    <summary>Similar to the role of Markov decision processes in reinforcement learning, Markov Games (also called Stochastic Games)lay down the foundation for the study of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and sequential agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce the solution concept, approximate Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE), to finite-state Stochastic Games repeated in the infinite horizon, and prove its $\mathbf{PPAD}$-completeness in computational complexity. Technically, we adopt a function with a polynomially bounded description in the strategy space to convert the MPE computation to a fixed-point problem, even though the stochastic game may demand an exponential number of pure strategies, in the number of states, for each agent. The completeness result follows the reduction of the fixed-point problem to \textsc{End of the Line}.


Past works on the stochastic games are mostly zero-sum MARL algorithms. A $P^{PPAD}$ algorithm for the general sum stochastic games in the finite horizon can be derived to establish an approximation algorithm for the general-sum stochastic games. That implies an approximate NE solution to the infinite-horizon setting. Such a possible extension suffers from three weaknesses: 1. the solution is time-dependent and hence not a perfect equilibrium; 2. the time-dependent solution suffers a weakness of noncredible threats; 3. the time complexity is not tight (lower bound $\mathbf{PPAD}$ and upper bound $P^{PPAD}$). Our result beats such a solution in all those three properties.</summary>

    <title>Optimization and Sampling Under Continuous Symmetry: Examples and Lie Theory</title>

Vishnoi</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01080">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the last few years, the notion of symmetry has provided a powerful and
essential lens to view several optimization or sampling problems that arise in
areas such as theoretical computer science, statistics, machine learning,
quantum inference, and privacy. Here, we present two examples of nonconvex
problems in optimization and sampling where continuous symmetries play --
implicitly or explicitly -- a key role in the development of efficient
algorithms. These examples rely on deep and hidden connections between
nonconvex symmetric manifolds and convex polytopes, and are heavily
generalizable. To formulate and understand these generalizations, we then
present an introduction to Lie theory -- an indispensable mathematical toolkit
for capturing and working with continuous symmetries. We first present the
basics of Lie groups, Lie algebras, and the adjoint actions associated with
them, and we also mention the classification theorem for Lie algebras.
Subsequently, we present Kostant's convexity theorem and show how it allows us
to reduce linear optimization problems over orbits of Lie groups to linear
optimization problems over polytopes. Finally, we present the Harish-Chandra
and the Harish-Chandra--Itzykson--Zuber (HCIZ) formulas, which convert
partition functions (integrals) over Lie groups into sums over the
corresponding (discrete) Weyl groups, enabling efficient sampling algorithms.

extensively in statistics and learning theory. While the total variation
distance appears naturally in the sample complexity of distribution learning,
it is analytically difficult to obtain tight lower bounds for mixtures.
Exploiting a connection between total variation distance and the characteristic
function of the mixture, we provide fairly tight functional approximations.
This enables us to derive new lower bounds on the total variation distance
between pairs of two-component Gaussian mixtures that have a shared covariance
matrix.

transport principles. These evolve from a structure covering uniformly a
continuous space towards an optimal design in terms of optimal transport
theory. At convergence, the networks should optimize the way resources are
transported through it. As the network structure shapes in time towards
optimality, its topological properties also change with it. The question is how
do these change as we reach optimality. We study the behavior of various
network properties on a number of network sequences evolving towards optimal
design and find that the transport cost function converges earlier than network
properties and that these monotonically decrease. This suggests a mechanism for
designing optimal networks by compressing dense structures. We find a similar
behavior in networks extracted from real images of the networks designed by the
body shape of a slime mold evolving in time.

distributed training of Machine Learning (ML) models over edge devices (e.g.,
IoT devices). In MEL, possible coexistence of multiple learning tasks with
different datasets may arise. The heterogeneity in edge devices' capabilities
will require the joint optimization of the learners-orchestrator association
and task allocation. To this end, we aim to develop an energy-efficient
framework for learners-orchestrator association and learning task allocation,
in which each orchestrator gets associated with a group of learners with the
same learning task based on their communication channel qualities and
computational resources, and allocate the tasks accordingly. Therein, a multi
objective optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total energy
consumption and maximize the learning tasks' accuracy. However, solving such
optimization problem requires centralization and the presence of the whole
environment information at a single entity, which becomes impractical in
large-scale systems. To reduce the solution complexity and to enable solution
decentralization, we propose lightweight heuristic algorithms that can achieve
near-optimal performance and facilitate the trade-offs between energy
consumption, accuracy, and solution complexity. Simulation results show that
the proposed approaches reduce the energy consumption significantly while
executing multiple learning tasks compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

    <title>Some Inapproximability Results of MAP Inference and Exponentiated Determinantal Point Processes</title>

point processes (DPPs). One is maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, i.e., to
find a principal submatrix having the maximum determinant. The other is
probabilistic inference on exponentiated DPPs (E-DPPs), which can sharpen or
weaken the diversity preference of DPPs with an exponent parameter $p$. We
prove the following complexity-theoretic hardness results that explain the
difficulty in approximating MAP inference and the normalizing constant for
E-DPPs.
</p>
<p>1. Unconstrained MAP inference for an $n \times n$ matrix is NP-hard to
approximate within a factor of $2^{\beta n}$, where $\beta = 10^{-10^{13}} $.
This result improves upon a $(\frac{9}{8}-\epsilon)$-factor inapproximability
given by Kulesza and Taskar (2012).
</p>
<p>2. Log-determinant maximization is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of
$\frac{5}{4}$ for the unconstrained case and within a factor of
$1+10^{-10^{13}}$ for the size-constrained monotone case.
</p>
<p>3. The normalizing constant for E-DPPs of any (fixed) constant exponent $p
\geq \beta^{-1} = 10^{10^{13}}$ is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of
$2^{\beta pn}$. This gives a(nother) negative answer to open questions posed by
Kulesza and Taskar (2012); Ohsaka and Matsuoka (2020).

    <title>Multi-Queues Can Be State-of-the-Art Priority Schedulers</title>

active research area. An intriguing proposed design is the Multi-Queue: given
$n$ threads and $m\ge n$ distinct priority queues, task insertions are
performed uniformly at random, while, to delete, a thread picks two queues
uniformly at random, and removes the observed task of higher priority. This
approach scales well, and has probabilistic rank guarantees: roughly, the rank
of each task removed, relative to remaining tasks in all other queues, is
$O(m)$ in expectation. Yet, the performance of this pattern is below that of
well-engineered schedulers, which eschew theoretical guarantees for practical
efficiency.
</p>
<p>We investigate whether it is possible to design and implement a
Multi-Queue-based task scheduler that is both highly efficient and has
analytical guarantees. We propose a new variant called the Stealing Multi-Queue
(SMQ), a cache-efficient variant of the Multi-Queue, which leverages both queue
affinity -- each thread has a local queue, from which tasks are usually
removed; but, with some probability, threads also attempt to steal
higher-priority tasks from the other queues -- and task batching, that is, the
processing of several tasks in a single insert / delete step. These ideas are
well-known for task scheduling without priorities; our theoretical contribution
is showing that, despite relaxations, this design can still provide rank
guarantees, which in turn implies bounds on total work performed. We provide a
general SMQ implementation that can surpass state-of-the-art schedulers such as
Galois and PMOD in terms of performance on popular graph-processing benchmarks.
Notably, the performance improvement comes mainly from the superior rank
guarantees provided by our scheduler, confirming that analytically-reasoned
approaches can still provide performance improvements for priority task
scheduling.

the weighted $p$-norm of the flow for any $p &gt; 1$. When $p=2$, the problem is
that of finding an electrical flow, and its dual is equivalent to solving a
Laplacian linear system. The case $p = \infty$ corresponds to finding a
min-congestion flow, which is equivalent to max-flows. A typical algorithmic
construction for such problems considers vertex potentials corresponding to the
flow conservation constraints, and has two simple types of update steps: cycle
toggling, which modifies the flow along a cycle, and cut toggling, which
modifies all potentials on one side of a cut. Both types of steps are typically
performed relative to a spanning tree $T$; then the cycle is a fundamental
cycle of $T$, and the cut is a fundamental cut of $T$. In this paper, we show
that these simple steps can be used to give a novel efficient implementation
for the $p = 2$ case and to find near-optimal $p$-norm flows in a low number of
iterations for all values of $p &gt; 1$. Compared to known faster algorithms for
these problems, our algorithms are simpler, more combinatorial, and also expose
several underlying connections between these algorithms and dynamic graph data
structures that have not been formalized previously.

$n^{O(\log n)}$, a consequence of a classic algorithm of Ehrenfeucht and
Haussler.

<p>Our algorithm shares similarities with practical heuristics for learning
decision trees, which we augment with additional ideas to circumvent known
lower bounds against these heuristics. To analyze our algorithm, we prove a new
structural result for decision trees that strengthens a theorem of O'Donnell,
Saks, Schramm, and Servedio. While the OSSS theorem says that every decision
tree has an influential variable, we show how every decision tree can be
"pruned" so that every variable in the resulting tree is influential.

    <title>Moving intervals for packing and covering</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jiang:Rain.html">Rain Jiang</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jiang:Kai.html">Kai Jiang</a>, Minghui Jiang <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00579">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study several problems on geometric packing and covering with movement.
Given a family $\mathcal{I}$ of $n$ intervals of $\kappa$ distinct lengths, and
another interval $B$, can we pack the intervals in $\mathcal{I}$ inside $B$
(respectively, cover $B$ by the intervals in $\mathcal{I}$) by moving $\tau$
intervals and keeping the other $\sigma = n - \tau$ intervals unmoved? We show
that both packing and covering are W[1]-hard with any one of $\kappa$, $\tau$,
and $\sigma$ as single parameter, but are FPT with combined parameters $\kappa$
and $\tau$. We also obtain improved polynomial-time algorithms for packing and
covering, including an $O(n\log^2 n)$ time algorithm for covering, when all
intervals in $\mathcal{I}$ have the same length.

Gradient Sampling methodology to the class of stratifiably smooth objective
functions, which are defined as locally Lipschitz functions that are smooth on
some regular pieces-called the strata-of the ambient Euclidean space. For this
class of functions, our algorithm achieves a sub-linear convergence rate. We
then apply our method to objective functions based on the (extended) persistent
homology map computed over lower-star filters, which is a central tool of
Topological Data Analysis. For this, we propose an efficient exploration of the
corresponding stratification by using the Cayley graph of the permutation
group. Finally, we provide benchmark and novel topological optimization
problems, in order to demonstrate the utility and applicability of our
framework.

    <title>The hierarchy and GapP</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There is a great but little-known theorem from the early 90's by Seinosuke Toda and Mitsunori Ogihara (buried as Lemma 2.3 in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0221023">their paper</a>) that shows the polynomial-time hierarchy is randomly low for Gap-P.</p><p>Let M be a non-deterministic polynomial-time machine. #M(x) is the number of accepting paths of M on x. #P is the set of functions f such that f(x) = #M(x) for an NP machine M. </p><p>Gap-M(x) is the difference between the number of accepting and rejecting paths. Unlike #M(x), Gap-M(x) could be negative. Gap-P is the set of functions such that f(x)=Gap-M(x) for an NP machine M. Equivalently Gap-P is the difference of two #P functions. Gap-P <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0000(05)80024-8">inherits all the nice closure properties of #P</a> while being closed under negation and subtraction.</p><p><b>Theorem </b>(Toda-Ogihara): Let q be a polynomial and f be a function in Gap-P<sup>PH</sup>. There is a function g in Gap-P and a polynomial p such that for all x, if you choose a binary string r randomly of length p(|x|), f(x) = g(x,r) with probability at least 1-2<sup>-q(|x|)</sup>.</p><p>In other words, with randomness the PH as an oracle of Gap-P disappears.
</p><p>
  Let me show you how the proof works for a specific f in GapP<sup>PH</sup>, namely the indicator function for SAT: f(φ) = 1 if φ is satisfiable and 0 otherwise.</p><p>Recall <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/09/favorite-theorems-unique-witnesses.html">Valiant-Vazirani</a> showed how to randomly reduce a formula φ to a set of formula ψ<sub>1</sub>,…,ψ<sub>k</sub> such that</p><p/><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>If φ is not satisfiable then for all i, ψ<sub>i</sub> will not be satisfiable</li><li>If φ is satisfiable then with high probability for some i, ψ<sub>i</sub> will have exactly one satisfying assignment.</li></ol><div>Picking k &gt; 4|x|q(|x|) will reduce the error in (2) to under 2<sup>-q(|x|)</sup>. Let g(φ,r) use r to choose ψ<sub>1</sub>,…,ψ<sub>k</sub> and output the Gap-P function 1-∏(1-#ψ<sub>i</sub>) using the closure properties of Gap-P where #ψ<sub>i</sub> is the number of satisfying assignments to ψ<sub>i</sub>.</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>If φ is not satisfiable then for all i, #ψ<sub>i</sub>=0 and g(φ,r) = 0.</li><li>If φ is satisfiable then with high probability for some i, #ψ<sub>i</sub>=1 and thus g(φ,r) = 1.</li></ul><div>Note that if r is a bad random sequence and φ is satisfiable, g(φ,r) might be an exponentially large integer, positive or negative. It's right most of the time but when it's wrong it's terribly wrong.</div></div></div>

    <title>Congratulations, Dr. Maxwell!</title>
    <summary>I took part today in the successful dissertation defense of Will Maxwell, a student of Amir Nayyeri and Cora Borradaile at Oregon State University. Will has also visited me at UC Irvine, and I’ve worked with him on two papers, on low-stretch spanning trees and Hanoi graph treewidth. But his dissertation has a different focus, his work on generalizations of graph algorithms to higher-dimensional topological spaces.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I took part today in the successful dissertation defense of Will Maxwell, a student of Amir Nayyeri and Cora Borradaile at Oregon State University. Will has also visited me at UC Irvine, and I’ve worked with him on two papers, on <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/04/19/stretch-average-stretch.html">low-stretch spanning trees</a> and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/05/03/hanoi-vs-sierpinski.html">Hanoi graph treewidth</a>. But his dissertation has a different focus, his work on generalizations of graph algorithms to higher-dimensional topological spaces.</p>

<p>The main idea can be seen in Will’s paper “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2020.21">Minimum bounded chains and minimum homologous chains in embedded simplicial complexes</a>” (with Cora and Amir, at the 2020 Symposium on Computational Geometry), on topological generalizations of unweighted shortest paths in graphs. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_simplicial_complex">abstract simplicial complex</a> is just a family of finite sets closed under taking subsets, where we think of each set of \(d+1\) elements as defining a \(d\)-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex">simplex</a>. From this point of view, an undirected graph is just a 1-dimensional simplicial complex, with 1-element subsets for its vertices and 2-element subsets for its edges. A set of \(d\)-dimensional simplices is called a \(d\)-chain (in mod-2 homology), and its boundary is a chain one dimension lower. For instance, a path in a graph has its two endpoints as its boundary, and the shortest path problem asks for the minimum-cardinality 1-chain having two given points as its boundary. More generally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_inspection_problem">T-join problem</a> asks for a 1-chain having any given 0-chain as its boundary.</p>

<p>The SoCG paper generalizes this problem in two ways. You can either ask for the minimum <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-chain</span> with a given <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\((k-1)\)-chain</span> as boundary (the “minimum bounded chain” of the first part of the title), or you can ask for the minimum <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-chain</span> that shares a boundary with a given <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-chain</span> and belongs to the same homology class (the second part of the title). Both are \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete and hard to approximate, even for \(k\)-dimensional complexes that are embedded into \((k+1)\)-dimensional space (analogous to planar graphs). However, they can be approximated to within a \(\sqrt{\log n}\) approximation ratio, and solved exactly in fixed-parameter tractable time. Both the positive and negative results involve translations to and from minimum cut completion, the problem of finding a cut that is as close as possible to a given edge set, on a dual graph of the embedding of the complex.</p>

<p>This use of the dual prevents these algorithms from applying to abstract complexes that are not embedded. And testing whether a complex can be embedded into a space of one higher dimension is itself a hard problem: \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard for 2-complexes and undecidable for sufficiently higher dimensions. But it turns out that some abstract complexes can have duals even when they cannot be embedded: as Will’s dissertation observes, a dual graph exists whenever homology defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_matroid">cographic matroid</a> on the \(k\)-simplices, a condition that generalizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Lane%27s_planarity_criterion">Mac Lane’s planarity criterion</a> and can be tested in polynomial time.</p>

<p>A newer paper, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2021.69">Generalized max-flows and min-cuts in simplicial complexes</a>” (with Amir), appears at this year’s European Symposium on Algorithms. It performs a similar translation from the maximum flow and minimum cut problems on graphs to analogous problems on simplicial complexes. The generalized problems are defined in a way allowing them to be solved by linear programs, with the flow LP dual to the cut LP, so a version of the max flow min cut theorem applies automatically to this generalization. However, unlike graph max flow and min cut problems, the solutions are not always integral, and finding an optimal integral solution is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard.</p>

<p>The SoCG 2020 and ESA 2021 papers form two chapters in the dissertation, with a final chapter on a third direction of generalization that appears not to be public yet. After finalizing his dissertation, Will will be heading to Washington, DC to work as a Department of Defense researcher on (non-classified) applications of topological computation in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Will!</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I moved back to Italy exactly two years ago. I was looking for some change and for new challenges and, man, talk about being careful what you wish for!</p>



<p>Last year was characterized by a sudden acceleration of Bocconi’s plans to develop a computer science group. From planning for a slow growth of a couple of people a year until, in 5-7 years, we could have the basis to create a new department, it was decided that a new computer science department would start operating next year — perhaps as soon as February 2022, but definitely, or at least to the extent that one can make definite plans in these crazy times, by September 2022.</p>



<p>Consequently, we went on a hiring spree that was surprisingly successful. Five computer scientists and four statistical physicists have accepted our offers and are coming between now and next summer. In computer science, Andrea Celli (who won the NeurIPS best paper award last year) and Marek Elias started today. Andrea, who is coming from Facebook London, works in algorithmic game theory, and Marek, who is coming TU Eindhoven, works in optimization. Within the next couple of weeks, or as soon as his visa issues are sorted out, Alon Rosen will join us from IDC Herzliya as a full professor. Readers of <em>in theory</em> may know Alon from his work on lattice-based cryptography, or his work on zero-knowledge, or perhaps his work on the cryptographic hardness of finding Nash equilibria. Two other computer science tenured faculty members are going to come, respectively, in February and September 2022, but I am not sure if their moves are public yet.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I have been under-spending my ERC grant, but perhaps this is going to change and some of my readers will help me out. </p>



<p>If you are interested in coming to Milan for a post-doc, do get in touch with me. A call will be out in a month or so.</p>



<p>After twenty years in Northern California, I am still readjusting to seasonal weather. September is among Milan’s best months: the oppressive heat of the summer gives way to comfortable days and cool nights, but the days are still bright and sunny. Currently, there is no quarantine requirement or other travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international travellers. If you want to visit, this might be your best chance until Spring Break (last year we had a semi-lockdown from late October until after New Year, which might very well happen again; January and February are not Milan’s best months; March features spectacular cherry blossoms, and it is again an ok time to visit).</p></div>

    <title>Since we will soon be back in the classroom, how was Zoom? Anything you want to maintain?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>UMCP will have all classes on campus this Fall. There is a Mask Mandate. All students and faculty have to get vaccinated unless they have a health or religious exception. 92% are vaccinated, which I interpret as people are NOT abusing the exceptions (though I still wish it was higher, and it may go higher). (ADED LATER- right after I posted this I got an email saying that UMCP is now up to 97%).  Those NOT vaccinated have to get tested - I think twice a week. </p><p>Now that we are back in the live-classroom, here are some thoughts about teaching on zoom. </p><p>I taught on zoom:</p><p>Spring 2020: The last half of both Ramsey Theory and Automata Theory(Reg, CFG,P,NP,Dec,Undec)</p><p>Fall 2021:  Cryptography </p><p>Spring 2021: Honors Discrete Math and Automata theory</p><p><br/></p><p>a) I taught in the usual time slot but I recorded the lecture so those who could not make it (more common during the pandemic) could still see it. Attendance was low, verbal interaction was low, but chat-interaction was very good. Looking into if we can do a chat in an in-person class. I was recording lectures before the pandemic and will keep doing so.</p><p>b) My exams were open-notes, open-book, open-web. That cuts down on ways they can cheat, though they can still phone-a-friend. Or ask their cat.  Unusual-but-correct answers can happen, as I discussed in <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/07/a-table-for-matrix-mortality-what-i.html#comment-form">this blog</a>.</p><p>c) I gave my muffin talk a few times on zoom. In person it goes very well as my enthusiasm is contagious.  On Zoom that affect is dampened so the audience was more sedate.  I gave it as a special lecture to High School students and to my REU students. Note that it was NOT part of a class so the usual motivation to learn it to do the HW is gone. Hence its more important they be excited about it. </p><p>d) In person I carefully make sure that I wear a funny T-shirt every day, and its a diff one, and usually a math one to (if possible) match the topic. On Zoom I did not bother, though I sometimes used wallpaper to match the topic. </p><p>e) I had to make up slides for Aut theory and for some of Discrete Math. For Crypto I already had slides. I like the slides I made up and will use them in the future. But see next point. </p><p>f) In Discrete Math I went  faster than usual- perhaps because its on slides, perhaps because there were less questions since it was on zoom, perhaps because Emily my  TA was so awesome that they had less questions. (She is very interested in education and did a guest post about the pandemic and education <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/04/a-guest-blog-on-pandemics-affect-on.html">here</a>.) As a result I actually learned and presented the proofs that (1) the e is irrational (my slides are <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/COURSES/250/S21/slides/etalk.pdf">here</a>) and that Liouville numbers are transcendental (my slides are <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/COURSES/250/S21/slides/ltalk.pdf">here</a>). While I enjoyed learning those theorems and I think the students understood them on some level, I will slow down next time.</p><p>g) Ramsey Theory: It is impossible to teach the Poly VDW theorem on slides, so I had to omit that part of the course. </p><p>h) Bottom Line: Did the students learn more? less? the same? My impression is that the students learned about the same, but really really didn't like it. And thats legit- that is NOT just students complaining. </p></div>

<p><strong>[Warning: spoilers follow!]</strong></p>



<p>Last week Dana and I watched the full first season of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81206259"><em>The Chair</em></a>, the Netflix drama that stars Sandra Oh as Ji-Yoon Kim, incoming chairwoman of the English department at the fictional Pembroke University.  As the rave reviews promised, I found the show to be brilliantly written and acted.  At times, <em>The Chair</em> made me think about that <em>other</em> academia-centered sitcom, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>, which I freely confess I also enjoyed.  But <em>The Chair</em> is much more highbrow (and more political), it’s about the humanities rather than STEM, and it’s mostly about academics who are older than the ones in <em>Big Bang</em>, both biologically and professionally.</p>



<p>I wouldn’t call <em>The Chair</em> “realistic”: the sets, stuffed with imposing bookshelves, paintings of great scholars, etc., look like how a TV producer might imagine university buildings, rather than the relatively humdrum reality.  But in less than three hours, the show tackles a staggering number of issues that will be recognizable and relevant to anyone in academia: cratering enrollments, a narrow-minded cost-cutting dean, a lack of free time and a desperate search for childcare, a tenure case that turns into a retention case, a woke scandal (about which more later), a faculty revolt against Ji-Yoon culminating in a vote of no confidence, and much more.  There’s also an elaborate side plot involving the actor (and real-life former literary scholar) David Duchovny, who portrays himself, being invited to lecture at Pembroke, which is <em>not</em> the sort of thing most academics have experience with, but which I suppose many viewers will enjoy.</p>



<p>The show is written at a high enough level that its stumbles are those of a daring acrobat.  In the main narrative arc of the first season, the writers set themselves an absurdly ambitious (and, I think, laudable) goal: namely, to dramatize a conflict between a free-spirited professor, and woke students trying to cancel that professor for a classroom “microaggression,” in a way that fully empathizes with both sides.  I don’t know if the show actually succeeds at this, but that’s partly because I don’t know if it’s <em>possible</em> to succeed.</p>



<p>To start with some background: in Pembroke’s English department, there are old, traditionalist white males, who give lectures extolling the Great Men of Literature, and who apparently still wield considerable power.  Meanwhile, critical theorists are presented as young, exciting upstarts bravely challenging the status quo.  People with recent experience of English departments should correct me if I’m wrong, but my sense is that this is pretty anachronistic—i.e., that the last powerful traditionalists in humanities departments were routed by the 80s or 90s at the latest, so that students in the Twitter-and-smartphone era (when <em>The Chair</em> is set) would be about as likely to encounter them as they would professors sitting around in charcoal suits smoking pipes.</p>



<p>There were also some of what felt to me like … intersectional oversights?  Ji-Yoon, being Korean-American, is repeatedly approached by Black female students and faculty as a “fellow woman of color,” with whom they can commiserate about the entrenched power of the department’s white males.  The show never examines how woke discourse has increasingly reclassified Asian-Americans as “white-adjacent”—as, for example, in the battles over gifted and magnet programs or admissions to Harvard.  Likewise, woke students are shown standing arm-in-arm with Pembroke’s Jewish community, to denounce (what we in the audience know to be) a phantom antisemitic incident.  Left unexplored is how, in the modern woke hierarchy, Jews have become just another kind of privileged white person (worse, of course, if they have ties to Israel).</p>



<p>This brings me to the first season’s central conflict, which revolves around Bill Dobson, a handsome middle-aged white male professor who’s revered as the department’s greatest genius on the basis of his earlier work, but who, after the death of his wife, is now washed-up, flippant, and frequently drunk or high.  In one class session, while lecturing about intellectuals who found the strength to resist fascism despite their own nihilistic impulses, Bill makes a Nazi salute and shouts “Heil Hitler!,” as a theatrical reminder to the students about the enormity of what those intellectuals were fighting.  Alas, a woke student captures that moment on their smartphone camera and shares it on social media.  The clip of Bill making the Heil salute goes viral, shorn of all exculpatory context.  Soon, crowds of students are waving placards and screaming “No Nazis at Pembroke!” outside the English building.  In a desperate effort to make his PR crisis go away, the dean initiates termination proceedings against Bill—the principles of academic freedom and even Bill’s tenure be damned.  Ji-Yoon, of course, as Bill’s chair, is caught smack in the middle of this.  It’s complicated even further by Ji-Yoon’s and Bill’s romantic feelings for each other, and further still by Bill’s role as the babysitter of Ji-Yoon’s adopted daughter.</p>



<p>As all of this unfolds, the show seems immensely interested in pinning the blame on Bill’s “tragic flaws,” minor though they seemed to me—mostly just pride and unseriousness.  (E.g., trying to lampoon the absurd charge of Nazism, Bill offhandedly mentions that he’s always wanted to visit Hitler’s mountain retreat, and on another occasion belts out “Springtime for Hitler” from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Producers_(1967_film)">The Producers</a></em>.)  The woke students, by contrast, are portrayed as earnest, understandably upset, and legitimately terrified about hate crimes on campus.  If they, too, have opportunistic motives to attack Bill, the show never examines them.</p>



<p>In one sentence, then, here’s my beef with <em>The Chair</em>: its script portrays a mob, step by step, destroying an innocent man’s life over nothing, and yet it wants me to feel the mob’s pain, and be disappointed in its victim for mulishly insisting on his innocence (even though he <em>is</em>, in fact, innocent).</p>



<p>With real-life woke controversies, there often lingers the question of whether the accused <em>might really be</em> a racist, fascist, sexual predator, or whatever else, adequate proof or no.  What’s different here is that we <em>know</em> that Bill Dobson is none of those things, we <em>know</em> he’s decent to his core, because the writers have painstakingly shown us that.  And yet, in a weird narrative pretzel, we’re nevertheless supposed to be mad at him, and to sympathize with the campaign to cancel him.</p>



<p>A casual perusal of other reviews of <em>The Chair</em> told me that these reactions were far from universal.  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+chair+reviews&amp;oq=the+chair+reviews&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i67i131i433j0i131i433i512l2j0i512l7.2011j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Here</a>, for example, is what one viewer wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I can appreciate that this is probably close to the reality that most women/of color experience in higher education. I enjoyed watching the scenes with Joan and Yaz [two female professors] the most but the rest was a drag. I couldn’t understand why Ji-Yoon was into Bill, or why <em>anyone</em> was into Bill. I found him to be an insufferable man-baby. That is such a turn off. So she’d put him straight but then still be pining for him. He wreaked [sic] of entitled, white male, tenured privilege and never showed any contrition for his actions or even awareness of their impact. i’m so tired of the “brilliant <strong>_</strong>” being used to justify coddling someone. And for the rest of the stuffy old patriarchal farts– boot them out! They weren’t good teachers and weren’t able to meet the needs of today’s students.</p></blockquote>



<p>I asked myself: <em>did this person watch the same show?</em>  It’s like, the script couldn’t possibly have been clearer about Bill’s character, the fact that he’s the polar opposite of the woke students’ mental construct.   And yet, if the show had drawn an unambiguous corollary from Bill’s goodness—namely, that the effort to cancel him is a moral travesty—then <em>The Chair</em> itself might have been denounced as conservative (or at least classical liberal) propaganda, and those who’d otherwise form its core viewership wouldn’t have watched.</p>



<p>So, if I were a literary critic like the ones on the show, I might argue that <em>The Chair</em> begs for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_and_the_Art_of_Writing">Straussian</a> interpretation.  Sure, there’s an “overt” reading, wherein Bill Dobson is done in by his own hubris, or wherein it’s a comedy of errors with no one to blame.  But then there’s also an “esoteric” reading, wherein Bill is the victim of an extremely specific modern-day collective insanity, one that future generations might look back on with little more ambivalence than we look back on McCarthyism.  The writers of <em>The Chair</em> might <em>hint</em> at this latter reading, through their sympathetic portrayal of Bill and the obviousness of the injustice done to him, but they can never make it too explicit, because of the political and cultural constraints under which they themselves operate.</p>



<p>Under this theory, it presumably falls to those slightly outside the world portrayed in <em>The Chair</em>—like, let’s imagine, a theoretical computer science blogger who himself was denounced for woke heresies to the point where he has little more to lose in that direction—to make the esoteric reading explicit.  Unless and until, of course, a second season comes along to undermine that reading entirely.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-127 |  Small Circuits Imply Efficient Arthur-Merlin Protocols | 

	Michael Ezra, 

	Ron D. Rothblum</title>
    <summary>The inner product function $\langle x,y \rangle = \sum_i x_i y_i \bmod 2$ can be easily computed by a (linear-size) ${AC}^0(\oplus)$ circuit: that is, a constant depth circuit with AND, OR and parity (XOR) gates. But what if we impose the restriction that the parity gates can only be on the bottom most layer (closest to the input)? Namely, can the inner product function be computed by an ${AC}^0$ circuit composed with a single layer of parity gates? This seemingly simple question is an important open question at the frontier of circuit lower bound research.
    
    In this work, we focus on a minimalistic version of the above question. Namely, whether the inner product function cannot be \emph{approximated} by a small $DNF$ augmented with a single layer of parity gates. Our main result shows that the existence of such a circuit would have unexpected implications for interactive proofs, or more specifically, for interactive variants of the Data Streaming and Communication Complexity models. In particular, we show that the existence of such a small (i.e., polynomial-size) circuit yields:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item An $O(d)$-message protocol in the Arthur-Merlin Data Streaming model for every $n$-variate, degree $d$ polynomial (over $\mathbb{GF}(2)$), using only $\widetilde{O}\left(d\right)\cdot\log(n)$ communication and space complexity. In particular, this gives an AM$[2]$ Data Streaming protocol for a variant of the well-studied triangle counting problem, with poly-logarithmic communication and space complexities.
       
        \item A $2$-message communication complexity protocol for any sparse (or low degree) polynomial, and for any function computable by an ${AC}^0(\oplus)$ circuit. Specifically, for the latter, we obtain a protocol with communication complexity that is poly-logarithmic in the size of the ${AC}^0(\oplus)$ circuit.
    \end{enumerate}</summary>

    <title>TR21-126 |  Quantum Algorithms for Variants of Average-Case Lattice Problems via Filtering | 

	Qipeng Liu, 

	Yilei Chen, 

	Mark Zhandry</title>
    <summary>We show polynomial-time quantum algorithms for the following problems: 
(*) Short integer solution (SIS) problem under the infinity norm, where the public matrix is very wide, the modulus is a polynomially large prime, and the bound of infinity norm is set to be half of the modulus minus a constant. 
(*) Extrapolated dihedral coset problem (EDCP) with certain parameters. 
(*) Learning with errors (LWE) problem given LWE-like quantum states with polynomially large moduli and certain error distributions, including bounded uniform distributions and Laplace distributions.

The SIS, EDCP, and LWE problems in their standard forms are as hard as solving lattice problems in the worst case. However, the variants that we can solve are not in the parameter regimes known to be as hard as solving worst-case lattice problems. Still, no classical or quantum polynomial-time algorithms were known for those variants.

Our algorithms for variants of SIS and EDCP use the existing quantum reductions from those problems to LWE, or more precisely, to the problem of solving LWE given LWE-like quantum states. Our main contributions are introducing a filtering technique and solving LWE given LWE-like quantum states with interesting parameters.</summary>

    <title>TR21-125 |  The Exact Complexity of Pseudorandom Functions and Tight Barriers to Lower Bound Proofs | 

	Zhiyuan Fan, 

	Jiatu Li, 

	Tianqi Yang</title>
    <summary>How much computational resource do we need for cryptography? This is an important question of both theoretical and practical interests. In this paper, we study the problem on pseudorandom functions (PRFs) in the context of circuit complexity. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove extremely tight upper and lower bounds in various circuit models.

* In general $B_2$ circuits, assuming the existence of PRFs, PRFs can be constructed in $2n + o(n)$ size, simplifying and improving the $O(n)$ bound by Ishai et al. (STOC 2008). We show that such construction is almost optimal by giving an unconditional $2n-O(1)$ lower bound.

* In logarithmic depth circuits, assuming the existence of $NC^1$ PRFs, PRFs can be constructed in $2n + o(n)$ size and $(1+\epsilon) \log n$ depth simultaneously.

* In constant depth linear threshold circuits, assuming the existence of $TC^0$ PRFs, PRFs can be constructed with wire complexity $n^{1+O(1.61^{-d})}$. We also give an $n^{1+\Omega(c^{-d})}$ wire complexity lower bound for some constant $c$.

The upper bounds are proved with generalized Levin's trick and novel constructions of "almost" universal hash functions; the lower bound for general circuits is proved via a tricky but elementary wire-counting argument; and the lower bound for $TC^0$ circuits is proved by extracting a "black-box" property of $TC^0$ circuits from the "white-box" restriction lemma of Chen, Santhanam, and Srinivasan (Theory Comput. 2018). As a byproduct, we prove unconditional tight upper and lower bounds for "almost" universal hashing, which we believe to have independent interests.

Following Natural Proofs by Razborov and Rudich (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 1997), our results make progress in realizing the difficulty to improve known circuit lower bounds which recently becomes significant due to the discovery of several "bootstrapping results". In $TC^0$, this reveals the limitation of the current restriction-based methods; in particular, it brings new insights in understanding the strange phenomenon of "sharp threshold results" such as the one presented by Chen and Tell (STOC 2019).</summary>

    <title>TR21-124 |  On the Complexity of Two-Party Differential Privacy | 

	Noam Mazor, 

	Iftach Haitner, 

	Jad Silbak, 

	Eliad Tsfadia</title>
    <summary>In distributed differential privacy, the parties perform analysis over their joint data while preserving the privacy for both datasets. Interestingly, for a few fundamental two-party functions such as inner product and Hamming distance, the accuracy of the distributed solution lags way behind what is achievable in the client-server setting. McGregor, Mironov, Pitassi, Reingold, Talwar, and Vadhan [FOCS ’10] proved that this gap is inherent, showing upper bounds on the accuracy of (any) distributed solution for these functions. These limitations can be bypassed when settling for computational differential privacy, where the data is differentially private only in the eyes of a computationally bounded observer, using public-key cryptography primitives.

We prove that the use of public-key cryptography is necessary for bypassing the limitation of McGregor et al., showing that a non-trivial solution for the inner-product, or the Hamming distance, implies the existence of a key-agreement protocol. Our bound implies a combinatorial proof for the fact that non-Boolean inner product of independent (strong) Santha-Vazirani sources is a good condenser. We obtain our main result by showing that the inner-product of a (single, strong) SV source with a uniformly random seed is a good condenser, even when the seed and source are dependent.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This is the fourth and last instalment of the series of interviews with the 2021 CONCUR Test-of-Time Award recipients, which I have conducted with Nathalie Bertrand and Nobuko Yoshida's great help. (See <a href="https://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2021/06/interview-with-concur-2021-tot-award.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2021/08/interview-with-concur-2021-tot-award.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2021/08/interview-with-concur-2021-tot-award_23.html" target="_blank">there</a> for the previous ones.) In it, I interviewed <a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/janin/" target="_blank">David Jani</a>n and <a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/igw/" target="_blank">Igor Walukiewicz</a>. </p><p>I thank David and Igor for their very stimulating answers to my questions and for painting such a rich picture of the context for their award-winning work and of the subsequent developments related to it. Enjoy!<b/></p><p>Note: The interview has been slightly edited for clarity and to correct some small typos. Thanks to <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Ilaria.Castellani/" target="_blank">Ilaria Castellani</a> for pointing out several typos that had escaped my attention. <b><br/></b></p><p><b>Luca:</b> You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2021 for your paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-61604-7_60" target="_blank">On the Expressive Completeness of the Propositional mu-Calculus with respect to Monadic Second Order Logic</a>, which appeared at CONCUR 1996. In that article, you showed what I consider to be a fundamental result, namely that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_%CE%BC-calculus" target="_blank">mu-calculus</a> and the bisimulation-invariant fragment of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadic_second-order_logic" target="_blank">monadic second-order logic (MSOL)</a>  have the same expressiveness over transition systems. Could you tell us how you came to study that question and why do you think that such a natural problem hadn't been answered before your paper? </p><p><b>David and Igor:</b>At that time we were interested in automata characterizations of the expressive power of MSOL and the mu-calculus. In 1988 <a href="https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~niwinski/" target="_blank">Damian Niwinski</a> has shown that over binary trees the mu-calculus and MSOL are expressively equivalent. When it appeared, the result was quite surprising, even unexpected.  The two logics are not equivalent on unranked trees where the number of children of a node is not  fixed. In consequence, the logics are not equivalent over the class of all transition systems. </p><p>In 1983 van Benthem showed that modal logic is equivalent to the bisimulation-invariant fragment of first-order logic. When we have learned about this result we<br/>have realized that our automata models can be used to prove a similar statement<br/>for the mu-calculus. <br/><br/>The method of van Benthem could not be applied to MSOL, the automata based<br/>method looks like the only way to prove the result. <br/><br/><b>Luca:</b> I am interested in how research collaborations start, as I like to tell "research-life stories" to PhD students and young researchers. Could you tell us how you started your collaboration?<br/><br/><b>David:</b> I came to meet Igor when he was visiting Bordeaux in fall 93, presenting his first completeness result on a proof system for the mu-calculus (LICS 93). I was myself starting a PhD considering modal logic for specifying (various forms of) nondeterminism in connection with (power)domain theory (FST&amp;TCS 93).<br/><br/>We eventually met again in Auvergnes (center of France) for the Logic Colloquium in summer 94. There, spending time in the park nearby the conference venue or walking around the volcanoes, we elaborated a notion of nondeterministic automata for the modal mu-calculus. This result can be seen as extending the notion of "disjunctive" normal form from propositional logic to the modal mu-calculus. I remember that Igor later used this result for his second completeness result for <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/" target="_blank">Kozen</a>’s proposed proof system for the mu-calculus (LICS 95). Thanks to Igor, this was for me the occasion to learn in depth the link between mu-calculus and tree automata.<br/><br/>Incidentally, <a href="https://staff.science.uva.nl/j.vanbenthem/" target="_blank">Johan van Benthem</a> was also attending this Logic Colloquium and we both attend his lecture about the bisimulation-invariant fragment of FO. Although we did not yet realize we could generalize his result to MSO, this surely increased our own understanding of logic.<br/><br/>Our first result (Automata for the mu-calculus) was presented at MFCS in 95 in Prague, where Igor and I met again. It could have been there, or a little later, that we eventually postulated our bisimulation-invariance result. However, proof arguments were only found later while exchanging emails. It was a bit amazing for me that we could discuss that way across Europe: email started to be heavily used only in the late 80's. In my head, Poland was far, far away from France.<br/><br/>Yet our collaboration was eventually in the line of an  ongoing collaboration<br/>between Warsaw and Bordeaux, involving researcher like Arnold (my supervisor)<br/>and Niwinski (Igor's mentor), both major specialists in the area of automata and<br/>logics. Somehow, as a followup, together with Aachen (<a href="https://logic.rwth-aachen.de/People/Graedel/" target="_blank">Grädel</a> and <a href="https://www.lics.rwth-aachen.de/cms/LICS/Der-Lehrstuhl/Team/Dozierende/~ocwi/Wolfgang-Thomas/lidx/1/" target="_blank">Thomas</a>) and<br/>many other sites, the GAMES European network was later created, and, almost at<br/>the same time, Igor came to Bordeaux as a CNRS researcher.<br/><br/><b>Luca:</b> As you mentioned earlier, van Bentham has <a href="https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/3800551/1170_12194y.pdf" target="_blank">shown</a> that modal logic has the same expressive power as the bisimulation-invariant fragment of first-order logic. In some sense, one may consider your main result as the extension of van Bentham's theorem to a setting with fixed-points. Could you briefly describe at a high level the challenges that fixed-points created in your work? To your mind, what was the main technical achievement or technique in your paper?<br/><br/><b>David and Igor:</b> Sure our result is similar to van Benthem's, and, as mentioned<br/>above, his own presentation in 93 was very inspiring. However, his proof relies<br/>on compactness of first-order logic and cannot be adapted to monadic<br/>second-order logic. In our proof, we have used automata-theoretic techniques. <br/><br/>In our previous works we had developed automata models for MSOL and the<br/>mu-calculus on unranked trees. Every transition system is bisimulation invariant<br/>to a tree obtained by the unfolding of the transition system. Crucially for our<br/>result, it is also equivalent to a tree where every subtree is duplicated<br/>infinitely many times. A short pumping argument shows that on such trees the two automata models are equivalent. <br/><br/><b>Luca:</b> Did any of your subsequent research build explicitly on the results and the techniques you developed in your award-winning paper? Is there any result obtained by other researchers that builds on your work and that you like in particular?<br/><br/><b>David and Igor: </b>Around that time Marco Hollenberg and Giovana D'Agostino used our automata-theoretic methods to show the uniform interpolation property for the mu-calculus. <br/><br/>In collaboration with Giacomo Lenzi (postdoc in Bordeaux from Pisa), David<br/>considered the bisimulation-invariant fragment of various levels of the monadic<br/>quantifier alternation hierarchy. It turns out that monadic Sigma_1 corresponds to reachability properties and monadic Sigma_2 corresponds to Büchi properties, respectively the first and second levels of the mu-calculus hierarchy. <br/><br/>It could be the case that all mu-calculus can be translated into monadic<br/>Sigma_3 formulas -- this is true when restricting to deterministic transition<br/>systems. However, with nondeterminism, such a result seems difficult to achieve. <br/><br/>Incidentally, Giacomo and David also proved that adding limited counting capacity<br/>to modalities yields a fixed-point calculus equivalent to the unraveling invariant<br/>fragment of MSO (LICS 2001).  <br/><br/>In 1999, in collaboration with Erich Grädel, Igor has used similar techniques to define and study guarded fixed-point logic. Subsequently, several other fixed-point logics of this kind were proposed with the most expressive one probably being guarded negation logic with fixed points of Bárány, ten Cate, and Segoufin from 2015.  These works all use automata-theoretic methods to some extent. <br/><br/><b>Luca:</b> Your paper was written while Igor was at BRICS at the University of Aarhus. Igor, what was it like to be at BRICS@Aarhus at that time? What role do<br/>you think centres like BRICS played and can play in the development of theoretical computer science? Do you think that your stay at BRICS had a<br/>positive impact on your future career?<br/><br/><b>Igor:</b> My stay at BRICS had definitively a beneficial impact on me. At that time BRICS was one of the most active centers world wide in theoretical computer science. Being able to see and talk to so many different people, being exposed<br/>to so many different ideas, was very enriching. BRICS was a meeting place <br/>allowing scientists to have a better and larger vision of our field. BRICS contributed to the development of many people involved, as well as to the excellence of Aarhus, and even Denmark as a whole, in our field.<br/><br/><b>Luca:</b> I have been brought up in the concurrency-theory tradition and I feel that bisimulation-invariant properties are the interesting ones over transition systems. Do you think that we actually "need" logics that allow one to specify properties of transition systems that are not bisimulation invariant?<br/><br/><b>David:</b> That was the idea indeed and the mu-calculus is the good logic for that. From a mathematical perspective, bisimulation is a fairly natural definition. In some sense, bisimulation equivalence is a greatest co-congruence.<br/><br/>However, I always suspected that bisimulation is too fine grained as an equivalence for concurrency. When modeling realistic systems, nondeterminism arises either as controllable (angelic) or uncontrollable (demonic) choice. In this case, the right equivalence to be considered is simulation equivalence.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that David Park, who "invented" bisimulation, was actually studying equivalence of J.R. Büchi's deterministic string automata where, because of determinism, bisimulation turns out to be equivalent to simulation equivalence. It is only after Matthew Hennessy and Robin Milner's work in concurrency that bisimulation was applied to nondeterministic behaviors.<br/><br/><b>Igor:</b> In the context of XML and semistructured data, bisimulation is not relevant. One of the prominent queries in XPATH is whether a value appears twice -- that is clearly not a bisimulation-invariant property. So while XPATH looks very close to PDL or the mu-calculus, many techniques and questions are very different. The other context that comes to mind is controller synthesis, where we ask for a<br/>transition system of a specific shape, for example, with self-loops on certain actions. Such self loops represent invisibility of the action to the controller. <br/><br/><b>Luca:</b> What are the research topics that you find most interesting right now? Is there any specific problem in your current field of interest that you'd like to see solved?<br/><br/><b>David: </b>In Logic for Computer Science, there have always been two kinds of approaches: model theory that eventually led to model checking and proof theory that eventually led to typed programming languages.<br/><br/>Twenty years later, aiming at designing and implementing real concurrent systems, especially for interactive arts, I realized that the latter approach was<br/>(at least for me) a lot more effective. Building concurrent systems by synchronizing arbitrary sub-systems sounded for me like unstructured programming; it was essentially unmaintainable. Monads and linear types, among<br/>many other approaches in typed functional programming, surely offered interesting<br/>alternatives to process calculi approaches.<br/><br/><b>Igor:</b> In the context of the paper we discuss here, I am surprised by developments around the model-checking problem for the mu-calculus. After some years of relative calm, Calude, Jain, Khoussainov, Li and Stephan have made an important breakthrough in 2017. Yet, despite big activity after this result, the research on the problem seems to have hit one more barrier. Another old prominent problem is decidability of the alternation hierarchy for the mu-calculus. The problem is: given a formula and a number of alternations between the least and the greatest fixed-points, decide if there is an  equivalent formula with this number of alternations. Even when the number of alternations is fixed we do not know the answer. Among others, Thomas Colcombet and Christof Loeding have done very interesting work on this subject.<br/><br/><b>Luca:</b> What advice would you give to a young researcher who is keen to start working on topics related to automata theory and logic in computer science? <br/><br/><b>David:</b> From the distance, our result sounds to me as a combination of both technique and imagination. Technique for mastering known results and imagination for finding original open problems, especially between research fields that are not (yet) known to be deeply related. As a matter of fact, I felt lucky finding such a fresh open problem that was (probably) a lot easier to solve than many other well-known hard problems.<br/><br/>Technique comes from hard work. It is obviously essential but somehow easy to teach and evaluate in academia. Imagination comes from curiosity. It is still essential but a lot more difficult to teach. So young researchers must develop by themselves their own imagination and curiosity.<br/><br/>In the automata-theory branch of logic in computer science, the remaining open<br/>problems seem fairly hard, so I believe that it is the imagination of young researchers that will make the difference for setting up new interesting directions of research, especially those who are ready to look aside, towards other areas of<br/>logic in computer science and, because it can be a considerable source of<br/>motivation, funny applications.<br/><br/><b>Igor:</b> Naturally, the field is much broader these days than it was 25 years ago. It is<br/>crucial to master some techniques. For this, working on variations of already solved problems is a good method. Yet, I think it is important to escape<br/>the cycle of constant modifications of existing problems and their solutions. <br/>I would suggest that, at some moment, one should find an important open<br/>problem that one is passionate about and should spend a considerable effort on<br/>it. I admit that this is a matter of a taste, personality, and having a sufficiently<br/>comfortable situation to afford such a risk. Another good option is to look at frontiers with other areas: distributed computing, semantics, control theory, security. <br/><br/></p><br/></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><br/><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update: </span></strong>Come to think of it, let’s circle back to the thing about kids under 13 getting banned from taking the SAT, as a ridiculous unintended consequence of some federal regulation.  I wonder whether this is a campaign this blog could spearhead that would have <strong>an actual chance of making a positive difference in the world (!!)</strong>, rather than just giving me space to express myself, to vent my impotent rage at the tragic failures of our civilization and the blankfaces who sleep soundly despite knowing that they caused those failures.  What if, like, a whole bunch of us wrote to the College Board, or whatever federal agency enforces the regulation that the College Board is worried about, and we asked them whether a solution might be found in which parents gave permission on the web form for their under-13s to take the SAT, given how memorable this opportunity was for many of us, how it was a nerd rite of passage, and how surely none of us have any wish to deny that opportunity to the next generation, so let’s work together to solve this?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>I’m depressed that, all over the world, the values of the Enlightenment are humiliated and in retreat, while the values of the Taliban are triumphant.  The literal Taliban of course, but also a thousand mini-Talibans of every flavor, united in their ideological certainty.</p>



<p>I’m depressed that now and for the future, the image of the United States before the world—<em>deservedly</em> so—is one of desperate Afghans plunging to their deaths from the last airplanes out of Kabul.  I’m depressed that, while this historic calamity was set in motion by Donald Trump, the president who bears direct, immediate moral responsibility for it is the one I voted for.  And knowing what I know now, I’d <em>still</em> have voted for him—but with an ashen face.</p>



<p>I’m depressed that, on social media, the same people who seven years ago floridly denounced me, because, while explaining how as a young person I overcame the urge to suicide and finally achieved some semblance of a normal life, I made a passing reference to a vanished culture of arranged marriages, to which I seemed better-adapted than to the world of today—these very same people are the ones sagely resigned to millions of Afghan women and girls<em> actually</em> forced into unwanted marriages, tortured, and raped, who explain that there’s nothing the US can or should do about this, even that it was folly to imagine we could impose parochial Western values, like women’s rights, on a culture that doesn’t want them.  These are the people who saw fit to lecture me on my feminist failings.</p>



<p>I’m depressed that there’s an <em>exceedingly</em> good chance that both of my kids will get covid, as they’ve returned to school and preschool in Austin, TX, where the Delta variant is raging out of control, new reports of cases among the kids’ schoolmates come almost every day, Daniel has been quarantined at home for the past week because of one such case, there’s no vaccination mandate (and a looming battle over mask mandates), and—crucially, tragically, incredibly—<strong>the FDA has not only slow-walked approval of covid vaccines for children under 12, but has pushed back the approval <em>even further</em> than it previously planned, ignoring <a href="https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/fda-covid-19-vaccine-children-under-12-pfizer-aap-moderna/521-cb2d3d7e-c08e-4920-a0e8-92b81a4d6e90">unprecedented public objections</a> from the American Academy of Pediatrics.</strong>  The FDA blankfaces have done this in spite of the reality, obvious to anyone with eyes and a brain, that they’re thereby consigning thousands of children to their deaths, that whatever ultra-rare risks the vaccine poses to children are infinitesimal compared to the overwhelming benefit.</p>



<p>Since I worry that I wasn’t clear enough, how about this: in a just world, the FDA in its current form would be dismantled, and <s>all those who needlessly delayed the delivery of covid vaccines to children would be tried for manslaughter</s> [while I still think the case for authorizing covid vaccines for kids right now is <em>overwhelmingly</em> clear, I hereby retract this particular remark, which was based on a factor 5-10 overestimate of the covid mortality risk for kids—for more, see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5769#comment-1907100">this comment</a>].  The blankfaces have <em>already</em> killed more people through pointlessly delaying the approval of covid vaccines than their agency could plausibly have saved through its entire history: do they need to take the children as well?  As far as I’m concerned, those who defend the status quo—those who meet the on-the-ground reality of overflowing pediatric hospitals with obfuscatory words about procedures and best practices and the need for yet more data—are no better either morally or intellectually than the anti-vaxx conspiracy theorists, their rightly-reviled cousins.</p>



<p>As icing on the cake, I’m depressed that the College Board is no longer administering the SAT to children under 13, apparently because of federal regulations—-which means that Johns Hopkins CTY’s famed <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/testing/study-exceptional-talent-set">Study of Exceptional Talent</a>, a program that made a big difference in my life three decades ago, has been suspended indefinitely.  Imagine being a nerdy 11-year-old in 2021: no more tracking, no more gifted programs, no more magnet schools, no more acceleration, no <em>getting vaccinated against deadly disease</em> (!!), … oh, and if perchance you felt the urge to take the SAT, just to prove that you could outscore the grownups who decided to impose all this on you, then no, you’re no longer allowed to do that either.</p>



<p>The one bright spot in the endlessly bleak picture is that Daniel, my 4-year-old son, now plays a pretty mean chess game, if not quite at the level of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5171">Beth Harmon</a>.  Having just learned the rules a few months ago, Daniel now gives me and Dana (admittedly, no one would mistake either of us for Magnus Carlsen) extremely competitive matches; just yesterday he beat several adults in a park.  Daniel has come to spend much of his free time (and now that he’s quarantined, he has a lot) playing chess against his iPad and watching chess videos.  To be clear, he has very little emotional maturity <em>even for a 4-year-old</em>, and unlike me at the same age, he has no overwhelming passion for numbers or counting, but with chess I’ve finally found a winner.  Now I just need to hope that they don’t ban chess-playing for children under 13.</p>



<p>So that’s it, it’s off my chest.  Commenters: what else have you got that might cheer me up?</p></div>

David Silver, the 2019 ACM Computing Prize winner, is highlighted this month in the main journal of the ACM—the Communications of the ACM. He is featured in the “Last Byte” <a href="https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/9/255049-playing-with-and-against-computers/fulltext">article</a> at the end. </p>
<p>
Today we discuss one aspect of the article in regard to machine assistance.</p>
<p>
The article highlights his work on computer programs that play Go, under the title “Playing With, and Against, Computers.” Silver led a Google DeepMind project that used learning methods to make the program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a>, which beat the many-times world Go champion Lee Sedol in March 2016.  </p>
<p>
The victory was only the beginning; subsequent iterations of the algorithm have been able to learn without any human data or prior knowledge except the rules of the game and, eventually, without even knowing the rules.  Very impressive. The versions that Silver refers to include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero">AlphaGo Zero</a> and finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero">AlphaZero</a>. We covered the 2016 match <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2016/03/11/stonefight-at-the-goke-corral/">here</a> and discussed AlphaZero <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2017/12/17/truth-from-zero/">here</a>.

<p/><p>
Each month the last article is special. It starts on the last page <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the month’s publication. Then it continues to page <img alt="{p-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and so on. All the other articles go from <img alt="{q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="{q+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and so on. On the website it gives the pages as “120-ff”; maybe the hyphen is a minus sign to invert the sense of <em>ff</em> as “following folios.”</p>
<p>
The article is also always in the form of an interview: a series of questions and answers by the person being highlighted. This month the author, Leah Hoffmann, asks Silver questions about his work on Go playing programs. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/26/great-go-glitchy-grammar/lh/" rel="attachment wp-att-19072"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19072" height="144" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lh.jpg?resize=120%2C144&amp;ssl=1" width="120"/></a></p>
<p/><h2> One Question </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
About midway through the interview, Hoffmann poses the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <b>Eventually, you built a system that learned to play Go on a smaller, nine-by-nine sized board.</b> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Silver answered:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We had some successes in the early days on the small-sized boards. Our system did learn, through these very principled trial-and-error reinforcement learning techniques, to associate different patterns with whether they would lead to winning or losing the game. Then I started collaborating Sylvain Gelly at the University of Paris on a project called MoGo, which became the first nine-by-nine Go championship program. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
What is wrong with his answer? What is interesting about this answer, from a Google point of view? Any thoughts before you turn the page? Well, posts do not have pages on the blog, so we’ll use a section heading as divider.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Our Answer </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The answer is that the response is not correct grammar. Do you see? It should be:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Then I started collaborating <b>with</b> Sylvain Gelly at the University of Paris on a project <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We find it fun to see an article about robotic methods that can play the world’s best Go, yet misses a chance to discover a simple grammatical error. There are lots of programs, free ones even, that catch this one. (Microsoft Word 2016, however, seems not to.)</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Google Fix? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This gave us the idea of seeing whether existing Google tools could fix it automatically. </p>
<p>
One available tool is Google Translate, and this recalled the idea of our old <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/11/12/can-we-translate-english-to-english/">post</a> titled, “Can We Translate English To English?” That idea, which I (Ken writing this part) occasionally use when communicating with chess officials in many countries, is to try repeated translations into the target language until you get one that translates back to English the way you want it. Here, we have freedom to use any language <em>L</em> as the intermediary. </p>
<p>
Using just the last sentence in the quote, here is what I get when I translate into <em>L</em> and then back. People used to write in Latin even for fellow speakers of their first language, so I tried Latin:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/26/great-go-glitchy-grammar/golatin/" rel="attachment wp-att-19074"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19074" height="76" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GoLatin.jpg?resize=600%2C76&amp;ssl=1" width="600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Latin inserted a missing preposition, but not the right one. Thinking of a language with similar richness of grammar to Latin but more native speakers who are currently alive (so that Google gains more data year over year), I tried Russian:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/26/great-go-glitchy-grammar/gorussian/" rel="attachment wp-att-19078"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19078" height="87" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GoRussian.jpg?resize=600%2C87&amp;ssl=1" width="600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
This got the main part right, except for ‘y’ coming back as ‘i’, but wobbled on the second half—which is frankly a mouthful in English. To multiply the number of native speakers by 10, I went to Chinese. Google offers the choice of “Traditional” or “Simplified” Chinese, but coming back is the same:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/26/great-go-glitchy-grammar/gochinese/" rel="attachment wp-att-19079"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19079" height="68" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GoChinese.jpg?resize=600%2C68&amp;ssl=1" width="600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Going via Chinese got “with” but lost the specificity of “collaborating” and also messed up the second half. So I tried completely the opposite idea: an artificial language with zero native speakers and a limited vocabulary—Esperanto.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/26/great-go-glitchy-grammar/goesperanto/" rel="attachment wp-att-19080"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19080" height="76" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GoEsperanto.jpg?resize=600%2C76&amp;ssl=1" width="600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Suddenly it is perfect. What is curious is that the Esperanto puts no preposition between “kunlabori” and Sylvain Gelly, who looks like a direct object the same as in the mistaken English original. But Google knows to insert the extra “with” on coming back. </p>
<p>
We’ll invite you to have fun trying other languages. Among ones I tried, only Italian and Portuguese matched the exactness of the correction via Esperanto. But all of them fixed the issue of “with.”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Does this show a commonality among human languages in their entirety that can help us improve our experiences with any one of them?</p>

    <title>The Long Road</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><i>Guest blogger Varsha Dani tells us why it's never too late.</i></p><p>This week, I am starting as an Assistant Professor at RIT and I am super excited about it. What's the big deal, you are probably thinking. Don't lots of people get hired in tenure track positions every year? Sure. But the difference in my case is that I got my Ph.D. in 2008. </p><div>Why didn't I look for a position right away? There were a number of reasons. I was burned out. I was going to have a baby. The job market was not particularly good that year. I would have had a two-body problem. And most importantly, I thought it was just going to be a short break. I thought that there was no rush...</div><div><br/></div><div>What did I do in those intervening years? A lot of things. I spent a lot of time with my kids, including part home-schooling them for some time. I found some new interests, both in Math and CS and outside. I found new collaborators and did some research in new areas, just for fun. Sometimes I was funded for it through grants, but mostly I wasn't. I wrote a lot of Computer Science and some math materials for Brilliant.org. I organized math clubs at my kids' elementary and middle schools. I hiked. I wrote <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/06/on-chain-letters-and-pandemics.html">poetry</a>. I never intended nearly 13 years to go by, but somehow they did.  At some point I remembered that I had meant to take a short break, not to give up on being an academic altogether. But by then it seemed too late. At the beginning of my meant-to-be-short hiatus, I used to jokingly refer to myself as a "scholar at large" but by the time a decade had gone by I had started to feel extremely isolated and being a scholar for its own sake was not something to joke about anymore.  Each year I rolled the job-search dice, but with each passing year it seemed more and more futile to do so, and more and more of an imposition to ask people to write recommendations for me. And then, out of the blue, last year, I found a whole community of independent researchers who, like me, were pursuing their scholarly interests despite not being employed to do so, and who felt unapologetically unembarrassed, even proud of it.  And, even more out of the blue, this year I got an offer. And now, this Fall, I am actually doing it. I am actually an academic! To be honest, I feel more than a little trepidation about it, mixed in with the excitement. </div><div><br/></div><div>So why am I telling you this? Partly to celebrate. Partly to publicly thank my spouse, who has been extremely supportive of all my decisions (and all my actions that were born of indecision) over many years. Partly to give a shout-out to the wonderful folks at the <a href="http://ronininstitute.org/">Ronin Institute</a> who helped me remember that we do science (and computer science) because we love it, not because it pays the bills. Ironically, I believe I needed to be reminded of that before I could get a job! But mostly, I'm writing this to reach out to anyone out there who thinks that their decisions have led to a one-way street they no longer want to be on. It may be hard, and there are, of course, no guarantees, but you won't know whether you can turn around, unless you try. </div></div>

<p>
Michael I. Jordan of the University of California, Berkeley, is a pioneer of AI that few outside of his field recognize. “He’s known as the Michael Jordan of machine learning,” quips Oren Etzioni, director of the Seattle-based Allen Institute.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I discuss some linkage between machine learning and computational complexity theory.<br/>
<span id="more-19054"/></p>
<p>
The quip by Etzioni runs longer—see <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/who-s-michael-jordan-computer-science-new-tool-ranks-researchers-influence">this</a>. The Allen Institute’s <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a> project aims to achieve content-based associative search for academic publications, so one can search for X that are close to a topic Y you have defined. They created an “influence graph” for millions of academic publications that goes well beyond citation counts. The graph’s most influential computer science paper was one by Jordan.</p>
<p>
Neither Jordan has ever worked in complexity theory. Somehow, I thought the above is relevant to complexity theory. It got me thinking about MIJ and his connection to machine learning (ML). This is connected to complexity theory again, and so <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> </p>
<p>
My thoughts converged on how the notion of <em>monotone</em> plays in both fields. Influence strikes us as naturally monotone—“negative influence” is still influence—and building the graph is a kind of positively weighted transitive closure. Many ML algorithms work by monotonically increasing an objective function, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation-maximization_algorithm">expectation-maximization</a> as expounded by MIJ. Non-monotone components such as negative (inhibiting) neural links and <a href="http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2014/08/4488.pdf">line</a>–<a href="https://www.caam.rice.edu/~yzhang/caam565/L1_reg/BB-step.pdf">search</a> add-ons to gradient descent are employed, but when and to what extent are they critical? We think negation is critical in complexity theory, but maybe not so much. Here are my thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Upper Bounds and Lower Bounds </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/24/a-negative-comment-on-negations/easy/" rel="attachment wp-att-19057"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19057" height="252" src="https://i2.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/easy.png?resize=338%2C252&amp;ssl=1" width="338"/></a></p>
<p>
Complexity theory is all about how hard is it to solve some problem. How hard is it to decide if a number is a prime? How hard is it to find a factor of a composite number? How hard is to color a graph with three colors? And so on.</p>
<p>
There are two issues: </p>
<p>
<b>Upper Bounds</b> Find an algorithm for the problem that is more efficient in some manner. Often in number of steps, but can be in other measures of complexity like memory used or amount of randomness and so on.</p>
<p>
<b>Lower Bounds</b> Show that no algorithm for the problem is more efficient in some manner. For example, show that no algorithm can solve the problem is fewer than a certain number of steps.</p>
<p>
The first is an <img alt="{\exists}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cexists%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> problem; the second is a <img alt="{\forall}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cforall%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. An upper bound is proving there exists an algorithm that is efficient enough. You job is to present an algorithm that solves the problem. A lower bound is proving all algorithms that solve the problem, must take more steps than allowed. </p>
<p>
There is something about <img alt="{\exists}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cexists%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that is fundamentally simpler than <img alt="{\forall}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cforall%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. An upper bound requires you to design an algorithm that works in some clever manner. The algorithm must exploit some trick about the problem that is powerful. For example to decide if a number is a prime, do not try all possible factors. Rather use a key consequence of a number being a prime: use the value of the number raised to a high power. </p>
<p>
The lower bound requires you to show that there is no algorithm that operates more efficiently that a certain bound. You must show that being too fast, for example, makes you wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Negations </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One approach to lower bounds is via Boolean complexity. The idea is that any computation can be done with <img alt="{AND}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAND%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{OR}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BOR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and <img alt="{NOT}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BNOT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. But, if we leave out <img alt="{NOT}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BNOT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, some computations cannot be done. However: </p>

Suppose that you wish to show that something cannot be computed efficiently. An obvious first step is to explain what operations are needed to compute it at all. Once you fix on operations that are enough, you can then focus on the question of whether the given operations can <em>efficiently</em> compute it.</p>
<p>
Suppose you wish to show that it will take a long time to get from A to another location B. How can you prove this? You might measure how long the distance is between A and B. Then if you know that you must drive a car from A to B, a lower bound is simple: How fast can the car go at maximum and argue that the time is therefore at least </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{\mathit{Distance}(A,B)}{M}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathit%7BDistance%7D%28A%2CB%29%7D%7BM%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Here M is the maximum speed the car goes.</p>
<p>
Suppose that Distance is <img alt="{100}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B100%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <i>miles</i> and the car can go at most <img alt="{40}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B40%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> miles per hour. Then a simple calculation is that it must take at least  	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{100}{40} = 2.5 \text{ hours.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B100%7D%7B40%7D+%3D+2.5+%5Ctext%7B+hours.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Of course it could be higher if sometimes you go slower—perhaps you have to stop now and then for traffic lights. 	</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Monotone Circuits </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There are many theorems like <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eva/Gap.Between.Monotone.NonMonotone.Circuit.Complexity.is.Exponential.pdf">this</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Any monotone circuit that computes <img alt="{F(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> correctly has size at least exponential in <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> . </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
These theorems are often hard to prove and require clever methods, but there are now tons of them. The field of complexity continues to extend and refine these theorems.</p>
<p>
This feeds in to the approach of showing <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> via Boolean circuit complexity. That is, to show that for some particular <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete problem, any Boolean computation for it requires a super-polynomial number of gates. A big idea is to build off the monotone lower bound results by moderately adding negation. </p>
<p>
But there is a big issue: it takes only order <img alt="{\log n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> negations to make the results fail. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2017/08/17/on-the-edge-of-eclipses-and-pnp/">covered</a> some recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/06/16/pnp/">attempts</a> by Norbert Blum to make this kind of idea work, but they do not seem to have established a new <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/10/p-vs-np-proof-claims/">base camp</a> for this approach, beyond <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01978380">previously</a>–<a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~razborov/files/clique.pdf">known</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397586901222">results</a> and <a href="file://C:/Users/KWRegan/Downloads/TR16-188.pdf">more</a>–<a href="https://theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v016a013/">recent</a> <a href="https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/ctd/article/view/15761">advances</a>.</p>
<p>
This failure led many to think that negations are somehow the “final frontier.” But we do not agree with this either. We feel that negations are not the critical issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Slice Issue—Again </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The key is the concept of <em>slice</em>. A slice of <img alt="{\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a subset <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that has all the elements the same weight. That is, its member binary strings have the same number of <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>s.</p>
<p>
There are many theorems like <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0215037?journalCode=smjcat">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> Any monotone circuit that computes <img alt="{F(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> correctly has size polynomial in <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Provided it only need work on some slice of <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
For a simple insight, suppose we want to say that a given bit <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of a string <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If we are promised that <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> belongs to a slice with <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>s, then we can do this with a monotone function: one saying that bits <img alt="{1\dots i-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%5Cdots+i-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{i+1\dots n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%2B1%5Cdots+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> collectively have at least <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>s. </p>
<p>
For an example of how slices show that negations cannot be the issue, consider factoring of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> bit numbers. This requires perhaps super polynomial size circuits. But note that if we fix factoring to <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-bit numbers that have <img alt="{n/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>‘s, say, then it becomes a function on a slice. And it is easy to see that a computation without any negations is at most order <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> bigger. Thus negations cannot be the secret to factoring. This is the key insight.</p>
<p>
We still have not said anything new. This insight says that strong lower bounds on monotone complexity for slice functions will give lower bounds for general circuits. But we still do not know how to get such bounds. We have shifted around the side of the mountain, but the resulting “Slice Gap” seems to block ascent as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Climbing Mount ML </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This is what has me thinking about whether machine learning can supply new insight. </p>
<p>
Here is a simple old story of what I mean. One of the limits on the simple neural model of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">perceptrons</a> that was shown a half-century ago by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert is that they cannot compute the binary XOR function. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_(book)#The_XOR_affair">led</a> people to expect that small assemblages of perceptrons would be similarly powerless. But it only takes three layers of perceptrons to compute XOR. The point is, a small control structure over monotone can replace the free use of negation.</p>
<p>
To go deeper—into deep learning for instance—we’ve peeked at the <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf">book</a> <em>Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms</em> by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David. The latter we know for some <a href="https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/users/wwwb/cgi-bin/tr-get.cgi/1991/CS/CS0699.revised.pdf">work</a> on Boolean circuits and P=NP. The nub is more easily approached via a 2014 <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/workshop/osl2015/slides/osl2015_shalev_shwartz.pdf">talk</a> by the former, titled “On the Computational Complexity of Deep Learning,” and his 2016 <a href="https://www.ima.umn.edu/2015-2016/SW5.16-19.16/24770">followup</a>. One point is that “theoretically weak” structures perform well when requirements of worst-case correctness and realizability are lifted—and the details make us wonder about possible parallels to the case of slices.  The point also prompts us to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p>
What control structures, or intermediate operations short of full negation, create practically powerful algorithms that are still theoretically nearly as weak as monotone?  Can researching them help us close the gap on lower bounds?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
To go wider, it seems that both we humans and ML algorithms perform well at many tasks using largely monotone components. Can they help give an account relevant to complexity of what power necessarily comes from non-monotone components? We note caveats expressed by MIJ in a much-noted 2014 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/machinelearning-maestro-michael-jordan-on-the-delusions-of-big-data-and-other-huge-engineering-efforts">interview</a> for <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> about generalizing from brain function to ML practice, but our intent is to look for particulars.</p>

    <title>TR21-122 |  The complexity of testing all properties of planar graphs, and the role of isomorphism | 

	Sabyasachi Basu, 

	Akash Kumar, 

	C. Seshadhri</title>
    <summary>Consider property testing on bounded degree graphs and let $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ denote the proximity parameter.  A remarkable theorem of Newman-Sohler (SICOMP 2013) asserts that all properties of planar graphs (more generally hyperfinite) are testable with query complexity only depending on $\varepsilon$. Recent advances in testing minor-freeness have proven that all additive and monotone properties of planar graphs can be tested in $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ queries. Some properties falling outside this class, such as Hamiltonicity, also have a similar complexity for planar graphs.  Motivated by these results, we ask: can all properties of planar graphs can be tested in $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ queries?  Is there a uniform query complexity upper bound for all planar properties, and what is the ``hardest" such property to test?

	We discover a surprisingly clean and optimal answer. Any property of bounded degree planar graphs can be tested in $\exp(O(\varepsilon^{-2}))$ queries.  Moreover, there is a matching lower bound, up to constant factors in the exponent.  The natural property of testing isomorphism to a fixed graph requires $\exp(\Omega(\varepsilon^{-2}))$ queries, thereby showing that (up to polynomial dependencies) isomorphism to an explicit fixed graph is the hardest property of planar graphs.  The upper bound is a straightforward adapation of the Newman-Sohler analysis that tracks dependencies on $\varepsilon$ more carefully.  The main technical contribution is the lower bound construction, which is achieved by a special family of planar graphs that are all mutually far from each other. 

    We can also apply our techniques to get analogous results for bounded treewidth graphs. We prove that all properties of bounded treewidth graphs can be tested in $\exp(O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries. Moreover, testing isomorphism to a fixed forest requires $\exp(\Omega(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries.</summary>

    <title>Interview with CONCUR 2021 ToT Award Recipients: Ahmed Bouajjani and Javier Esparza</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><i>I am delighted to post <a href="http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Nathalie.Bertrand/" target="_blank">Nathalie Bertrand</a>'s splendid interview with <a href="https://qonfest2021.lacl.fr/test-of-time.php" target="_blank">CONCUR 2021 Test-of-Time Award</a> recipients <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~abou/" target="_blank">Ahmed Bouajjani</a> and <a href="https://www7.in.tum.de/~esparza/" target="_blank">Javier Esparza</a>. (Ahmed and Javier receive the award for a paper their co-authored with the late <a href="https://hsb2019.fit.vutbr.cz/oded_maler.php" target="_blank">Oded Maler</a>.)<br/><br/>Thanks to Ahmed and Javier for their answers and to Nathalie for conducting such an interesting interview, which is rich in information on the technical context for, and impact of, their work as well as on their research collaborations over the years. I now leave the floor to Nathalie and her interviewees. Enjoy! </i><br/></p><p>This post is devoted to the interview I was honored to conduct with Ahmed Bouajjani and Javier Esparza for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-63141-0_10" target="_blank">their paper</a> with Oded Maler on reachability in pushdown automata.<br/><br/><b>Nathalie: </b>You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2021 for your paper with Oded Maler <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-63141-0_10" target="_blank">Reachability Analysis of Pushdown Automata: Application to Model-Checking</a>, which appeared at CONCUR 1997. In that article, you develop symbolic techniques to represent and manipulate sets of configurations of pushdown automata, or even of the broader class of alternating pushdown systems. The data structure you define to represent potentially infinite sets of configurations is coined alternating multi-automata, and you provide algorithms to compute the<br/>set of predecessors (pre*) of a given set of configurations.  Could you briefly explain to our readers what alternating multi-automata are?<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> The paper is based on two ideas. The first one is to use finite automata as a data structure to represent infinite sets of configurations of the pushdown automaton.  We called them <i>multi-automata</i> because they have multiple initial states, one per control state of the pushdown automaton, but there is nothing deep there.  The second idea is that this representation is closed under the operation of computing predecessors, immediate or not. So, given a multi-automaton representing a set of configurations, we can compute another multi-automaton representing all their predecessors. If you compute first the immediate predecessors, then their immediate predecessors, and so on, you don't converge, because your automata grow bigger and bigger. The surprising fact is that you can compute <i>all</i> predecessors in one go by just adding transitions to the original<br/>automaton, without adding any new states. This guarantees termination. Later we called this process ``saturation''.<br/><br/>Once you can compute predecessors, it is not too difficult to obtain a model-checking algorithm for LTL model checking. But for branching-time logics you must also be able to compute intersections of sets of configurations. That's where alternation kicks in, we use it to represent intersections without having to add new states.<br/><br/><b>Nathalie:</b> Could you also tell us how you came to study the question addressed in your award-winning article?  Which of the results in your paper did you find most surprising or challenging?<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> In the late 80s and early 90s many people were working on symbolic model-checking, the idea of using data structures to compactly represent sets of configurations. BBDs for finite-state model-checking were a hot topic, and for quite a few years dominated CAV. BDDs can be seen as acyclic automata, and so it was natural to investigate general finite automata as data structure for infinite-state systems.  Pierre Wolper and his group also did very good work on that.<br/><br/>About your second question, when I joined the team Ahmed and Oded had already been working on the topic for a while, and they had already developed the saturation algorithm. When they showed it to me I was blown away, it was so beautiful. A big surprise.<br/><br/><b>Nathalie:</b> In contrast to most previous work, your approach applied to model checking of pushdown systems treats in a uniform way linear-time and branching time logics. Did you apply this objective in other contributions?<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> I didn't. The reason is that I was interested in concurrency, and when you bring together concurrency and procedures even tiny fragments of branching-time logics become undecidable. So I kind of stuck to the linear-time case. Did you work on branching-time, Ahmed?<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> Somehow yes (although it is not precisely about linear vs. branching time properties), in the context of Regular Model Checking, a uniform framework for symbolic analysis of infinite-state systems using automata-based data structures. There, we worked on two versions, one based on word automata for systems where configurations can be encoded as words or vectors of words, such as stacks, queues, etc., and another one based on tree automata for configurations of a larger class of systems like heap manipulating programs, parametrized systems with tree-like architectures, etc.  The techniques we developed for both cases are based on the same principles.<br/><br/><b>Nathalie:</b> As it is often the case, the paper leaves some open questions. For instance, I believe, the precise complexity of verification of pushdown systems against CTL specifications is PSPACE-hard and in EXPTIME. Did you or others close this gap since? Did your techniques help to establish the precise complexity?<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> In our paper we showed that model checking the alternating modal<br/>mu-calculus is EXPTIME-hard. CTL is less expressive, and it  was the most popular logic in the verification community at the time, so it was natural to ask if it had lower complexity. <br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> Yes, as a first step in the paper we showed that a fragment of CTL, called EF, had PSPACE complexity. But I made a mistake in the proof, which was later found by Igor Walukiewicz. Igor cracked the problem in a paper at FSTTCS'00. It turns out that EF is indeed PSPACE-complete (so at least we got the result right!), and full CTL is EXPTIME-complete. I wish Igor had used our technique, but he<br/>didn't, he applied the ideas of his beautiful CAV'96 paper on parity pushdown games.<br/><br/><b>Nathalie:</b> It is often interesting to understand how research collaborations start as it can be inspiring to PhD students or colleagues. Could you tell us how you started your collaboration on the award-winning paper? Did you continue working together (on a similar topic or on something totally different) after 1997?<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> Javier and I first met in Liege for CAV 95. French universities have this program that allows us to bring foreign colleagues to France for a month as invited professors, and I invited Javier to Grenoble in 96.<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> It was great fun; Verimag was a fantastic place to do verification, we both liked cinema, Ahmed knew all restaurants, and the Alps were beautiful. Ahmed invited me again to Grenoble in 97. This time I came with my wife, and we again had a great time.<br/><br/>When I arrived in Grenoble in 96 Ahmed and Oded had already written most of the work that went into the paper. My contribution was not big, I only extended the result to the alternation-free mu-calculus, which was easy, and proved a matching lower bound. I think that my main contribution came <b>after</b> this paper. Ahmed and Oded were too modest, they thought the result was not so important, but I found it not only beautiful, I thought it'd be great implement the LTL part,<br/>and build a model checker for programs with procedures. We could do that thanks to Stefan Schwoon, who started his PhD in Munich around this time--he is now at Paris-Saclay---and was as good a theoretician as a tool builder. Around 2000 he implemented a symbolic version of the algorithms in MOPED, which was quite successful.<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> In 99 I moved to LIAFA in Paris, and I remember your kids were born.<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> Yes, you sent my wife beautiful flowers!<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> But we kept in touch, and we wrote a paper together in POPL'03 with my PhD student Tayssir Touili, now professor in Paris. We extended the ideas of the CONCUR paper to programs with both procedures and concurrency. Other papers came, the last in 2008.<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> And Ahmed is visiting Munich next year, pandemic permitting, so I hope there'll be more.<br/><br/><b>Nathalie:</b> How would you say this award-winning paper influenced your later work? Did any of your subsequent research build explicitly on it?<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> This paper was the first of many I have co-authored on verification of infinite-state systems using automata.  All of them use various automata classes to represent sets of configurations, and compute reachable configurations by iterative application of automata operations. We call these procedures accelerations; instead of computing a fixed point of a function by repeated iteration, you "jump" to the fixed point after finitely many steps, or at least converge faster. Accelerations were implicitly present in the CONCUR'97 paper. They have been also used by many other authors, for example Bernard Boigelot and Pierre Wolper.<br/><br/>My first paper on accelerations was with Peter Habermehl, my PhD student at the time and now at IRIF.  We worked on the verification of systems communicating through queues, using finite automata with Presburger constraints as data structure.  Then came several works on communicating systems with my student Aurore Annichini and Parosh Abdulla and Bengt Jonsson from Uppsala. As a natural continuation, with the Uppsala group and my student Tayssir Touili we developed the framework of Regular Model Checking. And then, with Peter Habermehl, Tomas Vojnar and Adam Rogalewicz from TU Brno, we extended Regular Model Checking to Abstract Regular Model Checking, which proved<br/>suitable and quite effective for the analysis of heap manipulating programs.<br/><br/>We also applied the CONCUR'97 results to the analysis of concurrent programs. The first work was a POPL'03 paper with Javier, Tayssir, and me on an abstraction framework. Two years later, Shaz Qadeer and Jakob Rehof proposed bounded-context switch analysis for bug detection. That paper created a line of research, and we contributed to it in many ways, together with Shaz, Mohamed Faouzi Atig, who was my student then, and is now Professor at Uppsala, and others.<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> The CONCUR'97 paper was very important for my career. As I said before, it directly led to MOPED, and later to jMOPED, a version of MOPED for Java programs developed by Stefan Schwoon and Dejvuth Suwimonteerabuth. Then, Tony Kucera, Richard Mayr, and I asked ourselves if it was possible to extend probabilistic verification to pushdown systems, and wrote some papers on the topic, the first in LICS'04. This was just the right moment, because at the same time Kousha Etessami and Mihalis Yannakakis started to write brilliant papers on recursive Markov chains, an equivalent model. The POPL'03 paper with Ahmed and Tayssir also came, and it triggered my work on Newtonian program analysis with two very talented PhD students, Stefan Kiefer, now in Oxford, and Michael Luttenberger, now my colleague at TUM.  So the CONCUR'97 paper was at the root of a large part of my work of the next 15 years.<br/><br/><b>Nathalie: </b>Is there any result obtained by other researchers that builds on your work and that you like in particular or found surprising?<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> After implementing MOPED, Stefan worked with Tom Reps on an extension to weighted pushdown automata, the Weighted Pushdown Library. Tom and Somesh Jha also found beautiful applications to security. This was great work.  I was also very impressed by the work of Luke Ong and his student Matthew Hague. In 97 Ahmed and I tried to apply the saturation method to the full mu-calculus but failed, we thought it couldn't be done. But first Thierry Cachat gave a saturation algorithm for Büchi pushdown games, then Luke, Matthew cracked the mu-calculus problem, and then they even extended it to<br/>higher-order pushdown automata, together with Arnaud Carayol, Olivier Serre, and others.  That was really surprising.<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> I agree. I'd also mention Qadeer and Rehof's TACAS'05 paper. They built on our results to prove that context-bounded analysis of concurrent programs is decidable. They initiated a whole line of research.<br/><br/><b>Nathalie:</b> What are the research topics that you find most interesting right now? Is there any specific problem in your current field of interest that you'd like to see solved?<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> Ten years ago I've had said the complexity of the reachability problem for Petri nets and of solving parity games, but now the first one is solved and the second almost solved! Now I don't have a specific problem, but in the last years I've been working on parameterized systems with an arbitrary number of agents, and many aspects of the theory are still very unsatisfactory. Automatically proving a mutual exclusion algorithm correct for a few processes was already routine 20 years ago, but proving it for an arbitrary number is still very much an open problem.<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> I think that invariant and procedure summary synthesis will remain hard and challenging problems that we need to investigate with new approaches and techniques. It is hard to discover the right level of abstraction at which the invariant must be expressed, which parts of the state are involved and how they are related. Of course the problem is unsolvable in general but finding good methodologies on how to tackle it depending on the class of programs is an important issue. I think that the recent emergence of data-driven approaches is<br/>promising. The problem is to develop well principled methods combining data-driven techniques and formal analysis that are efficient and that offer well understood guarantees.<br/><br/><b>Nathalie:</b> Would you have an anecdote or a tip from a well-established researcher to share to PhD students and young researchers?<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> Getting this award reminded me of the conference dinner at CAV 12 in St. Petersburg. I ended up at a table with some young people I didn't know. The acoustics was pretty bad.  When the CAV Award was being announced, somebody at the table asked "What's going on?", and somebody else answered "Not much, some senior guys getting some award". Never take yourself very seriously ...<br/><br/><b>Nathalie:</b> Oded Maler passed away almost 3 years ago. Do you have any memory of him to share with our readers?<br/><br/><b>Ahmed:</b> Oded was very amused by the number of citations. He used to say "Look at all the damage we've done."<br/><br/><b>Javier:</b> Yes, Oded had a wonderful sense of humor, very dry and deadpan. When I arrived in Grenoble it took me a few days to learn how to handle it!  I miss it very much.<br/><br/></p></div>

    <title>When Words Get Stretched Beyond Their Original meaning</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>STORY ONE:</p><p> On a Jeopardy rerun with Alex Trebek the question (actually the answer, given the shows format) was (I paraphrase)</p><p><br/>Who resigned his commision in the US Army Air Force in April 1941 after President Roosevelt publicly rebuked him for his views?</p><p>The answer (actually the question--Why does Jeopardy do this answer-question thing, drives me nuts!) was</p><p>Charles Lindbergh.</p><p>Alex Trebek then said  <i>Charles Lindberg's views on WW II were not politically correct.</i></p><p>This really struck me since <i>Politically correct </i>means, to quote Wikipedia:</p><p><i>a term used to describe language, policies, or measures that are intended to avoid offense of disadvantage to members of particular groups in society. </i></p><p>Wikipedia also adds that the term is generally used pejoratively with an implication that these policies are excessive or unwarranted. </p><p> But Alex Trebek is using the term to mean  <i>incorrect </i>or perhaps <i>incorrect given what we know now</i> or if you think history is written by the winners, then perhaps <i>incorrect since Germany lost the wa</i>r.  But my point is that I really don't think the term  <i>politically incorrect </i> makes sense here.</p><p>STORY TWO</p><p>More recently I heard an anti-masker say</p><p><i>We should not let some woke school board take the right to not wear a mask away from parents and children</i>.</p><p>Independent of if you are anti-mask-mandates or pro-mask-mandates, this seems like a strange use of the word  <i>woke </i> which means, to paraphrase Wikipedia:</p><p><i>Having an awareness of racial prejudice, gender prejudice, sexual orientation prejudice, and the past and current discrimination they have and do cause. </i></p><p>I've seen it both positively and negatively.</p><p>The anti-masker's using of the term seems odd in that mask wearing is not a woke issue. Perhaps he should have said </p><p><i>We should not let some Nazi school board take the right to not wear a mask away from parents and children.</i></p><p>The term  <i>Nazi </i>while not actually correct, conveys that the school board is authoritarian. However, he really could not use the term that since he was was a neo-Nazi and proud of it. That raises a question: what pejorative  term can a Neo-Nazi use when they want to say someone is  Authoritarian? I ask non-rhetoically. </p><p>But I am getting off topic here- my real point is that the word<i> woke </i>is being used to mean Authoritarian which is not even close to its original meaning. </p><p><br/></p><p>MY POINT</p><p>The above are examples of how a word in English may change its definition over time, which is not really news, but I found the examples interesting since I saw the origin of these words.</p><p>BILL, THIS IS A COMPLEXITY BLOG! SO TALK ABOUT COMPLEXITY. OR MATH!</p><p>In math do words change their meaning over time? Yes. Here are a few</p><p><i>Function</i>: at one time `function' implicitly means a function that occurs in nature. So only continous and perhaps diff functions qualified. </p><p><i>Sets</i>: probably similar.</p><p><i>Efficient</i>: At one time this was an informal notion (Joe Kruskal's paper on MST (see <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1956-007-01/S0002-9939-1956-0078686-7/S0002-9939-1956-0078686-7.pdf">here</a>) is an example of that), then it seemed to be P or perhaps BPP. For some its linear or O(n log n) with a small constant. Rather than say the notion changed, its more like it was never that well defined in the first place, and still isn't. </p><p><i>Constructive: </i>The many diff definitions of this word could be a blog post of its own. In fact, I thought it was, but I could not find it. I did find lots of blog posts that use the word <i>constructive</i> in diff ways. </p><p><i>Elementary</i>: Also has many definitions, though they are closer together than for Constructive. This one I did do a post on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/02/what-is-elementary-proof.html#comment-form">here</a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>
