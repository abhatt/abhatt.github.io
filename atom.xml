which the precise value can be queried by paying a cost. The goal is to devise
an adaptive decision tree to find a correct solution to the problem in
consideration while minimizing the expected total query cost. We show that
sorting in this scenario can be performed in polynomial time. For the problem
of finding the data item with minimum value, we have some evidence for
hardness. This contradicts intuition, since the minimum problem is easier both
in the online setting with adversarial inputs and in the offline verification
setting. However, the stochastic assumption can be leveraged to beat both
deterministic and randomized approximation lower bounds for the online setting.

    <title>Fairness in Influence Maximization through Randomization</title>

fields in order to study how information spreads in social networks. While
previously the attention was mostly on efficiency, more recently fairness
issues have been taken into account in this scope. In this paper, we propose to
use randomization as a mean for achieving fairness. Similar to previous works
like Fish et al. (WWW '19) and Tsang et al. (IJCAI '19), we study the maximin
criterion for (group) fairness. In contrast to their work however, we model the
problem in such a way that, when choosing the seed sets, probabilistic
strategies are possible rather than only deterministic ones. We introduce two
different variants of this probabilistic problem, one that entails
probabilistic strategies over nodes (node-based problem) and a second one that
entails probabilistic strategies over sets of nodes (set-based problem). While
the original deterministic problem involving the maximin criterion has been
shown to be inapproximable, interestingly, we show that both probabilistic
variants permit approximation algorithms that achieve a constant multiplicative
factor of 1-1/e plus an additive arbitrarily small error that is due to the
simulation of the information spread. For an experimental study, we provide
implementations of multiplicative-weight routines for both problems and compare
the achieved fairness values to existing methods. Maybe non-surprisingly, we
show that the ex-ante values of the computed probabilistic strategies are
significantly larger than the (ex-post) fairness values of previous methods.
This indicates that studying fairness via randomization is a worthwhile path to
follow. Interestingly and maybe more surprisingly, we observe that even the
ex-post fairness values computed by our routines, dominate over the fairness
achieved by previous methods on most of the instances tested.

    <title>Complexity of the list homomorphism problem in hereditary graph classes</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1602115200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/o/Okrasa:Karolina.html">Karolina Okrasa</a>, Paweł Rzążewski <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03393">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A homomorphism from a graph $G$ to a graph $H$ is an edge-preserving mapping
from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$. For a fixed graph $H$, in the list homomorphism problem,
denoted by LHom($H$), we are given a graph $G$, whose every vertex $v$ is
equipped with a list $L(v) \subseteq V(H)$. We ask if there exists a
homomorphism $f$ from $G$ to $H$, in which $f(v) \in L(v)$ for every $v \in
V(G)$. Feder, Hell, and Huang [JGT~2003] proved that LHom($H$) is polynomial
time-solvable if $H$ is a bi-arc-graph, and NP-complete otherwise.
</p>
<p>We are interested in the complexity of the LHom($H$) problem in graphs
excluding a copy of some fixed graph $F$ as an induced subgraph. It is known
that if $F$ is connected and is not a path nor a subdivided claw, then for
every non-bi-arc graph the LHom($H$) problem is NP-complete and cannot be
solved in subexponential time, unless the ETH fails. We consider the remaining
cases for connected graphs $F$.
</p>
<p>If $F$ is a path, we exhibit a full dichotomy. We define a class called
predacious graphs and show that if $H$ is not predacious, then for every fixed
$t$ the LHom($H$) problem can be solved in quasi-polynomial time in $P_t$-free
graphs. On the other hand, if $H$ is predacious, then there exists $t$, such
that LHom($H$) cannot be solved in subexponential time in $P_t$-free graphs.
</p>
<p>If $F$ is a subdivided claw, we show a full dichotomy in two important cases:
for $H$ being irreflexive (i.e., with no loops), and for $H$ being reflexive
(i.e., where every vertex has a loop). Unless the ETH fails, for irreflexive
$H$ the LHom($H$) problem can be solved in subexponential time in graphs
excluding a fixed subdivided claw if and only if $H$ is non-predacious and
triangle-free. If $H$ is reflexive, then LHom($H$) cannot be solved in
subexponential time whenever $H$ is not a bi-arc graph.

2009] presented a recognition algorithm for interval graphs by six graph
searches. Li and Wu [Discrete Mathematics \&amp; Theoretical Computer Science 2014]
simplified it to only four. The great simplicity of the latter algorithm is
however eclipsed by the complicated and long proofs. The main purpose of this
paper is to present a new and significantly short proof for Li and Wu's

simpler interpretation of the recognition algorithm of Corneil [Discrete
Applied Mathematics 2004] for unit interval graphs, based on three sweeps of

Toward the proofs of the main results, we make several new structural
observations that might be of independent interests.

logic with team semantics (TeamLTL). In contrast to LTL, TeamLTL is capable of
defining hyperproperties, i.e., properties which relate multiple execution
traces. Logics for hyperproperties have so far been mostly obtained by
extending temporal logics like LTL and QPTL with trace quantification,
resulting in HyperLTL and HyperQPTL. We study the expressiveness of TeamLTL
(and its extensions with downward closed generalised atoms A and connectives
such as Boolean disjunction v) in comparison to HyperLTL and HyperQPTL.
Thereby, we also obtain a number of model checking results for TeamLTL, a
question which is so far an open problem. The two types of logics follow a
fundamentally different approach to hyperproperties and are are of incomparable
expressiveness. We establish that the universally quantified fragment of
HyperLTL subsumes the so-called k-coherent fragment of TeamLTL(A,v). This also
implies that the model checking problem is decidable for the fragment. We show
decidability of model checking of the so-called "left-flat" fragment of
TeamLTL(A,v) via a translation to a decidable fragment of HyperQPTL. Finally,
we show that the model checking problem of TeamLTL with Boolean disjunction and
inclusion atom is undecidable.

    <title>New Verification Schemes for Frequency-Based Functions on Data Streams</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1602115200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Ghosh:Prantar.html">Prantar Ghosh</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03287">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the general problem of computing frequency-based functions, i.e.,
the sum of any given function of data stream frequencies. Special cases include
fundamental data stream problems such as computing the number of distinct
elements ($F_0$), frequency moments ($F_k$), and heavy-hitters. It can also be
applied to calculate the maximum frequency of an element ($F_{\infty}$).
</p>
<p>Given that exact computation of most of these special cases provably do not
admit any sublinear space algorithm, a natural approach is to consider them in
an enhanced data streaming model, where we have a computationally unbounded but
untrusted prover sending proofs or help messages to ease the computation. Think
of a memory-restricted client delegating the computation to a stronger cloud
service whom it doesn't want to trust blindly. Using its limited memory, it
wants to verify the proof that the cloud sends. Chakrabarti et al.~(ICALP '09)
introduced this setting as the "annotated data streaming model" and showed that
multiple problems including exact computation of frequency-based
functions---that have no sublinear algorithms in basic streaming---do have
annotated streaming algorithms, also called "schemes", with both space and
proof-length sublinear in the input size.
</p>
<p>We give a general scheme for computing any frequency-based function with both
space usage and proof-size of $O(n^{2/3}\log n)$ bits, where $n$ is the size of
the universe. This improves upon the best known bound of $O(n^{2/3}\log^{4/3}
n)$ given by the seminal paper of Chakrabarti et al.~and as a result, also
improves upon the best known bounds for the important special cases of
computing $F_0$ and $F_{\infty}$. We emphasize that while being quantitatively
better, our scheme is also qualitatively better in the sense that it is simpler
than the previously best scheme that uses intricate data structures and
elaborate subroutines.

high accuracy. We further develop a reduction framework, inspired by
\emph{proximal point methods} in convex optimization, which bootstraps samplers
for regularized densities to improve dependences on problem conditioning. A key
ingredient in our framework is the notion of a "restricted Gaussian oracle"
(RGO) for $g: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which is a sampler for
distributions whose negative log-likelihood sums a quadratic and $g$. By
combining our reduction framework with our new samplers, we obtain the
following bounds for sampling structured distributions to total variation
distance $\epsilon$. For composite densities $\exp(-f(x) - g(x))$, where $f$
has condition number $\kappa$ and convex (but possibly non-smooth) $g$ admits
an RGO, we obtain a mixing time of $O(\kappa d \log^3\frac{\kappa
d}{\epsilon})$, matching the state-of-the-art non-composite bound; no composite
samplers with better mixing than general-purpose logconcave samplers were
previously known. For logconcave finite sums $\exp(-F(x))$, where $F(x) =
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i \in [n]} f_i(x)$ has condition number $\kappa$, we give a
sampler querying $\widetilde{O}(n + \kappa\max(d, \sqrt{nd}))$ gradient oracles
to $\{f_i\}_{i \in [n]}$; no high-accuracy samplers with nontrivial gradient
query complexity were previously known. For densities with condition number
$\kappa$, we give an algorithm obtaining mixing time $O(\kappa d
\log^2\frac{\kappa d}{\epsilon})$, improving the prior state-of-the-art by a
logarithmic factor with a significantly simpler analysis; we also show a
zeroth-order algorithm attains the same query complexity.

constructs a corresponding tree decomposition as well. Our algorithm is a
faster variation of Reed's classical algorithm. For the benefit of the reader,
and to be able to compare these two algorithms, we start with a detailed time
analysis for Reed's algorithm. We fill in many details that have been omitted
in Reed's paper. Computing tree decompositions parameterized by the treewidth
$k$ is fixed parameter tractable (FPT), meaning that there are algorithms
running in time $O(f(k) g(n))$ where $f$ is a computable function, $g$ is a
polynomial function, and $n$ is the number of vertices. An analysis of Reed's
algorithm shows $f(k) = 2^{O(k \log k)}$ and $g(n) = n \log n$ for a
5-approximation. Reed simply claims time $O(n \log n)$ for bounded $k$ for his
constant factor approximation algorithm, but the bound of $2^{\Omega(k \log k)}
n \log n$ is well known. From a practical point of view, we notice that the
time of Reed's algorithm also contains a term of $O(k^2 2^{24k} n \log n)$,
which for small $k$ is much worse than the asymptotically leading term of
$2^{O(k \log k)} n \log n$. We analyze $f(k)$ more precisely, because the
purpose of this paper is to improve the running times for all reasonably small
values of $k$.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(f(k)n\log{n})$ too, but with a much
smaller dependence on $k$. In our case, $f(k) = 2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$. This
algorithm is simple and fast, especially for small values of $k$. We should
mention that Bodlaender et al.\ [2016] have an asymptotically faster algorithm
running in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)} n$. It relies on a very sophisticated data
structure and does not claim to be useful for small values of $k$.

Kleene patterns to detect and aggregate arbitrarily-long event sequences,
called event trends. State-of-the-art systems process such queries in two
steps. Namely, they first construct all trends and then aggregate them. Due to
the exponential costs of trend construction, this two-step approach suffers
from both a long delays and high memory costs. To overcome these limitations,
we propose the Graph-based Real-time Event Trend Aggregation (Greta) approach
that dynamically computes event trend aggregation without first constructing
these trends. We define the Greta graph to compactly encode all trends. Our
Greta runtime incrementally maintains the graph, while dynamically propagating
aggregates along its edges. Based on the graph, the final aggregate is
incrementally updated and instantaneously returned at the end of each query
window. Our Greta runtime represents a win-win solution, reducing both the time
complexity from exponential to quadratic and the space complexity from
exponential to linear in the number of events. Our experiments demonstrate that
Greta achieves up to four orders of magnitude speed-up and up to 50--fold
memory reduction compared to the state-of-the-art two-step approaches.

    <title>Dynamic Query Evaluation Over Structures with Low Degree</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1602115200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/v/Vigny:Alexandre.html">Alexandre Vigny</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02982">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the evaluation of first-order queries over classes of databases
that have bounded degree and low degree. More precisely, given a query and a
database, we want to efficiently test whether there is a solution, count how
many solutions there are, or be able to enumerate the set of all solutions.
</p>
<p>Bounded and low degree are rather natural notions and both yield efficient
algorithms. For example, Berkholz, Keppeler, and Schweikardt showed in 2017
that over databases of bounded degree, not only any first order query can
efficiently be tested, counted and enumerated, but the data structure used can
be updated when the database itself is updated.
</p>
<p>This paper extends existing results in two directions. First, we show that
over classes of databases with low degree, there is a data structure that
enables us to test, count and enumerate the solutions of first order queries.
This data structure can also be efficiently recomputed when the database is
updated. Secondly, for classes of databases with bounded degree we show that,
without increasing the preprocessing time, we can compute a data structure that
does not depend on the query but only on its quantifier rank. We can therefore
perform a single preprocessing that can later be used for many queries.

(GNNs), we propose the first method that exploits vector flows over graphs to
develop globally consistent directional and asymmetric aggregation functions.
We show that our directional graph networks (DGNs) generalize convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) when applied on a grid. Whereas recent theoretical works
focus on understanding local neighbourhoods, local structures and local
isomorphism with no global information flow, our novel theoretical framework
allows directional convolutional kernels in any graph. First, by defining a
vector field in the graph, we develop a method of applying directional
derivatives and smoothing by projecting node-specific messages into the field.
Then we propose the use of the Laplacian eigenvectors as such vector field, and
we show that the method generalizes CNNs on an n-dimensional grid. Finally, we
bring the power of CNN data augmentation to graphs by providing a means of
doing reflection, rotation and distortion on the underlying directional field.
We evaluate our method on different standard benchmarks and see a relative
error reduction of 8% on the CIFAR10 graph dataset and 11% to 32% on the
molecular ZINC dataset. An important outcome of this work is that it enables to
translate any physical or biological problems with intrinsic directional axes
into a graph network formalism with an embedded directional field.

equivariant to all three shape-preserving transformations of point clouds:
translation, rotation, and permutation.

<p>In this paper, we present a first study of the approximation power of these

characterization of the space of equivariant polynomials. We then use these
conditions to show that two recently suggested models are universal, and for
devising two other novel universal architectures.

    <title>A Parallel Batch-Dynamic Data Structure for the Closest Pair Problem</title>

data structure for the closest pair problem. Our solution is based on a serial
dynamic closest pair data structure by Golin et al. [SIAM J.\ on Computing,
1998], and supports batches of insertions and deletions in parallel. For a data
set of size $n$, our data structure supports a batch of insertions or deletions
of size $m$ in $O(m\log (1+(n+m)/m))$ expected work and $O(\log
(n+m)\log^*(n+m))$ depth with high probability, and takes linear space. The key
techniques for achieving these bounds are a new work-efficient parallel
batch-dynamic binary heap, and careful management of the computation across
multiple points to minimize work and depth.
</p>
<p>We provide an optimized multicore implementation of our data structure using
dynamic hash tables, parallel heaps, and dynamic $k$-d trees. Our experiments
on a variety of synthetic and real-world data sets show that it achieves a
parallel speedup of up to 38.57x (15.10x on average) on 48 cores with
hyper-threading. In addition, we also implement and compare four parallel
algorithms for static closest pair problem, for which no practical
implementations exist in the literature. On 48 cores with hyper-threading, the
algorithms achieve up to 51.45x (29.42x on average) speedup, and Rabin's
algorithm performs the best on average. Comparing our dynamic algorithm to the
fastest static algorithm, we find that it is advantageous to use the dynamic
algorithm for batch sizes of up to 70\% of the data set. As far as we know, our
work is the first to experimentally evaluate parallel algorithms for the
closest pair problem, in both the static and the dynamic settings.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Apologies dear readers for the late posting. The beginning of the school year is always frenzied, and the pandemic has only added to that frenzy. We have an exciting September, with four papers on graph property testing, one paper on distribution testing, and one paper that connects both topics.</p>



<p><strong>Estimation of Graph Isomorphism Distance in the Query World</strong> by Sourav Chakraborty, Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, and Sayantan Sen (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/135/">ECCC</a>). Graph isomorphism is about as fundamental as it gets, and this papers studies approximating the graph isomorphism distance for dense graphs. There is a known graph \(G_k\) (with \(n\) vertices). The algorithm is given query access to an input graph \(G_u\) and needs to approximate the number of edge inserts/deletes required to make the graphs isomorphic. This is the tolerant testing version; the property testing version is known to be doable in \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})\) queries (<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/070680795?journalCode=smjcat">Matsliah-Fischer</a>). The main insight of this paper is to relate the tolerant testing complexity to a distribution testing problem. Consider distributions over the \(\{0,1\}^n\) defined by multisets of \(n\) hypercube points. Our aim is to estimate the earthmover distance between a known distribution and an unknown distribution. Interestingly, the query model is different: one can sample the underlying multisets <em>without</em> replacement. It turns out that the optimal complexity of this problem is (upto polylog factors) is the same as the optimal complexity of tolerant testing of graph isomorphism. A direct corollary is that the isomorphism distance can be approximated upto additive \(\epsilon n^2\) using \(\widetilde{O}(n)\) samples. This equivalence also gives an alternate proof for lower bounds for property testing graph isomorphism.</p>



<p><strong>Robustly Self-Ordered Graphs: Constructions and Applications to Property Testing </strong>by Oded Goldreich and Avi Wigderson (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/149/">ECCC</a>). Let’s start from the application. The aim is to prove the following property testing lower bounds for the bounded-degree graph setting: an exponential separation between tolerant and vanilla testing, and finding an efficiently decidable property (in polynomial time) that cannot be property tested in sublinear time. For binary strings, results of this form are known. Can these be “ported” to the bounded-degree graph world? Can we construct graphs such that adjacency queries reduce to bit queries in strings? Naturally, one can simply represent the adjacency list as a string and treat graph queries as bit queries. But the problem is that of isomorphisms: different bit strings could represent the same graph and therefore, the different bit strings must have the same status with respect to the underlying property. The key insight in this paper is to introduce <em>robustly self-ordered graph</em>s, as a tool to port bit string property testing lower bounds to bounded-degree graphs. Such graphs essentially have a unique (identity) automorphism, even after a few edge insert/deletes. The actual definition is more technical, but that is the essence. The main result is an explicit construction of such graphs, from which the lower bound can be ported directly through a convenient lemma.</p>



<p><strong>Modifying a Graph’s Degree Sequence and the Testablity of Degree Sequence Properties </strong>by Lior Gishboliner (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12697.pdf">arXiv</a>). A sequence of numbers \(D = (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)\) is graphic if there exists an undirected graph on \(n\) vertices whose degrees are precisely the numbers of the sequence. Graphical sequences have been characterized by classic results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem">Erdös-Gállai</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel%E2%80%93Hakimi_algorithm">Havel-Hakimi</a>. This paper first proves the following theorem. Suppose a graphic sequence \(D’\) has \(l_1\)-distance at most \(\delta\) from the degree sequence \(D\) of a graph \(G\). Then, there exists a graph \(G’\) with degree sequence \(D’\) such that the (dense graph) distance between \(G\) and \(G’\) is \(O(\sqrt{\delta})\). This theorem is used to prove an interesting property testing result. Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a subset of graphic sequences that are closed under permutation. Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be the set of graphs that have a degree sequence in \(\mathcal{D}\). Then \(\mathcal{G}\) can be tested in \(poly(1/\epsilon)\) queries.</p>



<p><strong>Sampling an Edge Uniformly in Sublinear Time</strong> by Jakub Têtek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11178.pdf">arXiv</a>). In the general model for sublinear algorithms on graphs, an important choice is whether one allows uniform random edge queries. A natural question is whether such queries can simulated efficiently, using only random vertex, degree, and neighbor queries. This problem appears somewhat implicitly in previous sublinear subgraph counting algorithms, and <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10628/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2019-52.pdf">Eden-Ron-Rosenbaum</a> study it explicitly. They prove that one can sample from an \(\epsilon\)-approximate uniform distribution (over edges) using \(O(n/\sqrt{\epsilon m})\) samples. The problem of sampling from exactly the uniform distribution is left open. Until this paper. The main result shows that by modifying the Eden-Ron-Rosenbaum algorithm parameters, one can generate edge samples from an \(\epsilon\)-approximate uniform distribution using \(O((n/\sqrt{m})\log \epsilon^{-1})\) samples. The exact uniform distribution is achieved by setting \(\epsilon = 1/n\), to get a sample complexity of \(O((n\log n)/\sqrt{m})\).</p>



<p><strong>Faster Property Testers in a Variation of the Bounded Degree Model </strong>by Isolde Adler and Polly Fahey (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07770.pdf">arXiv</a>). The setting of bounded-degree graph property testing naturally extends to bounded-degree relational databases, which can be thought of as “directed” hypergraphs. This is an interesting new direction of research, that combines property testing with database theory (see <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/157699299.pdf">Adler-Harwath</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3294052.3319679">Chen-Yoshida</a>). One of the main contributions of this work is to consider another notion of distance: edge and vertex inserts/deletes. This is a natural extension, and we can now compare distances between graphs/databases with different numbers of vertices. The main result is that, under this notion of distance, a large class of properties can be tested in constant running time on databases with bounded degree and treewidth. Specifically, any property expressible in Counting Monadic Second-Order Logic (CMSO) can be tested in constant time. Previous results by Alder-Harwath showed that such properties can be tested (under the standard distance notion) in constant queries, but polylogarithmic time. </p>



<p><strong>Optimal Testing of Discrete Distributions with High Probability</strong> by Ilias Diakonikolas, Themis Gouleakis, Daniel M. Kane, John Peebles, and Eric Price (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06540">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/140/">ECCC</a>). The focus of this paper is distribution testing in the “high probability” regime, where we wish the error of the tester to be \(&lt; \delta\). Typically, most results just get an error of at most \(1/3\), from which standard probabilistic boosting would tack on an extra \(O(\log 1/\delta)\) factor. In standard TCS settings, one doesn’t focus on optimizing this dependence, but in statistics, there is significant focus on the optimal sample complexity. And indeed, for practical applications, it is crucial to have sharp bounds on the right number of samples required for hypothesis testing. The paper also argues that getting the optimal sample complexity requires new algorithms, even for uniformity testing. There are optimal results given for closeness and independence testing. The optimal sample complexity only pays a multiplicative factor of \(\log^{1/3} (1/\delta)\) or \(\log^{1/2}(1/\delta)\) over the optimal bound for constant error (with other additive terms depending on \(\log(1/\delta)\)).</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We consider statistical inference tasks in a distributed setting where access to data samples is subjected to strict “local constraints,” through a unified framework that captures communication limitations and (local) privacy constraints as special cases. We study estimation (learning) and goodness-of-fit (testing) for both discrete and high-dimensional distributions. Our goal is to understand how the sample complexity increases under the information constraints.<br/><br/>In this talk we will provide an overview of this field and a sample of some of our results. We will discuss the role of (public) randomness  and interactivity in information-constrained inference, and make a case for thinking about randomness and interactivity as resources.<br/><br/>The work is part of a long-term ongoing collaboration with Clément Canonne (IBM Research) and Himanshu Tyagi (IISc), and includes works done with Cody Freitag (Cornell), Yanjun Han (Stanford), Yuhan Liu (Cornell), and Ziteng Sun (Cornell). </p></blockquote></div>

    <title>Conference Digest - NeurIPS 2020</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020">NeurIPS 2020</a> is the biggest conference on machine learning, with tons of content on differential privacy in many different forms.
We were able to find two workshops, a competition, and 31 papers. 
This was just going off the preliminary <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/AcceptedPapersInitial">accepted papers list</a>, so it’s possible that we might have missed some papers on differential privacy – please let us know!
We will update this post later, once all the conference material (papers and videos) are publicly available.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Edit distance is a classic measure of similarity between strings, with applications ranging from computational biology to coding. Computing edit distance is also a classic dynamic programming problem, with a quadratic run-time solution, often taught in the “Intro to Algorithms” classes. Improving this runtime has been a decades-old challenge, now ruled likely-impossible using tools from the modern area of fine-grained complexity. We show how to approximate the edit distance between two strings in near-linear time, up to a constant factor. Our result completes a research direction set forth in the breakthrough paper of [Chakraborty, Das, Goldenberg, Koucky, Saks; FOCS’18], which showed the first constant-factor approximation algorithm with a (strongly) sub-quadratic running time.</p>

Emil Faber is the pretend founder of the pretend Faber College. The 1978 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_House">Animal House</a> starts with a close-up of Faber’s statue, which has the inscription, <b>Knowledge Is Good</b>.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought we might talk about knowledge, science, mathematics, proofs, and more.</p>
<p>
The phrase on Faber’s pedestal is meant to be a joke, as is the subtitle we added saying the same about science. But there is some truth to both of them. From the cause of climate change to the best response to the current pandemic to sports predictions there is much interest in science. Science is good, indeed.</p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Science </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What is science and what are methods of creating knowledge via science? There is a whole world on the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a>. The central questions are: What is science? What methods are used to create new science? Is science good?—just kidding. </p>
<p>
We are not experts on the philosophy of science. But there seem to be three main ways to create scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Experiments:</i> This is the classic one. Think about the testing of a candidate vaccine to stop the pandemic. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Computational Experiments:</i> This is relatively new. Think computer simulations of how climate change is effected by the methods of creating energy—for example. wind vs. coal. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Mathematical Proofs:</i> This is the one we focus on here at GLL. Think proofs that some algorithm works or that there is no algorithm that can work unless… </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Mathematical Proofs </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are interested in creating knowledge via proving new theorems. This is how we try to create knowledge. Our science is based not on experiments and not on simulations but mostly on the theorem-proof method. Well not exactly. We do use experiments and simulations. For example, the field of quantum algorithms uses both of these.</p>
<p>
However, math proofs are the basis of complexity theory. This means that we need to create proofs and then check that they are correct. The difficulty of checking a proof is based on who created them: </p>
<ul>
<li>
You did—checking your own work. <p/>
</li><li>
Someone else did—refereeing for a journal. <p/>
</li><li>
Someone in your class did—grading exams. <p/>
</li><li>
Some graduate student did—mentoring. <p/>
</li><li>
Someone on the web who claims a major result like <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/> did—debugging. <p/>
</li><li>
And so on.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> My Favorite Checking Method </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My favorite tool for checking is this trick: Suppose that we have a proof <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{P}"/> that demonstrates <img alt="{A \implies X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+X%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A \implies X}"/> is true. Sometimes it is possible to show that there is a proof <img alt="{Q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Q}"/> that proves <img alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A \implies Y}"/> where: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The proof <img alt="{Q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Q}"/> is based on changing the claimed proof <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{P}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
The proof <img alt="{Q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Q}"/> demonstrates <img alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A \implies Y}"/>, and; <p/>
</li><li>
The statement <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Y}"/> does not follow from <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A}"/>.
</li></ol>
<p>
One way this commonly arises is when <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{P}"/> as a proof did not use all of the assumptions in <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A}"/>. Thus <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{P}"/> really proves more that <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{X}"/> and it proves <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Y}"/>. But we note that <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Y}"/> is not a consequence of <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A}"/>.</p>
<p>
For example, consider the Riemann hypothesis. Suppose that we claim that we have a proof that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%5Cneq+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 "/></p>
<p>follows from the usual axioms of math plus <img alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}"/>. Sounds great. But suppose this is based on an argument that assumes that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 "/></p>
<p>and manipulates the summation, eventually yielding a contradiction, without using the condition <img alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}"/>. This is a problem, since there are <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{s}"/> with <img alt="{\Re(s) = 1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3D+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\Re(s) = 1/2}"/> so that the sum is zero. This is an example of the above method of checking. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A New Checking Method </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
From time to time claims are made of resolutions to famous conjectures. Think <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>. These claims have all been wrong to date. So most researchers are reluctant to take time to check any new claims. Why would you take the effort to try and find the bug that is likely there? </p>
<p>
I wonder if there could be a method that is based on competition. For concreteness, suppose Alice and Bob are two researchers who both claim a resolution to the <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> versus <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> problem. Alice has a lower bound argument that <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/> and Bob has an upper bound that <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>. Could we have them play a “game”? </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Give their papers to each other. Have them try to find a flaw in each other’s paper. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
They are highly motivated. Could we argue that if they cannot find any flaw then we would be slightly more motivated to look at the papers? </p>
<p>
This might work even if they both claim <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>. Ken and I, personally, have had more claims of <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/> brought to our attention. Even in this case they would be highly motivated: the awards, the prizes, the praise will go to the one who is correct. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Possible Extensions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One difference in our situation from classic empirical science is the nature of gaps in knowledge. For example, one of the big current controversies in physics is over the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a>. The Wikipedia article we just linked seems to date mostly to years around 2012 when dark matter was more widely accepted than <a href="https://medium.com/futuresin/doubting-dark-matter-f3e400c7dcd7">strikes</a> us <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-dark-matter-real/">today</a> (see also <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/10/dark-matter-nightmare-what-if-we-just.html">this</a> and <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/03/are-dark-energy-and-dark-matter.html">this</a>). There are cases where two competing theories are incompatible yet the available data do not suffice to find a fault in either. </p>
<p>
Whereas, with claimed proofs of incompatible statements, such as <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/> and <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>, at least one must have a demonstrable error. The statements themselves may have barriers all the way up to undecidability, but that does not matter to judging the proffered proofs.</p>
<p>
The method may be more applicable in life sciences where the gap is gathering sufficient field or lab observations. For a topical example, consider claims about the risk or safety of human gatherings amid the pandemic. One extreme is represented by the extraordinary <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp13670.pdf">claim</a>, which is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-do-crowds-contribute-to-covid-its-complicated/">evidently</a> quite <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/09/14/sturgis-bike-rally-paper-impact-on-covid-19-coronavirus-cases/">excessive</a>, that the Sturgis motorcycle rally in August led to over 250,000 Covid-19 cases. The other extreme would be analyses used to justify gatherings with minimal precautions. The extremes cannot coexist. The means to arbitrate between them are available in principle but require costly social effort for contact tracing and testing as well as resolving mathematical issues between epidemiological models.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What do you think of our new checking method? Should it be more widely employed for evaluating claims and hypotheses?</p>

    <title>On Euclidean Steiner $(1+\epsilon)$-Spanners</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1602028800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bhore:Sujoy.html">Sujoy Bhore</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/T=oacute=th:Csaba_D=.html">Csaba D. Tóth</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02908">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Lightness and sparsity are two natural parameters for Euclidean
$(1+\epsilon)$-spanners. Classical results show that, when the dimension $d\in
\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$ are constant, every set $S$ of $n$ points in
$d$-space admits an $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners with $O(n)$ edges and weight
proportional to that of the Euclidean MST of $S$. Tight bounds on the
dependence on $\epsilon&gt;0$ for constant $d\in \mathbb{N}$ have been established
only recently. Le and Solomon (FOCS 2019) showed that Steiner points can
substantially improve the lightness and sparsity of a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner.
They gave upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-(d+1)/2})$ for the minimum
lightness in dimensions $d\geq 3$, and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-(d-1))/2})$ for
the minimum sparsity in $d$-space for all $d\geq 1$. They obtained lower bounds
only in the plane ($d=2$). Le and Solomon (ESA 2020) also constructed Steiner
$(1+\epsilon)$-spanners of lightness $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log\Delta)$ in the plane,
where $\Delta\in \Omega(\log n)$ is the \emph{spread} of $S$, defined as the
ratio between the maximum and minimum distance between a pair of points.
</p>
<p>In this work, we improve several bounds on the lightness and sparsity of
Euclidean Steiner $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners. Using a new geometric analysis, we
establish lower bounds of $\Omega(\epsilon^{-d/2})$ for the lightness and
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$ for the sparsity of such spanners in Euclidean
$d$-space for all $d\geq 2$. We use the geometric insight from our lower bound
analysis to construct Steiner $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners of lightness
$O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ for $n$ points in Euclidean plane.

    <title>Learning a mixture of two subspaces over finite fields</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1602028800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Chen:Aidao.html">Aidao Chen</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/De:Anindya.html">Anindya De</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/v/Vijayaraghavan:Aravindan.html">Aravindan Vijayaraghavan</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02841">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the problem of learning a mixture of two subspaces over
$\mathbb{F}_2^n$. The goal is to recover the individual subspaces, given
samples from a (weighted) mixture of samples drawn uniformly from the two
subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$.
</p>
<p>This problem is computationally challenging, as it captures the notorious
problem of "learning parities with noise" in the degenerate setting when $A_1
\subseteq A_0$. This is in contrast to the analogous problem over the reals
that can be solved in polynomial time (Vidal'03). This leads to the following
natural question: is Learning Parities with Noise the only computational
barrier in obtaining efficient algorithms for learning mixtures of subspaces
over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$?
</p>
<p>The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer to the above question.
Namely, we show the following results: 1. When the subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$
are incomparable, i.e., $A_0$ and $A_1$ are not contained inside each other,
then there is a polynomial time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and
$A_1$. 2. In the case when $A_1$ is a subspace of $A_0$ with a significant gap
in the dimension i.e., $dim(A_1) \le \alpha dim(A_1)$ for $\alpha&lt;1$, there is
a $n^{O(1/(1-\alpha))}$ time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and
$A_1$.
</p>
<p>Thus, our algorithms imply computational tractability of the problem of
learning mixtures of two subspaces, except in the degenerate setting captured
by learning parities with noise.

Hamiltonians, which is a family of Hamiltonians that not suffer from the sign

classes, such as BPP, BQP, MA, QMA, etc., this property remains open for StoqMA
since Bravyi, Bessen and Terhal defined this class in 2006. In this note, we
show that an error reduction for StoqMA will, perhaps surprisingly, imply that
StoqMA = MA.

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bl=auml=sius:Thomas.html">Thomas Bläsius</a>, Tobias Friedrich, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Katzmann:Maximilian.html">Maximilian Katzmann</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02787">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Finding a minimum vertex cover in a network is a fundamental NP-complete
graph problem. One way to deal with its computational hardness, is to trade the
qualitative performance of an algorithm (allowing non-optimal outputs) for an
improved running time. For the vertex cover problem, there is a gap between
theory and practice when it comes to understanding this tradeoff. On the one
hand, it is known that it is NP-hard to approximate a minimum vertex cover
within a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. On the other hand, a simple greedy algorithm
yields close to optimal approximations in practice.
</p>
<p>A promising approach towards understanding this discrepancy is to recognize
the differences between theoretical worst-case instances and real-world
networks. Following this direction, we close the gap between theory and
practice by providing an algorithm that efficiently computes close to optimal
vertex cover approximations on hyperbolic random graphs; a network model that
closely resembles real-world networks in terms of degree distribution,
clustering, and the small-world property. More precisely, our algorithm
computes a $(1 + o(1))$-approximation, asymptotically almost surely, and has a
running time of $\mathcal{O}(m \log(n))$.
</p>
<p>The proposed algorithm is an adaption of the successful greedy approach,
enhanced with a procedure that improves on parts of the graph where greedy is
not optimal. This makes it possible to introduce a parameter that can be used
to tune the tradeoff between approximation performance and running time. Our
empirical evaluation on real-world networks shows that this allows for
improving over the near-optimal results of the greedy approach.

on their private data while preserving privacy? This paper introduces
InstaHide, a simple encryption of training images, which can be plugged into
existing distributed deep learning pipelines. The encryption is efficient and
applying it during training has minor effect on test accuracy.
</p>
<p>InstaHide encrypts each training image with a "one-time secret key" which
consists of mixing a number of randomly chosen images and applying a random
pixel-wise mask. Other contributions of this paper include: (a) Using a large
public dataset (e.g. ImageNet) for mixing during its encryption, which improves
security. (b) Experimental results to show effectiveness in preserving privacy
against known attacks with only minor effects on accuracy. (c) Theoretical
analysis showing that successfully attacking privacy requires attackers to
solve a difficult computational problem. (d) Demonstrating that use of the
pixel-wise mask is important for security, since Mixup alone is shown to be
insecure to some some efficient attacks. (e) Release of a challenge dataset

described heaps with both Meld, DecreaseKey and DecreaseKey interfaces,

The paper was intended to concentrate on DecreaseKey interface, but it could be
hard to separate the two described data structures without carefull reading.

the rather easy DecreaseKey version in hopefully readable form. The paper is
intended not to require references to other papers.

number $x\in[0,1]$ using a single bit. A sender that knows $x$ chooses a value
$X\in\set{0,1}$ to transmit. In turn, a receiver estimates $x$ based on the
value of $X$. We consider both the biased and unbiased estimation problems and
aim to minimize the cost. For the biased case, the cost is the worst-case (over
the choice of $x$) expected squared error, which coincides with the variance if
the algorithm is required to be unbiased.
</p>
<p>We first overview common biased and unbiased estimation approaches and prove
their optimality when no shared randomness is allowed. We then show how a small
amount of shared randomness, which can be as low as a single bit, reduces the
cost in both cases. Specifically, we derive lower bounds on the cost attainable
by any algorithm with unrestricted use of shared randomness and propose
near-optimal solutions that use a small number of shared random bits. Finally,
we discuss open problems and future directions.

our algorithm makes $O(n^{7/4})$ queries in the matrix model and
$O(n^{3/4}m^{1/2})$ queries in the list model. Our approach combines Gabow's

<p>At that time, still the early days of online convex optimization, we were contemplating everything from adaptive gradient methods to bandit convex optimization. Blackwell’s famed approachability theorem was looming in the background, considered to be one of the strongest theorems in the ML-theorists toolkit. </p>



<p>I’ve recently added a new draft chapter to to V2.0 of <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu">Introduction to Online Convex Optimization</a>, about the connection between OCO and Blackwell approachability: they are algorithmically equivalent! More precisely, an efficient algorithm for approachability gives rise to an efficient algorithm for OCO with sublinear regret, and vice versa. </p>



<p>Details are in the chapter draft, and  I recommend this music for reading it: (the song is called “together we won despite everything”, dedicated to music and science)</p>

Thirty years ago, Laszlo Babai, Carsten Lund and myself <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01200056">showed</a> that every language in nondeterministic exponential time has proofs in this model.<div><br/></div><div>Now suppose the provers have entangled quantum bits. This question has a long history that culminates in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE paper</a> earlier this year by Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, Henry Yuen showing that every proof of any length can be proven in this model. Incredible!</div><div><br/></div><div>But wait, why is there a new version 2 dated last week? Turns out the MIP* = RE paper relied on a 2016 paper by Vidick which was later discovered to have a bug. No worries, as the authors of the MIP* = RE paper got around this issue by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">quantum analysis</a> of a low-degree test from that old Babai-Fortnow-Lund paper.</div><div><br/></div><div>Vidick's <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/">blog post</a> explains it all, including the angst of a major result falling apart temporarily. He has <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/01/babai-strikes-back.html">good</a> <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke">company</a>.

After all, only the most gifted athletes participate.  There is a self-defeating double standard at work here, nationwide.<br/>—Carl Sagan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469"><em>The Demon-Haunted World</em></a> (1996)</p></blockquote>



<p>I’d like you to feel about the <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">impending destruction</a> of Virginia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a>, the same way you might’ve felt when the Taliban threatened to blow up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan">Bamyan Buddhas</a>, and then days later actually did blow them up.  Or the way you felt when human negligence caused wildfires that incinerated half the koalas in Australia, or turned the San Francisco skyline into an orange hellscape.  For that matter, the same way most of us felt the day Trump was elected.  I’d like you to feel in the bottom of your stomach the <em>avoidability</em>, and yet the finality, of the loss.</p>



<p>For thousands of kids in the DC area, especially first- or second-generation immigrants, TJHS represented a lifeline.  Score high enough on an entrance exam—something hard but<em> totally within your control</em>—and you could attend a school where, instead of the other kids either tormenting or ignoring you, they might teach you Lisp or the surreal number system.  Where you could learn humility instead of humiliation.</p>



<p>When I visited TJHS back in 2012 to give a quantum computing talk, I toured the campus, chatted with students, fielded their questions, and thought: so <em>this</em> is the teenagerhood—the ironically <em>normal</em> teenagerhood—that I was denied by living someplace else.  I found myself wishing that a hundred more TJHS’s, large and small, would sprout up across the country.  I felt like if I could further that goal then, though the universe return to rubble, my life would’ve had a purpose.</p>



<p>Instead, of course, our sorry country is destroying the few such schools that exist.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/nyregion/specialized-schools-nyc-deblasio.html">Stuyvesant and Bronx Science</a> in New York, and the Liberal Arts and Science Academy here in Austin, are also under mortal threat right now.  The numerous parents who moved, who arranged their lives, specifically so that these schools might later be available for “high-risk” kids were suckered.</p>



<p>Assuming you haven’t just emerged from 30 years in a Tibetan cave, you presumably know why this is happening.  As the <em>Washington Post</em>‘s Jay Matthews <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/americas-top-sat-school-makes-another-disputed-attempt-at-diversity/2020/10/03/1bef3db2-0261-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F2bf01fe%2F5f78a5d19d2fda0efb3d8031%2F5974cf76ade4e21a8497eeb1%2F42%2F62%2F2b179e7390f19bdba6f66f626ab37646">explains</a>, the Fairfax County School Board is “embarrassed” to have a school that, despite all its outreach attempts, remains only 5% Black and Latino—even though, crucially, the school <em>also</em> happens to be only 19% White (it’s now ~75% Asian).</p>



<p>You might ask: so then why doesn’t TJHS just institute affirmative action, like almost every university does?  It seems there’s an extremely interesting answer: <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/04/26/is-the-no-1-high-school-in-america-thomas-jefferson-fairfax-discrimination/">they did in the 1990s</a>, and Black and Hispanic enrollment surged.  But then the verdicts of court cases, brought by right-wing groups, made the school district fear that they’d be open to lawsuits if they continued with affirmative action, so they dropped it.  Now the boomerang has returned, and the School Board has decided on a more drastic remedy: namely, to eliminate the TJHS entrance exam entirely, and replace it by a lottery for anyone whose GPA exceeds 3.5.</p>



<p>The trouble is, TJHS without an entrance exam is no longer TJHS.  More likely than not, such a place would simply converge to become another of the thousands of schools across the US where success is based on sports, networking, and popularity.  And if by some miracle it avoided that fate, <em>still</em> it would no longer be available to most of the kids who‘d most need it.</p>



<p>So yes, the district is <strong>embarrassed</strong>—note that the<em> Washington Post</em> writer explains it as if that’s the most obvious, natural reaction in the world—to host a school that’s regularly ranked #1 in the US, with the highest average SATs and a distinguished list of alumni.  To avoid this embarrassment, the solution is (in effect) to burn the school to the ground.</p>



<p>In a world-historic irony, the main effect of this “solution” will be to <strong>drastically limit the number of Asian students, while drastically <em>increasing</em> (!!!) the number of White students</strong>.  The proportion of Black and Hispanic students is projected to increase a bit but remain small.  Let me say that one more time: in practice, TJHS’s move from a standardized test to a lottery will be<strong> overwhelmingly pro-White, anti-Asian, and anti-immigrant</strong>; only as a much smaller effect will it be pro-underrepresented-minority.</p>



<p>In spite of covid and everything else going on, hundreds of students and parents have been <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">protesting in front of TJHS</a> to try to prevent the school’s tragic and pointless destruction.  But it sounds like TJHS’s fate might be sealed.  The school board tolerated excellence for 35 more years than it wanted to; now its patience is at an end.</p>



<p>Some will say: sure, the end of TJHS is unfortunate, Scott, but why do you let this stuff <em>weigh</em> on you so heavily?  This is merely another instance of friendly fire, of good people fighting the just war against racism, and in <em>one</em> case hitting a target that, yeah, OK, probably should’ve been spared.  On reflection, though, I can accept that only insofar as I accept that it was “friendly fire” when Bolsheviks targeted the kulaks, or (much more comically, less importantly, and less successfully) when Arthur Chu, Amanda Marcotte, and a thousand other woke-ists targeted me.  With friendly fire like that, who needs enemy fire?</p>



<p>If you care about the gifted Black and Hispanic kids of Fairfax County, then like me, you should demand a change in the law to allow the reinstatement of affirmative action for them.  You should acknowledge that the issue lies there and not with TJHS itself.</p>



<p>I don’t see how you reach the point of understanding all the facts and still wanting to dismantle TJHS, over the desperate pleas of the students and parents, without a decent helping of <em>resentment</em> toward the kind of student who flourishes there—without a wish to see those uppity,  “fresh off the boat” Chinese and Indian grinds get dragged down to where they belong.  And if you tell me that such magnet programs need to end even though you yourself once benefitted from them—well, isn’t that more contemptible still?  Aren’t you knowingly burning a bridge you crossed so that a younger generation can’t follow you, basically reassuring the popular crowd that if they’ll only accept <em>you</em>, then there won’t be a hundred more greasy nerds in your tow?  And if, on some level, you already know these things about yourself, then the only purpose of this post has been to remind you of them.</p>

<p>As for the news that dominates the wires and inevitably preempts what I’ve written: <strong>I wish for his successful recovery, followed by his losing the election and spending the rest of his life in New York State prison</strong>.  (And I look forward to seeing how woke Twitter summarizes the preceding statement—e.g., “Aaronson, his mask finally off, conveys well-wishes to Donald Trump”…)</p>

    <title>Open Problem - Avoiding the Union Bound for Multiple Queries</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Background:</strong> Perhaps the best-studied problem in differential privacy is answering multiple counting queries.
The standard approach is to add independent, appropriately-calibrated (Laplace or Gaussian) noise to each query result and apply a composition theorem.
To bound the maximum error over the query answers, one takes a union bound over the independent noise samples.
However, this is <em>not</em> optimal.
The problem is to identify the optimal method (up to constant factors).</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Is there a randomized algorithm \(M : \{0,1\}^{n \times k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k\) that is differentially private<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1">1</a></sup> and satisfies
\[
\forall x \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times k} \quad \mathbb{E}\left[ \left\|M(x) - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right\|_\infty \right] \leq c \sqrt{k}
\]
for some constant \( c &gt; 0\) depending only on the privacy parameters?<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Adding independent Gaussian noise to each coordinate/query yields \(c \sqrt{k \log k}\) in place of \(c \sqrt{k}\) above. 
Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>] showed that the union bound can <em>almost</em> be avoided and obtained \(c \sqrt{k \log \log k}\) using correlated noise.
The algorithm is nonetheless based on independent Gaussian noise, with the added step of using the exponential mechanism to identify high-error answers and correct them.</p>

<p>Note that a \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) lower bound is known [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3158">BUV18</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>]. By [<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~bhaskara/files/privacy.pdf">BDKT12</a>] it suffices to consider mechanisms \(M\) that add <em>instance-independent noise</em>. That is, \(M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + Z\) where \(Z\) is some fixed noise distribution over \(\mathbb{R}^k\) that is independent of \(x\).</p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> For a positive solution, an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner at a sushi restaurant of your choice.
If the solution is an efficiently-sampleable distribution with a closed-form density, alcohol will be included.
For a negative solution, alcohol only.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

A very recent work by Ganesh and Zhao [<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~arunganesh/papers/generalizedgaussians.pdf">GZ20</a>] improves the best upper bound from \(c\sqrt{k \log \log k}\) to \(c\sqrt{k \log \log \log k}\).</p>

<p><strong>The reason for answer 1 is</strong>: Since the ratio of boys/girls is 50/50, and you don’t count yourself in the answer, boys will tend to have more sisters and girls will tend to have more brothers</p>



<p><strong>The reason for answer 2 </strong>is: Some families are uneven and have more boys. In these families you will see more boys having more brothers than sisters and less girls having more brothers than sisters. Some families are uneven and have more girls. In these families you will see more girls having more sisters than brothers and less boys having more sisters than brothers. </p>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: Lifting theorems in complexity theory are a method of transferring lower bounds in a weak computational model into lower bounds for a more powerful computational model, via function composition. There has been an explosion of lifting theorems in the last ten years, essentially reducing communication lower bounds to query complexity lower bounds. These theorems only hold for composition with very specific “gadgets” such as indexing and inner product. <br/><br/> In this talk, we will present a generalization of the theorem lifting Nullstellensatz degree to monotone span program size by Pitassi and Robere (2018) so that it works for any gadget with high enough rank, in particular, for useful gadgets such as equality and greater-than. We will then explain how to apply our generalized theorem to solve three open problems: <br/>– We present the first result that demonstrates a separation in proof power for cutting planes with unbounded versus polynomially bounded coefficients. Specifically, we exhibit CNF formulas that can be refuted in quadratic length and constant line space in cutting planes with unbounded coefficients, but for which there are no refutations in subexponential length and subpolynomial line space if coefficients are restricted to be of polynomial magnitude.<br/>– We give the strongest separation to-date between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone Boolean circuits. Namely, we show that the classical GEN problem, which has polynomial-size monotone Boolean circuits, requires monotone Boolean formulas of size <img alt="2^{\Omega(n / \textrm{polylog} n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%5COmega%28n+%2F+%5Ctextrm%7Bpolylog%7D+n%29%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="2^{\Omega(n / \textrm{polylog} n)}"/>.<br/>– We give the first explicit separation between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone real formulas. Namely, we give an explicit family of functions that can be computed with monotone real formulas of nearly linear size but require monotone Boolean formulas of exponential size. Previously only a non-explicit separation was known.<br/><br/>This talk is based on joint work with Or Meir, Jakob Nordström, Toniann Pitassi, Robert Robere, and Marc Vinyals, available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02144" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02144</a> </p></div>

The obvious method, looping over nonzeros and testing the squares each might be part of, is cubic when there are many nonzeros. And there can be many nonzeros without forcing a square to exist. Is there a standard hardness assumption under which strongly subcubic is impossible?</p>
