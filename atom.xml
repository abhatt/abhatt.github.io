    <title>Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Clause for Complexity Theorists, If you Only Believe</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Guest Post by Hunter Monroe)
   

In this  guest post and <a href="https://speedupblogger.wordpress.com/2021/12/05/unifying-conjectures-on-complexity-and-noncomputability/">discussion paper</a>, I present a remarkable set of structurally similar conjectures which, if you only believe them, conjure up a dream world for theorists by asserting a new form of diagonalization based on naturally nonrelativizing facts invoking a deep linkage to underlying noncomputable languages. These conjectures, all stronger than the things to be proved, imply that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse because the arithmetic hierarchy does not collapse, and P≠NP≠coNP. The diagonalizations imply the existence of hard instances, with the result that many complexity classes have speedup, including the Π side of PH, and proof speedup for tautologies stems from proof speedup for arithmetic. These conjectures do two things: (1) let us explore a hypothetical world where many open problems about uniform complexity classes are resolved and consider steps beyond e.g. to circuit complexity, and (2) reduce numerous open questions to a single plausible claim about how Turing machines have limited information about noncomputable languages. This would potentially allow a slew of open questions to be resolved at once with a skeleton key.<p>The following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3765">conjecture</a> implying $\textbf{P!=NP}$ is remarkable: it hints at a deeper, unnoticed relationship between complexity and noncomputability; it is <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/scan10.pdf">equivalent</a> to speedup for all paddable $\textbf{coNP}$-complete languages and in proof length for tautologies; tweaked versions would separate other complexity classes; and if true it is a nonrelativizing fact.</p><p/>



Conjecture: (*) For any deterministic TM $M$ accepting the $\textbf{coNP}$-complete language ``nondeterministic TM $N$ on input $x$ does not halt within $t$ steps'' ($\texttt{coBHP}$), there exists a $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ ($N'$ does not halt on $x'$, ever) with $M$'s running time $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by any polynomial.

<p/>

If true, (*) is a nonrelativizing fact; there is no hard $\langle N, x\rangle$ for $M$ with an exponential time oracle. The noncomputable language $\texttt{coHP}$ potentially explains why (*) is true, by analogy with this trivial theorem:

<p/>


Theorem. For any $M$ accepting $\texttt{coBHP}$, there exists some non-halting $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ with $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by a constant.

<p/>


Otherwise, $M$ would accept $\texttt{coHP}$ and have too much information about a non-c.e. language; (*) is just a stronger version. In the extreme, any $M$ is completely ignorant about some $\langle N',x'\rangle$ and requires on the order of $2^t$ steps to rule out every potentially halting branch.  Tweaking (*) yields conjectures implying that $\textbf{PH}$ does not collapse:

<p/>


Conjectures: For any $M^{\Pi^p_i}$ that accepts $\Pi^p_{i+1}=\{\langle N^{\Pi^p_i},x,1^t\rangle|$ $N^{\Pi^p_i}$ does not halt on input $x$ in $t$ steps$\}$, there is a non-halting $\langle N'^{\Pi^p_i},x'\rangle\in \Pi_i$ with $M^{\Pi^p_i}$'s running time not bounded by any polynomial.

<p/>


By invoking every level $\Pi_i$ of the arithmetic hierarchy ($\textbf{AH}$), these conjectures state that the noncollapse $\textbf{PH}$ is due to the noncollapse of $\textbf{AH}$. The conjecture (*) can be calibrated depending on the desired separation to equip $M$ with an oracle or nondeterminism or constrain its resources, to choose a resource-bounded complete problem and underlying non-c.e. language, and to fine tune how hard a hard instance needs to be.

<p/>


Proof speedup for tautologies (equivalent to (*)) may stem from the proof speedup for arithmetic that occurs when adding undecidable statements as new axioms, allowing new theorems to be proved and shortening the proof of existing theorems. This literature translates any arithmetic theorem free of existential quantifiers into a tautology by replacing $k$-bit numbers with $k$ Boolean variables. The analogy with (*) suggests this stronger conjecture may in fact also be equivalent:

<p/>


Conjecture: The following two statements are equivalent: (1) there is no optimal propositional proof system; and (2) Any propositional proof system $P$ is outperformed by a sufficiently powerful conservative extension $T$ of the Peano arithmetic, and $T$ can be improved further by adding any undecidable statement in $T$ as a new axiom.

<p/>


So (*) is a Swiss army knife for generating conjectures that give us a vision of a world in which answering essentially one question would serve as a skeleton key that unlocks many open problems.</div>

    <title>Efficient Universal Quantum Compilation: An Inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev Algorithm</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1638748800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bouland:Adam.html">Adam Bouland</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Giurgica=Tiron:Tudor.html">Tudor Giurgica-Tiron</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02040">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The Solovay-Kitaev algorithm is a fundamental result in quantum computation.
It gives an algorithm for efficiently compiling arbitrary unitaries using
universal gate sets: any unitary can be approximated by short gates sequences,
whose length scales merely poly-logarithmically with accuracy. As a
consequence, the choice of gate set is typically unimportant in quantum
computing. However, the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm requires the gate set to be
inverse-closed. It has been a longstanding open question if efficient
algorithmic compilation is possible without this condition. In this work, we
provide the first inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, which makes no
assumption on the structure within a gate set beyond universality, answering
this problem in the affirmative, and providing an efficient compilation
algorithm in the absence of inverses for both $\text{SU}(d)$ and $\text{SL}(d,
\mathbb{C})$. The algorithm works by showing that approximate gate
implementations of the generalized Pauli group can self-correct their errors.

of vertices of a given size, whose removal partitions G into the maximum number
of connected components. This problem has many applications in several areas.
It has been proven to be NP-complete on general graphs, as well as on split and
planar graphs. In this paper, we enrich its complexity study with two new
results. First, we prove that it remains NP-complete even when restricted on
the class of bipartite graphs. This is unlike what it is expected, given that
the K-way vertex cut problem is a generalization of the Maximum Independent set
problem which is polynomially solvable on bipartite graphs. We also provide its
equivalence to the wellknown problem, namely the Critical Node Problem (CNP),
On split graphs. Therefore, any solving algorithm for the CNP on split graphs
is a solving algorithm for the K-way vertex cut problem and vice versa.

The $H$-Transversal problem, given a graph $G$,
asks to remove the smallest number of vertices from $G$ so that $G$ does not

exists and is believed to be tight for every $2$-vertex-connected $H$, the best

Euclidean metrics. We obtain $(1+\sqrt{3})$-approximation algorithms for both

approximation (that is known to be best-possible for general metrics). We also
study the Matroid Supplier problem on Euclidean metrics, and show that it
cannot be approximated to a factor better than $3$ (assuming $P\ne NP$); so the
Euclidean metric offers no improvement in this case.

computational task that is hard to achieve using state-of-the-art classical
systems. One approach is to perform sampling from a probability distribution
associated with a class of highly entangled many-body wavefunctions. It has
been suggested that this approach can be certified with the Linear
Cross-Entropy Benchmark (XEB). We critically examine this notion. First, in a
"benign" setting where an honest implementation of noisy quantum circuits is
assumed, we characterize the conditions under which the XEB approximates the
fidelity. Second, in an "adversarial" setting where all possible classical
algorithms are considered for comparison, we show that achieving relatively
high XEB values does not imply faithful simulation of quantum dynamics. We
present an efficient classical algorithm that, with 1 GPU within 2s, yields
high XEB values, namely 2-12% of those obtained in experiments. By identifying
and exploiting several vulnerabilities of the XEB, we achieve high XEB values
without full simulation of quantum circuits. Remarkably, our algorithm features
better scaling with the system size than noisy quantum devices for commonly
studied random circuit ensembles. To quantitatively explain the success of our
algorithm and the limitations of the XEB, we use a theoretical framework in
which the average XEB and fidelity are mapped to statistical models. We
illustrate the relation between the XEB and the fidelity for quantum circuits
in various architectures, with different gate choices, and in the presence of
noise. Our results show that XEB's utility as a proxy for fidelity hinges on
several conditions, which must be checked in the benign setting but cannot be
assumed in the adversarial setting. Thus, the XEB alone has limited utility as
a benchmark for quantum advantage. We discuss ways to overcome these
limitations.

graph $G_0$ is a graph obtained by replacing each vertex by $\ell$ copies, and
each edge by a matching corresponding to the action of an element of $H$.
</p>
<p>In this work, we show the following explicit constructions of expanders
obtained via abelian lifts. For every (transitive) abelian group $H \leqslant
\text{Sym}(\ell)$, constant degree $d \ge 3$ and $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we construct
explicit $d$-regular expander graphs $G$ obtained from an $(H,\ell)$-lift of a
(suitable) base $n$-vertex expander $G_0$ with the following parameters:
</p>
<p>(i) $\lambda(G) \le 2\sqrt{d-1} + \epsilon$, for any lift size $\ell \le
2^{n^{\delta}}$ where $\delta=\delta(d,\epsilon)$,
</p>
<p>(ii) $\lambda(G) \le \epsilon \cdot d$, for any lift size $\ell \le
2^{n^{\delta_0}}$ for a fixed $\delta_0 &gt; 0$, when $d \ge d_0(\epsilon)$, or
</p>
<p>(iii) $\lambda(G) \le \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$, for lift size ``exactly''
$\ell = 2^{\Theta(n)}$.
</p>
<p>As corollaries, we obtain explicit quantum lifted product codes of Panteleev
and Kalachev of almost linear distance (and also in a wide range of parameters)
and explicit classical quasi-cyclic LDPC codes with wide range of circulant
sizes.
</p>
<p>Items $(i)$ and $(ii)$ above are obtained by extending the techniques of
Mohanty, O'Donnell and Paredes [STOC 2020] for $2$-lifts to much larger abelian
lift sizes (as a byproduct simplifying their construction). This is done by
providing a new encoding of special walks arising in the trace power method,
carefully "compressing'" depth-first search traversals. Result $(iii)$ is via a
simpler proof of Agarwal et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math 2019] at the expense of
polylog factors in the expansion.

    <title>Online Search With Best-Price and Query-Based Predictions</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Spyros Angelopoulos, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kamali:Shahin.html">Shahin Kamali</a>, Dehou Zhang <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.01592">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the online (time-series) search problem, a player is presented with a
sequence of prices which are revealed in an online manner. In the standard
definition of the problem, for each revealed price, the player must decide
irrevocably whether to accept or reject it, without knowledge of future prices
(other than an upper and a lower bound on their extreme values), and the
objective is to minimize the competitive ratio, namely the worst-case ratio
between the maximum price in the sequence and the one selected by the player.
The problem formulates several applications of decision-making in the face of
uncertainty on the revealed samples.
</p>
<p>Previous work on this problem has largely assumed extreme scenarios in which
either the player has almost no information about the input, or the player is
provided with some powerful, and error-free advice. In this work, we study
learning-augmented algorithms, in which there is a potentially erroneous
prediction concerning the input. Specifically, we consider two different
settings: the setting in which the prediction is related to the maximum price
in the sequence, as well as the setting in which the prediction is obtained as
a response to a number of binary queries. For both settings, we provide tight,
or near-tight upper and lower bounds on the worst-case performance of search
algorithms as a function of the prediction error. We also provide experimental
results on data obtained from stock exchange markets that confirm the
theoretical analysis, and explain how our techniques can be applicable to other
learning-augmented applications.

often used to optimize node-link representations of graphs to enable the
comprehension of the underlying data. With few exceptions, graph drawing
algorithms typically optimize one such criterion, usually at the expense of
others. We propose a layout approach, Multicriteria Scalable Graph Drawing via
Stochastic Gradient Descent, $(SGD)^2$, that can handle multiple readability
criteria. $(SGD)^2$ can optimize any criterion that can be described by a
differentiable function. Our approach is flexible and can be used to optimize
several criteria that have already been considered earlier (e.g., obtaining
ideal edge lengths, stress, neighborhood preservation) as well as other
criteria which have not yet been explicitly optimized in such fashion (e.g.,
node resolution, angular resolution, aspect ratio). The approach is scalable
and can handle large graphs. A variation of the underlying approach can also be
used to optimize many desirable properties in planar graphs, while maintaining
planarity. Finally, we provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the
effectiveness of $(SGD)^2$: we analyze the interactions between criteria,
measure the quality of layouts generated from $(SGD)^2$ as well as the runtime
behavior, and analyze the impact of sample sizes. The source code is available
on github and we also provide an interactive demo for small graphs.

    <title>TR21-174 |  Sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating von Neumann entropy | 

	Sathyawageeswar Subramanian, 

	Tom Gur, 

	Min-Hsiu Hsieh</title>
    <summary>Entropy is a fundamental property of both classical and quantum systems, spanning myriad theoretical and practical applications in physics and computer science. We study the problem of obtaining estimates to within a multiplicative factor $\gamma&gt;1$ of the Shannon entropy of probability distributions and the von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum states. Our main results are:

       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the Shannon entropy $H(\mathbf{p})$ of a classical probability distribution $\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\ldots,p_n)$;
       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac12+\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ of a density matrix $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$.

    In both cases, the input is assumed to have entropy bounded away from zero by a quantity determined by the parameter $\eta&gt;0$, since, as we prove, no polynomial query algorithm can multiplicatively approximate the entropy of distributions with arbitrarily low entropy. In addition, we provide $\Omega\left(n^{\frac{1}{3\gamma^2}}\right)$ lower bounds on the query complexity of $\gamma$-multiplicative estimation of Shannon and von Neumann entropies.

    We work with the quantum purified query access model, which can handle both classical probability distributions and mixed quantum states, and is the most general input model considered in the literature.</summary>

    <title>TR21-173 |  On the Structure of Learnability beyond P/poly | 

	Ninad Rajgopal, 

	Rahul Santhanam</title>
    <summary>Motivated by the goal of showing stronger structural results about the complexity of learning, we study the learnability of strong concept classes beyond P/poly, such as PSPACE/poly and EXP/poly. We show the following:


1. (Unconditional Lower Bounds for Learning)  Building on [KKO13], we prove unconditionally that BPE/poly cannot be weakly learned in polynomial time over the uniform distribution, even with membership and equivalence queries.

2. (Robustness of Learning) For the concept classes EXP/poly and PSPACE/poly, we show unconditionally that worst-case and average-case learning are equivalent, that PAC-learnability and learnability over the uniform distribution are equivalent, and that membership queries do not help in either case.

3. (Reducing Succinct Search to Decision for Learning) For the decision problems $R_{Kt}$ and $R_{KS}$ capturing the complexity of learning EXP/poly and PSPACE/poly respectively, we show a succinct search to decision reduction: for each of these problems, the problem is in BPP iff there is a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm computing circuits encoding proofs for positive instances of the problem. This is shown via a more general result giving succinct search to decision results for PSPACE, EXP and NEXP, which might be of independent interest. 

4. (Implausibility of Oblivious Strongly Black-Box Reductions showing NP-hardness of learning NP/poly) We define a natural notion of hardness of learning with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions. We show that learning PSPACE/poly is PSPACE-hard with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions. On the other hand, if learning NP/poly is NP-hard with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions, the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.</summary>

    <title>TR21-172 |  Ideals, Determinants, and Straightening: Proving and Using Lower Bounds for Polynomial Ideals | 

	Robert Andrews, 

	Michael Forbes</title>
    <summary>We show that any nonzero polynomial in the ideal generated by the $r \times r$ minors of an $n \times n$ matrix $X$ can be used to efficiently approximate the determinant. Specifically, for any nonzero polynomial $f$ in this ideal, we construct a small depth-three $f$-oracle circuit that approximates the $\Theta(r^{1/3}) \times \Theta(r^{1/3})$ determinant in the sense of border complexity. For many classes of algebraic circuits, this implies that every nonzero polynomial in the ideal generated by $r \times r$ minors is at least as hard to approximately compute as the $\Theta(r^{1/3}) \times \Theta(r^{1/3})$ determinant. We also prove an analogous result for the Pfaffian of a $2n \times 2n$ skew-symmetric matrix and the ideal generated by Pfaffians of $2r \times 2r$ principal submatrices.

This answers a recent question of Grochow about complexity in polynomial ideals in the setting of border complexity. Leveraging connections between the complexity of polynomial ideals and other questions in algebraic complexity, our results provide a generic recipe that allows lower bounds for the determinant to be applied to other problems in algebraic complexity. We give several such applications, two of which are highlighted below.
	
$\bullet$ We prove new lower bounds for the Ideal Proof System of Grochow and Pitassi. Specifically, we give super-polynomial lower bounds for refutations computed by low-depth circuits. This extends the recent breakthrough low-depth circuit lower bounds of Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas to the setting of proof complexity. Moreover, we show that for many natural circuit classes, the approximative proof complexity of our hard instance is governed by the approximative circuit complexity of the determinant.

$\bullet$ We construct new hitting set generators for the closure of low-depth circuits. For any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we construct generators with seed length $O(n^\varepsilon)$ that hit $n$-variate low-depth circuits. Our generators attain a near-optimal tradeoff between their seed length and degree, and are computable by low-depth circuits of near-linear size (with respect to the size of their output). This matches the seed length of the generators recently obtained by Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas, but improves on the degree and circuit complexity of the generator.</summary>

The journey leading to the establishment of this new journal has been long and the fact that this path eventually reached its destination is due to the sterling efforts and foresight of a number of people within our community. The seeds of TheoretiCS were sown within the Council of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science during my two terms as president of that association. At that time, <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/jos-baeten" target="_blank">Jos Baeten</a> and <a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/kucera/">Antonin Kucera</a> worked hard to try and set up an open-access journal of the association. That journal never saw the light of day, but the process that eventually led to TheoretiCS was afoot. After some time, <a href="https://ls1-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/en/kontakt-thomas-schwentick" target="_blank">Thomas Schwentick</a> took the baton in the relay race and took decisive steps in turning the establishment of this new journal into a true community effort. It is fair to say that the launch of this journal has involved an unprecedented level of cooperation amongst <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/advisory-board" target="_blank">representatives of leading conferences from across the entire Theoretical Computer Science community</a>. I am immensely grateful to everyone who participated in that work for the effort they put into making TheoretiCS a reality and apologise for not mentioning all the colleagues who contributed explicitly in this post.   You can find more information on TheoretiCS in the text below, which I received from Jos Baeten, founding member-at-large of the Advisory Board of the Theoretics Foundation. </p><p>So, what can you do to support this new journal? There are at least two things that each of us can do and that I believe are important. </p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Help TheoretiCS reach its quality objectives by submitting your best work to it and by encouraging your colleagues to do so too. TheoretiCS aims at publishing articles of a very high quality, and at becoming a reference journal on par with the leading journals in the area. To be accepted, a paper must make a significant contribution of lasting value to a relevant area of TCS, and its presentation must be of high quality. This is elaborated upon in the guiding principles spelled out below. I let you reach your own conclusions about the quality and the breadth of the <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/editorial-board" target="_blank">editorial board of TheoretiCS</a>, which is stellar IMHO. <br/></li><li>Spread the news of the launch of TheoretiCS within your networks. Despite its many years of existence and the role it plays within our community, I still meet colleagues (even in Theoretical Computer Science) who do not know that <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics" target="_blank">LIPIcs</a> exists and who claim that publishing conference proceedings with commercial publishers is a sign of scientific quality. </li></ol><p>If you happen to be in a position to do so, you can support the <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/theoretics-foundation" target="_blank">TheoretiCS foundation</a>, which is a German not-for-profit organization, by making a donation. </p><p/><p>I look forward to seeing the developments of TheoretiCS. Even though predicting the future is difficult, I have no doubt that the journal will become a coveted outlet, with the help of the community it aims to serve. Welcome to TheoretiCS and good luck!</p><p/><p><br/>=== Additional information about the journal ===<br/><br/>---  Guiding principles and objectives  ---<br/><br/>- We believe that our field (and science in general) needs more 'virtuous' open-access journals, a whole eco-system of them, with various levels of specialization and of selectivity. We also believe that, along with the structuring role played by conferences in theoretical computer science, we collectively need to re-develop the practice of journal publications.<br/><br/>- The scope of TheoretiCS is the whole of Theoretical Computer Science, understood in an inclusive meaning (concretely: including, but not restricted to, the Theory of Computing and the Theory of Programming; or equivalently, the so-called TCS-A and TCS-B, reminiscent of Jan van Leeuwen's Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science).<br/><br/>- Our aim is to rapidly become a reference journal and to contribute to the unity of the Theoretical Computer Science global community. In particular, we will seek to publish only papers that make a very significant contribution to their respective fields, that strive to be accessible to a wider audience within theoretical computer science, and that are, generally, of a quality on par with the very best journals in the field.<br/><br/>- TheoretiCS adheres to the principles of 'virtuous' open-access: there is no charge to read the journal, nor to publish in it. The copyright of the papers remains with the authors, under a Creative Commons license.<br/><br/><br/>---  Editorial Board  ---<br/><br/>The inaugural Editors-in-Chief are Javier Esparza (TU München) and Uri Zwick (Tel Aviv U.). The entire Editorial Board can be seen at <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">https://theoretics-journal.org</a> (see below as well).<br/><br/><br/>---  Organization and a bit of history  ---<br/><br/>The project built on groundwork laid in the Council of the EATCS, and started in 2019 and underwent a long gestation. From the start, we wanted to have a thorough discussion with a wide representation of the community, on how to best implement the guiding principles sketched above. It was deemed essential to make sure that all fields of theoretical computer science would feel at home in this journal, and that it would be recognized as a valid venue for publication all over the world.<br/><br/>This resulted in the creation of an Advisory Board, composed of representatives of most of the main conferences in the field (currently APPROX, CCC, COLT, CONCUR, CSL, FOCS, FoSSaCS, FSCD, FSTTCS, ICALP, ICDT, ITCS, LICS, MFCS, PODC, SoCG, SODA, STACS, STOC, TCC) and of so-called members-at-large. The composition of this Advisory Board, which may still evolve, can be consulted at <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">https://theoretics-journal.org</a>.<br/><br/><br/>---  Logistics and answers to some natural questions  ---<br/><br/>- The journal is published by the TheoretiCS Foundation, a non-profit foundation established under German law. <br/><br/>- TheoretiCS is based on the platform episciences.org, in the spirit of a so-called overlay journal.<br/><br/>- The Advisory Board, together with the Editors-in-Chief and the Managing Editors, devolved much of their efforts to designing and implementing an efficient 2-phase review system: efficient in terms of the added-value it brings to the published papers and their authors, and of the time it takes. Yet, as this review system relies in an essential fashion on the work and expertise of colleagues (like in all classical reputable journals), we cannot guarantee a fixed duration for the evaluation of the papers submitted to TheoretiCS.<br/><br/>- Being charge-free for authors and readers does not mean that there is no cost to publishing a journal. These costs are supported for the foreseeable future by academic institutions (at the moment, CNRS and Inria, in France; others may join).<br/><br/>- The journal will have an ISSN, and each paper will have a DOI. There will be no print edition.<br/><br/><br/>---  Editorial Board  ---<br/><br/>Editors-in-Chief<br/><br/>    Javier Esparza (Technische Universität München, Munich)<br/>    Uri Zwick (Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv)<br/><br/>Managing  Editors<br/><br/>    Antoine Amarilli (Institut polytechnique de Paris, Télécom Paris)<br/>    Nathanaël Fijalkow (CNRS, Bordeaux, and The Alan Turing Institute of Data Science, London)<br/><br/>Editors<br/><br/>    Martin Abadi, Google, USA<br/>    Andris Ambainis, U. of Latvia<br/>    Albert Atserias, UPC, Barcelona<br/>    Haris Aziz, UNSW, Sydney<br/>    David Basin, ETH Zürich<br/>    Patricia Bouyer, CNRS, Paris-Saclay<br/>    Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Università di Milano<br/>    Anuj Dawar, Cambridge University<br/>    Luc Devroye,  McGill University, Montreal<br/>    Jacob Fox, Stanford University<br/>    Mohsen Ghaffari, ETH Zürich<br/>    Georg Gottlob, Oxford University<br/>    Anupam Gupta, Carnegie-Mellon University<br/>    Venkatesan Guruswami, Carnegie-Mellon University<br/>    Johan Håstad, KTH, Stockholm<br/>    Ravi Kannan, Microsoft Research India, Bengaluru<br/>    Anna Karlin, University of Washington, Seattle<br/>    Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo<br/>    Valerie King, University of Victoria<br/>    Robert Kleinberg, Cornell University<br/>    Naoki Kobayashi, University of Tokyo<br/>    Elias Koutsoupias, Oxford University<br/>    Xavier Leroy, Collège de France, Paris<br/>    Katrina Ligett, Hebrew University, Jerusalem<br/>    Rupak Majumdar, MPI-SWS, Kaiserslautern<br/>    Joseph Mitchell, State University of New York at Stony Brook<br/>    Mehryar Mohri, Google and New York University<br/>    David Mount, University of Maryland<br/>    Anca Muscholl, Université de Bordeaux<br/>    Danupon Nanongkai, University of Copenhagen<br/>    Moni Naor, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot<br/>    Catuscia Palamidessi, Inria, Palaiseau<br/>    Michał Pilipczuk, University of Warsaw<br/>    Jean-Francois Raskin, Université Libre de Bruxelles<br/>    Peter Sanders, KIT, Karlsruhe<br/>    Davide Sangiorgi, Università di Bologna<br/>    Nitin Saxena, IIT Kanpur<br/>    Alistair Sinclair, UC Berkeley<br/>    Ola Svensson, EPF Lausanne<br/>    Gregory Valiant, Stanford University<br/>    Stephanie Weirich, University of Pennsylvania<br/>    Virginia V.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This is a blog post written by me (Boaz) with Edith Cohen. It is cross posted on <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">Scott Aaronson’s blog</a>. See also <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1466799615349608452?s=20">a thread on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>See also the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a>, and <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">fuller analysis</a> of the CMF proposed revisions.</p>



<p>Mathematical education at the K-12 level is critical for preparation for STEM careers. An ongoing challenge to the US K-12 system is to improve the preparation of students for advanced mathematics courses and expand access and enrollment in these courses. As stated by a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/stem/algebra/index.html#WHYALGEBRAI">Department of Education report</a> <strong><em>“taking Algebra I before high school … can set students up for a strong foundation of STEM education and open the door for various college and career options.”</em></strong> The report states that while 80% of all students have access to Algebra I in middle school, only 24% enroll. This is also why the goal of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Bob Moses’ Algebra Project</a> is to ensure that <strong>“every child must master algebra, preferably by eighth grade, for algebra is the gateway to the college-prep curriculum, which in turn is the path to higher education.” </strong></p>



<p>The most significant potential for growth is among African American or Latino students, among whom only 12% enroll in Algebra before high school. This untapped potential has longer-term implications for both society and individuals. For example, although African Americans and Latinos comprise 13% and 18% (respectively) of the overall US population, they only account for 4% and 11% of <a href="https://ira.asee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2018-Engineering-by-Numbers-Engineering-Statistics-UPDATED-15-July-2019.pdf">engineering degrees</a>. There is also a gap in access by income: Calculus is <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/unequal-access-calculus-could-hinder-low-income-and-black-students">offered</a> in 92% of schools serving the top income quartile but only in 77% of schools serving the bottom quartile (as measured by the share of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch). Thus minority and low income students have less access to STEM jobs, which yield <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/stem-employment.htm">more than double the median salary</a> of non-STEM jobs, and are projected to grow at a 50% higher rate over the next decade.</p>



<p>Given these disparities, we applaud efforts such as the <a href="https://algebra.org/wp/">Algebra Project</a>, the <a href="http://thecalculusproject.org/">Calculus Project</a>, and <a href="https://www.beammath.org">Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics</a> that increase access to advanced mathematical education to underserved students (in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Bob Moses’ words</a> <strong><em>“raise the floor”</em></strong>). However, we are concerned by recent approaches, such as the proposed <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">California Math Framework</a> (CMF) revisions,  that take the opposite direction.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">this document for a detailed analysis and critique of the CMF</a>, but the bottom line is that rather than trying to elevate under-served students, <strong>such “reforms” reduce access and options for all students</strong>. In particular, the CMF encourages schools to stop offering Algebra I in middle school, while placing obstacles (such as doubling-up, compressed courses, or outside-of-school private courses) in the way of those who want to take advanced math in higher grades. When similar reforms were implemented in San Francisco, they <a href="https://edsource.org/2021/one-districts-faulty-data-shouldnt-drive-californias-math-policy/663374">resulted</a> in an <strong><em>“inequitable patchwork scheme”</em></strong> of workarounds that affluent students could access but that their less privileged counterparts could not. The CMF also promotes<strong> trendy and shallow courses</strong> (such as a nearly math-free version of  “data science”) as recommended alternatives  to<strong> foundational mathematical courses</strong> such as Algebra and Calculus. These courses do not prepare students <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">even for careers in data science itself</a>!</p>



<p>As educators and practitioners, we have seen first-hand the value of solid foundations in mathematics for pursuing college-level STEM education and a productive STEM career. </p>



<p>While well-intentioned, <strong>we believe that many of the changes proposed by the CMF are deeply misguided and will disproportionately harm under-resourced students</strong>. Adopting them would result in a student population that is less prepared to succeed in STEM and other 4-year quantitative degrees in college.  The CMF <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter7.docx">states</a> that <strong><em>“many students, parents, and teachers encourage acceleration beginning in grade eight (or sooner) because of mistaken beliefs that Calculus is an important high school goal.”</em></strong> Students, parents, and teachers <strong><em>are not mistaken</em></strong>. Neither is the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), which set in 2015 a goal to double the number of African American students taking calculus by 2025. Calculus is not the only goal of K-12 math education, but it <em>is</em> important for students who wish to prepare for STEM in college and beyond. </p>



<p>We agree that calculus is not the “be-all and end-all” of high-school mathematics education. In particular, we encourage introducing options such as logic, probability, discrete mathematics, and algorithms design in the K-12 curriculum, as they can be valuable foundations for STEM education in college. However, when taught beyond a superficial level (which unfortunately is <em>not</em> the case in the CMF “data science” <a href="https://hsdatascience.youcubed.org/">proposals</a>), these topics are not any easier  than calculus. They require the same foundations of logic, algebra, and functions, and fluency with numbers and calculations. Indeed, the career paths with the highest potential for growth require <a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/the-era-of-the-mathematician-has-arrived-39ec20b24aa6">more and deeper mathematical preparation</a> than ever before. Calculus and other mathematical foundations are not important because they are admission requirements for colleges, or because they are relics of the <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/math-curriculum/">“Sputnik era”</a>. They are important because they provide fundamental knowledge and ways of thinking that are necessary for success in these fast growing and in-demand fields.</p>



<p>We also fully support incorporating introductory data analysis and coding skills in the K-12 curriculum (and there are some <a href="https://coursekata.org/">good</a> <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ap/2022/">approaches</a> for doing so).  But we strongly disagree with marketing such skills as replacing foundational skills in algebra and calculus when preparing for 4-year college degrees in STEM and other quantitative fields. These topics are important and build on basic math foundations but are not a replacement for such foundations any more than social media skills can replace reading and writing foundations. </p>



<p>Given the above, we, together with <strong>more than 150 scientists, educators, and practitioners in STEM</strong>, have signed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home"><strong>open letter expressing our concerns with such trends</strong></a>. The signatories include STEM faculty in public and private universities and practitioners from industry. They include educators with decades of experience teaching students at all levels, as well as researchers that won the highest awards in their fields, including the Fields Medal, the Nobel Prize, and the Turing Award. Signers also include people vested in mathematical high-school education, such as Adrian Mims (founder of <a href="http://thecalculusproject.org/">The Calculus Project</a>) and Jelani Nelson (UC Berkeley EECS professor and founder of <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a>) who have spearheaded projects to increase access to underserved populations.</p>



<p>We encourage you to read the letter, and if you are a US-based STEM professional or educator, consider signing it as well: <a href="https://bit.ly/mathedletter">https://bit.ly/mathedletter</a><br/></p>



<p>Unfortunately, in recent years, debates on US education have become politicized. The letter is not affiliated with any political organization, and we believe that the issues we highlight transcend current political debates. After all, expanding access to mathematical education is both socially just and economically wise.</p>

<p>Today, I’m turning over <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> to an extremely important guest post by theoretical computer scientists <a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/">Boaz Barak</a> of Harvard and <a href="http://www.cohenwang.com/edith/">Edith Cohen</a> of Google (<a href="https://windowsontheory.org/?p=8232">cross-posted</a> on the <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/">windows on theory</a> blog).  In addition to the post below, please read—and if relevant, consider signing—our <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home"><strong>open letter</strong></a> about math education in the US, which now has over <s>150</s> <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">now 535</span></strong> signatories, including Fields Medalists, Turing Award winners, and Nobel laureates.  Finally, check out our <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">fuller analysis</a> of what the California Mathematics Framework is poised to do and why it’s such an urgent crisis for math education.  I’m particularly grateful to my colleagues for their writing efforts, since I would never have been able to discuss what’s happening in such relatively measured words. <em>–Scott Aaronson</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Mathematical education at the K-12 level is critical for preparation for STEM careers. An ongoing challenge to the US K-12 system is to improve the preparation of students for advanced mathematics courses and expand access and enrollment in these courses. As stated by a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/stem/algebra/index.html#WHYALGEBRAI">Department of Education report</a> <strong><em>“taking Algebra I before high school … can set students up for a strong foundation of STEM education and open the door for various college and career options.”</em></strong> The report states that while 80% of all students have access to Algebra I in middle school, only 24% enroll. This is also why the goal of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Bob Moses’ Algebra Project</a> is to ensure that <strong>“every child must master algebra, preferably by eighth grade, for algebra is the gateway to the college-prep curriculum, which in turn is the path to higher education.”</strong></p>



<p>The most significant potential for growth is among African American or Latino students, among whom only 12% enroll in Algebra before high school. This untapped potential has longer-term implications for both society and individuals. For example, although African Americans and Latinos comprise 13% and 18% (respectively) of the overall US population, they only account for 4% and 11% of <a href="https://ira.asee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2018-Engineering-by-Numbers-Engineering-Statistics-UPDATED-15-July-2019.pdf">engineering degrees</a>. There is also a gap in access by income: Calculus is <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/unequal-access-calculus-could-hinder-low-income-and-black-students">offered</a> in 92% of schools serving the top income quartile but only in 77% of schools serving the bottom quartile (as measured by the share of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch). Thus minority and low income students have less access to STEM jobs, which yield <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/stem-employment.htm">more than double the median salary</a> of non-STEM jobs, and are projected to grow at a 50% higher rate over the next decade.</p>



<p>Given these disparities, we applaud efforts such as the <a href="https://algebra.org/wp/">Algebra Project</a>, the <a href="http://thecalculusproject.org/">Calculus Project</a>, and <a href="https://www.beammath.org">Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics</a> that increase access to advanced mathematical education to underserved students. However, we are concerned by recent approaches, such as the proposed <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">California Math Framework</a> (CMF) revisions,  that take the opposite direction.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">this document for a detailed analysis and critique of the CMF</a>, but the bottom line is that rather than trying to elevate under-served students, <strong>such “reforms” reduce access and options for all students</strong>. In particular, the CMF encourages schools to stop offering Algebra I in middle school, while placing obstacles (such as doubling-up, compressed courses, or outside-of-school private courses) in the way of those who want to take advanced math in higher grades. When similar reforms were implemented in San Francisco, they <a href="https://edsource.org/2021/one-districts-faulty-data-shouldnt-drive-californias-math-policy/663374">resulted</a> in an <strong><em>“inequitable patchwork scheme”</em></strong> of workarounds that affluent students could access but that their less privileged counterparts could not. The CMF also promotes<strong> trendy and shallow courses</strong> (such as a nearly math-free version of  “data science”) as recommended alternatives  to<strong> foundational mathematical courses</strong> such as Algebra and Calculus. These courses do not prepare students <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">even for careers in data science itself</a>!</p>



<p>As educators and practitioners, we have seen first-hand the value of solid foundations in mathematics for pursuing college-level STEM education and a productive STEM career. </p>



<p>While well-intentioned, <strong>we believe that many of the changes proposed by the CMF are deeply misguided and will disproportionately harm under-resourced students</strong>. Adopting them would result in a student population that is less prepared to succeed in STEM and other 4-year quantitative degrees in college.  The CMF <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter7.docx">states</a> that <strong><em>“many students, parents, and teachers encourage acceleration beginning in grade eight (or sooner) because of mistaken beliefs that Calculus is an important high school goal.”</em></strong> Students, parents, and teachers <strong><em>are not mistaken</em></strong>. Neither is the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), which set in 2015 a goal to double the number of African American students taking calculus by 2025. Calculus is not the only goal of K-12 math education, but it <em>is</em> important for students who wish to prepare for STEM in college and beyond. </p>



<p>We agree that calculus is not the “be-all and end-all” of high-school mathematics education. In particular, we encourage introducing options such as logic, probability, discrete mathematics, and algorithms design in the K-12 curriculum, as they can be valuable foundations for STEM education in college. However, when taught beyond a superficial level (which unfortunately is <em>not</em> the case in the CMF “data science” <a href="https://hsdatascience.youcubed.org/">proposals</a>), these topics are not any easier  than calculus. They require the same foundations of logic, algebra, and functions, and fluency with numbers and calculations. Indeed, the career paths with the highest potential for growth require <a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/the-era-of-the-mathematician-has-arrived-39ec20b24aa6">more and deeper mathematical preparation</a> than ever before. Calculus and other mathematical foundations are not important because they are admission requirements for colleges, or because they are relics of the <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/math-curriculum/">“Sputnik era”</a>. They are important because they provide fundamental knowledge and ways of thinking that are necessary for success in these fast growing and in-demand fields.</p>



<p>We also fully support incorporating introductory data analysis and coding skills in the K-12 curriculum (and there are some <a href="https://coursekata.org/">good</a> <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ap/2022/">approaches</a> for doing so).  But we strongly disagree with marketing such skills as replacing foundational skills in algebra and calculus when preparing for 4-year college degrees in STEM and other quantitative fields. These topics are important and build on basic math foundations but are not a replacement for such foundations any more than social media skills can replace reading and writing foundations. </p>



<p>Given the above, we, together with <strong>more than 150 scientists, educators, and practitioners in STEM</strong>, have signed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home"><strong>open letter expressing our concerns with such trends</strong></a>. The signatories include STEM faculty in public and private universities and practitioners from industry. They include educators with decades of experience teaching students at all levels, as well as researchers that won the highest awards in their fields, including the Fields Medal and the Turing Award. Signers also include people vested in mathematical high-school education, such as Adrian Mims (founder of <a href="http://thecalculusproject.org/">The Calculus Project</a>) and Jelani Nelson (UC Berkeley EECS professor and founder of <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a>) who have spearheaded projects to increase access to underserved populations.</p>



<p>We encourage you to read the letter, and if you are a US-based STEM professional or educator, consider signing it as well: <a href="https://bit.ly/mathedletter">https://bit.ly/mathedletter</a></p>



<p>Unfortunately, in recent years, debates on US education have become politicized. The letter is not affiliated with any political organization, and we believe that the issues we highlight transcend current political debates. After all, expanding access to mathematical education is both socially just and economically wise.</p>

    <title>Editing a Classifier</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a class="bbutton" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01008" style="float: left; width: 45%;">

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01008">recent work</a>, we develop a framework for modifying the
behavior of a classifier by directly rewriting its internal prediction rules.
This allows a model designer to adapt the model to new setting or remove
specific spurious correlations with virtually no additional data collection or
further model training. </i></p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Modern machine learning classifiers work because they are able to extract
predictive correlations from large, relatively uncurated datasets. However, as
has been pointed out
<a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/torralba/research/bias/">re</a>-<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04975">pea</a>-<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06707">te</a>-<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">dly</a>,
many of these correlations are spurious or context-specific. That is, while
they are predictive on the training dataset, they need not necessarily be
predictive in the real-world settings where we wish to deploy our models. For
instance, a useful example to keep in mind throughout this post is that of
“cars on snow”: if a model relies on the presence of “road” to recognize a car
(because most cars in the training set are on the road) it might have trouble
recognizing cars when they drive through snow.</p>

<p>So, what can we do about that?</p>

<h2 id="editing-classifiers-setting-up-the-problem">Editing classifiers: Setting up the problem</h2>
<p>A natural idea is to modify the model after training, but how exactly would we
do that? The canonical method for modifying such a “buggy” ML model once it
has been trained is to collect additional data that captures the classifier’s
intended behavior and then use that data to fine-tune the model. However,
collecting such data might be tricky and/or expensive. More importantly, this
is an <em>indirect</em> process, i.e., we are specifying model behavior only through
training examples—which is what gave rise to undesired correlations in the
first place.</p>

<p>In order to develop a more reliable process, we want to allow a model designer
to <em>directly</em> edit model’s “inner mechanics”. In other words, we want the
designer to be able to specify <em>how</em> a model should predict on broad families
of inputs (and not just what it should predict on a specific, fixed set of
training inputs).</p>

<p>Conceptually, we can think of the model as operating based on some <em>prediction
rules</em>. For instance, “if grass is present, then this is likely an image of a
cow” or “if a wheel is present, this is likely an image of a car”. From that
perspective, our goal is to enable the designer to interact with these rules
and rewrite how these <em>concepts</em> (e.g., “car”, “wheel”) are associated with
each other. Crucially, we need for such rewrites to <em>generalize</em>, i.e., if one
modifies how the concept “wheel” is perceived by the model, then this
modification should apply to all instances containing a wheel.</p>

<h2 id="a-concrete-editing-methodology">A concrete editing methodology</h2>
<p>So, how do we turn this conceptual framework into an actual tool? Our
method—which we will describe now—builds on the recent work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15646">Bau et al.
2020</a> that developed a method for editing
generative models.</p>

<p><strong>Concepts as vectors.</strong> Our point of start is figuring out  a way to capture
high-level concepts via concrete objects that  we can manipulate. The object of
choice is latent vectors. Indeed, as it turns out, it is possible to find directions in
the latent representation of the model that capture different visual concepts (e.g.,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11279">TCAV</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05796">Network
Dissection</a>). Moreover, as Bau et al. found,
it is possible to find such directions based only on a few images. This can be
done by simply selecting the pixels corresponding to the desired concept and
then aggregating the latent representations of these pixels via PCA.</p>

<p><strong>Layers as associative memory.</strong> Next, we want to develop a way to modify how
the classifier processes these high-level concepts (captured by vectors). For
this, we view each layer of the network as a linear associative memory: i.e., a
mapping of each latent vector in its input (the key) to another latent vector in its
output—the value. From that perspective, if we have a vector $k$ capturing some
high-level concept in the latent representation space <em>before</em> some layer $L$,
and a vector $v$ capturing another concept <em>after</em> $L$, then we can modify the
weights $W$ of that layer to map one concept to another, i.e., have that</p>

\[v \simeq Wk.\]

<p>Importantly, to ensure that this update does not affect how other concepts are
being processed, we restrict it to only a rank-one change in the weights W. You
can find a more detailed description in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15646">original
paper</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rewriting classifiers.</strong> With these primitives in place, we can focus our
attention on editing classifiers. How would we modify a model to recognize cars
on snow as it would if they were on the road? At a high-level, we need to
ensure that the model treats the concept of “snow” the same way it treats the
concept of “road”. To this end, we start from a picture of a car (on a road),
manually annotate the part that depicts “road”, and then replace this part by
copy-pasting a snow texture on it.</p>

<p>Now, fixing any layer $L$, we use the selected pixels to compute a “snow” vector
$k$ <em>before</em> that layer and a “road” vector $v$ <em>after</em> that layer. Then, in order
to perform our edit we simply update the weights of that layer so that it
(approximately) maps the vector $k$ to the vector $v$. And that’s it! We can leave
the rest of the model as-is, since the snowy part of the image will be
processed as if it depicted a road.</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/pipeline.png" style="width: 80%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong> Editing methodology.</strong> We modify a
layer of the classifier so that the concept "snow" before the layer gets mapped
to "road" after the layer using a single synthetic example.</div>

<h2 id="does-editing-work">Does editing work?</h2>

<p>Let’s now try to apply this methodology to a couple of real world test cases.
In both cases, we will perform these updates based on a <em>single</em> exemplar that
we manually modified.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1: Vehicles on snow.</strong> We start with our running example of
vehicles-on-snow. For that, we form a test set through searching
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> for images of “&lt;vehicle&gt; on snow” for a
number of different vehicles corresponding to ImageNet classes. We observe that
the performance of our ImageNet model on these new images is not great. Can we now
improve the model on this test set via a targeted edit?</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/snow_edit.png" style="width: 90%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Adapting the model to snowy environments.</strong>
By mapping the concept "snow" to "road" we aim to improve the model's
ability to recognize vehicles driving through snow.</div>

<p>To check that, we form an exemplar by taking a picture of a “police van” (a
class that is not in our test set) on a road and replacing the road with a snow
texture. It turns out that by then  editing the model to map “snow” to “road”
using our method we can indeed improve the performance on our snowy test set!
Also, note that the vehicle in our exemplar belongs to a class that is not part
of the test set, so we can see that our edit generalized to other instances of
the concepts used.</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/snow_results.png" style="width: 80%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Editing performance on vehicles-on-snow edits.</strong> 
Editing consistently improves model accuracy across classes. In contrast,
fine-tuning using the same data cannot correct any of the predictions.</div>

<p>It is worth contrasting this with the performance of fine-tuning, i.e., when we
simply fine-tune the whole model on this exemplar. There seems to be no
performance improvement in this case.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: Typographic-attacks.</strong> We then take a look at the recent
typographic attacks of <a href="https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/">[Goh et al.,
2021]</a>: putting a handwritten “ipod” label on
different household objects causes a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020">CLIP</a>
classifier to classify them as iPods! Here is our reproduction:</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/ipod.png" style="width: 80%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Typographic attacks.</strong> 
Placing a handwritten note with the text "ipod" on various household objects
causes a CLIP-trained model to incorrectly predict "ipod".</div>

<p>Now, we will try to edit this classifier to make it ignore this misleading text
and thus predict the underlying object correctly. To do so, we start from an
unrelated image of a can opener and synthetically create two version of that
image: one where we paste an “ipod” label and one where we paste a blank label.
We then edit the model to map “ipod” to “blank” and we find that this corrects
the model predictions on all images, making the model impervious to this
typographic-attack!</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/ipod_edit.png" style="width: 90%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Mitigating typographic attacks via editing.</strong> 
Mapping the text ipod to "blank" allows us to correct all model mistakes caused
by the misleading text, recovering the underlying object prediction.</div>

<p>In contrast, fine-tuning is not a reliable solution. While it can fix some
mistakes (potentially by adjusting class biases), it often causes the model to
incorrectly associate other objects with the fine-tuning label and/or decreases
model performance on actual ipod images.</p>

<h2 id="large-scale-synthetic-evaluation">Large-scale synthetic evaluation</h2>
<p>While the two examples that we looked at so far might be compelling, we want to
stress test our method on a wider variety of settings. Unfortunately, manually
identifying interesting scenarios and collecting the corresponding datasets is
a daunting task. We thus focus on creating <em>synthetic</em> editing test cases.</p>

<p>Specifically, we want to setup scenarios in which we transform a specific
concept (e.g., “wheel”) in a consistent manner across classes. This way, if the
editing process is successful, performing the edit using a few of these images
should significantly improve the performance of the model on other transformed
images.</p>

<p>To setup such scenarios in a scalable manner, we leverage a pipeline based on
pre-trained instance segmentation models and style transfer (we manually
collect a set of textures to use as styles).</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/synthetic.png" style="width: 90%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Creating synthetic test cases.</strong> 
By leveraging pre-trained instance segmentation models and style transfer, we
can transform concepts in large existing datasets. This allows us to create
editing test cases in a scalable way.</div>

<p>With this pipeline in place, we evaluate editing across a wide range of
examples and measure how many of the errors caused by these transformations get
corrected. As a baseline, we compare ourselves to fine-tuning of either the
whole network, or of all the layers after the one that we perform editing on.</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/results.png" style="width: 95%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Editing performance.</strong> Editing
consistently corrects the mistakes caused by the transformations we apply. In
fact, this is true even for classes that are different from the one used to
perform the edit. In contrast, fine-tuning does not generalize in the same way
and only corrects mistakes on images of the same class.</div>

<p>Looking at these results, we can observe that when measuring the impact of
editing and fine-tuning on images of the same class used during editing, both
methods perform reasonably well. However, when we focus on images of <em>other</em>
classes—which would reflect actual generalization—editing continues to
correct errors while fine-tuning often causes more errors than it fixes!</p>

<h2 id="beyond-editing-synthetic-test-cases-as-counterfactuals">Beyond editing: Synthetic test cases as counterfactuals</h2>
<p>While we developed the above pipeline with the goal of  benchmarking editing
methods in mind, it turns out to be useful more broadly. In fact, it
provides us with a scalable way to evaluate models on <em>counterfactuals</em>, i.e.,
to test how the model’s  prediction changes when a given concept of interest is
transformed. Such counterfactuals-based analysis can be used to get a
better understanding of which concepts are important for the model to recognize
each class as well as to reveal model sensitivities across classes.</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/analysis.png" style="width: 95%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Counterfactual-based model analysis. </strong> 
Using the synthetic transformations we described we can analyze how model
predictions are sensitive to the presence of various objects.</div>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>
<p>In this post, we described a framework for directly editing classification
models. We saw how such editing can be a powerful and versatile primitive for
correcting model behavior with minimal data gathering and human labor.
However, we are still only starting to understand what is possible
through this framework. What other model edits would be useful to have?
How can we “localize” our edits so that they only apply to a specific context?
How do we edit multiple prediction rules at once?</p></div>

To analyze our algorithm, we prove a new structural result for decision trees that strengthens a theorem of O’Donnell, Saks, Schramm, and Servedio. While the OSSS theorem says that every decision tree has an influential variable, we show how every decision tree can be “pruned” so that every variable in the resulting tree is influential.</p>

    <title>TR21-171 |  Algorithms and Lower Bounds for Comparator Circuits from Shrinkage | 

	Bruno Pasqualotto Cavalar, 

	Zhenjian Lu</title>
    <summary>Comparator circuits are a natural circuit model for studying bounded fan-out computation whose power sits between nondeterministic branching programs and general circuits. Despite having been studied for nearly three decades, the first superlinear lower bound against comparator circuits was proved only recently by Gál and Robere (ITCS 2020), who established a $\Omega((n/\log n)^{1.5})$ lower bound on the size of comparator circuits computing an explicit function of $n$ bits. 

In this paper, we initiate the study of average-case complexity and circuit analysis algorithms for comparator circuits. Departing from previous approaches, we exploit the technique of shrinkage under random restrictions to obtain a variety of new results for this model. Among our results, we show 

- Average-case Lower Bounds. For every $k = k(n)$ with $k \geq \log n$, there exists a polynomial-time computable function $f_k$ on $n$ bits such that, for every comparator circuit $C$ with at most $n^{1.5}/O(k\cdot \sqrt{\log n})$ gates, we have 
 
\[ \text{Pr}_{x\in\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^n}\left[C(x)=f_k(x)\right]\leq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^{\Omega(k)}}. \]

This average-case lower bound matches the worst-case lower bound of Gál and Robere by letting $k=O(\log n)$. 

- #SAT Algorithms. There is an algorithm that counts the number of satisfying assignments of a given comparator circuit with at most $n^{1.5}/O\!\left(k\cdot \sqrt{\log n}\right)$ gates, in time $2^{n-k}\cdot\text{poly}(n)$, for any $k\leq n/4$. The running time is non-trivial when $k=\omega(\log n)$. 

- Pseudorandom Generators and MCSP Lower Bounds. There is a pseudorandom generator of seed length $s^{2/3+o(1)}$ that fools comparator circuits with $s$ gates. Also, using this PRG, we obtain an $n^{1.5-o(1)}$ lower bound for MCSP against comparator circuits.</summary>

Paul Beame is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. He is known for work in logical complexity and lower bounds—in proving, for example, time-space tradeoffs. He is also interested in the practical applications of symbolic model checking for the verification of software specifications.</p>
<p>
Today we are glad to convey the announcement he forwarded of the creation of a new open-access journal dedicated to Theoretical Computer Science. </p>
<p>
The <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">new journal</a> is called <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> and lists the following <em>distinguished endorsers</em> who are top leaders in all of theory: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Noga Alon <p/>
</li><li>
Shafi Goldwasser <p/>
</li><li>
Donald Knuth <p/>
</li><li>
Robert Tarjan <p/>
</li><li>
Leslie Valiant <p/>
</li><li>
Moshe Vardi <p/>
</li><li>
Andrew Yao
</li></ul>
<p>
They have just thrown their <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">page</a> open for business today, December 1. </p>
<p>
There used to be an independent self-publishing fair held every year in London called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_and_Be_Damned">Publish and Be Damned</a>.” The association of <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> with the computing section of <a href="https://arxiv.org/corr">ArXiv</a> might smack of self-publishing but this journal is in every further respect the opposite:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It uses the <em>overlay journal</em> platform <a href="https://episciences.org/">Episciences</a>, whose mission is to “add value to these archives by attaching a scientific caution to the validated papers.” <p/>
</li><li>
It has a large and capable board of editors who will work the way the other major established print and online journals do.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Editors </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Paul wrote us a direct e-mail and emphasized two points at the start (with our light editing):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> </em></p><em>
<ol>
<li>
The aim of <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> to publish articles of a very high quality, to become a reference journal on par with the leading journals in all of Theoretical Computer Science, and <p/>
</li><li>
The [internationally] inclusive view of Theoretical Computer Science that this journal represents, which is evident in the choice of two excellent co-editors-in-chief and an outstanding inaugural editorial board.
</li></ol>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
He adds that it was thanks to the leadership of Thomas Schwentick and others, including helping to gain <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/theoretics-foundation">sponsorship</a>, and the hard work of the co-editors-in-chief, managing editors, and the rest of the Advisory Board, that this new journal launch was made possible.</p>

<li>
Javier Esparza, Technische Universität München <p/>

</p><p/><h2> Why A New Journal? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Indeed. The announcement adds:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> – We believe that our field (and science in general) needs more ‘virtuous’ open-access journals, a whole eco-system of them, with various levels of specialization and of selectivity. We also believe that, along with the structuring role played by conferences in theoretical computer science, we collectively need to re-develop the practice of journal publications. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
There is a long, historical, good point here. Thirty years ago, David S. Johnson moved personal mountains to compile the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/117006">STOC/FOCS Bibliography</a>, whose essential subtitle <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/117006">(preliminary version)</a> spoke a truth expanded in the blurb by Michael Loui:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Many computer scientists believe, erroneously, that it is sufficient to publish their papers in conferences, particularly prestigious conferences such as STOC and FOCS—and neglect to publish them in journals. In contrast, this bibliography emphasizes the benefits of archival publication in rigorously refereed journals. Often, the journal version corrects errors, provides more details, and extends the results of the conference paper.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
ArXiv, however, has put more weight in the other end of this boat. It is the easy end to step into and ride; your humble bloggers confess a few instances ourselves. After noting he’d already used the STOC/FOCS Bibliography to locate journal versions of papers, Michael—again, writing in <b>1991</b>—finished by saying,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Compiling and maintaining [this and other similar] bibliographies would require the continual cooperation of many authors and journal editors, but the results would be worth the effort.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We interpret what Paul is saying along these lines.  It may not be a completely new kind of journal—it goes for continuity with the kind we know—or a completely new mission for a journal.  But it is responding to new contexts and environments for journals, like watercraft in a 007 movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> More Aims </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The announcement also declares these purposes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> </em></p><em>
<ul>
<li>
The scope of <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> is the whole of Theoretical Computer Science, understood in an inclusive meaning (concretely: including, but not restricted to, the Theory of Computing and the Theory of Programming; or equivalently, the so-called TCS-A and TCS-B, reminiscent of Jan van Leeuwen et al.’s Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science). <p/>
</li><li>
Our aim is to rapidly become a reference journal and to contribute to the unity of the Theoretical Computer Science global community. In particular, we will seek to publish only papers that make a very significant contribution to their respective fields, that strive to be accessible to a wider audience within theoretical computer science, and that are, generally, of a quality on par with the very best journals in the field. <p/>
</li><li>
<font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> adheres to the principles of ‘virtuous’ open-access: there is no charge to read the journal, nor to publish in it. The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors, under a Creative Commons license.
</li></ul>
</em><p><em>
</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Some further points and history are given in full in the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/12/theoretics-new-tcs-journal.html">posting</a> on Lance and Bill’s blog.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are excited by the creation of <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font>. We especially like the ability to freely read articles and also to freely submit articles. We look forward to see the articles that will appear in the journal. Please submit some of your new results. Good luck. </p>
<p>
We certainly hope to see some of the following in the journal soon: </p>
<ul>
<li>
A Super Linear Lower Bound on the Circuit Size for 3-SAT. <p/>
</li><li>
A Simple Quantum Algorithm for Almost All Cases of the Halting Problem. <p/>
</li><li>
Graph Isomorphism is in Polynomial Time.
</li></ul>
<p>
What do you hope to see soon in <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font>?</p>

I got the quote from the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/50-year-old-problem-eludes-theoretical-computer-science">Simons Institute Newsletter</a>, which points to a longer <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/27/1037123/p-np-theoretical-computer-science">MIT Technology Review</a> article to which I don’t have access.  The newsletter article mentions two well-known surprising results (also on my list), and another cool one which came after my post and that I was thinking of adding.  For more surprising results, see my list.  What do you believe?</p>

    <title>TheoretiCS: A New TCS Journal</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><i>Guest Post from Paul Beame on behalf of the TheoretiCS Foundation</i></p><p>I am writing to let you know of the launch today of <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">TheoretiCS</a>, a new fully open-access journal dedicated to Theoretical Computer Science developed by the members of our community that I have been involved in and for which I gave a brief pre-announcement about at STOC.</p><p>This journal has involved an unprecedented level of cooperation of representatives of leading conferences from across the entire Theoretical Computer Science spectrum. This includes representatives from STOC, FOCS, SODA, CCC, PODC, SoCG, TCC, COLT, ITCS, ICALP, which may be more familiar to readers of your blog, as well as from LICS, CSL, CONCUR, ICDT, MFCS and a number of others.</p><p><b>Two Points of Emphasis</b></p><p/><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Our quality objective - TheoretiCS aims at publishing articles of a very high quality, and at becoming a reference journal on par with the leading journals in all of Theoretical Computer Science</li><li>The inclusive view of Theoretical Computer Science that this journal represents, which is evident in the choice of two excellent co-editors-in-chief, Javier Esparza and Uri Zwick, and an outstanding <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/editorial-board">inaugural editorial board</a>.</li></ul><p/><p><b>Guiding principles and objectives</b></p><p/><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>We believe that our field (and science in general) needs more 'virtuous' open-access journals, a whole eco-system of them, with various levels of specialization and of selectivity. We also believe that, along with the structuring role played by conferences in theoretical computer science, we collectively need to re-develop the practice of journal publications.</li><li>The scope of TheoretiCS is the whole of Theoretical Computer Science, understood in an inclusive meaning (concretely: including, but not restricted to, the Theory of Computing and the Theory of Programming; or equivalently, the so-called TCS-A and TCS-B, reminiscent of Jan van Leeuwen et al.'s Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science).</li><li>Our aim is to rapidly become a reference journal and to contribute to the unity of the Theoretical Computer Science global community. In particular, we will seek to publish only papers that make a very significant contribution to their respective fields, that strive to be accessible to a wider audience within theoretical computer science, and that are, generally, of a quality on par with the very best journals in the field.</li><li>TheoretiCS adheres to the principles of 'virtuous' open-access: there is no charge to read the journal, nor to publish in it. The copyright of the papers remains with the authors, under a Creative Commons license.</li></ul><p/><p><b>Organization and a bit of history</b></p><p>The project started in 2019 and underwent a long gestation. From the start, we wanted to have a thorough discussion with a wide representation of the community, on how to best implement the guiding principles sketched above. It was deemed essential to make sure that all fields of theoretical computer science would feel at home in this journal, and that it would be recognized as a valid venue for publication all over the world.</p><p>This resulted in the creation of an <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/advisory-board">Advisory Board</a>, composed of representatives of most of the main conferences in the field (currently APPROX, CCC, COLT, CONCUR, CSL, FOCS, FoSSaCS, FSCD, FSTTCS, ICALP, ICDT, ITCS, LICS, MFCS, PODC, SoCG, SODA, STACS, STOC, TCC) and of so-called members-at-large. </p><p><b>Logistics and answers to some natural questions</b></p><p/><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The journal is published by the TheoretiCS Foundation, a non-profit foundation established under German law. Thomas Schwentick, Pascal Weil, and Meena Mahajan are officers of the foundation.</li><li>TheoretiCS is based on the platform <a href="https://episciences.org/">episciences.org</a>, in the spirit of a so-called overlay journal.</li><li>The Advisory Board, together with the Editors-in-Chief and the Managing Editors, spent much of their efforts in designing and implementing an efficient 2-phase review system: efficient in terms of the added-value it brings to the published papers and their authors, and of the time it takes. Yet, as this review system relies in an essential fashion on the work and expertise of colleagues (like in all classical reputable journals), we can not guarantee a fixed duration for the evaluation of the papers submitted to TheoretiCS.</li><li>Being charge-free for authors and readers does not mean that there is no cost to publishing a journal. These costs are supported for the foreseeable future by academic institutions (at the moment, CNRS and Inria, in France; others may join).</li><li>The journal will have an ISSN, and each paper will have a DOI. There will be no print edition.</li></ul><p/></div>

    <title>What were the effects of the Bangladesh mask intervention?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There’s been a bit of a social-media back-and-forth between us and Jason Abaluck about the design and statistical significance of the <a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Mask_Second_Stage_Paper_20211108.pdf.pdf">Bangladesh Mask RCT</a>. To focus and hone the discussion on some crucial details, we just posted a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01296">short note</a> where we re-analyzed the data from this trial using standard non-parametric paired statistics tests on treatment-village pairs. In this blog, we summarize those results, highlighting potentially significant biases in the study. Importantly, we found that the behavior of unblinded staff when enrolling study participants was one of the most highly significant differences between treatment and control groups. The significant impacts on staff and participant behavior urge caution in interpreting small differences in the study outcomes which depended on survey responses.</p>

<p>Let’s first review the full study protocol, as it’s a cluster RCT and hence a bit more complicated than the typical trials with which many are familiar. First 600 villages in Bangladesh were paired based on COVID-case data, population density, and population size. Each paired village was assigned to treatment or control at random. Next, observers were sent to the treatment and control villages to enroll households in the study. Importantly, observers <em>were not blinded</em> to the treatment assignment in each village. The observers were also tasked with giving out the masks in the intervention villages, so they knew if the village was assigned to treatment or control. Households were approached by the observers and the households either (a) consented to participate, (b) declined to participate, or (c) were marked “unreachable” by the unblinded observers. The study team then proceeded to implement a mask promotion intervention in the treatment villages. In both villages, participants were asked to report COVID-like symptoms. Those who reported symptoms were asked to volunteer blood draws for serology. The primary endpoint was evaluated based on the number of these blood draws that tested positive for COVID antibodies.</p>

<p>As we have noted before, despite 300:300 randomization of the 600 villages, there was a notable imbalance in the size of the consenting populations between the control and treatment groups. The control group contained 156,938 individuals while the treatment group contained 170,497 individuals. The total absolute numbers of symptomatic seropositives in the treatment and control villages was 1086 and 1106, respectively. This difference is too small to be significant if participants had been individually randomized. In the study, an effect is asserted for the <em>relative rate</em> of symptomatic seropositives, i.e., normalized by population denominators. We note that the 10% decrease reported in the fraction of individuals who become symptomatic seropositives is not driven primarily by a decrease in the numerator of this fraction of symptomatic seropositives, but instead by the increase in the denominator.</p>

<p>What is the right way to test whether attributes differ between the treatment and control groups? If we have an attribute that we observe in every village, we can assess the hypothesis “a control village is equally likely to have a larger value of the attribute than its control pair than it is to have a smaller value.” Since the villages were paired, a standard non-parametric test for such questions is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test">Wilcoxon signed-rank test</a>. This test is nice because we need not worry about using sophisticated models or variance correction techniques. Instead, we can just try to assess if bulk statistics are plausibly different in the treatment and control groups. Let’s use this test to gain insights about the mask study.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the count in each village of individuals who reported COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive for covid-antibodies. The null hypothesis is that it is equally likely for a paired village to have more symptomatic seropositive in control as in treatment. According to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the p-value is 0.97 and we cannot reject the null hypothesis. What about the <em>rate</em> of symptomatic seropositivity? Was the percentage of infections in the control group higher than in the treatment? Again, we cannot reject the null as the p-value of the Wilcoxon test is 0.25. In our writeup, we found similar results when restricting attention to subgroups assigned to cloth masks and surgical masks, and also in the population of individuals over 60. Based on these tests, we cannot assert that the intervention affected the primary endpoint of symptomatic seroprevalence. However, there are behavioral effects that are significantly different between treatment and control.</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="Boxplots of different village features" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/village_attribute_boxplots.png" width="100%"/></p>

<p>From our analysis, it is quite clear that more mask wearing was observed in the treatment group rather than the control group (p&lt;$10^{-47}$). Moreover, there was a large difference in observed social distancing (p&lt;$10^{-15}$). It is notable—even if one did not expect any effect from masks at all—that the increase in observed physical distancing did not translate to clearer differences in symptomatic seropositivity between treatment and control groups.</p>

<p>Second, the populations of the treatment and control groups themselves are very different. One of the main difficulties in running a mask trial is the issue of blinding. You certainly cannot run a blinded intervention as people know whether or not they are wearing masks. But in such unblinded studies, it is critical that the populations sampled to be surveyed are identical before the unblinding occurs.</p>

<p>Here is where things get a bit subtle. The villages were assigned to treatment at random, but the households were not. The surveyors who handed out masks knew in advance the treatment assignment of their villages. This knowledge alone induced a highly significant difference. <em>The fraction of households approached in each village is significantly different in treatment and control</em> (p&lt;$10^{-11}$). This selection bias induced a large imbalance in the size of the treatment and control groups, and may have affected the overall seropositivity counts. Interestingly we found that the rate of consent for symptom surveys and the rate of consent for blood draws were indistinguishable between treatment and controls. The main significant difference was due to the behavior of the study staff.</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="Boxplots of survey interactions" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/survey_boxplots.png" width="100%"/></p>

<p>That the unblinded staff behaved differently in the different types of villages is not surprising and similar experimenter behavior has blemished randomized trials since their inception. We can’t know the exact cause of the difference in households reached, but perhaps the staff put just a little bit more effort into soliciting responses in the treatment group because they were excited about testing their intervention. Whatever the case, this behavioral difference created a large population difference between the groups: whereas 3,394 of 68,514 households were unreachable in the treatment group, 4,970 of 65,536 households were unreachable in control. This is a difference of over four thousand people, far exceeding the 20 case difference in symptomatic seropositivity.</p>

<p>Our analysis suggests that the impact of the mask intervention was highly effective at modifying behaviors (distancing, mask-wearing, symptom reporting), but that any effect on actual symptomatic seropositivity was much more subtle. In particular, whatever effects the intervention had on the rate of symptomatic seropositivity in the villages was certainly not large relative to other factors contributing to variance in this parameter across villages.
We suggest that the very large causal effects on consent rates and thus population denominators urge caution in interpreting the small differences we see in symptomatic seropositivity between treatment and controls, which are not statistically significant according to standard nonparametric paired tests.</p>

    <title>The cult of statistical significance and the Bangladesh Mask RCT.</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the last post, <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/11/23/mask-rct-revisited/">I argued that the effect size in the Bangladesh Mask RCT was too small to inform policy making</a>. I deliberately avoided diving into statistical significance as arguments about p-values quickly devolve into scientific gish gallop. Statistical validity is the most overrated form of experimental validity, and it crowds out more important questions of effect size, bias, design, and applicability.</p>

<p>But shoot, sometimes Byzantine academic arguments are fun. And, though they are always wrong, sometimes they are useful. In this blog I want to discuss how we analyze statistical validity in cluster randomized controlled trials. It is quite subtle and sensitive, and should give us pause about these experimental designs. The sample sizes needed for validating large effects in cluster randomized trials can be absurdly high, and running a clean trial with millions of participants is likely impossibly difficult and almost never worth doing.</p>

<p>To review in the <a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Mask_Second_Stage_Paper_20211108.pdf.pdf">Bangladesh Mask RCT</a> there were $n_C=$163,861 individuals from $k_C=$300 villages in the control group. There were $n_T=$178,322 individuals from $k_T=$300 villages in the intervention group. The main end point of the study was whether their intervention reduced the number of individuals who reported covid-like symptoms and tested seropositive at some point during the trial. There were $i_C=$1,106 symptomatic individuals confirmed seropositive in the control group and $i_T=$1,086 such individuals in the treatment group.</p>

<p>What can we say about the statistical significance of this 20 case difference? Most would guess this difference is not significant. Indeed, in a balanced design with $n_T=n_C$ and 180,000 individuals in each arm, this study would not be statistically significant. Let’s imagine we ran an experiment where we could treat the outcomes of each individual as independent, identically distributed random variables. What is the p-value associated with the null hypothesis that the prevalence of infections in the control group is less than or equal to the prevalence in the treatment group? A simple statistical test of this hypothesis is the z-test for proportions. For the z-test, the p-value when the groups are balanced is 0.3.</p>

<p>The authors claim a balanced design, but, though the number of treatment and control villages are indeed equal, the number of <em>individuals</em> in the treatment group is 1.1x bigger than the control group. <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/11/23/mask-rct-revisited/">As I mentioned in the previous post</a>, this discrepancy can likely be explained by the large differential in response rates between the groups: 1.05x fewer households were approached for surveys in control and the control group responded at 1.07x lower rate than treatment. The most significant difference between the treatment and control group may very well be the consent rate of the household survey. For the medical statistics experts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention-to-treat_analysis">the intention to treat principle</a> says that the  individuals who are unreachable or who refuse to be surveyed must be counted in the study. Omitting them invalidates the study.</p>

<p>But the issues of significance remain even if we forgive this large imbalance in the study. If we re-run the z-test with the $n_C$ and $n_T$ in the study data, the p-value is now 0.009, which would be quite significant at the standard p &lt; 0.05 threshold. However, the individual outcomes are <em>not</em> independent. The trial was cluster-randomized, so everyone in the same village received the same intervention. This means that the outcomes inside a village are correlated, and they are likely more correlated inside a village than outside.</p>

<p>To capture the correlation among intra-cluster participants, statisticians use the notion of the <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/power-calculations"><em>intra-cluster correlation coefficient</em></a> $\rho$. $\rho$ is a scalar between 0 and 1 that measures the relative variance within clusters and between clusters. When $\rho=1$, all of the responses in each cluster are identical. When $\rho=0$, the clustering has no effect, and we can treat our assignment as purely randomized. Once we know $\rho$ we can compute an <em>effective sample size</em>: if the villages are completely correlated, the number of samples in the study would be 600. If they were independent, the number of samples would be over 340,000. The number of effective samples is equal to the total number of samples divided by the <em>design effect</em>:</p>

\[{\small
    DE = 1+\left(\frac{n_T+n_C}{k_T+k_C}-1\right)\rho \,.
}\]

<p>What is the design effect of the Bangladesh RCT? Measuring the intra-cluster correlation $\rho$ is nontrivial: the true value of $\rho$ depends on both potential outcomes in an experiment and needs to be estimated using some side experiment or previous trials at baseline. $\rho$ is often inferred from secondary covariates of earlier experiments on a similar population. We don’t have a pre-specified estimate, but can cheat a bit here and estimate $\rho$ from the provided data in the control villages. A standard ANOVA calculation says that the observed symptomatic seropositivity in the control villages has an intra-village correlation of $\rho=$0.007. This value isn’t particularly unreasonable. Some practitioners suggest that because of behavioral contagion alone, $\rho$ should be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1466680">between 0.01 and 0.02 for human studies.</a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013998#pone.0013998-Carrat2">This cluster RCT on mask use to prevent influenza in households</a> uses $\rho=$0.24.  As a sanity check, the intra-village correlation of reported systems is 0.03. So let’s stick with $\rho=$0.007 and see where it takes us.</p>

<p>For the Bangladesh RCT, assuming $\rho=$0.007, the design effect is about 5. This reduces the effective sample size from over 340,000 to just under 70,000. What happens with our z-test? We simply take the z-score and divide by the square root of the design effect, yielding a p-value of 0.14. The result is not statistically significant once we take into account the intra-cluster correlation. In order to “achieve” statistical significance, $\rho$ would need to be less than 0.001 and the design effect would have to be less than 2.2.</p>

<p>We can also do similar design-effect adjustments for relative risk reduction. Recall the relative risk reduction is the ratio of the rate of infection in the treatment group to the rate of infection in the control group</p>

\[{\small
    RR = \frac{i_T/n_T}{i_C/n_C}\,.
}\]

<p>A small $RR$ corresponds to a large reduction in risk. For the mask study, the estimated risk reduction is $RR=$0.9.  If the assignments of every individual to treatment and control were random, we could compute error bars on the log of the risk ratio. The log risk ratio is</p>

\[{\small
    \ell RR = \log \frac{i_T/n_T}{i_C/n_C}\,,
}\]

<p>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk#Inference">a standard estimate of the standard error $SE$ of $\ell RR$</a> is</p>

\[{\small
    SE = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{i_T} + \frac{1}{i_C} - \frac{1}{n_T}- \frac{1}{n_C}}\,.
}\]

<p>In the mask study, $SE=$0.043. Using a Gaussian approximation, our confidence interval would then be</p>

\[{\scriptsize
    [\exp(\ell RR - 1.96 SE), \exp(\ell RR + 1.96 SE)] = [0.83, 0.98]\,.
}\]

<p>The way we interpret the confidence interval (and I’ll likely screw this up) is that if the Gaussian approximation were true, and all of the individual assignments to treatment and control were independent, and we repeated the experiment many times, the true risk ratio would fall inside the confidence interval 95% of the time. This calculation suggests that the confidence interval (barely) excludes a risk ratio of 1. However, this calculation does not take into account the cluster effects.  Assuming again that $\rho=$0.007, when we adjust our confidence intervals for cluster effects, we get the larger interval</p>

\[{\scriptsize
    \left[\exp(\ell RR - 1.96 SE \sqrt{DE}), \exp(\ell RR + 1.96 SE \sqrt{DE} )\right] = [0.75, 1.09]\,.
}\]

<p>Again, a standard cluster RCT analysis would not be able to reject a null effect for the complex masking intervention. In terms of my most-loathed statistic of efficacy, the confidence interval ranges from -9% to 25% after adjustment.</p>

<p>Note that even the strong claims made in the paper about subgroups are not significant once intra-cluster correlation is accounted for. A commonly quoted result is that surgical masks dramatically reduced infections for individuals over 60 years old. In this case, $n_C =$14,826, $n_T$=16,088, $i_C=$157 and $i_T=$124. The estimated effectiveness is 27%. However, with a design effect of 5, the p-value for the z-test here is 0.13 and the confidence intervals for the efficacy are -23% to 57%. So again, one can’t rest on statistical significance to argue this effect is real.</p>

<p>As a last statistical grumble, all of these corrections don’t even account for the multiple hypothesis testing in the manuscript where nearly 200 hypotheses were evaluated. <strong>After a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction">Bonferroni correction</a> and accounting for design effect, none of the p-values would be less than 0.5.</strong></p>

<p>How large would the trial have to be in order to have statistical significance? We can focus on the z-test, and ask how many samples would be needed to reject the null hypothesis 95% of the time when the relative risk is 0.9, the prevalence in the control group is 0.076, and the intra-cluster correlation is 0.007. The answer is <strong><em>1.1 million people</em></strong>, over 3 times larger than the actual study size.</p>

<p>When a power calculation reveals a trial needs more than a million subjects, researchers need to pause to think if they are asking the right question. It is likely impossible to conduct a precise experiment that rules out all confounding at such a scale. The number of people needed to run such a trial is huge, and maintaining data quality would be both prohibitively difficult and expensive. Any trial has potential harms to its subjects, and the larger the sample size, the more likely harm may occur. Ensuring beneficence and informed consent at this scale is likely impossible. And if one really expects the clinical significance to be this small, why invest all of these resources into running an RCT instead of looking for more powerful interventions?</p>

    <title>Open: 4  colorability for graphs of bounded genus or bounded crossing number (has this been asked before?)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> I have  co-authored (with Nathan Hayes, Anthony Ostuni, Davin Park) an open problems column  on the topic of this post. It is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/open/cross.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>Let g(G) be the genus of a graph and cr(G) be the crossing number of a graph.</p><p>As usual chi(G) is the chromatic number of a graph. </p><p>KNOWN to most readers of this blog:</p><p>{G: \chi(G) \le 2} is in P</p><p>{G: \chi(G) \le 3 and g(G)\le 0 } is NPC (planar graph 3-col)</p><p>{G : \chi(G) \le 4 and g(G) \le 0} is in P (it's trivial since all planar graphs are 4-col)</p><p>{G: \chi(G) \le 3 and cr(G) \le 0} is NPC (planar graph 3-col)</p><p>{G: \chi(G) \le 4 and cr(G) \le 0} is in P (trivial since all planar graphs are 4-col)</p><p>LESS WELL KNOWN BUT TRUE (and brought to my attention by my co-authors and also Jacob Fox and Marcus Schaefer) </p><p>For all g\ge 0 and r\ge 5, {G : \chi(G) \le r and g(G) \le g} is in P</p><p>For all c\ge 0 and r\ge 5, {G : \chi(G) \le r and cr(G) \le c} is in P </p><p>SO I asked the question: for various r,g,c what is the complexity of the following sets:</p><p>{G: \chi(G) \le r AND g(G) \le g} </p><p>{G: \chi(G) \le r AND cr(G) \le c}</p><p>SO I believe the status of the following sets is open</p><p>{G : \chi(G) \le 4 and g(G)\le 1} (replace 1 with 2,3,4,...)</p><p>{G : \chi(G) \le 4 and cr(G)\le 1} (replace 1 with 2,3,4...) </p><p><br/></p><p>QUESTIONS</p><p>1) If anyone knows the answer to these open questions, please leave comments. </p><p>2) The paper pointed to above mentions all of the times I read of someone asking questions like this. There are not many, and the problem does not seem to be out there. Why is that?</p><p>a) It's hard to find out who-asked-what-when. Results are published, open problems often are not. My SIGACT News open problems column gives me (and others) a chance to write down open problems; however, such venues are rare. So it's possible that someone without a blog or an open problems column raised these questions before. (I checked cs stack exchange- not there- and I posted there but didn't get much of a response.) </p><p>b) Proving NPC seems hard since devising gadgets with only one crossing is NOT good enough since you use the gadget many times. This may have discouraged people from thinking about it. </p><p>c) Proving that the problems are in P (for the r\ge 6 case) was the result of using a hard theorem in graph theory from 2007. The authors themselves did not notice the algorithmic result. The first published account of the algorithmic result might be my open problems column.  This may be a case of the graph theorists and complexity theorists not talking to each other, though that is surprising since there is so much overlap that I thought there was no longer a distinction. </p><p>d) While I think this is a natural question to ask, I may be wrong. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/05/what-is-natural-question-who-should.html">here</a> for a blog post about when I had a natural question and found out why I may be wrong about the problems naturalness. </p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR21-170 |  Pseudorandom Self-Reductions for NP-Complete Problems |

    <summary>A language $L$ is random-self-reducible if deciding membership in $L$ can be reduced (in polynomial time) to deciding membership in $L$ for uniformly random instances. It is known that several "number theoretic" languages (such as computing the permanent of a matrix) admit random self-reductions. Feigenbaum and Fortnow showed that NP-complete languages are not non-adaptively random-self-reducible unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses, giving suggestive evidence that NP may not admit random self-reductions. Hirahara and Santhanam introduced a weakening of random self-reductions that they called pseudorandom self-reductions, in which a language $L$ is reduced to a distribution that is computationally indistinguishable from the uniform distribution. They then showed that the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) admits a non-adaptive pseudorandom self-reduction, and suggested that this gave further evidence that MCSP is "distinguished" from standard NP-Complete problems.

We show that, in fact, the NP-Complete Clique problem admits a non-adaptive pseudorandom self-reduction, assuming the planted clique conjecture. More generally we show the following. Call a property of graphs $\pi$ hereditary if $G \in \pi$ implies $H \in \pi$ for every induced subgraph of $G$. We show that for any infinite hereditary property $\pi$, the problem of finding a maximum induced subgraph $H \in \pi$ of a given graph $G$ admits a non-adaptive pseudorandom self-reduction.</summary>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: The linear-probing hash table is one of the oldest and most widely used data structures in computer science. However, linear probing also famously comes with a major drawback: as soon as the hash table reaches a high memory utilization, elements within the hash table begin to cluster together, causing insertions to become slow. This phenomenon, now known as “primary clustering”, was first captured by Donald Knuth in 1963; at a load factor of <img alt="1 - 1/x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+-+1%2Fx&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the expected time per insertion becomes <img alt="\Theta(x^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%28x%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, rather than the more desirable <img alt="\Theta(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%28x%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>We show that there is more to the story than the classic analysis would seem to suggest. It turns out that small design decisions in how deletions are implemented have dramatic effects on the asymptotic performance of insertions. If these design decisions are made correctly, then even a hash table that is continuously at a load factor <img alt="1 - \Theta(1/x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+-+%5CTheta%281%2Fx%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can achieve average insertion time <img alt="\tilde{O}(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28x%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. A key insight is that the tombstones left behind by deletions cause a surprisingly strong “anti-clustering” effect, and that when insertions and deletions are one-for-one, the anti-clustering effects of deletions actually overpower the clustering effects of insertions.</p>
<p>We also present a new variant of linear probing, which we call “graveyard hashing”, that completely eliminates primary clustering on any sequence of operations. If, when an operation is performed, the current load factor is <img alt="1 - 1/x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+-+1%2Fx&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for some <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then the expected cost of the operation is <img alt="O(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28x%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. One corollary is that, in the external-memory model with a data block size of <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, graveyard hashing offers the following remarkable guarantee: at any load factor <img alt="1-1/x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-1%2Fx&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> satisfying <img alt="x = o(B)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+o%28B%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, graveyard hashing achieves <img alt="1 + o(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%2B+o%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> expected block transfers per operation. Past external-memory hash tables have only been able to offer a <img alt="1+o(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Bo%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> guarantee when the block size <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is at least <img alt="\Omega(x^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28x%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
