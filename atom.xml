<p>
Santa Claus is on the way to visit those of us who have been good. </p>
<p/><p>
Tonight is Christmas Eve, and we want to thank everyone who has been supporting Ken and me at GLL.</p>
<p>
Whether or not you believe in Santa Claus, whether or not you celebrate Xmas, we should agree that this has been some year. </p>
<p>
Indeed the the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus">Santa Claus</a> issue raises some questions about truth telling. Children are typically told by their parents that Santa is real; tonight you can “watch” his progress as he travels around the world. Dr. Anthony Fauci even <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/coronavirus/dr-fauci-reassures-children-says-he-personally-vaccinated-santa-claus">said</a> he traveled to the North Pole to give Santa the new Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>
This raises some objections to presenting Santa Claus as a real person, rather than a story: </p>
<ul>
<li>
That lying is normally bad. <p/>
</li><li>
That parents intentionally lying to their children promotes distrust. <p/>
</li><li>
That it promotes selfishness, greed, and materialism. <p/>
</li><li>
That it associates good behavior with being materially rewarded with presents from Santa Claus. <p/>
</li><li>
That tricking children into believing falsehoods interferes with the development of critical thinking.
</li></ul>
<p>
Most agree that it is harmless, but see this for more on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_controversies#Rejection_among_certain_groups">controversy</a>. Ken finessed it by “superposing” the real Saint Nicholas on what told his children.</p>
<p>
Or read this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Indisputable-Existence-Santa-Claus-Mathematics/dp/1468316125">book</a> on <i>The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus: The Mathematics of Christmas</i> by Hannah Fry and Thomas Evans.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> P <img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\neq}"/> NP </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The belief that P is weaker than NP, that there is no efficient algorithm for many problems, is perhaps our version of Santa Claus. We cannot prove it, we cannot see how to even really approach it. </p>
<p>
But most of us believe that a resolution is <em>presently</em> out there, and that says there is no efficient algorithm for SAT and other NP-complete problems. Is this a story we tell each other like Santa Claus: Is P<img alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{&lt;}"/>NP the same? Is it just a story we tell each other?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> P <img alt="{=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{=}"/> NP </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Well not really: P is not equal to NP yet. But there are many important examples of hard problems that are solved every day. These problems are solved even though they are believed to be hard to solve.</p>
<p>
The algorithms that are used are brute force. The algorithms just try all the possible solutions and keep checking to see if this guess is correct. While complexity theory is filled with clever algorithms for hard problems that: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Solve special cases; <p/>
</li><li>
Give approximation solutions; <p/>
</li><li>
Solve some of the time; <p/>
</li><li>
And so on.
</li></ul>
<p>
Often only a perfect solution in the general case is what we sometimes needed. Two important examples of this are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Bitcoin mining; <p/>
</li><li>
Password cracking.
</li></ol>
<p>
The first of these can be as precious as a diamond, but the latter is a lump of coal when it happens to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Password Cracking </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A password is checked by a system by using a password file <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> that consists of records like 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  [name, h(name,p)]. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Bname%2C+h%28name%2Cp%29%5D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  [name, h(name,p)]. "/></p>
<p>A user who claims to be <img alt="{name}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bname%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{name}"/>, then proves this by giving an <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{w}"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  h(name,w) = h(name,p). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++h%28name%2Cw%29+%3D+h%28name%2Cp%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  h(name,w) = h(name,p). "/></p>
<p>Here <img alt="{h(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{h(x)}"/> is hash function. This function is public and so is the file <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/>. Well the file is not exactly public, but an attacker often does know the file. Note, the value <img alt="{name}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bname%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{name}"/> represents the name and other information that is used like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">salt</a>. </p>
<p>
The hope is that it is hard to invert the hash function <img alt="{h(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{h(x)}"/> and so an attacker cannot easily find a <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{w}"/>. The difficulty is that a brute force attack works when <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{p}"/> can be guessed. And this unfortunately is quite often. If we think Bob used the password “12345678,” then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  h(Bob,12345678) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++h%28Bob%2C12345678%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  h(Bob,12345678) "/></p>
<p>will check correctly. </p>
<p>
Even with random passwords cracking them by brute force is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking">possible</a> </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Graphics processors can speed up password cracking by a factor of 50 to 100 over general purpose computers for specific hashing algorithms. As of 2011, available commercial products claim the ability to test up to 2,800,000,000 passwords a second on a standard desktop computer using a high-end graphics processor. Such a device can crack a 10 letter single-case password in one day. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This is an amazing result. The algorithm that breaks passwords, the cracker, is just brute force. But the cleverness is all in the implementation. The cleverness is using GPU’s or FPGA’s to make the algorithm—brute force or not—run so fast. Here GPU’s are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">graphics processors</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>‘s are field programmable arrays. Both of these devices are hardware that is well matched to computing the hash functions that are used. See this Hackaday <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/05/15/all-your-passwords-are-belong-to-fpga/">item</a> for details.</p>

    <title>Slowest Sorting Algorithms</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Radu Gigore <a href="https://twitter.com/rgrig/status/1342015488252063744">tweeted</a> "People are obsessed with finding the best algorithms. What about the worst?" So here's a Christmas gift that keeps giving, the slowest of sorting algorithms. </p><p>Before you read on, try to think of the slowest sorting algorithm. No fair spinning its wheels, sleeping or doing unrelated tasks. It should always make progress towards sorting. </p><p>Here are some <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-slowest-sorting-algorithms/">examples</a>, in particular bogosort that generates all permutations until it finds a sorted one. Takes n! time on average.</p><p>But we can do much worse. The following redicusort algorithm I got from Stuart Kurtz back in the 90's.</p><blockquote><p>Generate all permutations and then sort those permutations. The sort of the original permutation will be first on the list.</p></blockquote><p>The running time depends on the sorting algorithm you use after generating the permutations.</p><p>If you use bubblesort you get a (n!)<sup>2</sup> time algorithm. </p><p>If you use bogosort you get a (n!)! bound.</p><p>What if you just call redicusort recursively? The algorithm will never end. If you want to guarantee termination you need to bound the depth of the recursion. Choose something like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackermann function</a> to get a sorting algorithm that always makes progress but not primitively recursive. In general you can get a sorting algorithm that takes longer than any fixed computable function.</p></div>

    <summary>We define the shadow complexity of a polytope P as the maximum number of vertices in a linear projection of $P$ to the plane. We describe connections to algebraic complexity and to parametrized optimization. We also provide several basic examples and constructions, and develop tools for bounding shadow complexity.</summary>

    <title>Sorting Can Exponentially Speed Up Pure Dynamic Programming</title>

shortest path problem, can be efficiently solved by dynamic programming (DP)
algorithms that are "pure" in that they only perform basic operations, as min,
max, +, but no conditional branchings via if-then-else in their recursion
equations. It is known that any pure (min,+) DP algorithm solving the minimum
weight spanning tree problem on undirected n-vertex graphs must perform at
least $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ operations. We show that this problem can be
solved by a pure (min,max,+) DP algorithm performing only $O(n^3)$ operations.
The algorithm is essentially a (min,max) algorithm: addition operations are
only used to output the final values. The presence of both min and max
operations means that now DP algorithms can sort: this explains the title of
the paper.

tropical (min,+) and (max,+) circuits approximating given optimization
problems. Many classical dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for optimization
problems are pure in that they only use the basic min, max, + operations in
their recursion equations. Tropical circuits constitute a rigorous mathematical
model for this class of algorithms. An algorithmic consequence of our lower
bounds for tropical circuits is that the approximation powers of pure DP
algorithms and greedy algorithms are incomparable. That pure DP algorithms can
hardly beat greedy in approximation, is long known. New in this consequence is
that also the converse holds.

This is a classical
problem which is intimately connected with the undecidability of certain
physical phenomena. Concerning fluid flows, Moore asked in [15] if
hydrodynamics is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao
launched a programme based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to
address the blow up problem in the Navier-Stokes equations. In this direction,
the undecidability of some physical systems has been studied in recent years,
from the quantum gap problem [7] to quantum field theories [11]. To the best of
our knowledge, the existence of undecidable particle paths of 3D fluid flows
has remained an elusive open problem since Moore's works in the early 1990's.
In this article we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a
Riemannian $S^3$ and speculate on its implications concerning Tao's approach to
the blow up problem in the Navier-Stokes equations.

    <title>Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling</title>

Thakurta [EFMRTT19] demonstrates that random shuffling of input data amplifies
differential privacy guarantees. Such amplification leads to substantially
stronger privacy guarantees for systems in which data is contributed
anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17] and for the analysis of noisy stochastic gradient
descent. We show that an $\varepsilon_0$-locally differentially private
algorithm, under shuffling with $n$ users, amplifies to a
$(\Theta((1-e^{-\varepsilon_0})\sqrt{\frac{e^{\varepsilon_0}\log(1/\delta)}{n}}),
\delta)$-central differential privacy guarantee. This significantly improves
over previous work and achieves the asymptotically optimal dependence on
$\varepsilon_0$.
</p>
<p>Our result is based on a new approach that is simpler than previous work and
extends to approximate differential privacy with nearly the same guarantees.
Our work also yields an empirical method to derive tighter bounds on the
central $\varepsilon$ and we show that it gets to within a small constant
factor of the correct bound. As a direct corollary of our analysis we derive a
simple and asymptotically optimal algorithm for discrete distribution
estimation in the shuffle model of privacy [CSUZZ19].

arbitrary semialgebraic functions of bounded description complexity as gates.
In particular, such circuits can use all arithmetic operations +, -, x, /,
optimization operations min and max, conditional branching (if-then-else), and
many more. We show that probabilistic circuits using any of these operations as
gates can be simulated by deterministic circuits with only about a quadratical
blowup in size. A not much larger blow up in circuit size is also shown when
derandomizing approximating circuits. The algorithmic consequence, motivating
the title, is that randomness cannot substantially speed up dynamic programming
algorithms.

and the follower choose a spanning tree together, according to different
objective functions. By showing that this problem is NP-hard in general, we
answer an open question stated by Shi et al. We prove that BMST remains hard
even in the special case where the follower only controls a matching. Moreover,
by a polynomial reduction from the vertex-disjoint Steiner trees problem, we
give some evidence that BMST might even remain hard in case the follower
controls only few edges.
</p>
<p>On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time $(n-1)$-approximation
algorithm for BMST, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph.
Moreover, considering the number of edges controlled by the follower as
parameter, we show that 2-approximating BMST is fixed-parameter tractable and
that, in case of uniform costs on leader's edges, even solving BMST exactly is
fixed-parameter tractable. We finally consider bottleneck variants of BMST and
settle the complexity landscape of all combinations of sum or bottleneck
objective functions for the leader and follower, for the optimistic as well as
the pessimistic setting.

    <title>Library of efficient algorithms for phylogenetic analysis</title>

phylogenetic analysis, which provides phylogenetic trees computed from allelic
profiles built by sequencing specific regions of the sequences and abstracting
them to categorical indexes. With growing exchanges of people and merchandise,
epidemics have become increasingly important, and combining information of
country-specific datasets can now reveal unknown spreading patterns. The
phylogenetic analysis workflow is mainly composed of four consecutive steps,
the distance calculation, distance correction, inference algorithm, and local
optimization steps. There are many phylogenetic tools out there, however most
implement only some of these steps and serve only one single purpose, such as
one type of algorithm. Another problem with these is that they are often hard
to use and integrate, since each of them has its own API. This project resulted
a library that implements the four steps of the workflow, and is highly
performant, extensible, reusable, and portable, while providing common APIs and
documentation. It also differs from other tools in the sense that, it is able
to stop and resume the workflow whenever the user desires, and it was built to
be continuously extended and not just serve a single purpose. The time
benchmarks conducted on this library show that its implementations of the
algorithms conform to their theoretical time complexity. Meanwhile, the memory
benchmarks showcase that the implementations of the NJ algorithms follow a
linear memory complexity, while the implementations of the MST and GCP
algorithms follow a quadratic memory complexity.

satisfaction problems (CSPs) such as Maximum Independent Set or Minimum Vertex
Cover on sparse graph classes. Baker's approach gives a PTAS on planar graphs,
excluded-minor classes, and beyond. For Max-CSPs, and even more generally,
maximisation finite-valued CSPs (where constraints are arbitrary non-negative
functions), Romero, Wrochna, and \v{Z}ivn\'y~[SODA'21] showed that the
Sherali-Adams LP relaxation gives a simple PTAS for all
fractionally-treewidth-fragile classes, which is the most general "sparsity"
condition for which a PTAS is known. We extend these results to general-valued
CSPs, which include "crisp" (or "strict") constraints that have to be satisfied
by every feasible assignment. The only condition on the crisp constraints is
that their domain contains an element which is at least as feasible as all the
others (but possibly less valuable). For minimisation general-valued CSPs with
crisp constraints, we present a PTAS for all Baker graph classes -- a
definition by Dvo\v{r}\'ak~[SODA'20] which encompasses all classes where
Baker's technique is known to work, except possibly for
fractionally-treewidth-fragile classes. While this is standard for problems
satisfying a certain monotonicity condition on crisp constraints, we show this
can be relaxed to diagonalisability -- a property of relational structures
connected to logics, statistical physics, and random CSPs.

remainder r. Optimizing compilers accelerate software by replacing the division
of n by d with the division of c * n (or c * n + c) by m for convenient
integers c and m chosen so that they approximate the reciprocal: c/m ~= 1/d.
Such techniques are especially advantageous when m is chosen to be a power of
two and when d is a constant so that c and m can be precomputed. The literature
contains many bounds on the distance between c/m and the divisor d. Some of
these bounds are optimally tight, while others are not. Using accessible
mathematics, we present optimally tight bounds for quotient and remainder
computations.

My moderation queue is overflowing right now with “gas the kikes,” “[f-word] [n-words],” “race war now,” “kikes deserve to burn in hell,” “a world without [n-words],” “the day of the rope approaches,” and countless similar contributions.  One commenter focused on how hilarious he found my romantic difficulties earlier in life.</p>



<p>The puzzle, for me, is that I’d spent <em>years</em> denouncing Trump’s gleeful destruction of the country that I grew up believing in, using the strongest language I could muster.  So why am I only <em>now</em> getting all the hate-spam?</p>



<p>Then a possible explanation hit me: namely, the sort of person who’d leave such comments is <em>utterly impervious to moral condemnation</em>.  The only thing such a person cares about—indeed, as it turns out, feels a volcanic need to shout down—is someone articulating an actual plausible path to removing his resentment-fueled minority from power.  If this is right, then I’m proud to have hit a nerve. –SA</p>

But it’s also the state of MD Anderson, often considered the best oncology center on earth, and of Steven Weinberg, possibly the greatest living physicist.

    A video demo of an <em>unadversarial patch</em> for garbage trucks.
    Placing the patch on misclassified garbage trucks significantly
    improves performance and robustness.
</div>

<p>Modern computer vision systems are sensitive to transformations and corruptions
of their inputs, making reliability and safety real concerns at deployment time.
For example, fog or snow can severely impact self-driving cars’ perception
systems; in an <a href="https://gradientscience.org/background">earlier post</a>, we found that even changes in image
background are often enough to cause model misbehavior. Techniques like data
augmentation, domain randomization, and robust training can all improve
robustness, but tend to perform poorly in the face of the unfamiliar
distribution shifts that computer vision systems encounter in the wild.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-make-classifiers-more-robust">How can we make classifiers more robust?</h2>

<p>So far, most approaches to robust machine learning have focussed on better model
training methods. However, there is more than one way to peel a banana. Instead
of tackling the general problem of designing universally robust vision
algorithms, we leverage an additional degree of freedom present in many
real-world scenarios. Specifically, we observe that in many situations, the
system designer not only trains the model used to make predictions, but also has
the ability to modify objects of interest. Critically, such a system designer could
modify objects to improve the model’s performance! For example, a drone
operator training a landing pad detection model can modify the landing pad
surface for easier detection, and a roboticist manipulating custom objects could
alter objects’ texture or geometry to assist with perception. Indeed, a similar
insight motivates QR codes, which are patterns explicitly designed to encode
easily recoverable bits in photographs. In our work, we ask: can we reliably
create objects that <em>augment</em>Note that QR codes don't
really fit the bill here, since they require their own decoder. (For
completeness, we still tested QR codes in our paper and
found them not robust to distribution shift.) the
performance of existing machine learning models on vision tasks like
classification or regression?</p>

<h2 id="designing-objects-for-robust-vision">Designing objects for robust vision</h2>
<p>Research on <a href="https://gradientscience.org/intro_adversarial">adversarial examples</a> has demonstrated that modern vision
models can be extraordinarily sensitive to small changes in input: carefully
chosen yet imperceptible perturbations of natural images can cause models to
make wildly inaccurate predictions. In particular, previous work has shown that
we can perturb objects’ textures so that they induce misclassification when
photographed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533">[Kurakin et al.]</a>. Indeed, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07397">Athalye et al.</a> 3D print a textured 
turtle that looks like a turtle, but classifies as a rifle when shown to a
classifier!</p>

<p>So, given that we can make objects <em>fool</em> ML models, can we also make them <em>help</em>?</p>

<p>The answer is yes! In our work, we turn the same oversensitivity behind
adversarial examples into a tool for robustly solving vision tasks.
Specifically, instead of optimizing inputs to mislead models (as in adversarial
attacks), we optimize inputs to reinforce correct behavior, yielding what we
refer to as <em>unadversarial examples</em> or <em>robust objects</em>.</p>

<p>We demonstrate that even a simple gradient-based algorithm can successfully
construct unadversarial examples for a variety of vision settings. In fact, by
optimizing objects for vision systems (rather than only vice-versa) we can
greatly improve performance on both in-distribution data and previously unseen
out-of-distribution data. For example, as illustrated below, optimizing the
texture of a 3D-modelled jet enables the image classifier to classify that jet
more robustly under various weather conditions, despite never being exposed to
such conditions in training:</p>

<p><img alt="Example of unadversarial example (jet)" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/unadversarial/headline_fig.png"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
    In our work, we demonstrate that optimizing objects (e.g., the
    pictured jet) for pre-trained neural networks can significantly boost
    performance and robustness on computer vision tasks.
</div>

<p>The model correctly classifies both the original jet and its unadversarial
counterpart in standard conditions, but recognizes only the unadversarial jet in
foggy and dusty conditions.</p>

<h2 id="constructing-unadversarial-examples">Constructing unadversarial examples</h2>
<p>Our paper proposes two ways of designing robust objects: unadversarial
stickers (patches), and unadversarial textures:</p>

<p><img alt="Example of unadversarial patch and unadversarial texture" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/unadversarial/patch_vs_texture.png"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
    Examples of the two considered methods for constructing unadversarial objects.
</div>

<p>As with adversarial examples, we construct both unadversarial patches and
textures via gradient descent. In both cases, we need a pre-trained vision model
to optimize objects for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Unadversarial patches</strong>: To construct/train unadversarial patches, we repeatedly
sample natural images from a given dataset, and place a patch onto the sampled
image (with random orientation and position) corresponding to the label of the
image. We then feed the augmented image into the pre-trained vision model, and
use gradient descent to minimize the standard classification loss of the model
with respect to the patch pixels. The procedure is almost identical to that of
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09665">Brown et al.</a> for constructing <em>adversarial</em>
patches; the main difference is that here we minimize, rather than maximize,
the loss of the pre-trained model.</li>
  <li><strong>Unadversarial textures</strong>: To construct adversarial textures, we start with a 3D
mesh of the object we would like to optimize, as well as a dataset of
background images. At each iteration, we render the current unadversarial
texture onto the 3D mesh, and overlay the rendering onto a random background
image. The result is fed to the pre-trained classifier, and we (again) use
gradient descent to minimize the classification loss with respect to the
texture. In previous work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07397">Athalye et al.</a>
use an extremely similar approach to optimize <em>adversarial</em> textures (the most
famous example of which being the 
<a href="https://www.labsix.org/physical-objects-that-fool-neural-nets/">rifle turtle</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evaluating-unadversarial-examples">Evaluating unadversarial examples</h2>
<p>After designing our unadversarial examples, we evaluate them in two ways. First,
we want to ensure that classifiers still maintain (or improve on) high accuracy
levels on standard benchmarks augmented with unadversarial examples. Second, we
want to understand the extent to which patches confer robustness to
<em>out-of-distribution</em> samples—how well do models perform on patches under
distribution shifts, despite such shifts never being considered in training?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, we first test our methods on standard datasets
(ImageNet and CIFAR) and robustness benchmarks (CIFAR10-C, ImageNet-C). It turns
out that adding unadversarial patches to ImageNet dataset boosts the ImageNet
accuracy as well as the robustness of a pretrained ResNet-18 model under various
corruptions!</p>

<p><img alt="Performance on ImageNet and ImageNet-C" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/unadversarial/benchmark_performance.png"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
Accuracy on (a) clean ImageNet images and (b) synthetically corrupted
ImageNet-C images as a function of patch size (given as a percentage of image
area). In (b), each bar denotes the average accuracy over the five severities
in ImageNet-C, and the horizontal dashed lines report the accuracy on the
original (non-patched) datasets.
</div>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12235">paper</a>,
we also compare to some non-optimization based baselines,
like QR code-based augmentation and predetermined patches; unadversarial patches
comfortably outperform all of the baselines we tested.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-robust-objects-fare-in-more-realistic-settings">How do robust objects fare in more realistic settings?</h2>
<p>The promising results we observe on standard classification and synthetic
corruption benchmarks motivate us to consider more realistic tasks. To this end,
we extend our evaluation to consider unadversarial examples in three additional
settings: (a) classifying objects in a high-fidelity renderer, (b) localizing
objects in a drone-landing simulator, and (c) recognizing objects in the real
world. In the first two (simulated) settings, we optimize over objects’ textures
directly and simulate weather conditions in the renderings themselves. In the
final setting, we print out patches designed for ImageNet and study how well
they aid classification when photographed on real world objects.</p>

<h3 id="a-recognizing-objects-in-a-high-fidelity-simulator">A) Recognizing Objects in a High-Fidelity Simulator</h3>
<p>We first test how well unadversarial examples aid recognition of
three-dimensional objects in a high-fidelity simulator. Generating unadversarial
textures for objects corresponding to ImageNet classes, such as “warplane” and
“automobile,” we then use Microsoft AirSim to evaluate how well the
unadversarial textures help classification in both standard and severe weather
conditions—like fog and snow (note that in AirSim these weather conditions are
explicitly simulated in the 3D scene, and not applied through image
post-processing). We observe that our unadversarial models are much more
recognizable than their original counterparts by the pre-trained ImageNet model,
especially under distribution shift. For example, our unadversarial jet beats
the baselines “Bright Jet” and “Dark Jet,” textures manually designed with the
goal of visibility in severe weather) in a variety of weather conditions and
severities:</p>

<div class="footnote">
The jet unadversarial example task. We show example conditions under which we
evaluate the objects, along with aggregate statistics for how well an
ImageNet classifier classifies the objects in different conditions.
</div>

<h3 id="b-localization-for-simulated-drone-landing">B) Localization for (Simulated) Drone Landing</h3>
<p>We then take the realism of our simulations a step further by training
unadversarial patches for a simulated drone landing task. The drone is equipped
with a pre-trained regression model that localizes the landing pad. To improve
localization, we place an unadversarial patch on the pad and optimize it by
minimizing a squared error loss (instead of a classification loss as in the
previous experiments) corresponding to the drone’s error in predicting landing
pad location. We then evaluate the effectiveness of the patch by examining  the
landing success rate in clear, moderate, and severe (simulated) weather
conditions. As shown below, we find that the unadversarial landing pad improves
landing success rate across all conditions:</p>

<p>Finally, we study unadversarial examples’ generalization to the physical world.
Printing out unadversarial patches, we place them on top of real-world objects
and classify these object-patch pairs along a diverse set of viewpoints and
object orientations. Our results are detailed below; we find that the
unadversarial patches consistently improve performance despite printing
artifacts, lighting conditions, partial visibility, and other naturally-arising
distribution shifts.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>We have shown that it is possible to design objects that improve the performance
of computer vision models, even under strong and unforeseen corruptions and
distribution shifts. By minimizing the standard loss of a pre-trained model,
without training for robustness to anything specific, we significantly boosted
both model performance and model robustness across a variety of tasks and
settings. Our results suggest that designing unadversarial inputs could be a
promising route towards increasing reliability and out-of-distribution
robustness of computer vision models.</p></div>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Dear TCS students:<br/><br/>By now, it is hard to overestimate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic to society. However, like every challenge, it has created some opportunities. For example, essentially all major conferences in TCS this year have been transformed into virtual ones, making them more accessible to scholars/students across the world (of course at the expense of traditional interactions). <br/><br/>ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA21) will be held virtually this year, on Jan. 10 – 13, 2021. As you may know, this is the premier conference on algorithms .<br/><br/>See <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda21" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda21</a><br/><br/>Thanks to our industry partners and ACM SIGACT group, SODA has some funds for covering student registrations. I am writing to informing you this opportunity and encourage you to apply:<br/> See: <br/>1. <a href="https://awards.siam.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://awards.siam.org/</a> <br/>2. <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/lodging-and-support/travel-support/soda21-travel-support" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/lodging-and-support/travel-support/soda21-travel-support</a><br/>That deadline is Dec. 27, 2020. Like before, having papers in SODA is not prerequisite.<br/><br/>Shang-Hua Teng<br/>On Behalf of SODA Steering Committee<br/></p></div>

<h2>The news</h2>
<p>Yuansi Chen gave an almost constant bounds for Bourgain’s 1984 slicing problem and for the Kannan-Lovasz-Simonovits 1995 conjecture. In this post I will describe these conjectures.</p>
<p>Unrelated cheerful news: Here is <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-mathematicians-adventure-through-the-physical-world-20201216/">a very nice Quanta article</a> by Kevin Hartnett on Lauren Williams, the positive Grassmannian and connections to physics. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/the-simplex-the-cyclic-polytope-the-positroidron-the-amplituhedron-and-beyond/">this related 2015 post</a>.)</p>
<h2>Bourgain’s slicing problem</h2>
<p><strong>Bourgain’s slicing problem (1984):</strong>  Is there <em>c &gt; 0</em> such that for any dimension n and any centrally symmetric convex body <em>K ⊆</em> <img alt="\mathbb R^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb R^n"/> of volume one, there exists a hyperplane <em>H</em> such that the<em> (n − 1)-</em>dimensional volume of <em>K ∩ H</em> is at least <em>c</em>?</p>
<p>Vitali Milman <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEobqGkNrtAhUJ3IUKHeerBUMQFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weizmann.ac.il%2Fmath%2Fklartag%2Fsites%2Fmath.klartag%2Ffiles%2Fuploads%2Fbourgain_slicing_problem.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Rq7Rw9I4wbSUIyTUCAn08">wrote</a>: <span style="color: #0000ff;">“I was told once by Jean that he had spent more time on this problem and had dedicated more efforts to it than to any other problem he had ever worked on.”  </span></p>
<p>A positive answer to the problem is sometimes referred to as the hyperplane conjecture. Bourgain himself proved in the late 1980s that  the answer is yes if <img alt="c=1/n^{1/4}\log n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3D1%2Fn%5E%7B1%2F4%7D%5Clog+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="c=1/n^{1/4}\log n"/> and twenty years later Boaz Klartag shaved away the log<em>n </em>factor. For more on the problem see <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEobqGkNrtAhUJ3IUKHeerBUMQFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weizmann.ac.il%2Fmath%2Fklartag%2Fsites%2Fmath.klartag%2Ffiles%2Fuploads%2Fbourgain_slicing_problem.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Rq7Rw9I4wbSUIyTUCAn08">this article by Boaz Klartag and Vitali Milman</a> and for the history see the moving foreword  by Vitali Milman.</p>
<p>Yuansi Chen’s result (combined with an earlier result of Klartag and Ronen) asserts that c can be taken as <img alt="n^{-o(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B-o%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n^{-o(1)}"/>.</p>
<h2>Computing the volume of convex sets and the 1995 Kannan-Lovasz-Simonovits conjecture</h2>
<p>Kannan, Lovász and Simonovits (KLS) conjectured  in 1995 that for any distribution that is<br/>
log-concave, the Cheeger isoperimetric coefficient equals to that achieved by half-spaces up to a universal constant factor.  The crucial point here is that the constant does not depend on the dimension.</p>
<p>Let <em>K</em> be a convex body of volume one in <img alt="\mathbb R^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb R^n"/> and consider the uniform probability distribution on <em>K</em>. Given a subset <em>A</em> of <em>K</em> of volume <em>t≤1/2</em> we can ask what is the surface <em>S(A)</em> area of <img alt="A \cap int K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Ccap+int+K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="A \cap int K"/>. (We don’t want to consider points in the surface of <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="K"/> itself.)   Let <img alt="f_K(t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_K%28t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f_K(t)"/> be the minimum value of <em>S(A)</em> for subsets of volume <em>t</em>. The Cheeger constant or the expansion constant is the minimum value of <em>f(t)/t. </em>The KAS conjecture asserts that up to a universal constant independent from the dimension the Cheeger constant is realized by separating <em>K </em>with a hyperplane! (The conjecture is also called the Kannan, Lovász and Simonovits hyperplane conjecture.)</p>
<p>The motivation for the KMS conjecture came from a major 1990 breakthrough in the theory of algorithms. Dyer, Frieze, and Kannan found a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the volume of a convex set K in <img alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb R^d"/>.  Kannan, Lovász and Simonovich (later joined by Santosh Vampala) wrote a series of ingenious papers where they improved the exponents of the polynomial and in the process introduced new methods for proving rapid mixing of Markov chains and new Euclidean isoperimetric results and conjectures.</p>
<p>As it turned out the KLS conjecture implies Bourgain’s hyperplane conjecture and also the “thin-shell conjecture” that  I will not describe here.</p>
<p>Yuansi Chen’s proved  an almost constant lower bound <img alt="d^{o(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d^{o(1)}"/> of the isoperimetric coefficient in the KLS conjecture!</p>
<p>This also gives faster mixing time bounds of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms on log-concave measures.</p>

But let me very briefly mention a few related matters.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are interesting negative results regarding volume computations, see the 1987 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02187886">Barany Furedi’s paper</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2634">Ronen Eldan’s 2009 paper</a></li>
<li>It is a very interesting question (that I heard from Moshe Vardi) to understand the connection between practice and theory regarding Markov chain Monte Carlo<br/>
(MCMC) sampling algorithms e.g. for approximating permanents and volumes.</li>
<li>Related topics are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvoretzky%27s_theorem">Dvoretzky’s theorem</a>, Milman’s theorem, isotropic position, the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_measure"> concentration of measure phenomenon,</a> asymptotic convex geometry.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Busseman-Petty problem</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busemann%E2%80%93Petty_problem">The Busseman-Petty problem</a> from 1956 asks whether it is true that a symmetric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_body" title="Convex body">convex body</a> with larger central hyperplane sections has a larger volume. So the question was  if <em>K</em> and <em>L</em> are centrally symmetric problems and all hyperplane sections of <em>K</em> (through the origin)  have a larger volume than those of L, is it true that the volume of <em>K</em> is larger than that of L.  Busemann and Petty showed that the answer is positive if <i>K</i> is a ball. (A positive answer when L is a ball would have given a very strong version of the slicing conjecture.) But the answer is negative for dimensions larger than or equal to 5.</p>
<p>Here is a brief history:</p>
<p>Larman and Rogers constructed a counterexample in dimension 12 in their example L was a ball and K was a perturbation of a ball. Ball showed that taking L to be a ball and K the standard cube gives a counterexample in dimension 10;  <span class="text">Giannopoulos and</span> Bourgain gave counterexamples in dimension 7   and Papadimitrakis finally found a counterexample in dimension 5. Gardner gave a  positive for answer for dimensions 3  Zhang gave a positive solution for dimension 4. Erwin Lutwak’s theory of intersection bodies plays an important role in the solution.  Gardner, Koldobskiy, and Schlumprecht presented a unified solution in all dimensions.</p>
<p>This is a really beautiful story and was saw a slice of the story in our <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/test-your-intuition2/">second “test your intuition”</a>.  In the late 90s I had a “what is new” corner on my homepage and I remember devoting it to some of these developments.</p>

    <title>TR20-188 |  Hard QBFs for Merge Resolution | 

	Olaf Beyersdorff, 

	Joshua Blinkhorn, 

	Meena Mahajan, 

	Tomáš Peitl, 

	Gaurav Sood</title>
    <summary>We prove the first proof size lower bounds for the proof system Merge Resolution (MRes [Olaf Beyersdorff et al., 2020]), a refutational proof system for prenex quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) with a CNF matrix. Unlike most QBF resolution systems in the literature, proofs in MRes consist of resolution steps together with information on countermodels, which are syntactically stored in the proofs as merge maps. As demonstrated in [Olaf Beyersdorff et al., 2020], this makes MRes quite powerful: it has strategy extraction by design and allows short proofs for formulas which are hard for classical QBF resolution systems.

Here we show the first exponential lower bounds for MRes, thereby uncovering limitations of MRes. Technically, the results are either transferred from bounds from circuit complexity (for restricted versions of MRes) or directly obtained by combinatorial arguments (for full MRes). Our results imply that the MRes approach is largely orthogonal to other QBF resolution models such as the QCDCL resolution systems QRes and QURes and the expansion systems ?Exp+Res and IR.</summary>

    <title>Dr Jill Biden</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>(I was helped on this post by Gorjan Alagic, Andrew Childs,  Tom Goldstein, Daniel Gottsman, Clyde Kruskal,  Jon Katz. I emailed them for their thoughts on the issue and some of those thoughts are embedded in the post. ) </p><p>The First First Lady to have a college degree was Lucy Hayes (Rutherford B Hayes was Prez 1876-1880). Nickname: Lemonade Lucy since she did not serve alcohol. </p><p>Trivia: who was the last first lady to not have a college degree? I'll answer that one at the end of this post. </p><p>The First First Lady to keep her day job was Abigail Fillmore who was a teacher. (Millard Fillmore was Prez in 1850-1852. He became prez  after Zachary Taylor died in office) . </p><p>In recent times it is  uncommon for a first lady to have a day job. So much so that it was notable when Elizabeth Dole said that if her husband (Bob Dole) won in 1996 she would keep her job at the Red Cross. </p><p>For other first lady firsts  see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_First_Lady_firsts#:~:text=Grace%20Coolidge,-Main%20article%3A%20Grace&amp;text=First%20first%20lady%20to%20earn%20a%20four%2Dyear%20undergraduate%20degree.">here</a>.</p><p>Jill Biden is the First First Lady to have a PhD. (ADDED LATER- one of the comments pointed out that she has an Ed. D, Doctor of Education.)   She says she will keep her day job as a professor.  Four other First ladies had advanced degrees: Pat Nixon (MS in Education), Laura Bush (MS in Library Science), Hillary Clinton (Law degree), Michelle Obama (Law degree). If I missed any, let me know. </p><p>The WSJ had an op-ed  that said Jill Biden should not call herself `Dr'.  Inspired by that, here are thoughts on the use of the word `Dr'</p><p>1) At the 1986 Structures Conference (now Complexity Conference ) Lane Hemachandra (now Lane Hemaspaandra) gave a talk. He had just gotten his PhD a few weeks ago, so he was introduced as `DOCTOR Lane Hemchandra' Gee, most of the talks were by people with PhD's but were not introduced as such.</p><p>2) Most people I know within academia do not call themselves Dr since it sounds pretentious. However, speaking in public about an issue one might want to use `Dr' to signal that you...know stuff. However, it would be odd for a PhD in (say) linguistics to claim he knows a lot about (say) politics. It has been said: an Intellectual is someone who is an expert in one field and pontificates in another field. </p><p>3) Does the general public think of DOCTOR as Medical Doctor? Probably yes. There are some exceptions: Dr. Martin Luther King and Dr. Henry Kissinger. Also, I think it is  more common in Psychology, pharmacy, education, and counseling to call yourself `Doctor'  </p><p>4) The article also criticized her PhD (in education, about community colleges) as `useless' . If that's the reason to not call her doctor than I shudder to think what the WSJ would think of degrees in, say, set theory with an emphasis on Large Cardinals. GEE, you can't call yourself  DOCTOR since your degree is on Ramsey Cardinals. OH, now they found an application, so now you CAN call yourself DOCTOR. OH, the application is to extending the Canonical Ramsey Theory from Polish spaces  to meta- compact  cardinals, so we can't call you DOCTOR after all. Do we really want to go down this path? </p><p>5) I ask all of the following non-rhetorically:  Did the author read her PhD thesis? Is he qualified to judge it? Did he (as one should do) look at her entire body of work to judge her? What point is he trying to make anyway? </p><p>6) Should Dr. Who call themselves a doctor? Are they  a medical doctor? PhD? If so, in what? Is `Who' part of their name? For other TV and movie tropes about the use of the word doctor, see <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/NotThatKindOfDoctor">here</a>.</p><p>7) I avoid saying I am a doctor since people will then ask me about the medical condition.</p><p>I avoid saying I am a computer scientist since people will then ask me how to help them with their Facebook privacy settings. </p><p>I avoid saying I am a mathematician since people will ask me to help their daughter with her trigonometry. </p><p>8) The answer to my trivia question: The last first lady to not have a college degree: Melania Trump. She went to college for a year and then left. The one before her was Barbara Bush who also went for a year and then left. </p><p>ADDED LATER: Many supervillians who don't have a PhD or an MD call themselves `Doctor', see <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/donnad/11-super-villains-masquerading-as-doctors">here</a>. Why no outrage about this? Because (1) they are fictional, and (2) imagine the scenario: Not only does Dr. Doom want to take over the world, he also doesn't even have a PhD or an MD!</p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>Optimization is as hard as approximation</title>
    <summary>Optimization is a key tool in machine learning, where the goal is to achieve the best possible objective function value in a minimum amount of time.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Optimization is a key tool in machine learning, where the goal is to achieve the best possible objective function value in a minimum amount of time. Obtaining any form of global guarantees can usually be done with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization">convex</a> objective functions, or with special cases such as risk minimization with one-hidden over-parameterized layer neural networks (see the <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-neural-networks-global-convergence/">June post</a>). In this post, I will consider low-dimensional problems (imagine 10 or 20), with no constraint on running time (thus get ready for some running-times that are exponential in dimension!).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider minimizing a function \(f\) on a bounded subset  \(\mathcal{X}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^d\), based only on function evaluations, a problem often referred to as zero-th order optimization or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization">derivative-free optimization</a>. No convexity is assumed, so we should not expect fast rates, and, again, no efficient algorithms that can provably find a global minimizer. Good references on what I am going to cover in this post are [1, 2, 5].</p>



<p class="justify-text">One may wonder why this is interesting at all. Clearly, such algorithms are not made to be used to find millions of parameters for logistic regression or neural networks, but they are often used for hyperparameter tuning (regularization parameters, size of neural network layer, etc.). See, e.g., [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/05311655a15b75fab86956663e1819cd-Paper.pdf">6</a>] for applications.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are going to assume some regularity for the functions we want to minimize, typically bounded derivatives. We will thus assume that \(f \in \mathcal{F}\), for a space \(\mathcal{F}\) of functions from \(\mathcal{X}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\). We are going to take a worst-case approach, where we characterize convergence over all members of \(\mathcal{F}\).  That is, we want our guarantees to hold for <em>all</em> functions in \(\mathcal{F}\). Note that this worst-case analysis may not predict well what’s happening for a particular function; in particular, it is (by design) pessimistic.</p>



<p class="justify-text">An algorithm \(\mathcal{O}\) will be characterized by (a) the choice of points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathcal{X}\) to query the function, and (b) the algorithm to output a candidate \(\hat{x} \in \mathcal{X}\) such that \(f(\hat{x}) \ – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)  \) is small. The estimate \(\hat{x}\) can only depend on \((x_i,f(x_i))\), for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\). In most of this post, the choice of points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) is made once (without seeing any function values). We show later in this blog post that going <em>adaptive</em>, where the point \(x_{i+1}\) is selected after seeing \((x_j,f(x_j))\) for all \(j \leqslant i\), does not bring much (at least in the worst-case sense).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given a selection of points and the algorithm \(\mathcal{O}\), the rate of convergence is the supremum over all functions \(f \in \mathcal{F}\) of the error \(f(\hat{x}) \ – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\). This is a function \(\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{O})\) of the number \(n\) of sampled points (and of the the class of functions \(\mathcal{F}\)). The optimal algorithm (minimizing \(\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{O})\)) will lead to a rate we denote \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm opt}\), and which we aim to characterize.</p>



<h2>Direct lower/upper bounds for Lipschitz-continuous functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The argument is particularly simple for a bounded metric space \(\mathcal{X}\) with distance \(d\), and \(\mathcal{F}\) the class of \(L\)-Lipschitz-continuous functions, that is, such that for all \(x,x’ \in \mathcal{X}\), \(|f(x) -f(x’)| \leqslant L d(x,x’)\). This is a very large set of functions, so expect weak convergence rates.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Set covers. </strong>We will need to cover the set \(\mathcal{X}\) with balls of a given radius. The minimal radius \(r\) of a cover of \(\mathcal{X}\) by \(n\) balls of radius \(r\) is denoted \(r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\). This corresponds to \(n\) ball centers \(x_1,\dots,x_n\). See example below for the unit cube \(\mathcal{X} = [0,1]^2\) and the metric obtained from the \(\ell_\infty\)-norm, with \(n = 16\), and \(r_n([0,1]^2,\ell_\infty) = 1/8\). See more details on covering numbers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_number">here</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5187" height="269" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cover-1024x1024.png" width="269"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">More generally, for the unit cube \(\mathcal{X} = [0,1]^d\), we have \(r_n([0,1]^d,\ell_\infty) \approx \frac{1}{2} n^{-1/d}\) (which is not an approximation where \(n\) is the \(d\)-th power of an integer). For other normed metrics, (since all norms are equivalent) the scaling as \(r_n \sim {\rm diam} (\mathcal{X}) n^{-1/d}\) is the same on any bounded set in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (with an extra constant that depends on \(d\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Algorithm. </strong>Given the ball centers \(x_1,\dots,x_n\), outputting the minimum of function values \(f(x_i)\) for \(i=1,\dots,n\), leads to an error which is less than \(L r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\), as the optimal \(x_\ast \in \mathcal{X}\) is at most at distance \(r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\) from one of the cluster centers, let’s say \(x_k\), and thus \(f(x_k)\  – f(x_\ast) \leqslant L d(x_k,x_\ast) \leqslant L r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\). This provides an upper-bound on \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm opt}\). The algorithm we just described seems naive, but it turns out to be optimal for this class of problems.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lower-bound.</strong> Consider any optimization algorithm, with its first \(n\) point queries and its estimate \(\hat{x}\). By considering the functions which are zero in these \(n+1\) points, the algorithm outputs zero. We now simply need to construct a function \(f \in \mathcal{F}\) such that \(f\) is zero at these points, but maximally smaller than zero at a different point. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Consider a cover of \(\mathcal{X}\) with \(n+2\) balls of minimal radius  (equal to \(r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\)), there has to exist at least one of the \(n+2\) corresponding ball centers such that the corresponding ball contains no points from the algorithm (denote by \(y\) its center). We can then construct the function $$ f(x)  = \ – L \big( r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) \ – d(x,y) \big)_+ = \ – L \max \big\{  r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) \ – d(x,y) ,0 \big\}, $$ which is zero on all points of the algorithm and the output point \(\hat{x}\), and with minimum value \(– L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\) attained at \(y\). Thus, we must have \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \geqslant 0 \ – (\ – L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) ) = L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\). This difficult function is plotted below in one dimension.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5260" height="73" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lowerbound-1-1024x178.png" width="423"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, the performance of any algorithm from \(n\) function values has to be larger than \(L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\).  Thus, so far, we have shown that $$L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) \leqslant \varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \leqslant L r_{n}(\mathcal{X},d).$$  For \(\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d\), \(r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\) is typically of order \({\rm diam}(\mathcal{X}) n^{-1/d}\), and thus the difference between \(n\) and \(n+2\) above is negligible. Note that the rate in \(n^{-1/d}\) is <strong>very</strong> slow, and symptomatic of the classical curse of dimensionality. The appearance of a covering number is not totally random here, as we will see below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Random search.</strong> We can have a similar bound up to logarithmic terms for random search, that is, after selecting independently \(n\) points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\), uniformly at random in \(\mathcal{X}\), and selecting the points with smallest function value \(f(x_i)\). The performance can be shown to be proportional to \(L {\rm diam}(\mathcal{X}) ( \log n )^{1/d} n^{-1/d}\) in high probability, leading to an extra logarithmic term (the proof can be obtained with a simple covering argument, as shown at the end of the post). Therefore, random search is optimal up to logarithmic terms for this very large class of functions to optimize.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We would like to go beyond Lipschitz-continuous functions, and study if we can leverage smoothness, and hopefully avoid the dependence in \(n^{-1/d}\). This can be done by a somewhat surprising equivalence between worst case guarantees from optimization and worst case guarantees for uniform approximation.</p>



<h2>Optimization is as hard as uniform function approximation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now also consider the problem of outputting a whole function \(\hat{f} \in \mathcal{F}\), such that \(\|f – \hat{f}\|_\infty = \max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} | \hat{f}(x)\ – f(x)|\) is as small as possible. For any approximation algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) that builds an estimate \(\hat{f} \in \mathcal{F}\) from \(n\) function values, we can define its convergence rate in the same way as for optimization algorithm \(\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{A})\), as a function of \(n\). The optimal approximation algorithm has a convergence rate denoted by \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm app}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From approximation to optimization. </strong>Clearly, an approximation algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) leads to an optimization algorithm \(\mathcal{O}\) with at most twice the same rate, that is, $$  \varepsilon_n(\mathcal{O}) \leqslant 2\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{A}),$$ by simply approximating \(f\) by \(\hat{f}\) and outputting any \(\hat{x} \in \arg \min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \hat{f}(x)\), for which $$f(\hat{x})  \leqslant \hat{f}(\hat{x}) + \| \hat{f}\ – f\|_\infty =  \min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \hat{f}(x) + \| \hat{f}\  – f\|_\infty \leqslant \min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} {f}(x) +2  \| \hat{f} \ – f\|_\infty. $$ See an illustration below (with a function estimated from the values at green points), with the candidate minimizer in orange.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5268" height="254" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/optim_approx-1024x553.png" width="470"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Thus in terms of worst-case performance, we get $$ \varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \leqslant 2\varepsilon_n^{\rm app}.$$ Intuitively, it seems that this upper-bound should be very loose, as approximating uniformly a function, in particular far from its minimum, seems useless for minimization. For worst-case performance, this intuition is incorrect… Indeed, the optimal rate for optimization with \(n\) function evaluations happens to be greater than the optimal rate for approximation with \(n+1\) function evaluations, which we will now show.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lower-bound on optimization performance. </strong>We will need an extra assumption, namely that the function space \(\mathcal{F}\) is convex and symmetric (and bounded in uniform norm).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider an optimization algorithm over the class of function \(\mathcal{F}\), that is considering \(n\) observation points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\), and an estimate \(\hat{x}\). The worst-case performance over all functions in \(\mathcal{F}\) is greater than over the (smaller) class of functions for which \(f(x_1) = \cdots = f(x_n) = f(\hat{x}) = 0\). Given that the performance measure is \(f(\hat{x})\  – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\), the performance is greater than the supremum of  \(– \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\) over functions in \(\mathcal{F}\) such that \(f(x_1) = \cdots = f(x_n) = f(\hat{x}) = 0\). For Lipschitz-continuous functions above, we built explicitly a hard function. In the general case, an explicit construction is not that easy, but we will relate the construction of such a function to the general approximation problem.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As we just saw, the optimal rate of the optimization algorithm is greater than $$\inf_{x_1,\dots,\, x_{n+1} \in \, \mathcal{X}} \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}, \ f(x_1)\ =\ \cdots \ = \ f(x_{n+1}) \ =\ 0} – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x) . $$ The quantity above characterizes how small a function can be when equal to zero on \(n+1\) points. When the set of function \(\mathcal{F}\) is centrally symmetric, that is \(f \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow \ – f \in \mathcal{F}\), we can replace \(– \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\) in the expression above by \(\| f\|_\infty\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that for convex and centrally symmetric spaces \(\mathcal{F}\) of functions, this happens to be the optimal rate of approximation with \(n+1\) function evaluations. This is sometimes referred to as Smolyak’s lemma [3], which we state here (see a very nice and short proof in [4]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Smolyak’s lemma. </strong>We consider a space of functions \(\mathcal{F}\) which is convex and centrally symmetric. Then:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>For any \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathcal{X}\), the optimal approximation method, that is the optimal map \(\mathcal{S}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathcal{F}\), i.e., an algorithm that computes \(\hat{f} = \mathcal{S}(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)) \in \mathcal{F}\), is <em>linear</em>, that is, there exist functions \(g_1,\dots,g_n: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) such that $$\mathcal{S}(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) g_i.$$</li><li>The optimal rate of uniform approximation in \(\mathcal{F}\) is equal to $$ \displaystyle \varepsilon_n^{\rm app} = \inf_{x_1,\dots,\, x_{n} \in \, \mathcal{X}} \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}, \ f(x_1)\ =\ \cdots \ = \ f(x_{n}) \ =\ 0} \| f \|_\infty.$$</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, we have “shown” that: $$ \varepsilon_{n+1}^{\rm app} \leqslant \varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \leqslant 2\varepsilon_n^{\rm app}, $$ that is, optimization is at most twice as hard as uniform approximation (still in the worst-case sense). We can now consider examples of uniform approximation algorithms to get optimization algorithms.</p>



<h2>Examples and optimal algorithms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As seen above, we simply need algorithms that approximate the function in uniform norm, and then we minimize the approximation. This is computationally optimal in terms of access to function evaluations (but clearly not in terms of computational complexity).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lipschitz-continuous functions.</strong> One can check that with \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) the centers of the cover above, and a piecewise constant function on each of the ball (with arbitrary values at intersections), then we have $$ \| \hat{f} \, – f \|_\infty \leqslant L   r_n(\mathcal{X},d),$$ which is a standard approximation result using covering numbers. We recover the result above directly from the cover argument (and here the sharper result that the rates of uniform approximation and optimization are asymptotically the same for this class of functions).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Smooth functions in one dimension.</strong> For simplicity, I will focus on the one-dimensional problem, where all concepts are simpler, some of them directly extend to higher dimensions, some of them don’t.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider \(\mathcal{X} = [0,1]\). The simplest interpolation techniques are piecewise constant and piecewise affine interpolations. That is, if we observe \(0 = x_1 \leqslant \cdots \leqslant x_n = 1\), we consider \(\hat{f}\) defined on \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\) as $$\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{2}f(x_i) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_{i+1}) $$ </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5286" height="152" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/interpolation_constant-2-1024x451.png" width="339"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">or $$ \hat{f}(x) = f(x_i) + \frac{ x\  – x_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}\big[ f(x_{i+1})\ – f(x_i) \big].$$</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5287" height="144" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/interpolation_affine-1024x449.png" width="324"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">If we assume that \(f\) is twice differentiable with second-derivative bounded by \(M_2\), then, we can show that on \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\), we have for piecewise affine interpolation: $$ | f(x) \ – \hat{f}(x) | \leqslant \frac{M_2}{8} | x_{i+1} – x_i |^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">If we assume that \(f\) is differentiable with first-derivative bounded by \(M_1\), then, we can show that on \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\), we have for piecewise affine or constant interpolation: $$ | f(x) \ – \hat{f}(x) | \leqslant \frac{M_1}{2} | x_{i+1} – x_i |.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to, when \(x_i = (i-1)/(n-1)\), to uniform error in \(O(1/n)\) for functions with a bound on a single derivative and or \(O(1/n^2)\) for two derivatives. Thus, we see two effects, that are common in approximations problems: (a) the more regular the function to approximate, the better the approximation rate, (b) If we consider a method tailored to smoother functions, it often works well for less smooth functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Explicit piecewise affine interpolation is harder to perform in higher dimensions, where other techniques can be used as presented below, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel methods</a> (again!).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Going high-dimensional with kernel methods.</strong> We assume that we have a positive definite kernel \(k: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), and, given the \(n\) elements \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) of \(\mathcal{X}\) and function values \(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)\), we look for the interpolating function \(f\) in the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space with minimum norm. By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a>, it has to be of the form \(\sum_{i=1}^n  \alpha_i k(x,x_i)\). Since it has to interpolate, we must have \(K\alpha = y\) and thus \(\alpha = K^{-1} y\), where \(y_i = f(x_i)\) for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\), and \(K\) the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix. Thus, interpolation can then be easily done in higher dimensions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev spaces</a> are commonly used in the interpolation context, and for \(s\) square-integrable derivatives, for \(s &gt; d/2\), they are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. See below for examples of interpolations with various Sobolev spaces and increasing number of interpolating points, where the approximation errors (in uniform norm) are computed. With \(s=1\), we recover piecewise affine interpolation, but smoother functions are obtained for \(s=2\).</p>

<p class="justify-text"><strong>Optimal rates of approximation.</strong> With the method defined above, we can obtain the optimal rates of approximation (and hence of optimization) of \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm app} \approx \displaystyle \frac{1}{n^{m/d}}\), for the set of functions with \(m\) bounded derivatives. Thus, for very smooth functions, we can escape the curse of dimensionality (that is, obtain a power of \(n\) that does not decay too slowly). See [1] for more details.</p>



<h2>The powerlessness of adaptivity</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The critical reader may argue that the algorithm set-up described in this post is too simple: the points at which we take function values are decided once and for all, independently of the observed function values. Clearly, some form of adaptivity should beat random search. The sad truth is that the bound for worst-case performance is the same… up to a factor of 2 at most (still in the worst-case sense).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The argument is essentially the same as for non-adaptive algorithms: for the Lipschitz-continuous example, our hard function can also be built for adaptive algorithms, while for the general case, it simply turns out that the rate for adaptive approximation is exactly the same than for adaptive approximation [4].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, adaptive and non-adaptive approximations are just a factor of two of each other. Note that given the practical success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization">Bayesian optimization</a> (which is one instance of adaptive optimization) on some problems, there could be at least two explanations (choose the one you prefer, or find a new one): (1) the worst-case analysis can be too pessimistic, or (2) what is crucial in Bayesian optimization is not the adaptive choice of points to evaluate the function, but the adaptivity to smoothness of the function to optimize (that is, if the function has \(m\) derivatives, then the rate is \(n^{-m/d}\), which can be much better than \(n^{-1/d}\)).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I highlighted the strong links between approximation problems and optimization problems. It turns out that the parallel between worst-case performances goes beyond: computing integrals from function evaluations, a problem typically referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration">quadrature</a>, is also as hard. More on this in a future post.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As warned early in the post, the algorithms presented here all have running time that are exponential in dimension, as they either perform random sampling or need to minimize a model of the function to optimize. </p>



<p class="justify-text">The only good news in this post: optimization is hard as approximation, but the scenario is more varied than expected. Indeed approximation can be fast and avoid the curse of dimensionality, at least in the exponent of the rate, when the function is very smooth (indeed, for \(m\)-times differentiable functions, the constant in front of \(n^{-m/d}\) still depends exponentially in \(d\)). It would be nice to catch this property also in an optimization algorithm, with a running time complexity depending polynomially on \(n\) only, and not exponentially in \(d\). Next month, I will present recent work with Alessandro Rudi and Ulysse Marteau-Ferey [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11978">7</a>] that does exactly this, by combining the tasks of interpolation and optimization in a single convex optimization problem.</p>

<h2>Performance of random search</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider sampling independently and uniformly in \(\mathcal{X}\) \(n\) points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\). For a given \(L\)-Lipschitz-continuous function \(f\), with global minimizer \(x\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), we have $$\min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} f(x_i)\  – f(x) \leqslant L \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(x,x_i).$$ Thus, to obtain an upper-bound on performance over all functions \(f\) (and potentially all locations of the global minimizer \(x\)), we need to bound $$\max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(x,x_i).$$ If we have a cover with \(m\) points \(y_1,\dots,y_m\), and radius \(r = r_m(\mathcal{X},d)\), we have $$\max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(x,x_i) \leqslant r + \max_{j  \in \{1,\dots,m\}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(y_j,x_i) .$$ We can then bound the probability that $$ \max_{j \in \{1,\dots,m\}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(y_j,x_i) \geqslant r$$ by the union bound (and using the independence of the \(x_i\)’s) as \(m\) times the \(n\)-th power of the probability that one of the \(x_i\) is not in a given ball of radius \(r\). By a simple volume argument (and assuming that all balls of a given radius have the same volume), this probability is less than \(( 1 – 1/m)\). Thus with probability greater than \(1 – m(1 – 1/m)^n \geqslant 1 – m e^{ – n /m}\) the worst-case performance is less than \(2Lr\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since for normed metrics in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), \(r  \sim m^{-1/d} {\rm diam}(\mathcal{X})\), by selecting \(m = 2n \log n\), we get an overall performance proportional to \( L \big( \frac{ \log n}{n} \big)^{1/d}\) with probability greater than \(1 – \frac{ \log n}{n}\) (which tends to one when \(n\) grows).</p></div>

<em>A dean of engineering</em><br/>
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/12/17/database-and-theory/dean-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17922"><img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-17922" height="173" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/dean-1.jpg?w=180&amp;h=173" width="180"/></a></p>
<p>Jennifer Widom was appointed as the <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2017/02/27/computer-scientist-jennifer-widom-named-dean-stanford-school-engineering/">Dean</a> of Engineering at Stanford not long ago. No doubt her research in databases and her teaching played a major role in her selection. For example, she is known for her contributions to online education including teaching one of the first massive open courses—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCS</a>—which had over 100,000 students.</p>
<p>Today I thought we might highlight her area, databases, and one of its connections to theory.</p>
<p>But first, I was impressed to hear her say in an ACM <a href="https://learning.acm.org/bytecast">podcast</a> that she used punch cards during the start of her career:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> So my passion in high school actually became music, and when it came time to select a college, I chose to go to music school. I’m pretty sure at this point, I’m the only dean of engineering anywhere who has a bachelor’s degree in trumpet performance, but that’s actually what my undergraduate degree is in. Late in my music education, I just sort of randomly took a class called computer applications and music research. And it was a class in the music school about using programming to analyze music, and it was my first exposure to computer programming. I have to say, it’ll reveal my age, but I used punch cards in that class. It was sort of the end of the punch card era. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>I admit to having used these too at the start of my days as an undergrad at <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/univac/cards.html">Case</a> Institute. Do you know what a punch card is?</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/12/17/database-and-theory/case/" rel="attachment wp-att-17901"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17901" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/case.png?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>Ken once had his own experience with punch cards and music. While taking an intro programming course during his sophomore year—taught then by Jeffrey Ullman—Ken and his roommate joined an excursion to NYC for dinner and the New York Philharmonic. Still dressed in suits, on return to Princeton, they descended into the computer center to do their assignment—via punch cards on a batch server. Ken’s roommate got out before 2am, but Ken says he was still fixing punch card typos that ruined runs as late as 4am.</p>
<h2>Data Management</h2>
<p>Widom’s <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/">research</a> has always been in the area of non-traditional databases: semi-structured data, data streams, uncertain data and data provenance.</p>
<p>We theorists view the world as made of questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upper Bounds Can we find a faster algorithm for problem X?</li>
<li>Lower Bounds Can we prove there are no faster algorithms for X? Sometimes we replace “faster” by other complexity measures, but these are the dominant questions we ask.
<p>Widom proposed a notion that is called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-provenance">lineage</a>. Theorists worry about the performance of searching, but this issue is about where did the data come from? See also <a href="http://db.cis.upenn.edu/DL/fsttcs.pdf">provenance</a>.</p>
<p>The insight boils down to garbage in and garbage out, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">GIGO</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> On two occasions I have been asked, “Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?”</em></p>
<p><em> Charles Babbage (1864). </em></p></blockquote>
<p>The issue of lineage and provenance is exactly this made modern. How can one track where the data comes from? Of course, finding fast algorithms to do the tracking is still an important question. Oh well.</p>
<h2>Databases Meet Theory</h2>
<p>Of course databases store and allow us to retrieve information—they are everywhere these days. One reason for their dominance is they support complex queries. For example, we can use databases to obtain all <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/> so that <img alt="{R(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{R(x,y)}"/> is true for some <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{y}"/>:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle \{ x \mid \exists y R(x,y) \}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5C%7B+x+%5Cmid+%5Cexists+y+R%28x%2Cy%29+%5C%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle \{ x \mid \exists y R(x,y) \}. "/></p>
<p>From a theory point of view any first-order question is allowed.</p>
<p>But searches often use approximate matches. Thus one might wish all <img alt="{R(x',y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28x%27%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{R(x',y)}"/> so that <img alt="{x'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x'}"/> is near <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/>. We might want all <img alt="{R(x',y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28x%27%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{R(x',y)}"/> so that <img alt="{x'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x'}"/> is not “Michael” but also includes “Micheal”. This type of error is not too hard to handle, but a worse type of error is</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle Michael \iff Michal " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+Michael+%5Ciff+Michal+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle Michael \iff Michal "/></p>
<p>Formally changing a letter is not as difficult as deleting or adding letters. This is the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/med.pdf">edit distance</a> between two strings is defined as the minimum number of insertions, deletions or substitutions of symbols needed to transform one string into another. An important application is to biology.</p>
<table style="margin: auto;">

<p>This leads to into the more-general notion of <em>entity resolution</em> (ER). Widom co-leads the <em>Stanford Entity Resolution Framework</em> (<a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/serf/">SERF</a>) with Hector Garcia-Molina; they were two of the authors on its earliest <a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/779/">paper</a> in 2006. The page highlights the lexical nature of ER:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For instance, two records on the same person may provide different name spellings, and addresses may differ. The goal of ER is to “resolve” entities, by identifying the records that represent the same entity and reconciling them to obtain one record per entity. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Their approach “involves functions that `match’ records (i.e., decide whether they represent the same entity) and `merge’ them.” Their framework has an outer layer that treats the functions as generic. Widom’s emphasis has been on axiomatizing properties of the functions to enable efficient and extensible manipulation by the outer layer.</p>
<p>Necessarily under the hood is a measure of edit distance. Ken recently monitored a large tournament where two players had the same surname and first three prenames, differing only in the last four letters of their last prename. The widget used to download the game file originally given to Ken truncated the names so that there seemed to be one person playing twice as many games. They could also have been distinguished by other database information. More common is when the same player is referenced with different spellings, such as (grandmaster Artur) Jussupow or Yusupov. The similarity metric needs to be extended beyond the name. This is when computation time becomes more a factor and theory enters in.</p>
<h2>Edit Distance</h2>
<p>Computing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance">edit distance</a> between two strings is a long-studied problem. The best algorithm known is order quadratic time, as we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/22/bellman-dynamic-programming-and-edit-distance/">here</a>. There are better running times if we allow approximate algorithms or quantum algorithms. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04178.pdf">this</a> for the latter and this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/alberto-apostolico-1948-2015/">post</a> for work related to the former.</p>
<p>Theorists have tried to improve the time needed for classical exact edit distance. It remains at quadratic time, however, and there is <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/edit-distance-reveals-hard-computational-problems-20150929/">evidence</a> of inability to do better that we have remarked as <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">puzzling</a>. One of the strange traits of theorists is that when something is hard we try to <a href="https://www.theidioms.com/when-life-gives-you-lemons/">exploit</a> the hardness.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>For instance, factoring integers is hard—so let us make crypto systems. The lemonade in the case of edit distance is a connection to the hardness of really-hard problems. To quote the seminal <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0348.pdf">paper</a> by Arturs Backurs and Piotr Indyk:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In this paper we provide evidence that the near-quadratic running time bounds known for the problem of computing edit distance might be tight. Specifically, we show that, if the edit distance can be computed in time <img alt="{O(n^{2-\epsilon})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B2-%5Cepsilon%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{O(n^{2-\epsilon})}"/> for some constant <img alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0}"/>, then the satisfiability of conjunctive normal form formulas with <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{N}"/> variables and <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M}"/> clauses can be solved in time subexp. The latter result would violate the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, which postulates that such algorithms do not exist. </em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Edit Distance—Searching</h2>
<p>An open problem that is closer to databases is not computing edit distance. Instead, the problem how to search for strings that are <em>near</em> a given string. This can be a generic use of an edit-distance function. A larger question is whether this can be approached more directly.</p>
<p>I believe that while edit distance may indeed be quadratic time, it still is open how fast searches can be done for approximate matches. The problem is given a large collection of strings <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> how fast can we find the closest string in the collection to some word <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{w}"/>? That the best algorithms for edit distance are probably quadratic does not—I believe—entail that this search question is difficult.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Two weeks ago, I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5122">blogged about</a> the striking claim, by the group headed by Chaoyang Lu and Jianwei Pan at USTC in China, to have achieved quantum supremacy via BosonSampling with 50-70 detected photons.  I also did a <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/12/chinas-quantum-computer-a-step-not-a-leap/">four-part interview</a> on the subject with Jonathan Tennenbaum at Asia Times, and other interviews elsewhere.  None of that stopped some people, who I guess didn’t google, from writing to tell me how disappointed they were by my silence!</p>



<p>The reality, though, is that a lot has happened since the original announcement, so it’s way past time for an update.</p>



<p><strong>I. The Quest to Spoof</strong></p>



<p>Most importantly, other groups almost immediately went to work trying to refute the quantum supremacy claim, by finding some efficient classical algorithm to spoof the reported results.  It’s important to understand that this is exactly how the process is <em>supposed</em> to work: as I’ve often stressed, a quantum supremacy claim is credible only if it’s open to the community to refute and if no one can.  It’s also important to understand that, for reasons we’ll go into, there’s a decent chance that people <em>will</em> succeed in simulating the new experiment classically, although they haven’t yet.  All parties to the discussion agree that the new experiment is, far and away, the closest any BosonSampling experiment has ever gotten to the quantum supremacy regime; the hard part is to figure out if it’s already there.</p>



<p>Part of me feels guilty that, as one of reviewers on the <em>Science</em> paper—albeit, one stressed and harried by kids and covid—it’s now clear that I didn’t exercise the amount of diligence that I could have, in searching for ways to kill the new supremacy claim.  But another part of me feels that, with quantum supremacy claims, much like with proposals for new cryptographic codes, vetting <em>can’t be the responsibility of one or two reviewers</em>.  Instead, provided the claim is serious—as this one obviously is—the only thing to do is to get the paper out, so that the <em>entire community</em> can then work to knock it down.  Communication between authors and skeptics is also a hell of a lot faster when it doesn’t need to go through a journal’s editorial system.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, one skeptic of the new quantum supremacy claim is Gil Kalai, who (despite Google’s result last year, which Gil still believes must be in error) rejects the entire possibility of quantum supremacy on quasi-metaphysical grounds.  But other skeptics are current and former members of the Google team, including Sergio Boixo and John Martinis!  And—pause to enjoy the irony—<em>Gil has effectively teamed up with the Google folks</em> on questioning the new claim.  Another central figure in the vetting effort—one from whom I’ve learned much of what I know about the relevant issues over the last week—is Dutch quantum optics professor and frequent <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> commenter <a href="https://people.utwente.nl/j.j.renema">Jelmer Renema</a>.</p>



<p>Without further ado, why might the new experiment, impressive though it was, be efficiently simulable classically?  A central reason for concern is photon loss: as Chaoyang Lu has now explicitly confirmed (it was implicit in the paper), up to ~70% of the photons get lost on their way through the beamsplitter network, leaving only ~30% to be detected.  At least with “Fock state” BosonSampling—i.e., the original kind, the kind with single-photon inputs that Alex Arkhipov and I proposed in 2011—it seems likely to me that such a loss rate would be fatal for quantum supremacy; see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01953">this 2019 paper</a> by Renema, Shchesnovich, and Garcia-Patron.</p>



<p>Incidentally, if anything’s become clear over the last two weeks, it’s that I, the co-inventor of BosonSampling, am no longer any sort of expert on the subject’s literature!</p>



<p>Anyway, one source of uncertainty regarding the photon loss issue is that, as I said in my last post, the USTC experiment implemented a 2016 variant of BosonSampling called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01199">Gaussian BosonSampling (GBS)</a>—and Jelmer tells me that the computational complexity of GBS in the presence of losses hasn’t yet been analyzed in the relevant regime, though there’s been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12075">work aiming in that direction</a>.  A second source of uncertainty is simply that the classical simulations work in a certain limit—namely, fixing the rate of noise and then letting the numbers of photons and modes go to infinity—but any real experiment has a fixed number of photons and modes (in USTC’s case, they’re ~50 and ~100 respectively).  It wouldn’t do to reject USTC’s claim via a theoretical asymptotic argument that would equally well apply to <em>any</em> non-error-corrected quantum supremacy demonstration!</p>



<p>OK, but if an efficient classical simulation of lossy GBS experiments exists, then <em>what is it?</em>  How does it work?  It turns out that we have a plausible candidate for the answer to that, originating with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3093">2014 paper</a> by Gil Kalai and Guy Kindler.  Given a beamsplitter network, Kalai and Kindler considered an infinite hierarchy of better and better approximations to the BosonSampling distribution for that network.  Roughly speaking, at the first level (k=1), one pretends that the photons are just classical distinguishable particles.  At the second level (k=2), one correctly models quantum interference involving <em>pairs</em> of photons, but none of the higher-order interference.  At the third level (k=3), one correctly models three-photon interference, and so on until k=n (where n is the total number of photons), when one has reproduced the original BosonSampling distribution.  At least when k is small, the time needed to spoof outputs at the k<sup>th</sup> level of the hierarchy should grow like n<sup>k</sup>.  As theoretical computer scientists, Kalai and Kindler didn’t care whether their hierarchy produced any physically realistic kind of noise, but later work, by Shchesnovich, Renema, and others, showed that (as it happens) it does.</p>



<p>In its original paper, the USTC team ruled out the possibility that the first, k=1 level of this hierarchy could explain its experimental results.  More recently, in response to inquiries by Sergio, Gil, Jelmer, and others, Chaoyang tells me they’ve ruled out the possibility that the k=2 level can explain their results either.  We’re now eagerly awaiting the answer for larger values of k.</p>



<p>Let me add that I owe Gil Kalai the following public <em>mea culpa</em>.  While his objections to QC have often struck me as unmotivated and weird, in the case at hand, Gil’s 2014 work with Kindler is clearly helping drive the scientific discussion forward.  In other words, at least with BosonSampling, it turns out that Gil put his finger precisely on a key issue.  He did exactly what every QC skeptic should do, and what I’ve always implored the skeptics to do.</p>



<p><strong>II. BosonSampling vs. Random Circuit Sampling: A Tale of HOG and CHOG and LXEB</strong></p>



<p>There’s a broader question: why should skeptics of a BosonSampling experiment even have to <em>think</em> about messy details like the rate of photon losses?  Why shouldn’t that be solely the <em>experimenters’</em> job?</p>



<p>To understand what I mean, consider the situation with Random Circuit Sampling, the task Google demonstrated last year with 53 qubits.  There, the Google team simply collected the output samples and fed them into a benchmark that they called “Linear Cross-Entropy” (LXEB), closely related to what Lijie Chen and I called “Heavy Output Generation” (HOG) in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">2017 paper</a>.  With suitable normalization, an ideal quantum computer would achieve an LXEB score of 2, while classical random guessing would achieve an LXEB score of 1.  Crucially, according to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12085">2019 result</a> by me and Sam Gunn, under a plausible (albeit strong) complexity assumption, <em>no</em> subexponential-time classical spoofing algorithm should be able to achieve an LXEB score that’s even slightly higher than 1.  In its experiment, Google reported an LXEB score of about 1.002, with a confidence interval <em>much</em> smaller than 0.002.  Hence: quantum supremacy (subject to our computational assumption), with no further need to know anything about the sources of noise in Google’s chip!  (More explicitly, Boixo, Smelyansky, and Neven <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01875">did a calculation</a> in 2017 to show that the Kalai-Kindler type of spoofing strategy <em>definitely</em> isn’t going to work against RCS and Linear XEB, with no computational assumption needed.)</p>



<p>So then why couldn’t the USTC team do something analogous with BosonSampling?  Well, they tried to.   They defined a measure that they called “HOG,” although it’s different from my and Lijie Chen’s HOG, more similar to a cross-entropy.  Following Jelmer, let me call their measure CHOG, where the C could stand for Chinese, Chaoyang’s, or Changed.  They calculated the CHOG for their experimental samples, and showed that it exceeds the CHOG that you’d get from the k=1 and k=2 levels of the Kalai-Kindler hierarchy, as well as from various other spoofing strategies, thereby ruling those out as classical explanations for their results.</p>



<p>The trouble is this: <em>unlike </em>with Random Circuit Sampling and LXEB, with BosonSampling and CHOG, we <em>know</em> that there are fast classical algorithms that achieve better scores than the trivial algorithm, the algorithm that just picks samples at random.  That follows from Kalai and Kindler’s work, and it even more simply follows from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7460">2013 paper</a> by me and Arkhipov, entitled “BosonSampling Is Far From Uniform.”  Worse yet, with BosonSampling, we currently have no analogue of my 2019 result with Sam Gunn: that is, a result that would tell us (under suitable complexity assumptions) the highest possible CHOG score that we expect any efficient classical algorithm to be able to get.  And since we don’t know exactly where that ceiling is, we can’t tell the experimentalists exactly what target they need to surpass in order to claim quantum supremacy.  Absent such definitive guidance from us, the experimentalists are left playing whac-a-mole against <em>this</em> possible classical spoofing strategy, and <em>that</em> one, and <em>that</em> one.</p>



<p>This is an issue that I and others were aware of for years, although the new experiment has certainly underscored it.  Had I understood <em>just how serious</em> the USTC group was about scaling up BosonSampling, and fast, I might’ve given the issue some more attention!</p>



<p><strong>III. Fock vs. Gaussian BosonSampling</strong></p>



<p>Above, I mentioned another complication in understanding the USTC experiment: namely, their reliance on Gaussian BosonSampling (GBS) rather than Fock BosonSampling (FBS), sometimes also called Aaronson-Arkhipov BosonSampling (AABS).  Since I gave this issue short shrift in my previous post, let me make up for it now.</p>



<p>In FBS, the initial state consists of either 0 or 1 photons in each input mode, like so: |1,…,1,0,…,0⟩.  We then pass the photons through our beamsplitter network, and measure the number of photons in each output mode.  The result is that the amplitude of each possible output configuration can be expressed as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_(mathematics)">permanent</a> of some n×n matrix, where n is the total number of photons.  It was interest in the permanent, which plays a central role in classical computational complexity, that led me and Arkhipov to study BosonSampling in the first place.</p>



<p>The trouble is, preparing initial states like |1,…,1,0,…,0⟩ turns out to be really hard.  No one has yet build a source that reliably outputs <em>one and only one photon</em> at exactly a specified time.  This led two experimental groups to propose an idea that, in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1579">2013 post on this blog</a>, I named Scattershot BosonSampling (SBS).  In SBS, you get to use the more readily available “Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion” (SPDC) photon sources, which output superpositions over different numbers of photons, of the form $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \alpha_n |n \rangle |n \rangle, $$ where α<sub>n</sub> decreases exponentially with n.  You then measure the left half of each entangled pair, <em>hope</em> to see exactly one photon, and are guaranteed that if you do, then there’s also exactly one photon in the right half.  Crucially, one can show that, if Fock BosonSampling is hard to simulate approximately using a classical computer, then the Scattershot kind must be as well.</p>



<p>OK, so what’s <em>Gaussian</em> BosonSampling?  It’s simply the generalization of SBS where, instead of SPDC states, our input can be an arbitrary “Gaussian state”: for those in the know, a state that’s exponential in some quadratic polynomial in the creation operators.  If there are m modes, then such a state requires ~m<sup>2</sup> independent parameters to specify.  The quantum optics people have a much easier time creating these Gaussian states than they do creating single-photon Fock states.</p>



<p>While the amplitudes in FBS are given by permanents of matrices (and thus, the probabilities by the absolute squares of permanents), the probabilities in GBS are given by a more complicated matrix function called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnian">Hafnian</a>.  Roughly speaking, while the permanent counts the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph, the Hafnian counts the number of perfect matchings in an <em>arbitrary</em> graph.  The permanent and the Hafnian are both #P-complete.  In the USTC paper, they talk about yet another matrix function called the “Torontonian,” which was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01639.pdf">invented two years ago</a>.  I gather that the Torontonian is just the modification of the Hafnian for the situation where you only have “threshold detectors” (which decide whether one or more photons are present in a given mode), rather than “number-resolving detectors” (which <em>count</em> how many photons are present).</p>



<p>If Gaussian BosonSampling includes Scattershot BosonSampling as a special case, and if Scattershot BosonSampling is at least as hard to simulate classically as the original BosonSampling, then you might hope that GBS would <em>also</em> be at least as hard to simulate classically as the original BosonSampling.  Alas, this doesn’t follow.  Why not?  Because for all we know, a <em>random</em> GBS instance might be a lot easier than a <em>random</em> SBS instance.  Just because permanents can be expressed using Hafnians, doesn’t mean that a random Hafnian is as hard as a random permanent.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I think it’s very likely that the sort of analysis Arkhipov and I did back in 2011 could be mirrored in the Gaussian case.  I.e., instead of starting with reasonable assumptions about the distribution and hardness of random permanents, and then concluding the classical hardness of approximate BosonSampling, one would start with reasonable assumptions about the distribution and hardness of random Hafnians (or “Torontonians”), and conclude the classical hardness of approximate GBS.  But this is theoretical work that remains to be done!</p>



<p><strong>IV. Application to Molecular Vibronic Spectra?</strong></p>



<p>In 2014, Alan Aspuru-Guzik and collaborators put out a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8427">paper</a> that made an amazing claim: namely that, contrary to what I and others had said, BosonSampling was <em>not</em> an intrinsically useless model of computation, good only for refuting QC skeptics like Gil Kalai!  Instead, they said, a BosonSampling device (specifically, what would later be called a GBS device) could be directly applied to solve a practical problem in quantum chemistry.  This is the computation of “molecular vibronic spectra,” also known as “Franck-Condon profiles,” whatever those are.</p>



<p>I never understood nearly enough about chemistry to evaluate this striking proposal, but I was always a bit skeptical of it, for the following reason.  Nothing in the proposal seemed to take seriously that BosonSampling is a <em>sampling</em> task!  A chemist would typically have some <em>specific numbers</em> that she wants to estimate, of which these “vibronic spectra” seemed to be an example.  But while it’s often convenient to estimate physical quantities via Monte Carlo sampling over simulated observations of the physical system you care about, that’s not the <em>only</em> way to estimate physical quantities!  And worryingly, in all the other examples we’d seen where BosonSampling could be used to estimate a number, the same number could <em>also</em> be estimated using one of several polynomial-time classical algorithms invented by Leonid Gurvits.  So why should vibronic spectra be an exception?</p>



<p>After an email exchange with Alex Arkhipov, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Leonardo Novo, and Raul Garcia-Patron, I believe we finally got to the bottom of it, and the answer is: vibronic spectra are <em>not</em> an exception.</p>



<p>In terms of BosonSampling, the vibronic spectra task is simply to estimate the probability histogram of some weighted sum like $$ w_1 s_1 + \cdots + w_ m s_m, $$ where w<sub>1</sub>,…,w<sub>m</sub> are fixed real numbers, and (s<sub>1</sub>,…,s<sub>m</sub>) is a possible outcome of the BosonSampling experiment, s<sub>i</sub> representing the number of photons observed in mode i.  Alas, while it takes some work, it turns out that Gurvits’s classical algorithms can be adapted to estimate these histograms.  Granted, running the actual BosonSampling experiment would provide <em>slightly</em> more detailed information—namely, some exact sampled values of $$ w_1 s_1 + \cdots + w_ m s_m, $$ rather than merely additive approximations to the values—but since we’d still need to sort those sampled values into coarse “bins” in order to compute a histogram, it’s not clear why that additional precision would ever be of chemical interest.</p>



<p>This is a pity, since if the vibronic spectra application <em>had</em> beaten what was doable classically, then it would’ve provided not merely a first practical use for BosonSampling, but also a lovely way to <em>verify</em> that a BosonSampling device was working as intended.</p>



<p><strong>V. Application to Finding Dense Subgraphs?</strong></p>



<p>A different potential application of Gaussian BosonSampling, first suggested by the Toronto-based startup <a href="https://www.xanadu.ai/">Xanadu</a>, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10730">finding dense subgraphs in a graph</a>.  (Or at least, providing an initial seed to classical optimization methods that search for dense subgraphs.)</p>



<p>This is an NP-hard problem, so to say that I was skeptical of the proposal would be a gross understatement.  Nevertheless, it turns out that there <em>is</em> a striking observation by the Xanadu team at the core of their proposal: namely that, given a graph G and a positive even integer k, a GBS device can be used to sample a random subgraph of G of size k, with probability <em>proportional to the square of the number of perfect matchings in that subgraph</em>.  Cool, right?  And potentially even useful, especially if the number of perfect matchings could serve as a rough indicator of the subgraph’s density!  Alas, Xanadu’s Juan Miguel Arrazola himself recently told me that there’s a cubic-time classical algorithm for the same sampling task, so that the possible quantum speedup that one could get from GBS in this way is at most polynomial.  The search for a useful application of BosonSampling continues!</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>And that’s all for now!  I’m grateful to all the colleagues I talked to over the last couple weeks, including Alex Arkhipov, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Sergio Boixo, Raul Garcia-Patron, Leonid Gurvits, Gil Kalai, Chaoyang Lu, John Martinis, and Jelmer Renema, while obviously taking sole responsibility for any errors in the above.  I look forward to a spirited discussion in the comments, and of course I’ll post updates as I learn more!</p></div>

Application deadline is tomorrow morning Italian time, tonight American time.)<br/><br/>Last weekend I was saddened to hear of the death of Korean filmmaker Kim Ki-duk. Kim was in Latvia, preparing to shoot a movie there. He disappeared about a week ago, and it then transpired that he had been hospitalized with Covid symptoms, and died last Friday from Covid complications.</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, living in the San Francisco Bay Area offered me several opportunities to discover cinema that was new to me. There were the several film festivals held each year in San Francisco, the wonderful retrospectives at the Castro Theater. There was also Netflix, that at the time operated by renting DVDs by mail (I am feeling like grandpa Simpson telling stories here) and whose catalog was basically every movie ever released in the US. I discovered the work of Hirokazu Kore-eda and Wong Kar-Wai, whose movies are now among my favorites, and I watched some challenging but rewarding movies by the likes of Tsai Ming-Lian and Hou Hsiao-Hsien. So, when it came out, I watched “3-iron” by Kim Ki-duk, an amazing movie on the theme of the poor being invisible to the rich, but taken to extreme and fantastical places.</p>



<p>I was reminded of that time during our first lockdown last Spring. After having watched a lot of TV series, I felt like I had to do something a bit more soul-nourishing before the lockdown ended. So I resolved to watch Tarkovsky’s “Solaris” and “Stalker”, which I had never seen. Compared with movies I had watched 15+ years ago like those of Tsai Ming-Lian and Hou Hsiao-Hsien, or like “3-iron”, “Solaris” was like a Michael Bay movie full of explosions and car chases, but I still had a really hard time getting into it. I ended up watching it over five or six sittings, across a couple of weeks (the lockdown actually ended before I was done watching it). I still haven’t seen “Stalker”. I suppose that twelve years of smartphone usage accounts for the difference in attention span.</p></div>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">The other day Dana and I finished watching The Queen’s Gambit, Netflix’s fictional saga of an orphaned girl in the 1960’s, Beth Harmon, who breaks into competitive chess and destroys one opponent after the next in her quest to become the world champion, while confronting her inner demons and addictions.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The other day Dana and I finished watching <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em>, Netflix’s fictional saga of an orphaned girl in the 1960’s, Beth Harmon, who breaks into competitive chess and destroys one opponent after the next in her quest to become the world champion, while confronting her inner demons and addictions.</p>



<p>The show is every bit as astoundingly good as everyone says it is, and I might be able to articulate why.  It’s because, perhaps surprisingly given the description, this is a story where <em>chess actually matters</em>—and indeed, the fact that chess matters so deeply to Beth and most of the other characters is central to the narrative.  (As in two pivotal scenes where Beth has sex with a male player, and then either she or he goes right back to working on chess.)</p>



<p>I’ve watched a lot of TV shows and movies, supposedly about scientists, where the science was just an interchangeable backdrop to what the writers clearly regarded as a more important story.  (As one random example, the drama <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)">NUMB3RS</a>, supposedly about an FBI mathematician, where “math” could’ve been swapped out for “mystical crime-fighting intuition” with barely any change.)</p>



<p>It’s true that a fictional work about scientists shouldn’t try to be a science documentary, just like <em>Queen’s Gambit</em> doesn’t try to be a chess documentary.  But if you’re telling a story about characters who are obsessed with topic X, then you need to <em>make their obsession plausible</em>, make the entire story hinge on it, and even make the audience vicariously feel the same obsession.</p>



<p>This is precisely what <em>Queen’s Gambit</em> does for chess.  It’s a chess drama where the characters are <em>constantly</em> talking about chess, thinking about chess, and playing chess—and that actually succeeds in making that riveting.  (Even if most of the audience can’t follow what’s happening on the board, it turns out that it doesn’t matter, since you can simply convey the drama through the characters’ faces and the reactions of those around them.)</p>



<p>Granted, a few aspects of competitive chess in the series stood out as jarringly unrealistic even to a novice like me: for example, the almost complete lack of draws.  But as for the board positions—well, apparently Kasparov was a consultant, and he helped meticulously design each one to reflect the characters’ skill levels and what was happening in the plot.</p>



<p>While the premise sounds like a feminist wish-fulfillment fantasy—orphan girl faces hundreds of intimidating white men in the sexist 1960s, orphan girl beats them all at their own game with style and aplomb—this is not at all a MeToo story, or a story about male crudity or predation.  It’s after bigger fish than that.  The series, you might say, conforms to all the external requirements of modern woke ideology, yet the actual plot subverts the tenets of that ideology, or maybe just ignores them, in its pursuit of more timeless themes.</p>



<p>At least once Beth Harmon enters the professional chess world, the central challenges she needs to overcome are internal and mental—just like they’re supposed to be in chess.  It’s not the Man or the Patriarchy or any other external power (besides, of course, skilled opponents) holding her down.  Again and again, the top male players are portrayed not as sexist brutes but as gracious, deferential, and even awestruck by Beth’s genius after she’s humiliated them on the chessboard.  And much of the story is about how those vanquished opponents then turn around and try to help Beth, and about how she needs to learn to accept their help in order to evolve as a player and a human being.</p>



<p>There’s also that, after defeating male player after male player, Beth sleeps with them, or at least wants to.  I confess that, as a teenager, I would’ve found that unlikely and astonishing.  I would’ve said: obviously, the only guys who’d even have a <em>chance</em> to prove themselves worthy of the affection of such a brilliant and unique woman would be those who could beat her at chess.  Anyone else would just be dirt between her toes.  In the series, though, each male player propositions Beth only <em>after</em> she’s soundly annihilated him.  And she’s never once shown refusing.</p>



<p>Obviously, I’m no Beth Harmon; I’ll never be close in my field to what she is in hers.  Equally obviously, I grew up in a loving family, not an orphanage.  Still, I was what some people would call a “child prodigy,” what with the finishing my PhD at 22 and whatnot, so naturally that colored my reaction to the show.</p>



<p>There’s a pattern that goes like this: you’re obsessively interested, from your first childhood exposure, in something that most people aren’t.  Once you learn what the something is, it’s evident to you that your life’s vocation couldn’t possibly be anything else, unless some external force prevents you.  Alas, in order to pursue the something, you first need to get past bullies and bureaucrats, who dismiss you as a nobody, put barriers in your way, despise whatever you represent to them.  After a few years, though, the bullies can no longer stop you: you’re finally among peers or superiors in your chosen field, regularly chatting with them on college campuses or at conferences in swanky hotels, and the main limiting factor is just the one between your ears. </p>



<p>You feel intense rivalries with your new colleagues, of course, you desperately want to excel them, but the fact that they’re all on the same obsessive quest as you means you can never actually hate them, as you did the bureaucrats or the bullies.  There’s too much of you in your competitors, and of them in you.</p>



<p>As you pursue your calling, you feel yourself torn in the following way.  On the one hand, you feel close to a moral obligation to humanity not to throw away whatever “gift” you were “given” (what loaded terms), to take the calling as far as it will go.  On the other hand, you also want the same things other people want, like friendship, validation, and of course sex.</p>



<p>In such a case, two paths naturally beckon.  The first is that of asceticism: making a virtue of eschewing all temporal attachments, romance or even friendship, in order to devote yourself entirely to the calling.  The second is that of renouncing the calling, pretending it never existed, in order to fit in and have a normal life.  Your fundamental challenge is to figure out a third path, to plug yourself into a community where the relentless pursuit of the unusual vocation and the friendship and the sex can all complement each other rather than being at odds.</p>



<p>It would be an understatement to say that I have some familiarity with this narrative arc.</p>



<p>I’m aware, of course, of the irony, that I can identify with so many contours of Beth Harmon’s journey—I, Scott Aaronson, who half the Internet denounced six years ago as a misogynist monster who denies the personhood and interiority of women.  In that life-alteringly cruel slur, there was a microscopic grain of truth, and it’s this: I’m not talented at imagining myself into the situations of people different from me.  It’s never been my strong suit.  I might <em>like</em> and <em>admire</em> people different from me, I might sympathize with their struggles and wish them every happiness, but I still don’t know what they’re thinking until they tell me.  And even then, I don’t fully understand it.</p>



<p>As one small but illustrative example, I have no intuitive understanding—zero—of what it’s like to be romantically attracted to men, or what any man could do or say or look like that could possibly be attractive to women.  If you have such an understanding, then imagine yourself sighted and me blind.  Intellectually, I might know that confidence or height or deep brown eyes or brooding artistry are supposed to be attractive in human males, but only because I’m told.  As far as my intuition is concerned, pretty much all men are equally hairy, smelly, and gross, a large fraction of women are alluring and beautiful and angelic, and both of those are just objective features of reality that no one could possibly see otherwise.</p>



<p>Thus, whenever I read or watch fiction starring a female protagonist who dates men, it’s very easy for me to imagine that protagonist judging me, enumerating my faults, and rejecting me, and very hard for me to do what I’m supposed to do, which is to <em>put myself into her shoes</em>.  I could watch a thousand female protagonists kiss a thousand guys onscreen, or wake up in bed next to them, and the thousandth-and-first time I’d still be equally mystified about what she saw in such a sweaty oaf and why she didn’t run from him screaming, and I’d snap out of vicariously identifying with her.  (Understanding gay men of course presents similar difficulties; understanding lesbians is comparatively easy.)</p>



<p>It’s possible to overcome this, but it takes an extraordinary female protagonist, brought to life by an extraordinary writer.  Off the top of my head, I can think of only a few.  There were Renee Feuer and Eva Mueller, the cerebral protagonists of Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Body-Problem-Contemporary-American-Fiction/dp/0140172459"><em>The Mind-Body Problem</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Passion-Woman-Vintage-Contemporaries/dp/0679728236"><em>The Late Summer Passion of a Woman of Mind</em></a>.  Maybe Ellie Arroway from Carl Sagan’s <em>Contact</em>.  And then there’s Beth Harmon.  With characters like these, I can briefly enter a space where their crushes on men seem no weirder or more inexplicable to me than my own teenage crushes … just, you know, inverted.  Sex is in any case secondary to the character’s primary urge to discover timeless truths, an urge that I fully understand because I’ve shared it.</p>



<p>Granted, the timeless truths of chess, an arbitrary and invented game, are less profound than those of quantum gravity or the P vs. NP problem, but the psychology is much the same, and <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em> does a good job of showing that.  To understand the characters of this series is to understand why they could be happier to lose an interesting game than to win a boring one.  And I could appreciate that, even if I was by no means the strongest player at my elementary school’s chess club, and the handicap with which I can beat my 7-year-old daughter is steadily decreasing.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-187 |  If VNP is hard, then so are equations for it | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	C Ramya, 

	Ramprasad Saptharishi, 

	Anamay Tengse</title>
    <summary>Assuming that the Permanent polynomial requires algebraic circuits of exponential size, we show that the class VNP *does not* have efficiently computable equations. In other words, any nonzero polynomial that vanishes on the coefficient vectors of all polynomials in the class VNP requires algebraic circuits of super-polynomial size.

In a recent work of Chatterjee and the authors (FOCS 2020), it was shown that the subclasses of VP and VNP consisting of polynomials with bounded integer coefficients *do*  have equations with small algebraic circuits. Their work left open the possibility that these results could perhaps be extended to all of VP or VNP. The results in this paper show that assuming the hardness of Permanent, at least for VNP, allowing polynomials with large coefficients does indeed incur a significant blow up in the circuit complexity of equations.</summary>

    <title>TR20-186 |  Shrinkage of Decision Lists and DNF Formulas | 

	Benjamin Rossman</title>
    <summary>We establish nearly tight bounds on the expected shrinkage of decision lists and DNF formulas under the $p$-random restriction $\mathbf R_p$ for all values of $p \in [0,1]$. For a function $f$ with domain $\{0,1\}^n$, let $\mathrm{DL}(f)$ denote the minimum size of a decision list that computes $f$. We show that
\[
  \mathbb E[\ \mathrm{DL}(f|\mathbf R_p)\ ] \le 
  \mathrm{DL}(f)^{\log_{2/(1-p)}(\frac{1+p}{1-p})}.
\]
For example, this bound is $\sqrt{\mathrm{DL}(f)}$ when $p = \sqrt{5}-2 \approx 0.24$. For Boolean functions $f$, we obtain the same shrinkage bound with respect to DNF formula size plus $1$ (i.e.,\ replacing $\mathrm{DL}(\cdot)$ with $\mathrm{DNF}(\cdot)+1$ on both sides of the inequality).</summary>

    <title>TR20-185 |  Quantum learning algorithms imply circuit lower bounds | 

	Tom Gur, 

	Alex Grilo, 

	Igor Oliveira, 

	Srinivasan Arunachalam, 

	Aarthi Sundaram</title>
    <summary>We establish the first general connection between the design of quantum algorithms and  circuit lower bounds. Specifically, let $\mathrm{C}$ be a class of polynomial-size concepts, and suppose that $\mathrm{C}$ can be PAC-learned with membership queries under the uniform distribution with error $1/2 - \gamma$ by a time $T$ quantum algorithm. We prove that if $\gamma^2 \cdot T \ll 2^n/n$, then $\mathrm{BQE} \not\subseteq \mathrm{C}$, where $\mathrm{BQE} = \mathrm{BQTIME}[2^{O(n)}]$ is an exponential-time analogue of $\mathrm{BQP}$. This result is optimal in both $\gamma$ and $T$, since it is not hard to learn any class $\mathcal{C}$ of functions in (classical) time $T = 2^n$  (with no error), or in quantum time $T = \mathrm{poly}(n)$ with error at most $1/2 - \Omega(2^{-n/2})$ via Fourier sampling. In other words, even a marginal improvement on these generic learning algorithms would lead to major consequences in complexity theory. 

Our proof builds on several works in learning theory, pseudorandomness, and computational complexity, and crucially, on a connection between non-trivial classical learning algorithms and circuit lower bounds established by Oliveira and Santhanam (CCC 2017). Extending their approach to quantum learning algorithms turns out to create significant challenges. To achieve that, we show among other results how pseudorandom generators imply learning-to-lower-bound connections in a generic fashion, construct the first conditional pseudorandom generator secure against uniform quantum computations, and extend the local list-decoding algorithm of Impagliazzo, Jaiswal, Kabanets and Wigderson (SICOMP 2010) to quantum circuits via a delicate analysis. We believe that these contributions are of independent interest and might find other applications.</summary>

    <title>Quarterly Th. Wksp `at' Northwestern, and thoughts inspired by it</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> On the <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/events/">Northwestern CS Theory Group</a> there is a set of Quarterly Theory Workshops. There is one coming up on Dec 17-18, 2020, called the <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/events/2020-junior-theorists-workshop/">Junior Theorists Workshop</a>. Take a look and possibly go to it! Because it is virtual you do not need to plan that much ahead- though they do want you to register. </p><p>1) I notice broadly two kinds of meetings:</p><p><br/>Based on WHO will be there, e.g., JUNIOR theorists</p><p><br/>Based on TOPIC: e.g., there was a meeting on ALGORITHMIC FAIRNESS.</p><p><br/></p><p>2) These types of meetings (NY Theory day is another) are, I believe, intended to be for people that are local (more on that later). But because the meeting will be on zoom, geography is no longer an impediment for either the attendees or the speakers. </p><p><br/></p><p>3) Before covid there was some talk of  `Gee, flying off to STOC, FOCS, other conferences is bad for the environment, what to do about that?'. With that in mind, here is a history which might not be true but makes a point:</p><p><i>In an earlier era FOCS/STOC were attended by mostly Americans and ICALP was attended by mostly Europeans.  I do not think there was any policy of discrimination on admissions, but it was more like Americans just did not submit to ICALP as much, nor Europeans  to FOCS/STOC. But over time when these conferences got to be considered prestigious people would routinely submit to either one depending on timing. If your paper was done in time for Conf X deadline, that's where you submit. If it does not get in then  you edit it some, perhaps add some new results, and submit to Conf Y. </i></p><p>So one solution to the air-travel-global-Warming   problem of conferences is go back to a time (which may not have ever existed) where it was just understood that you go to LOCAL conferences. Math does this, but it helps that their regional conferences are not  prestigious. But even they don't quite get it right: the joint AMS-MAA meeting alternates coasts. One year when it was in California they invited me to be a guest speaker (on the Muffin Problem). The following year it was in Baltimore. Note that I live in Maryland, so perhaps they should have waited a year. </p><p>How to encourage people to submit locally. I DO NOT want to have a rule or a diff standard for those who don't. As such... I have no idea. </p><p><br/></p><p>4)  Are virtual conferences a good idea? This is a hot topic now so I won't dwell on it, just to say that there is still something about being there IN PERSON, meeting people, serendipity that makes live confs better.</p><p>However, to have it at the same time be virtual and recorded will be VERY HELPFL to those who can't afford to go for whatever reason. </p><p>And of course there is the whole issue of if we should have prestigious conferences, which I won't get into now. Or later. That's more Lance's issue (he thinks no). </p><p><br/></p></div>
