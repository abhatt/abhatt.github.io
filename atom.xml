    <title>TR22-037 |  Robust Radical Sylvester-Gallai Theorem for Quadratics | 

	Rafael Mendes de Oliveira, 

	Abhibhav Garg, 

	Akash Sengupta</title>
    <summary>We prove a robust generalization of a Sylvester-Gallai type theorem for quadratic polynomials, generalizing the result in [S'20].
More precisely, given a parameter $0 &lt; \delta \leq 1$ and a finite collection $\mathcal{F}$ of irreducible and pairwise independent polynomials of degree at most 2, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $(\delta, 2)$-radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration if for any polynomial $F_i \in \mathcal{F}$, there exist $\delta(|\mathcal{F}| -1)$ polynomials $F_j$ such that $|\mathrm{rad}(F_i, F_j) \cap \mathcal{F}| \geq 3$, that is, the radical of $F_i, F_j$ contains a third polynomial in the set.

In this work, we prove that any $(\delta, 2)$-radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration $\mathcal{F}$ must be of low dimension: that is 
$$\dim \mathrm{span}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathrm{poly}(1/\delta).$$</summary>

    <title>TR22-036 |  Classes of Hard Formulas for QBF Resolution | 

	Agnes Schleitzer, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff</title>
    <summary>To date, we know only a few handcrafted quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) that are hard for central QBF resolution systems such as Q and QU, and only one specific QBF family to separate Q and QU. 

Here we provide a general method to construct hard formulas for Q and  QU. The construction uses simple propositional formulas (e.g. minimally unsatisfiable formulas) in combination with easy QBF gadgets (Sigma_2^b formulas without constant winning strategies). 
This leads to a host of new hard formulas, including new classes of hard random QBFs. 

We further present generic constructions for formulas separating Q and QU, and for separating Q and LDQ.</summary>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>:  A standard assumption for causal inference from observational data is that one has measured a sufficiently rich set of covariates to ensure that within covariates strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed treatment values. Skepticism about the exchangeability assumption in observational studies is often warranted because it hinges on one’s ability to accurately measure covariates capturing all potential sources of confounding. Realistically, confounding mechanisms can rarely if ever, be learned with certainty from measured covariates. One can therefore only ever hope that covariate measurements are at best proxies of true underlying confounding mechanisms operating in an observational study, thus invalidating causal claims made on basis of standard exchangeability conditions.</p>



<p>Causal learning from proxies is a challenging inverse problem which has to date remained unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a formal potential outcome framework for proximal causal learning, which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn about causal effects in settings where exchangeability based on measured covariates fails. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are given, leading to the proximal g-formula and corresponding proximal g-computation algorithm for estimation, both generalizations of Robins’ foundational g-formula and g-computation algorithm, which account explicitly for bias due to unmeasured confounding. Both point treatment and time-varying treatment settings are considered, and an application of proximal g-computation of causal effects is given for illustration.</p>

communication constraints. We propose a correlated quantization protocol whose
error guarantee depends on the deviation of data points instead of their
absolute range. The design doesn't need any prior knowledge on the
concentration property of the dataset, which is required to get such dependence
in previous works. We show that applying the proposed protocol as sub-routine
in distributed optimization algorithms leads to better convergence rates. We
also prove the optimality of our protocol under mild assumptions. Experimental
results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing mean estimation
protocols on a diverse set of tasks.

in graphs excluding a subdivided claw $S_{t,t,t}$ as an induced subgraph
[Chudnovsky, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, Thomass\'{e}, SODA 2020] and provide a
subexponential-time algorithm with improved running time
$2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ and a quasipolynomial-time approximation
scheme with improved running time $2^{\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1} \log^{5}
n)}$.
</p>
<p>The Gy\'arf\'as' path argument, a powerful tool that is the main building
block for many algorithms in $P_t$-free graphs, ensures that given an
$n$-vertex $P_t$-free graph, in polynomial time we can find a set $P$ of at
most $t-1$ vertices, such that every connected component of $G-N[P]$ has at
most $n/2$ vertices. Our main technical contribution is an analog of this
result for $S_{t,t,t}$-free graphs: given an $n$-vertex $S_{t,t,t}$-free graph,
in polynomial time we can find a set $P$ of $\mathcal{O}(t \log n)$ vertices
and an extended strip decomposition (an appropriate analog of the decomposition
into connected components) of $G-N[P]$ such that every particle (an appropriate
analog of a connected component to recurse on) of the said extended strip
decomposition has at most $n/2$ vertices.

large graphs require fast algorithms. Vertex ordering allows to orient the
edges from lower to higher vertex indices, and state-of-the-art triangle
listing algorithms use this to accelerate their execution and to bound their
time complexity. Yet, only two basic orderings have been tested. In this paper,
we show that studying the precise cost of algorithms instead of their bounded
complexity leads to faster solutions. We introduce cost functions that link
ordering properties with the running time of a given algorithm. We prove that
their minimization is NP-hard and propose heuristics to obtain new orderings
with different trade-offs between cost reduction and ordering time. Using
datasets with up to two billion edges, we show that our heuristics accelerate
the listing of triangles by an average of 30% when the ordering is already
given as an input, and 15% when the ordering time is included.

three simple closed quasigeodesics. Whereas a geodesic has exactly pi surface
angle to either side at each point, a quasigeodesic has at most pi surface
angle to either side at each point. Pogorelov's existence proof did not suggest
a way to identify the three quasigeodesics, and it is only recently that a
finite algorithm has been proposed.
</p>
<p>Here we identify three simple closed quasigeodesics on any tetrahedron: at
least one through 1 vertex, at least one through 2 vertices, and at least one
through 3 vertices. The only exception is that isosceles tetrahedra have simple
closed geodesics but do not have a 1-vertex quasigeodesic.

<p>We also identify an infinite class of tetrahedra that each have at least 34
simple closed quasigeodesics.

vertices $s,t$ ($s \neq t$), there is a neighbor vertex of $s$ that is closer
to $t$ than to $s$ in the Euclidean distance. Greedy drawings are important in
the context of message routing in networks, and graph classes that admit greedy
drawings have been actively studied. N\"{o}llenburg and Prutkin (Discrete
Comput. Geom., 58(3), pp.543-579, 2017) gave a characterization of
greedy-drawable trees in terms of an inequality system that contains a
non-linear equation. Using the characterization, they gave a linear-time
recognition algorithm for greedy-drawable trees of maximum degree $\leq 4$.
However, a combinatorial characterization of greedy-drawable trees of maximum
degree 5 was left open. In this paper, we give a combinatorial characterization
of greedy-drawable trees of maximum degree $5$, which leads to a complete
combinatorial characterization of greedy-drawable trees. Furthermore, we give a
characterization of greedy-drawable pseudo-trees. It turns out that
greedy-drawable pseudo-trees admit a simpler characterization than
greedy-drawable trees.

    <title>Neighborhood persistency of the linear optimization relaxation of integer linear optimization</title>

optimization (LO) relaxation is a property that for every optimal solution of
the relaxation that assigns integer values to some variables, there exists an
optimal solution of the ILO problem in which these variables retain the same
values. Although persistency has been used to develop heuristic, approximation,
and fixed-parameter algorithms for special cases of ILO, its applicability
remains unknown in the literature. In this paper we reveal a maximal subclass
of ILO such that its LO relaxation has persistency. Specifically, we show that
the LO relaxation of ILO on unit-two-variable-per-inequality (UTVPI) systems
has persistency and is (in a certain sense) maximal among such ILO. Our
persistency result generalizes the results of Nemhauser and Trotter, Hochbaum
et al., and Fiorini et al. Even more, we propose a stronger property called
\emph{neighborhood persistency} and show that the LO relaxation of ILO on UTVPI
systems in general has this property. Using this stronger result, we obtain a
fixed-parameter algorithm (where the parameter is the solution size) and
another proof of two-approximability for ILO on UTVPI systems where objective
functions and variables are non-negative.

first study the social distance width of two polygonal curves in one and two
dimensions, providing conditional lower bounds and matching algorithms.

<p>We then consider social distance width among polygons, which measures the
minimum distance that two agents can maintain while restricted to travel in or
on the boundary of the same polygon. We investigate several variants of the
problem in this setting, for some of which we provide linear time algorithms.

<p>We draw connections between our proposed social distancing measure and
existing related work in computational geometry, hoping that our new measure
may spawn investigations into further interesting problems that arise.

    <title>Metric Entropy Duality and the Sample Complexity of Outcome Indistinguishability</title>

indistinguishability, a theoretical framework of machine learning recently
introduced by Dwork, Kim, Reingold, Rothblum, and Yona (STOC 2021). In outcome
indistinguishability, the goal of the learner is to output a predictor that
cannot be distinguished from the target predictor by a class $D$ of
distinguishers examining the outcomes generated according to the predictors'
predictions.
</p>
<p>In the distribution-specific and realizable setting where the learner is
given the data distribution together with a predictor class $P$ containing the
target predictor, we show that the sample complexity of outcome
indistinguishability is characterized by the metric entropy of $P$ w.r.t. the
dual Minkowski norm defined by $D$, and equivalently by the metric entropy of
$D$ w.r.t. the dual Minkowski norm defined by $P$. This equivalence makes an
intriguing connection to the long-standing metric entropy duality conjecture in
convex geometry. Our sample complexity characterization implies a variant of
metric entropy duality, which we show is nearly tight. In the distribution-free
setting, we focus on the case considered by Dwork et al. where $P$ contains all
possible predictors, hence the sample complexity only depends on $D$. In this
setting, we show that the sample complexity of outcome indistinguishability is
characterized by the fat-shattering dimension of $D$.
</p>
<p>We also show a strong sample complexity separation between realizable and
agnostic outcome indistinguishability in both the distribution-free and the
distribution-specific settings. This is in contrast to distribution-free (resp.
distribution-specific) PAC learning where the sample complexity in both the
realizable and the agnostic settings can be characterized by the VC dimension
(resp. metric entropy).

    <title>Computing Continuous Dynamic Time Warping of Time Series in Polynomial Time</title>

series, where we define a time series to be a one-dimensional polygonal curve.
The drawback of Dynamic Time Warping is that it is sensitive to the sampling
rate of the time series. The Fr\'echet distance is an alternative that has
gained popularity, however, its drawback is that it is sensitive to outliers.
</p>
<p>Continuous Dynamic Time Warping (CDTW) is a recently proposed alternative
that does not exhibit the aforementioned drawbacks. CDTW combines the
continuous nature of the Fr\'echet distance with the summation of Dynamic Time
Warping, resulting in a similarity measure that is robust to sampling rate and
to outliers. In a recent experimental work of Brankovic et al., it was
demonstrated that clustering under CDTW avoids the unwanted artifacts that
appear when clustering under Dynamic Time Warping and under the Fr\'echet
distance. Despite its advantages, the major shortcoming of CDTW is that there
is no exact algorithm for computing CDTW, in polynomial time or otherwise.
</p>
<p>In this work, we present the first exact algorithm for computing CDTW of
one-dimensional curves. Our algorithm runs in time $O(n^5)$ for a pair of
one-dimensional curves, each with complexity at most $n$. In our algorithm, we
propagate continuous functions in the dynamic program for CDTW, where the main
difficulty lies in bounding the complexity of the functions. We believe that
our result is an important first step towards CDTW becoming a practical
similarity measure between curves.

    <title>Mathematics books by women, in need of more reviews</title>
    <summary>The last couple of years, for International Women’s Day, I’ve posted about mathematics books by women covered by recently added Wikipedia articles. I have a few more of those that I could list today, and a few more that I plan to add, but instead, I thought I’d list books on mathematics and related areas that look interesting enough to me that I want to add them to Wikipedia, but haven’t, because I haven’t found enough reviews to use as the basis for an article.</summary>

<p>If you know of more reviews for these, please let me know! I need at least three in-depth reviews, published in journals or by major societies rather than just on a web site or someone’s blog, by three different reviewers, to be comfortable writing a Wikipedia article. It would also help convince other Wikipedians that the topic is a worthy one for Wikipedia if it had at least one review in an actual journal, not just in the MAA, EMS, AMS, and zbMATH review collections, for which one could argue that a review is “routine coverage” that doesn’t suggest any particular significance for a book. Even if you can’t find more reviews, you might find some of these titles and topics intriguing enough to read the books.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Symmetric positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices come up in a variety of places in machine learning, statistics, and optimization, and more generally in most domains of applied mathematics. When estimating or optimizing over the set of such matrices, several geometries can be used. The most direct one is to consider PSD matrices as a convex set in the vector space of all symmetric matrices and thus to inherit the Euclidean geometry. Like for the positive orthant (which corresponds to diagonal PSD matrices), this is not natural for a variety of reasons. In this post we will consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bregman_divergence">Bregman divergences</a> to define our notion of geometry.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A first natural and common geometry is to consider PSD matrices as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix">covariance matrices</a> (or their inverses, often referred to a precision or concentration matrices). They can thus be seen as parameters of zero-mean Gaussian random vectors, and classical notions from information theory, such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, can be brought to bear to define a specific geometry. This happens to be equivalent to using the negative log determinant to define the Bregman divergence, and leads to the usual Stein divergence $$ – \log \det A + \log \det B \ – {\rm tr}[ – B^{\, -1} ( A \, – B) ] =  -\log \det (AB^{\, -1}) + {\rm tr}( A B^{\, -1}) + d, $$ which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback Leibler divergence</a> between two Gaussian random vectors with zero means and covariance matrices \(B\) and \(A\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we consider a different but related matrix function, which will be \(A \mapsto {\rm tr }  [ A \log A]\) instead of \(– {\rm tr} [ \log A ]\). This will have stronger links with the Shannon entropy of discrete random variables [1]. In particular, we will be able to extend two classical notions related to discrete entropy:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>The entropy function \(H(p) = \ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i\), defined on the simplex \(\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) (vectors with non-negative components that sum to one), is concave, while the associated Bregman divergence, here the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence</a>, is $$ \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}. $$ It is jointly convex in the vectors \(p\) and \(q\) (see this nice article [<a href="http://carma.newcastle.edu.au/resources/jon/Preprints/Books/CUP/CUPold/MaterialI/bregman.pdf">6</a>] for other jointly convex Bregman divergences). Note that the joint convexity is here a direct application of classical results regarding the convexity of the perspective of a convex function [<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf">10</a>, section 3.2.6].</li><li>The Fenchel-Legendre conjugate of \(-H\) (with the simplex as domain) is $$\sup_{p \in \Delta} \ \ p^\top z\ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i = \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^d \exp(z_i) \Big).$$ With the positive orthant as the domain, we have $$\sup_{p \in \mathbb{R}_+^d }\ \ p^\top z \ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i = \sum_{i=1}^d \exp(z_i-1) .$$ This has many consequences in probabilistic modelling, notably the duality between maximum likelihood and maximum entropy [1, <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/Papers/WaiJor08_FTML.pdf">7</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">The extension to matrices will have several interesting consequences:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>This defines a Bregman divergence that has interesting applications to mirror descent and smoothing techniques in optimization.</li><li>The non-trivial joint convexity of the associated Bregman divergence will lead to elegant methods for deriving concentration inequalities for symmetric matrices [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>].</li><li>Application to covariance operators in infinite-dimensional spaces will lead to a whole range of information-theoretic results [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>], but this is for next month!</li></ul>



<h2 id="von-neumann-entropy-and-relative-entropy">Von Neumann entropy and relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given a positive semi-definite symmetric matrix \(A \in \mathcal{S}_d\), the von Neumann entropy is defined as $$H(A) =\ – {\rm tr} [ A \log A],$$ as the trace of the matrix function \(– A \log A\), or equivalently as \(– \sum_{i=1}^d \! \lambda_i \log \lambda_i\) where \(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_d \geqslant 0\) are the \(d\) eigenvalues of \(A\) (note that we can have a zero eigenvalue and still be finite). </p>



<p class="justify-text">From <a href="https://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last month blog post</a>, we get that \(H\) is concave. We can then naturally define on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrahedron">spectrahedron</a> (set of positive semi-definite matrices with unit trace), the <em>relative entropy</em>, which is the Bregman divergence associated with the function \(A \mapsto {\rm tr} [ A \log A]\), whose gradient is \(\log A + I \), leading to: $$D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} [ A \log A ] \, – {\rm tr} [ B \log B] \, – {\rm tr} \big[ ( A \, – B) ( \log B + I ) \big],$$ which is equal to $$ D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} \big[ A ( \log A \,  – \log B ) \big] – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ This time we have to be careful to avoid infinite values: it is finite if and only if the null space of \(B\) is included in the one of \(A\), or, equivalently if \(B^{\, -1/2} A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2}\) is finite. Note that when \(A\) and \(B\) have unit traces, the term in \(– {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B)\) goes away.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As a Bregman divergence of a strictly convex function, \(D(A\|B)\) is non-negative and equal to zero if and only if \(A = B\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(A = {\rm Diag}(p)\) and \(B = {\rm Diag}(q)\) are diagonal, we get $$D(A\| B) = \sum_{i=1}^d \Big\{ p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \, – p_i + q_i \Big\},$$ and we recover the traditional relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Please refrain from writing \(D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} \big[ A \log ( A B^{\,-1} ) \big] – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B)\), which is not true unless \(A\) and \(B\) commute. See however below how using Kronecker products can make a similar equality always true.</p>



<h2>A geometry on matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The von Neumann relative entropy (also referred to as matrix KL divergence) defines a new notion of geometry, which is different from the Euclidean geometry based on the squared Frobenius norm \(\| A – B \|_{\rm F}^2 = {\rm tr} [ ( A -B)^2]\). Below, we plot and compare balls for these various geometries. We first consider Euclidean balls, defined as $$\mbox{ Euclidean : } \  \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  \| A – B \|_{\rm F}^2 \leqslant r \big\},$$ as well as the two KL balls (one for each side of the KL divergence): $$ \mbox{ Left KL : } \ \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  D(B\|A)  \leqslant r \big\},$$ $$\mbox{ Right KL : } \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  D(A\|B) \leqslant r \big\}.$$</p>

<h2 id="pinsker-inequality-1">Pinsker inequality</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to use the relative entropy within mirror descent, we need an extension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsker%27s_inequality">Pinsker inequality</a> $$\sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \Big(\sum_{i=1}^d | p_i – q_i| \Big)^2,$$ which is, in optimization terms, the \(1\)-strong-concavity of the entropy with respect to the \(\ell_1\)-norm. It turns out that the natural extension is true, that is, for PSD matrices with unit trace, $$D(A\| B) =  {\rm tr} \big[ A ( \log A\,   – \log B ) \big] \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \| A \ – B \|_\ast^2,$$ where \(\| \cdot \|_\ast\) denotes the trace norm, a.k.a. the nuclear norm, that is, the \(\ell_1\)-norm of eigenvalues. See [<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yaoliang/mynotes/sc.pdf">3</a>] for a nice and simple proof.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This allows to use the relative entropy when optimizing over the spectrahedron using mirror descent [<a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/MLOptChapterI.pdf">11</a>]. Note that the diameter \(\sup_{A} {\rm tr} [ A \log A] \ –   \inf_{A} {\rm tr} [ A \log A] \) over PSD matrices with unit trace is equal to \(\log d\). Using duality, the relative entropy can also be used for smoothing the maximal eigenvalue of a matrix [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10107-006-0001-8.pdf">12</a>].</p>



<h2 id="joint-convexity-of-matrix-relative-entropy">Joint convexity of matrix relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While the convexity with respect to \(A\) is straightforward, the relative entropy \(D(A \| B)\) is also <em>jointly</em> convex in \((A,B)\), which is crucial in the developments below. There exist several proofs, but one is particularly elegant [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0604206.pdf">4</a>] and will use the matrix-monotonicity that I presented in the <a href="https://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last post</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kronecker products.</strong> We need to make a clever use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product">Kronecker products</a>. Given two matrices \(A\) and \(B\) of any sizes, \(A \otimes B\) is the matrix defined by blocks \(A_{ij} B\), thus of size the products of the number of rows and columns of \(A\) and \(B\). In the derivations below, both \(A\) and \(B\) will be of size \(d \times d\), and thus \(A \otimes B\) is then of size \(d^2 \times d^2\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Kronecker products have very nice properties (they would probably deserve their own post!), such as (when dimensions are compatible), \((A \otimes B) ( C\otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\) or \((A \otimes B)^{\, -1} = A^{-1} \otimes B^{\, -1}\). What we will leverage is their use in characterizing linear operations on matrices. For a rectangular matrix \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_2}\), \({\rm vec}(X) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 d_2 \times 1}\) denotes the <em>vectorization</em> of \(X\) obtained by stacking all columns of \(X\) one after the other in a single column vector. Then, we have $$ (B^\top \otimes A){\rm vec}(X) = {\rm vec}(AXB)$$ for any \(A, X, B\) with compatible dimensions. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Reformulation of relative entropy.</strong> We can now use Kronecker products to get: $$ {\rm tr} [A \log A] = {\rm tr}[ A^{1/2}( \log A) A^{1/2} ] = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top [ I \otimes \log A ] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}),$$ and $$ {\rm tr} [A \log B] = {\rm tr} [ A^{1/2}( \log B) A^{1/2} ] = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top [    \log B \otimes I  ] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}),$$ leading to $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ I \otimes \log A \ – \log B \otimes I \big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ The key element is then to use the identity for PSD matrices $$\log(C \otimes D) = \log C \otimes I + I \otimes \log D$$ (which can be shown using the fact that eigenvalue decomposition of a Kronecker product of symmetric matrices can be obtained from the decompositions of the factors), leading to $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ \log ( I \otimes A) \ – \log (B \otimes I) \big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})\, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ It seems we have not achieved much, but now, the matrices \( I \otimes A\) and \(B \otimes I\) commute! Therefore, we can now write $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \Big[ \log \big( ( I \otimes A) (B \otimes I)^{-1} \big) \Big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})- {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ This can then be rewritten as $$D(A\|B)  =\, – {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ \log ( B \otimes A^{-1}) \big] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Using matrix-convexity.</strong> We can now use the matrix-convexity of \(\lambda \mapsto \ – \log \lambda\), and the representation from <a href="http://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last post</a> as $$ -\log \lambda = 1-\lambda + (\lambda-1)^2 \int_0^{+\infty} \!\!\frac{1}{\lambda +u} \frac{du}{(1+u)^2},$$ leading to $$D(A\|B) =  \int_0^{+\infty}  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \Big[ ( B\otimes A^{-1} – I)^2 (B\otimes A^{-1} + u I)^{-1} \Big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \frac{du}{(1+u)^2},$$ and then, by using  \(( B\otimes A^{-1} – I) ( I \otimes A^{1/2})  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})  =  {\rm vec}(B-A)\), $$D(A\|B) =   \int_0^{+\infty}  {\rm vec}(A-B)^\top  (B\otimes I+ u I \otimes A)^{-1}   {\rm vec}(A-B)   \frac{du}{(1+u)^2}.$$ We can then use the joint convexity of the function \((C,D) \mapsto {\rm tr} \big[  C^\top D^{-1} C \big] \) to get the  joint convexity of \(D(A\|B)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This extends to all matrix-convex functions beyond the logarithm, such as \(\lambda \mapsto (\lambda-1)^2\), \(\lambda \mapsto 1 \, – \lambda^{1/2}\) or \(\displaystyle \lambda \mapsto \frac{1}{\lambda}(\lambda-1)^2\), leading to other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence">\(f\)-divergences</a> between matrices. See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>, Appendix A.4] for details.</p>



<h2 id="lieb-concavity-theorems">Lieb concavity theorems</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that \((A,B) \mapsto D(A\|B)\) is jointly convex on all PSD matrices (not only unit trace), for any fixed symmetric matrix \(M\), the function $$ \varphi: B \mapsto \sup_{ A \succcurlyeq 0} \ {\rm tr}(AM) + {\rm tr}(A) \ – D(A\|B), $$ as the partial maximization (with respect to \(B\)) of a jointly concave function of \((A,B)\), is concave. We can maximize in closed form with respect to \(A\) by computing the gradient \(M \ – \log A  + \log B\), leading to \(A = \exp( M + \log B)\), and $$\varphi(B) = {\rm tr} \exp ( M + \log B),$$ which defines a concave function. This is one version of the classical Lieb concavity theorems [<a href="http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000187087390011X/pdf?md5=09b7ceaa543358cef395fa6af8de62aa&amp;pid=1-s2.0-000187087390011X-main.pdf">8</a>]. </p>



<p class="justify-text">As a consequence, we can obtain the “subadditivity of the matrix cumulant generative function”. That is, for any random <em>independent</em> symmetric matrices \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) of the same sizes, $$ \mathbb{E} \Big[  {\rm tr} \exp \big(   \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \big) \Big] \leqslant {\rm tr} \exp \big( \sum_{i=1}^n \log \big( \mathbb{E} [ \exp( X_i ) ] \big),$$ which can be shown by recursion using Jensen’s inequality for the function \(\varphi\) above with a well-chosen matrix \(M\). See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are now ready to consider concentration inequalities for random matrices.</p>



<h2 id="application-to-concentration-inequalities">Application to concentration inequalities</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider random independent random matrices \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) such that \(\mathbb{E} [ X_i ] = 0\) for all \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\). Let \(S = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \! X_i\) (which has zero mean). Our goal is to provide upper bounds on \(\mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big]\) and \(\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big]\). We follow the outstanding work and presentation of <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~jtropp/">Joel Tropp</a> [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>]: using the proper matrix tools presented above, we can get for matrix-valued random variables the almost exact same proofs of the usual concentration inequalities for real-valued random <em>variables</em>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality">Hoeffding</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_inequalities_(probability_theory)">Bernstein</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azuma%27s_inequality">Azuma</a>, or Mac-Diarmid inequalities. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Expectation. </strong>We have, for any \(u &gt; 0\), by homogeneity of the largest eigenvalue: $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] = \frac{1}{u}  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(uS) \big] =  \frac{1}{u}  \mathbb{E} \big[  \log \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big].$$ We can then use Jensen’s inequality for the logarithm to get (together with the fact the largest eigenvalue of the exponential is the exponential of the largest eigenvalue): $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big]=\frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ ( \lambda_{\max}( \exp ( uS) ) \big], $$ and finally that for a PSD matrix the trace is larger than the largest eigenvalue, to get $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big].$$ Experts in concentration inequalities have probably recognized the usual argument to bound the expectation of the maximum of \(d\) random <em>real-valued</em> (non necessarily independent) variables \(X_1,\dots,X_d\), as $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \max \{Y_1,\dots,Y_d\} \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u} \log \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp(uY_1)+ \cdots + \exp(u Y_d) \big].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Tail bound.</strong> We have, using Markov’s inequality, for any \(u &gt; 0\): $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] = \mathbb{P} \big[ \exp(\lambda_{\max}(uS)) \geqslant \exp(ut) \big] \leqslant e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big],$$ thus leading to $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] \leqslant e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big].$$ The same experts have recognized $$ \mathbb{P} \big[ \max \{Y_1,\dots,Y_d\} \geqslant t \big] \leqslant  e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp(uY_1)+ \cdots + \exp(u Y_d) \big].$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">We can now consider random matrices such that \(a I \preccurlyeq X_i \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely for all \(i=1,\dots,n\) (and still with zero mean). We first need a lemma whose proof is given at the end of the post, with the exact same proof as for the uni-dimensional case.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lemma.</strong> If \(\mathbb{E} [ X ] = 0\) and \(a I \preccurlyeq X \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely, then for all \(u &gt; 0\), $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp( u X) \big] \preccurlyeq \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \big) I.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Together with the consequence of Lieb’s result presented above and the matrix-monotonicity of the logarithm, we get: $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big] \leqslant {\rm tr} \exp \Big( n \big( \frac{u^2}{8n^2}(b-a)^2 I \big) \Big) = d  \exp \big(   \frac{u^2}{8n}(b-a)^2 \big).$$ We can then get immediately, by optimizing with respect to \(u\) (with optimal value \(u=4 n t /(b-a)^2\)), $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] \leqslant d \exp\big( – \frac{2 n t^2 }{(b-a)^2} \big),$$ and, with optimal value \(u= {2 \sqrt{2 n \log d }}/ { (b-a) }\): $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{b-a}{\sqrt{2n}} \sqrt{ \log d}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that these are the exact same results as when \(d=1\)! </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Extensions.</strong> As nicely detailed in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>], there are extensions to all classical concentration inequalities. Moreover, this can be applied to rectangular matrices, where the largest eigenvalue is replaced by the largest singular value. Finally, for those who like to work in infinite dimensions and cannot bear the explicit dependence in dimension, it is possible to derive results that depend only on a well-defined notion of “intrinsic dimension” (the associated results can then be used for the study of kernel methods, see [<a href="http://di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf">13</a>, chapter 9]).</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we know everything about the matrix relative entropy and its convexity properties, we will explore next month a new link between eigenvalues of covariance operators and the regular Shannon entropy of the generating probability distribution [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>], thus mixing my favorite recent mathematical topic with my probably all-time favorite one: positive definite kernels!</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-lemma-on-matrix-cumulant-generating-functions">Proof of lemma on matrix cumulant generating functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lemma.</strong> If \(\mathbb{E} [ X ] = 0\) and \(a I \preccurlyeq X \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely, then for all \(u &gt; 0\), $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp( u X) \big] \preccurlyeq \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 I \big) =  \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \big) I .$$ Note that we have \(a \leqslant 0 \leqslant b\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proof</strong>. We follow the standard proof [9] for real-valued random variables, simply transferred to the matrix case. On the interval \([a,b]\), by convexity of the exponential function $$ \exp(u\lambda) \leqslant \exp(ub) \frac{\lambda-a}{b-a} + \exp(ua) \frac{b \, – \lambda}{b-a}.$$ Thus (check why we can do this), almost surely: $$ \exp(uX) \preccurlyeq \exp(ub) \frac{X-a I }{b-a} + \exp(ua) \frac{bI  – X}{b-a},$$ leading to \(\displaystyle \mathbb{E} [ \exp(uX) ]  \preccurlyeq   \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a} I\). We can then show that \(\displaystyle \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a}  \leqslant \exp \Big(  \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \Big)\) to conclude the proof. We thus need to show that \(\displaystyle \psi(u) = \log \Big( \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a}  \Big) \leqslant \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2\) for all \(u \geqslant 0\). We can simply express \(\psi(u)\) as a rescaled logistic function as $$\psi(u) =  ua + \log \frac{b}{b-a} + \log\Big[ 1 + \exp\Big( u(b-a) + \log\frac{-a}{b-a} \Big) \Big].$$ We have \(\psi(0) = 0\), and $$\psi'(u) =  \frac{ba \exp(ua)\ – ab \exp(ub)}{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}, $$ thus \(\psi'(0) = 0\), and through the link with the logistic function, the second-order derivarive is less than \((b-a)^2 / 4\). This leads to the desired result by Taylor’s formula.</p>

    <summary>A seminal result in learning theory characterizes the PAC learnability of binary classes through the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Extending this characterization to the general multiclass setting has been open since the pioneering works on multiclass PAC learning in the late 1980s. This work resolves this problem: we characterize multiclass PAC learnability through the DS dimension, a combinatorial dimension defined by Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014). 

The classical characterization of the binary case boils down to empirical risk minimization. In contrast, our characterization of the multiclass case involves a variety of algorithmic ideas; these include a natural setting we call list PAC learning. In the list learning setting, instead of predicting a single outcome for a given unseen input, the goal is to provide a short menu of predictions. 

Our second main result concerns the Natarajan dimension, which has been a central candidate for characterizing multiclass learnability. This dimension was introduced by Natarajan (1988) as a barrier for PAC learning. Whether the Natarajan dimension characterizes PAC learnability in general has been posed as an open question in several papers since. This work provides a negative answer: we construct a non-learnable class with Natarajan dimension one. 

For the construction, we identify a fundamental connection between concept classes and topology (i.e., colorful simplicial complexes). We crucially rely on a deep and involved construction of hyperbolic pseudo-manifolds by Januszkiewicz and Swiatkowski. It is interesting that hyperbolicity is directly related to learning problems that are difficult to solve although no obvious barriers exist. This is another demonstration of the fruitful links machine learning has with different areas in mathematics.</summary>

    <title>Random thoughts on the Russian Invasion of Ukraine</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> 1) My first thought was: Doesn't Putin know that his army (and his society) is corrupt and people are promoted on loyalty rather than talent, hence the invasion is not going to work? But then note</p><p>a) He invaded Georgia (the country not the state)</p><p>b) He annexed Crimea</p><p>c) NATO agreeing on sanctions? They can't even agree on what to have for lunch.  </p><p>d) The above question ASSUMES that he will lose. This is not clear yet.</p><p>2) The US and other countries are imposing sanctions. Visa, MC, and Netflix have withdrawn from Russia. Will these cause Putin to stop, or will they just impose hardships on the citizens without having an affect? I ask non-rhetorically. Foreign Policy is hard, though I suspect Biden has hired experts and is listening to them. Doesn't mean they are right. </p><p>3) This seems like a case where its obvious that Putin is in the wrong so I was surprised to see some Pro-Putin arguments. To be fair, some were more that we should not get involved, which is not quite Pro Putin. Here are some and my thoughts on them.</p><p>a) Putin never called me a racist and never made my kids learn Critical Race Theory. This is meant as a GOTCHA comment. To take it seriously one would have to (1) examine what American's are learning in grade school, (2) examine what Russians are learning in grade school, (3) see which country is giving their students a more honest view of things (particularly history), and (4) decide that whichever school is teaching more honest material deserves are support. </p><p>b) Putin is a strong leader and I admire strong leaders. Really? If  Biden was a strong leader who could push through the Build-Back-Better plan, would you admire that? You can't just admire strong leaders in the abstract, you have to see where they lead. (Same with admiring people who have principles.)</p><p>c) Putin stands for good Christian values. OH- so Putin likes to help the poor and does not approve of divorce or pre-marital sex. Oh, that NOT what you mean? Oh, you just mean that he does not like gay people or abortion. OH, thats not correct- Russia has the second most number of abortions of any country (see <a href="https://www.worldblaze.in/countries-with-highest-abortion-rates/">here</a>) So the only issue where Russia shares your values is in not liking gay people. Is that enough  commonality is enough to justify invading a country? This does raise the serious question: who do you support in a war? The country that shrares your values? The country that didn't start it (sometimes hard to tell, though not in this case)? The country you have a treaty with? These are good and serious questions. </p><p>d) How come the world does not like Putin's war based on lies and had no problem with W's war on Iraq that was based on lies? This is actually a good question. Being an academic by first impulse is to write a paper on it. There are differences between the invasion of Ukraine and Gulf War II, but still, lets assume that they really are somewhat equivalent. The person asking the question was probably AGAINST Gulf War II. Hence they should be against the invasion of Ukraine as well. So this is a good question about the America and NATO's Double standard and hypocrisy but is not a reason to be pro-Putin. (I was emailed that there are many conflicts that American and NATO do not care about that are as bad as Putin's invasion.) </p><p>e) Russia had real concerns about security. The last time Russia was invaded was WW II (if I am wrong then please correct me in the comments). Even so, I've heard analogies made to America freaking out when Cuba had Nuclear missiles. There were no nukes in Ukraine. Ukraine was not going to join NATO anytime soon. I wonder if this was a pretense on Putin's part and not a real reason. </p><p>f) See <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/3/4/2083726/-This-week-in-QAnon-Chronicles-Ukraine-enters-the-conspiracy">here</a>. I give an excerpt (I am not making this up). </p><p>But as its Covid mission has become less clear, the group’s channels have turned to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where conspiracy-minded thinking has flourished. While some group members have admonished Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion, QAnon and anti-vaccine contingents within the groups have seized on a false conspiracy theory that the war is a cover for a military operation backed by former President Donald Trump in Ukraine.</p><p>The conspiracy theory, which is baseless and has roots in QAnon mythology, alleges that Trump and Putin are secretly working together to stop bioweapons from being made by Dr. Anthony Fauci in Ukraine and that shelling in Ukraine has targeted the secret laboratories. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has emerged in the past year as a main target for far-right conspiracy theories.</p><p>3) I was somewhat surprised when Hungary came out against Putin. But Putin's arrangments with his allies are transactional- there is no real love there. I was much more surprised when Switzerland came out against Putin. Switzerland has been neutral since 1515 (I think I read that some place). </p><div><br/></div><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR22-034 |  Fourier Growth of Regular Branching Programs | 

	Chin Ho Lee, 

	Edward Pyne, 

	Salil Vadhan</title>
    <summary>We analyze the Fourier growth, i.e. the $L_1$ Fourier weight at level $k$ (denoted $L_{1,k}$),  of read-once regular branching programs.
We prove that every read-once regular branching program $B$ of width $w \in [1,\infty]$ with $s$ accepting states on $n$-bit inputs must have its $L_{1,k}$ bounded by
$$
  \min\left\{ \Pr[B(U_n)=1] (w-1)^k , s \cdot O\left((n \log n)/k\right)^{\frac{k-1}{2}} \right\}.
$$
For any constant $k$, our result is tight up to constant factors for the AND function on $w-1$ bits, and is tight up to polylogarithmic factors for unbounded width programs. In particular, for $k=1$ we have $L_{1,1}(B)\leq s$, with no dependence on the width $w$ of the program.

Our result gives new bounds on the coin problem and new pseudorandom generators (PRGs). Furthermore, we obtain an explicit generator for unordered permutation branching programs of unbounded width with a constant factor stretch, where no PRG was previously known.

Applying a composition theorem of B{\l}asiok, Ivanov, Jin, Lee, Servedio and Viola (RANDOM 2021), we extend our results to ``generalized group products,'' a generalization of modular sums and product tests.</summary>

    <title>TR22-033 |  A better-than-$3\log{n}$ depth lower bound for De Morgan formulas with restrictions on top gates | 

	Ivan Mihajlin, 

	Anastasia Sofronova</title>
    <summary>We prove that a modification of Andreev's function is not computable by $(3 + \alpha - \varepsilon) \log{n}$ depth De Morgan formula with $(2\alpha - \varepsilon)\log{n}$ layers of AND gates at the top for any $1/5 &gt; \alpha &gt; 0$ and any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In order to do this, we prove a weak variant of Karchmer-Raz-Wigderson conjecture. To be more precise, we prove the existence of two functions $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ and $g \colon \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ such that $f(g(x) \oplus y)$ is not computable by depth $(1 + \alpha - \varepsilon) n$ formulas with $(2 \alpha - \varepsilon) n$ layers of AND gates at the top. We do this by a top-down approach, which was only used before for depth-$3$ model. 

Our technical contribution includes combinatorial insights into structure of composition with random boolean function, which led us to introducing a notion of well-mixed sets. A set of functions is well-mixed if, when composed with a random function, it does not have subsets that agree on large fractions of inputs. We use probabilistic method to prove the existence of well-mixed sets.</summary>

<p/><h2> The Procedure </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My heart has not been beating well. So they had to implant a device that monitors the heart and also can restart the beating if needed. It was not a long operation—about one hour—but took two days recovering in the hospital. </p>

The worst part of the recovery is that it is not restful. And it is boring. I am now home and resting much better.</p>

<p/><p>
Well, according to Alan Turing, I was universal as soon as I began to use my brain. But can I leverage my new processing power?</p>
<p>
The doctors told Kathryn that some ideas from DNA computing went into my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantable_cardioverter-defibrillator">ICD</a> device. Of course, I cannot implement any DNA computing algorithms on my device. </p>
<p>
I wonder, however, whether I can get useful outputs by varying the input—such as my pulse. Maybe I do not want to experiment on myself there. But it is not too far-fetched to imagine that in the not too distant future many of us could be controlling computations with our heartbeats. Or at least powering them while controlling with brainwaves. Call it “heartbeat computing”—?</p>
<p>
Ken has a more immediate concern: could the computing power in the device be used to cheat at chess? Already many chess tournament prohibit electronic physio devices, even watches, because of this potential. A cognitive <em>implant</em>, however, could bend the rules on what it means to be a human player.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I want to thank all who sent some best wishes. I really thank you all for your thoughts. </p>
<p>
I must also especially thank my dear wife Dr.Kathryn Farley for her tremendous support. And also thank Ken for helping her make some calls on our behalf. Thank you both.</p>

<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02703">The Amplituhedron BCFW Triangulation</a> by Chaim Even-Zohar, Tsviqa Lakrec, and Ran Tessler</h3>

We prove that this conjecture is true.</span></p>
<p>Congratulations to Chaim, Tsviqa, and Ran!</p>
<p>Quick remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The introduction to the paper give a very friendly introduction of the topic as well as a variety of results between 2013 and today.</li>
<li>Ran Tessler gave recently a lovely colloquium talk about the result in Tel Aviv University, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uKYef392Fc3HrgyxJzRED6U8p0nqsR7/view?usp=sharing">here are the slides</a>.</li>
<li>For a 2015 post about these objects and some thoughts about the combinatorial side: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/the-simplex-the-cyclic-polytope-the-positroidron-the-amplituhedron-and-beyond/" rel="bookmark">The Simplex, the Cyclic polytope, the Positroidron, the Amplituhedron, and Beyond.</a> See also this post for <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/midrasha-mathematicae-18-in-and-around-combinatorics/">a related lecture series by Alexander Postnikov.</a> (Here are <a href="https://4gravitons.com/category/amplitudes-methods/">quite a few blog posts</a> on the physics side from “4-gravitons”.)</li>

<p>(Click for a larger image.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Questions that arise naturally: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is there an analog for the “moment curve”? Are there analogs for “neighborly polytopes”? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do amplituhedra maximize numbers of cells or related parameters like the cyclic polytopes do? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are they amplituhedra “universal” objects like vertices of the cyclic polytopes? </span></p></div>

    <title>Combinatorial Exploration: An algorithmic framework to automate the proof of results in combinatorics</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Are you interested in combinatorial mathematics? If so, I am happy to welcome you to the future! </p><p>I am proud to share with you a new, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07715" target="_blank">99-page preprint</a> by three colleagues from my department (<a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/bean.html" target="_blank">Christian Bean</a>, <a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/nadeau.html" target="_blank">Émile Nadeau </a>and <a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/ulfarsson.html" target="_blank">Henning Ulfarsson</a>) and three of their collaborators (<a href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/malbert/index.php" target="_blank">Michael Albert</a>, <a href="https://akc.is/" target="_blank">Anders Claesson</a> and <a href="http://jaypantone.com/" target="_blank">Jay Pantone</a>) that is the result of years of work that led to the birth of  Combinatorial Exploration.   <i>Combinatorial Exploration</i> is an algorithmic framework that can prove results that so far have required the ingenuity of human combinatorialists. More specifically, it can study, at the press of a button, the structure of combinatorial objects and derive their counting sequences and generating functions. The applicability and power of Combinatorial Exploration are witnessed by the applications to the domain of permutation patterns given in the paper. My colleagues use it to re-derive <i>hundreds</i> of results in the literature in a uniform manner and prove many new ones. See the <a href="https://permpal.com/" target="_blank">Permutation Pattern Avoidance Library (PermPAL)</a> and Section 2.4 of the article for a more comprehensive list of notable results. The paper also gives three additional proofs-of-concept, showing examples of how Combinatorial Exploration can prove results in the domains of alternating sign matrices, polyominoes, and set partitions. Last, but by no means least, the github repository at <a href="https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/comb_spec_searcher">https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/comb_spec_searcher</a> contains the open-source python framework for Combinatorial Exploration, and the one at <a href="https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/Tilings">https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/Tilings</a> contains the code needed to apply it to the field of permutation patterns. </p><p> "Det er svært at spå, især om fremtiden", as Niels Bohr and Piet Hein famously said. However, let me stick my neck out and predict that this work will have substantial impact and will be the basis for exciting future work. </p><p> Congratulations  to my colleagues! With my department chair hat on, I am very proud to see work of this quality stem from my department and humbled by what my colleagues have achieved already. As an interested observer, I am very excited to see what their algorithms will be able to prove in the future. For the moment, let's all enjoy what they have done already. <br/></p></div>

<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/next-tcs-talk">the online form</a>. Registration is <em>not</em> required to attend the interactive talk, and the link will be posted on the website the day prior to the talk; however, by registering in the form, you will receive a reminder, along with the link. (The recorded talk will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/past-talks">on our website</a> afterwards) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/suggest-a-talk">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: In this talk I’ll show how to revise the classical hardness-vs-randomness framework, so that it can work in a non-black-box fashion. Specifically, we will construct derandomization algorithms that don’t rely on classical PRGs, and instead “extract pseudorandomness” from the given input on which we want to simulate the probabilistic machine.</p>
<p>Using a non-black-box approach allows us to deduce stronger conclusions (or alternatively rely on weaker hypotheses), compared to classical approaches. In one instantiation of the new framework, we reveal a close connection between the promiseBPP = promiseP conjecture and a new type of uniform lower bounds. In another instantiation, we simulate probabilistic algorithms with essentially no observable runtime overhead, under plausible hypotheses.</p>
<p>Based on a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/080/">joint work</a> with <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~lijieche/">Lijie Chen</a>.</p></blockquote></div>

    <title>REU programs in general, and two at Univ of MD this summer.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>REU stands for Research Experience for Undergraduates. </p><p>REU programs are funded by the NSF. The NSF website of REU programs is <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp">here</a>. </p><p>Univ if MD at College Park dept of Comp Sci is running two REU programs this summer:</p><p>I (William Gasarch) am running  REU-CAAR (Combinatorics and AI Applied to Real problems) whose theme is applying theory to practice. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/">here</a>.</p><p> Jacquelyn Michaelis and Mihai Pop are running REU-BRIDGe (Bioinformatics Research In Data science for Genomics) which, as you can probably tell from the name, is in bio-comp. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cbcb.umd.edu/summer-internships">here</a>.</p><p>Most REU programs have the following: </p><p>1) There is an admissions period where many people apply (I had around 200 applicants last year) of which only about 10 get in. Some have money for a few extra students. This year both REU-CAAR and REU-BRIDGe have applications due March 22; however, in the past I have admitted students before then, so students who apply March 21 may be at a severe disadvantage. </p><p>2) Students apply from across the United states and these programs are competitive, so good to apply to several that you would definitely goto. Students ask me how many- I'll say 10 though temper that with only applying to those you REALLY would goto, and if there are MORE THAN 10 that look awesome, you could apply to more. </p><p>3) Students stay in the dorms (the last two years some programs cancelled, and some were virtual- mine was virtual) and get stipend of $6000, and a meal card. The program is 10 weeks.</p><p>4) Students work on projects in teams of 2-5. Some programs have the students pick what projects they would be happy to work on when they apply (mine does that) while others assign projects once students arrive (REU-BRIDGe will do that). The later makes sense if the program is very focused so the projects do not differ that much. </p><p>5) These programs are excellent for giving ugrads a chance to do research (NSF wants at least half of the students to come from non-research schools) and a sense of what grad school is like. So I recommend students thinking of grad school, or just want to do research, to apply to these programs. </p><p>6) Some students get papers out of the research. In these cases the research usually continues after the program is over. </p><p>7) It is healthy for a student to go to an REU program that is at a DIFFERENT school then where they are an ugrad for broadening. There may be mitigating circumstances where this is not possible. </p><p><br/></p></div>
