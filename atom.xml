    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Abstraction is an abstraction. You can’t touch it or taste it or photograph it. You can barely talk about it without resorting to metaphors and analogies. Yet this ghostly concept is an essential tool in both mathematics and computer science. Oddly, it seems to inspire quite different feelings and responses in those two fields. I’ve been wondering why.</p>
<p>In mathematics abstraction serves as a kind of stairway to heaven—as well as a test of stamina for those who want to get there. <img alt="West stairs to Grandview Park 2017-10-28" border="0" class="alignright" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/west-stairs-to-Grandview-Park-2017-10-28.jpg" width="340"/>West stairs to Grand View Park, San Francisco, October 2017. You begin the climb at an early age, at ground level, with things that are not at all abstract. Jelly beans, for example.  You learn the important life lesson that if you have <img alt="five jelly beans" border="0" height="14" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/five-jelly-beans-32-by-89.png" width="39"/> and you eat <img alt="three jelly beans" border="0" height="14" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/three-jelly-beans-32-by-53.png" width="23"/>, you will have only <img alt="two jelly beans" border="0" height="14" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/two-jelly-beans-32-by-36.png" width="16"/> left. After absorbing this bitter truth, you are invited to climb the stairs of ab­straction as far as the first landing, where you replace the tasty tangible jelly beans with sugar-free symbols: \(5 - 3 = 2\).</p>
<p>Some years later you reach higher ground. The sym­bols represent­ing par­tic­ular numbers give way to the \(x\)s and \(y\)s that stand for quantities yet to be determined. They are symbols for sym­bols. Later still you come to realize that this algebra business is not just about “solving for \(x\),” for finding a specific number that corresponds to a specific letter. It’s a magical device that allows you to make blanket statements encompassing <em>all</em> numbers: \(x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1)\) is true for any value of \(x\).</p>
<p>Continuing onward and upward, you learn to manipulate symbolic expressions in various other ways, such as differentiating and integrating them, or constructing functions of functions of functions. Keep climbing the stairs and eventually you’ll be introduced to areas of mathematics that openly boast of their abstractness. There’s <em>abstract algebra</em>, where you build your own collections of numberlike things: groups, fields, rings, vector spaces. <img alt="Ben Orlin cartoon: 'Sorry, I only do abstractions, not numbers.' 'But numbers are abstractions.' 'Let me clarify: I only do abstractions of abstractions of abstractions'.jpg" border="0" class="alignleft" height="301" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Orlin-abstractions-of-abstractions.jpg" width="400"/>Cartoon by Ben Orlin, <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/01/11/why-are-mathematicians-so-bad-at-arithmetic/">mathwithbaddrawings.com</a>, reprinted under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons license.</a>Another route up the stairway takes you to <em>category theory</em>, where you’ll find a collection of ideas with the disarming label <em>ab­stract nonsense</em>.</p>
<p>Not everyone is filled with admiration for this Jenga tower of abstrac­tions teetering atop more abstrac­tions. Con­sider Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s last theorem, and its reception by the public. The theorem, first stated by Pierre de Fermat in the 1630s, makes a simple claim about powers of integers: If \(x, y, z, n\) are all integers greater than \(0\), then \(x^n + y^n = z^n\) has solutions only if \(n \le 2\). The proof of this claim, published in the 1990s, is not nearly so simple. Wiles (with contributions from Richard Taylor) went on a scavenger hunt through much of modern mathematics, collecting a truckload of tools and spare parts needed to make the proof work: elliptic curves, modular forms, Galois groups, functions on the complex plane, <em>L</em>-series. It is truly a <em>tour de force</em>.</p>
<p>Diagram (borrowed from Kenneth A. Ribet and Brian Hayes, “<a href="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/extras/bph-publications/AmSci-1994-03-Ribet-Hayes-Fermats-Last-Theorem.pdf">Fermat’s Last Theorem and Modern Arithmetic</a>“) outlines the overall strategy of the Wiles proof. If you had a counterexample to FLT, you could construct an elliptic curve <em>E</em> with certain properties. But the properties deduced on the left and right branches of the diagram turn out to be inconsistent, implying that <em>E</em> does not exist, nor does the counter­example that gave rise to it.<img alt="Outline of the Wiles-Taylor proof of Fermat's last theorem" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1994-03-Fermat-F11-L-series-updated-2019.svg" width="550"/></p>
<p class="indent">Is all that heavy machinery really needed to prove such an innocent-looking state­ment? Many people yearn for a simpler and more direct proof, ideally based on methods that would have been available to Fermat himself. Ken Ribet will be presenting “A 2020 View of Fermat’s Last Theorem” at the Joint Mathematics Meetings later this week. In a <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202001/rnoti-p82.pdf">preview</a> of the talk, he notes that advances made since 1994 allow a more succinct statement of the proof. But those recent advances are no easier to understand than the original proof.At least nine attempts to construct an elementary proof have been posted on the arXiv in the past 20 years, and there are lots more elsewhere. I think the sentiment motivating much of this work is, “You shouldn’t be allowed to prove a theorem I care about with methods I don’t understand.” Marilyn vos Savant, the <em>Parade</em> columnist, takes an even more <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312106577">extreme position</a>, arguing that Wiles strayed so far from the subject matter of the theorem as to make his proof invalid. (For a critique of her critique, see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2975048?seq=1">Boston and Granville</a>.)</p>
<p>Almost all of this grumbling about illegimate methods and excess complexity comes from outside the  community of research mathematicians. Insiders see the Wiles proof differently. For them, the wide-ranging nature of the proof is actually what’s most important. The main accomp­lishment, in this view, was cementing a connection between those far-flung areas of mathematics; resolving FLT was just a bonus.</p>
<p>Yet even mathematicians can have misgivings about the intricacy of math­ematical arguments and the ever-taller skyscrapers of abstraction. <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/2818/">Jeremy Gray</a>, a historian of mathematics, believes anxiety over abstraction was already rising in the 19th century, when mathematics seemed to be “moving away from reality, into worlds of arbitrary dimension, for example, and into the habit of supplanting intuitive concepts (curves that touch, neighboring points, velocity) with an opaque language of mathematical analysis that bought rigor at a high cost in intelligibility.”</p>
<p>Quite apart from these comments on abstraction, the thesis is well worth reading. It offers alternating sections of “mathsplaining” and “laysplaining.” See also a <a href="http://digitaleditions.walsworthprintgroup.com/publication/?m=7656&amp;l=1#{%22issue_id%22:%22566588%22,%22page%22:%2250%22}">review in <em>MAA Focus</em></a> by Adriana Salerno. The thesis was to be published in book form last fall by Birkhäuser, but the book doesn’t seem to be available yet.For a view of abstraction in contemporary mathematics, we have a vivid image from Piper Harron, a young mathematician who wrote an <a href="http://www.theliberatedmathematician.com/math/">extraordinarily candid PhD thesis in 2016</a>. The introductory chapter begins, “The hardest part about math is the level of abstraction required.” She goes on to explain:</p>
<blockquote class="undent"><p>I like to imagine abstraction (abstractly ha ha ha) as pulling the strings on a marionette. The marionette, being “real life,” is easily accessible. Everyone understands the marionette whether it’s walking or dancing or fighting. We can see it and it makes sense. But watch instead the hands of the puppeteers. Can you look at the hand movements of the puppeteers and know what the marionette is doing?… Imagine it gets worse. Much, much worse. Imagine that the marionettes we see are controlled by marionettoids we don’t see which are in turn controlled by pre-puppeteers which are finally controlled by actual puppeteers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep all those puppetoids in mind. I’ll be coming back to them, but first I want to shift my attention to computer science, where the towers of abstraction are just as tall and teetery, but somehow less scary.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Suppose your computer is about to add two numbers…. No, wait, there’s no need to suppose or imagine. In the orange panel below, type some numbers into the \(a\) and \(b\) boxes, then press the “+” button to get the sum in box \(c\). Now, please describe what’s happening inside the machine as that computation is performed.</p>
<div id="adder-box" style="width: 230px; height: 97px; border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px auto; background-color: coral;">
	<input id="aInput" style="width: 150px; height: 18px; text-align: right; font-family: monospace; font-size: 12pt;" type="text"/><p/>

<p>	<button id="plus-button">+</button><br/>
	<input id="bInput" style="width: 150px; height: 18px; text-align: right; font-family: monospace; font-size: 12pt;" type="text"/></p>

<div style="font-size: 14pt;">c</div>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can probably guess that somewhere behind the curtains there’s a fragment of code that looks like <code>c = a + b</code>. And, indeed, that statement appears verbatim in the JavaScript program that’s triggered when you click on the plus button. But if you were to go poking around among the circuit boards under the keyboard of your laptop, you wouldn’t find anything resembling that sequence of symbols. The program statement is a high-level abstraction. If you really want to know what’s going on inside the computing engine, you need to dig deeper—down to something as tangible as a jelly bean.</p>
<p>How about an electron? In truth, electrons are not so tangible. The proper mental image is not a hard sphere like a BB but a diffuse probability distribution. In other words, the electron itself is an abstraction.During the computation, clouds of electrons drift through the machine’s circuitry, like swarms of migrating butterflies. Their movements are regulated by the switching action of transistors, and the transistors in turn are controlled by the moving electrons. It is this dance of the electrons that does the arithmetic and produces an answer. Yet it would be madness to describe the evaluation of <code>c = a + b</code> by tracing the motions of all the electrons (perhaps \(10^{23}\) of them) through all the transistors (perhaps \(10^{11}\)).</p>
<p>To understand how electrons are persuaded to do arithmetic for us, we need to introduce a whole sequence of abstractions.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, step back from the focus on individual electrons, and reformulate the problem in terms of continuous quantities: voltage, current, capacitance, inductance.</li>
<li>Replace the physical transistors, in which voltages and currents change smoothly, with idealized devices that instantly switch from totally off to fully on.</li>
<li>Interpret the two states of a transistor as logical values (<em>true</em> and <em>false</em>) or as numerical values (\(1\) and \(0\)).</li>
<li>Organize groups of transistors into “gates” that carry out basic functions of Boolean logic, such as <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">and</span>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">or</span>, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">not</span>.</li>
<li>Assemble the gates into larger functional units, including adders, multipliers, comparators, and other components for doing base-\(2\) arithmetic.</li>
<li>Build higher-level modules that allow the adders and such to be operated under the control of a program. This is the conceptual level of the instruction-set architecture, defining the basic operation codes (<em>add, shift, jump</em>, etc.) recognized by the computer hardware.</li>
<li>Graduating from hardware to software, design an operating system, a collection of services and interfaces for abstract objects such as files, input and output channels, and concurrent processes.</li>
<li>Create a compiler or interpreter that knows how to translate programming language statements such as <code>c = a + b</code> into sequences of machine instructions and operating-system requests.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">From the point of view of most programmers, the abstractions listed above represent computational <em>infrastructure</em>: They lie beneath the level where you do most of your thinking—the level where you describe the algorithms and data structures that solve your problem. But computational abstractions are also a tool for building <em>superstructure</em>, for creating new functions beyond what the operating system and the programming language provide. For example, if your programming language handles only numbers drawn from the real number line, you can write procedures for doing arithmetic with complex numbers, such as \(3 + 5i\). (Go ahead, try it in the orange box above.) And, in analogy with the mathematical practice of defining functions of functions, we can build compiler compilers and schemes for metaprogramming—programs that act on other programs.</p>
<p>In both mathematics and computation, rising through the various levels of abstraction gives you a more elevated view of the landscape, with wider scope but less detail. Even if the process is essentially the same in the two fields, however, it doesn’t feel that way, at least to me. In mathematics, abstraction can be a source of anxiety; in computing, it is nothing to be afraid of. In math, you must take care not to tangle the puppet strings; in computing, abstractions are a defense against such confusion. For the mathematician, abstraction is an intellectual challenge; for the programmer, it is an aid to clear thinking.</p>
<p>Why the difference? How can abstraction have such a friendly face in computation and such a stern mien in math? One possible answer is that computation is just plain easier than mathematics. In speaking of “computation,” what I have in mind is the design of algorithms and data structures suitable for a machine we can build out of material components. If you are playing with Turing machines and other toys of theoretical computer science, the game is altogether different. But in my view theoretical computer science is just a funny-looking branch of mathematics. (With apologies to those of my friends who grimace to hear me say it.) Anything that fits into the computer is necessarily discrete and finite. In principle, any computer program could be reduced to a big table mapping all possible inputs to the corresponding outputs. Mathematics is invulnerable to this kind of trivialization by brute force. It has infinities hiding under the bed and lurking behind the closet door, and that’s what makes it both fun and frightening.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation is that computer systems are engineered artifacts; we can build them to our own specifications. If a concept is just too hairy for the human mind to master, we can break it down into simpler pieces. Math is not so complaisant—not even for those who hold that mathematical objects are invented rather than discovered. We can’t just design number theory so that the Riemann hypothesis will be true.</p>
<p>But I think the crucial distinction between math abstractions and computer abstractions lies elsewhere. It’s not in the abstractions themselves but in the boundaries between them.</p>

<p>Warning from the abstraction police on the office door of Radhika Nagpal, Harvard University. (Photographed November 2013.)<img alt="Abstraction barrier doorway 3402" border="0" class="centered" height="472" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/abstraction-barrier-doorway-3402.jpg" width="640"/></p>
<p>I believe I first encountered the term <em>abstraction barrier</em> in Abelson and Sussman’s <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">Structure and Inter­pretation of Computer Programs</a>, circa 1986. The underlying idea is surely older; it’s implicit in the “structured programming” literature of the 1960s and 70s. But <em>SICP</em> still offers the clearest and most compelling introduction.In building computer systems, we are urged to compartmentalize, to create self-contained and sealed-off modules—black boxes whose inner workings are concealed from outside observers. In this world, <em>information hiding</em> is considered a virtue, not an impeachable offense. If a design has a layered structure, with abstractions piled one atop the other, the layers are separated by  <em>abstraction barriers</em>. A high-level module can reach across the barrier to make use of procedures from lower levels, but it won’t know anything about the implementation of those procedures. When you are writing programs in Lisp or Python, you shouldn’t need to think about how the  operating system carries out its chores; and when you’re writing routines for the operating system, you needn’t think about the physics of electrons meandering through the crystal lattice of a semiconductor. Each level of the hierarchy can be treated (almost) independently.</p>
<p>Mathematics also has its abstraction barriers, although I’ve never actually heard the term used by mathematicians. A notable example comes from Giuseppe Peano’s formulation of the foundations of arithmetic, circa 1900. Peano posits the existence of a number \(0\), and a function called <em>successor</em>, \(S(n)\), which takes a number \(n\) and returns the next number in the counting sequence. Thus the natural numbers begin \(0, S(0), S(S(0)), S(S(S(0)))\), and so on. Peano deliberately refrains from saying anything more about what these numbers look like or how they work. They might be implemented as sets, with \(0\) being the empty set and successor the operation of adjoining an element to a set. Or they could be unary lists: (), (|), (||), (|||), . . . The most direct approach is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church numerals</a>, in which the successor function itself serves as a counting token, and the number \(n\) is represented by \(n\) nested applications of \(S\).</p>
<p>From these minimalist axioms we can define the rest of arithmetic, starting with addition. In calculating \(a + b\), if \(b\) happens to be \(0\), the problem is solved: \(a + 0 = a\). If \(b\) is <em>not</em> \(0\), then it must be the successor of some number, which we can call \(c\). Then \(a + S(c) = S(a + c)\). Notice that this definition doesn’t depend in any way on how the number \(0\) and the successor function are represented or implemented. Under the hood, we might be working with sets or lists or abacus beads; it makes no difference. An abstraction barrier separates the levels. From addition you can go on to define multiplication, and then exponentiation, and again abstraction barriers protect you from the lower-level details. There’s never any need to think about how the successor function works, just as the computer programmer doesn’t think about the flow of electrons.</p>
<p>The importance of not thinking was stated eloquently by Alfred North Whitehead, more than a century ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alfred North Whitehead, <em><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41568">An Introduction of Mathematics</a></em>, 1911, pp. 45–46.It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copybooks and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilisation advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle—they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.</p></blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>If all of mathematics were like the Peano axioms, we would have a watertight structure, compartmentalized by lots of leakproof abstraction barriers. And abstraction would probably not be considered “the hardest part about math.” But, of course, Peano described only the tiniest corner of mathematics. We also have the puppet strings.</p>
<p>In Piper Harron’s unsettling vision, the puppeteers high above the stage pull strings that control the pre-puppeteers, who in turn operate the marionettoids, who animate the marionettes. Each of these agents can be taken as representing a level of abstraction. The problem is, we want to follow the action at both the top and the bottom of the hierarchy, and possibly at the middle levels as well. The commands coming down from the puppeteers on high embody the abstract ideas that are needed to build theorems and proofs, but the propositions to be proved lie at the level of the marionettes. There’s no separating these levels; the puppet strings tie them together.</p>
<p>In the case of Fermat’s Last Theorem, you might choose to view the Wiles proof as nothing more than an elevated statement about elliptic curves and modular forms, but the proof is famous for something else—for what it tells us about the elementary equation \(x^n + y^n = z^n\). Thus the master puppeteers work at the level of algebraic geometry, but our eyes are on the dancing marionettes of simple number theory. What I’m suggesting, in other words, is that abstraction barriers in mathematics sometimes fail because events on both sides of the barrier make simultaneous claims on our interest. </p>
<p>In computer science, the programmer can ignore the trajectories of the electrons because those details really are of no consequence. Indeed, the electronic guts of the computing machinery could be ripped out and replaced by fluidic devices or fiber optics or hamsters in exercise wheels, and that brain transplant would have no effect on the outcome of the computation. Few areas of mathematics can be so cleanly floated away and rebuilt on a new foundation.</p>
<p>Can this notion of leaky abstraction barriers actually explain why higher mathematics looks so intimidating to most of the human population? It’s surely not the whole story, but maybe it has a role.</p>
<p>In closing I would like to point out an analogy with a few other areas of science, where problems that cross abstraction barriers seem to be particularly difficult. Physics, for example, deals with a vast range of spatial scales. At one end of the spectrum are the quarks and leptons, which rattle around comfortably inside a particle with a radius of \(10^{-15}\) meter; at the other end are galaxy clusters spanning \(10^{24}\) meters. In most cases, effective abstraction barriers separate these levels. When you’re studying celestial mechanics, you don’t have to think about the atomic composition of the planets. Conversely, if you are looking at the interactions of elementary particles, you are allowed to assume they will behave the same way anywhere in the universe. But there are a few areas where the barriers break down. For example, near a critical point where liquid and gas phases merge into an undifferentiated fluid, forces at all scales from molecular to macroscopic become equally important. Turbulent flow is similar, with whirls upon whirls upon whirls. It’s not a coincidence that critical phenomena and turbulence are notoriously difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Biology also covers a wide swath of territory, from molecules and single cells to whole organisms and ecosystems on a planetary scale. Again, abstraction barriers usually allow the biologist to focus on one realm at a time. To understand a predator-prey system you don’t need to know about the structure of cytochrome <em>c</em>. But the barriers don’t always hold. Evolution spans all these levels. It depends on molecular events (mutations in DNA), and determines the shape and fate of the entire tree of life. We can’t fully grasp what’s going on in the biosphere without keeping all these levels in mind at once.</p>

straight line segments. We focus on perfect (all points are matched)
non-crossing (no two edges intersect) matchings. Apart from the well known
MinMax variation, where the length of the longest edge is minimized, we extend
work by looking into different optimization variants such as MaxMin, MinMin,
and MaxMax. We consider both the monochromatic and bichromatic versions of
these problems and provide efficient algorithms for various input point
configurations.

    <title>Assignment-based Path Choice Estimation for Metro Systems Using Smart Card Data</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1578873600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Baichuan Mo, Zhenliang Ma, Haris N. Koutsopoulosc, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/z/Zhao:Jinhua.html">Jinhua Zhao</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03196">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Urban rail services are the principal means of public transportation in many
cities. To understand the crowding patterns and develop efficient operation
strategies in the system, obtaining path choices is important. This paper
proposed an assignment-based path choice estimation framework using automated
fare collection (AFC) data. The framework captures the inherent correlation of
crowding among stations, as well as the interaction between path choice and
left behind. The path choice estimation is formulated as an optimization
problem. The original problem is intractable because of a non-analytical
constraint and a non-linear equation constraint. A solution procedure is
proposed to decompose the original problem into three tractable sub-problems,
which can be solved efficiently. The model is validated using both synthetic
data and real-world AFC data in Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system.
The synthetic data test validates the model's effectiveness in estimating path
choice parameters, which can outperform the purely simulation-based
optimization methods in both accuracy and efficiency. The test results using
actual data show that the estimated path shares are more reasonable than
survey-derived path shares and uniform path shares. Model robustness in terms
of different initial values and different case study dates are also verified.

<p>
Evelyn Lamb is a mathematician who is also a journalist. She has a blog called <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/">Roots of Unity</a> on the <em>Scientific American</em> blog network. Also impressive is that she designed the <em>AMS Page-a-Day Calendar</em> on behalf of the American Mathematical Society. It is <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-128/">available</a> from the AMS with member discounts and is filled with wonderful tidbits on math.</p>
<p>
The other day she interviewed Ken and me on P=NP.</p>
<p>
Ken just happened to be visiting me that afternoon in New York and we spoke to Evelyn about P=NP. The call was delayed because of equipment issues on both ends. Perhaps the fundamental problem is not P=NP after all, but making computerized equipment work. Oh well.</p>
<p>
Evelyn is writing an article for the <em>New Scientist</em> magazine about P=NP. She said it was driven by the near 20th anniversary of the Clay <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems">Prizes</a>. Recall there were seven of these, each with a million dollar prize. One, the Poincaré conjecture, was already solved. The others are still open—the million dollars is still there waiting for a brilliant researcher. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Questions and Answers </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is our own rendition of some questions that came up. We did not keep a recording or notes on our end, and we have paraphrased and expanded some things that we said:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>What is the update on P=NP?</i> </p>
<p>
Ken: The update is that here is no update. There is no recent progress on resolving P=NP—seemingly none this decade, I’d say. <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/01/23/progress-on-the-frontier/">This</a> is still light-years away from it and you could even say the difficulty needed for yea-much progress is discouraging. There are some conjectures that elaborate on P <img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neq}"/> NP, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture">Unique Games</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">(S)ETH</a>, but those two have gone less clear.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Does the Clay prize help researchers?</i></p>
<p>
Dick: I do not see that the prize gets anyone to work on P=NP. <br/>
Ken: I disagree. The prize does help people explain quickly what they are working on to others and why. This is quite valuable. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Could P=NP be undecidable?</i></p>
<p>
Dick: Who knows. I note that known proofs that some combinatorial problem is unprovable in Peano arithmetic somehow rely on a function that grows too fast. The famous Ramsey problem is a perfect example. I do not see any way to get such a function in the P=NP area. Of course I could easily be wrong.</p>
<p>
Ken: This is the subject by which Dick and I first came to know each other in the 1980s, for instance this <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800141.804652">paper</a> of Dick’s with Rich DeMillo vis-à-vis <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/topology-provability-complexity-theory/">one</a> of mine. I now believe it is resolvable but will need deep and complex techniques. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
Here I, Ken, went into the topic of “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200009791494X">Natural</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof">Proofs</a>,” as Dick did again later.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>When will P=NP be solved?</i></p>
<p>
Ken: We just <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/22/predicting-when-pnp-is-resolved/">discussed</a> this on our blog. The upshot is that the conjecture has been open long enough—coming to its 50th anniversary if you date it by Steve Cook’s famous 1970–71 paper, 64 years if you date it by Kurt Gödel’s 1956 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/the-gdel-letter/">letter</a> to John von Neumann—that it is going outside the range where data on other conjectures has any predictive value.</p>
<p>
Dick: There is a related issue with P=NP. Perhaps we have guessed the wrong direction. Most believe that P is not equal to NP. But many conjectures were finally resolved when someone worked on the right direction.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Who believes P=NP vs P <img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neq}"/> NP?</i></p>
<p>
Ken: Our friend Bill Gasarch has polled this three times since 2002. His <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper3.pdf">article</a> finds 80% support for P <img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neq}"/> NP, which he <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/03/third-poll-on-p-vs-np-and-related.html">says</a> goes higher among those who have worked more on it. I believe unequal, but Dick’s opinion is <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/12/08/pnp-perhaps-i-change-my-mind/">fluid</a> and Don Knuth recently said he takes the “equal” possibility seriously. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
I (Ken) started hunting for how we’ve covered Knuth’s opinion on GLL—it seems only a brief mention <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/missing-mate-in-ten/">here</a> and in comments <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/02/05/a-panel-on-p-vs-np/">here</a>—but Dick related hearing it in person from Knuth.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Why so Hard?</i></p>
<p>
Ken: If you believe P <img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neq}"/> NP, then it is hard because Nature—mathematical nature—does a bang-up job of making it seem like P <img alt="{=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{=}"/> NP. Most instances of NP-complete problems are easy; so called SAT-solvers have had much practical success. The larger issue is that nature has frustrated us from proving any nontrivial general lower bounds at all. You can allow a <img alt="{2^{O(n)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7BO%28n%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{O(n)}}"/> exponential-time algorithm to make exponentially-long queries to NP and yet no one has proved that the resulting language cannot be decided by <em>linear</em>-sized Boolean circuits. Ryan Williams needed a lot of effort to <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/the-ryan-wiliams-combine/">prove</a> that this class does not have constant-depth poly-size modular-counting circuits, but those could be weaker in relevant ways than general linear-size circuits. But this class is a <em>lot</em> bigger than NP. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
I then said another factor is that sometimes algorithms seem to make no visible progress until at the very end when they suddenly come up with a correct answer. Dick and I had <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/08/28/lower-bounds-and-progressive-algorithms/">tried</a> to <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/17/progress-on-progressive-algorithms/">quantify</a> a notion of progress. I then started talking about the “hardness versus randomness” phenomenon and the “Natural Proofs” barrier again (for which this 2016 <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/natural-journal.pdf">paper</a> by Ryan is a good reference) but Dick cut in with a nub of all these matters.</p>
<p>
Dick: A key issue is what I call “Bait-and-Switch” (indeed, in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/bait-and-switch-why-lower-bounds-are-so-hard/">post</a> on the first day of GLL). Suppose an output <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is believed to be hard. Add a random <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> to it. The result <img alt="{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z}"/> is also random. One branch of an algorithm computing <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> and another working on <img alt="{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z}"/> seem to have nothing to do with <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. Yet when you do <img alt="{y+z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%2Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y+z}"/> bitwise you have <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. This destroys any lower-bound argument that would be based on metering progress toward <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Guessing wrong way?</i></p>
<p>
Dick continued saying that this issue only affects the “not equal” position and maybe it’s a hint of people guessing the wrong way. This went back into some things that were said before, and then the call started winding up. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Things We Didn’t Say </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We had made mental notes while walking back from lunch across the street in time for the call, but forgot some of them. To recycle an old <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/01/06/verbal-contract/">saying</a>, a mental note isn’t worth the paper it’s written on. </p>
<p>
One of them was to remark on Gerhard Woeginger’s P Versus NP claims <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm">page</a> and the relative balance of claims of “Equal” and “Not equal.” As of its last update in September 2016, the 116 listed claims are (by Ken’s count) divided 62 for “Equal,” 49 for “Not equal,” 3 for unprovable/undecidable, 1 claiming no claim, and 1 for <em>both</em> “Equal” and “Not equal.” It may be that “Equal” predominates because its logical formula begins with <img alt="{\exists}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cexists%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\exists}"/> and it seems easier to imagine one has found a single <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> that works rather than to exclude all <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>—an infinite number of them. </p>
<p>
I (Ken) had intended to connect this and the P=NP poll results to our <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/11/goldbach-a-curious-conjecture/">post</a> two months ago about cases of open questions where one direction seems overwhelmingly supported both by evidence and sentiment. Whatever one thinks about the value of all the P-vs.-NP claims, they witness that P-vs.-NP is certainly not one of those cases. </p>
<p>
Last, I had intended to mention the deepest evidence in favor of “not equal.” This is the sinuous thin line between hard and easy cases of problems. Going back at least to Thomas Schaefer’s great 1978 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaefer's_dichotomy_theorem">work</a> classifying cases of SAT, we’ve been aware of a surprisingly sharp <em>dichotomy</em> between “hard” and “in P” with seemingly no buffer zone. And the line sometimes seems to fall capriciously. In the second half of this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/11/20/a-magic-madison-visit/">post</a> we mentioned Jin-Yi Cai’s work on dichotomy and a case relevant also to quantum where counting solutions to a fixed family of quadratic mod-4 polynomials in <img alt="{\{0,1,2,3\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%2C2%2C3%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{0,1,2,3\}^n}"/> is easy, but counting those in <img alt="{\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{0,1\}^n}"/> to the same polynomial is hard. For another instance of this widely-appreciated point, see Scott Aaronson’s discussion of 3SAT <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1720">here</a>.</p>
<p>
The point is that if P=NP (or counting is in P) then all of this finely filigreed structure would vanish—poof—an illusion all along. Like if the Mandelbrot Set became a smeary blob. But then we’d be left with: why did we have this illusion in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We suggested that she speak to some others—people more expert than we are. For this and other reasons the article may be quite different. We hope giving our own summary here is a help. What points would you add to it?</p>
<p>
We also forgot to ask her about her own work in Teichmüller theory. Here are a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/do-you-know-your-abcs/">couple</a> of her <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/contrasts-in-number-theory/">articles</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture">ABC</a> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/titans-of-mathematics-clash-over-epic-proof-of-abc-conjecture-20180920">Conjecture</a>. But that is not a Clay problem and is a subject for another decade.</p>

    <title>Counting grid polygonalizations</title>
    <summary>A polygonalization of a point set is a simple polygon having all the points as its vertices. Another way to think about it is that it’s a non-crossing Hamiltonian cycle in a complete geometric graph. My recent work on the hardness of counting polygon triangulations was motivated in large part by the problem of counting polygonalizations. Counting polygonalizations should also be hard, but I don’t know how to prove it, and I was hoping that proving other similar problems hard might either lead to more insights or at least provide something to prove a reduction from.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A <em>polygonalization</em> of a point set is a simple polygon having all the points as its vertices. Another way to think about it is that it’s a non-crossing Hamiltonian cycle in a complete geometric graph. <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/counting-polygon-triangulations.html">My recent work on the hardness of counting polygon triangulations</a> was motivated in large part by the problem of counting polygonalizations. Counting polygonalizations should also be hard, but I don’t know how to prove it, and I was hoping that proving other similar problems hard might either lead to more insights or at least provide something to prove a reduction from.</p>

<p>More recently I’ve been attacking the problem from a different direction: looking at the number of polygonalizations for special point sets that are structured enough to make it possible to compute the answer easily while not being completely trivial. The point sets I chose were the  integer grids. Smaller grids are uninteresting:  grids don’t have any polygonalizations and  grids have only one, the outer rectangle.</p>

<p>In a  grid, any polygonalization must touch the outer points of the grid in clockwise order. And any subset of the inner  points that are between the same pair of outer points can only be connected in consecutive order. So, to describe a polygonalization, we only need to determine for each inner point which pair of outer points it is between. One way to do this is to assign letters to the consecutive pairs of outer points (for instance  along the upper left, top, and upper right, and  along the lower left, bottom, and lower right).
Then, identify each polygonalization with a sequence of letters describing the positions of its  inner points, in their left-to-right order.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Polygonalizations of a 2x5 grid labeled by the positions of the three inner points in the cyclic sequence of outer points" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/gridcycles.svg"/></p>

<p>This gives a one-to-one correspondence between polygonalizations and strings, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each string has length .</li>
  <li>The letters of the strings are drawn from the alphabet .</li>
  <li>If a letter appears in a string, all its appearances are consecutive.</li>
  <li>The subsequence of letters from  appear in that order, as does the subsequence of letters from .</li>
  <li>It is not allowed to have both  and , nor to have both  and .</li>
</ul>

<p>These conditions are a little messy, but it’s possible to set up a recurrence for the number  of strings that don’t use the left and right side symbols, with  choices for the top (lower case) symbols,  choices for the bottom (upper case) symbols, and  labeled points in the middle.
In the recurrence below,  represents the number of symbols in the last contiguous block of equal letters, and  or  represents the number of letters that remain available with values earlier in the alphabetic order than the one that was used for this block. The recurrence is:</p>



<p>with base case . Then the total number of polygonalizations can be found by splitting up the overall length  of the string into substrings of left, top or bottom, and right symbols, using this recurrence to count the number of ways of filling in the middle part, multiplying by two for each nonempty left or right part (because there is a choice of upper or lower case for each of these parts), and summing over all splits. <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/gridcycles.py">My code to do this</a> tells me that the sequence of numbers of polygonalizations for  grids, for , is</p>



<p>(not yet in OEIS but I will submit it).</p>

<p>The next question is: how quickly does this sequence grow? It’s singly exponential (because that’s true of all 2d non-crossing geometric graph counting problems) but what is the base of the exponential? We can make a rough estimate by ignoring faxtors that are polynomial or smaller. The first estimate I tried was wrong: it was that there are roughly  ways of choosing whether each letter is upper or lower case, most of which assign roughly half of the letters to each case, and roughly  ways of choosing an upper or lower case substring of length , for a total of  choices. But this is an overestimate, because it doesn’t take into account the requirement that each letter be contiguous. It would allow strings like  which don’t correspond to polygonalizations, and that turns out to matter in the estimation.</p>

<p>To get a better estimate, we need to break down how we choose a string in a different way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, choose how many of the lower case letters are actually used, and then which subset of them is used.</li>
  <li>Second, do the same thing with the upper case letters.</li>
  <li>Finally, repeat  times choosing for each letter of the string whether it repeats the previous letter, takes the next lower case letter from the chosen subset, or takes the next upper case letter from the chosen subset, making sure that the first choice is not a repeat and that the total number of next-letter choices matches the number of different letters to choose from.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are polynomially many choices for how many letters of each type to use,
so the total number of choices is within a polynomial factor of the number of choices after we fix these numbers of letters to a single value, the one that maximizes the number of remaining choices. And we can estimate the number of remaining choices using Stirling’s approximation. Estimating the number of polygonalizations in this way shows that it is within a polynomial factor of , where</p>



<p>and where the number of letters we use from each case is . Here, some magic happens: It doesn’t look like  and  should have nice simple formulas, but they do. With  (the golden ratio), we get a maximum at , for which . So our sequence is approximately asymptotic to .</p>

<p>Probably if you go through the same estimation process more carefully, you can recover the polynomial factor as well. I wasn’t so careful; instead I just computed how far off from  the numbers in my sequence are, fit a line to these factors on a log-log scale, and observed that its exponent was approximately 1. So, the polynomial factor is , and numerically the sequence of numbers of polygonalizations above is a very good fit to</p>



<p>Why the golden ratio? I don’t know.</p>

    <title>TR20-002 |  Sensitivity lower bounds from linear dependencies | 

	Sophie Laplante, 

	Reza Naserasr, 

	Anupa Sunny</title>
    <summary>Recently, using spectral techniques, H. Huang proved that every subgraph of the hypercube of dimension n induced on more than half the vertices has maximum degree at least the square root of n. Combined with some earlier work, this completed a proof of the sensitivity conjecture. In this work we show how to derive a proof of Huang’s result using only linear dependency and independence of vectors associated with the vertices of the hypercube. Our approach leads to several improvements of the result. In particular we prove that in any induced subgraph of the hypercube with more than half the number of vertices, there are two vertices, one of odd parity and the other of even parity, each with at least n vertices at distance at most 2. As an application we show that for any Boolean function f, the polynomial degree of f is bounded above by the product of the 0- and 1-sensitivities, a strictly stronger statement which implies the sensitivity conjecture.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Spoiler Alert: </b>This post has details from the final episodes of the HBO television series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)">Silicon Valley</a><br/>
<br/>
A few times I've gotten emails from people claiming they have shown P = NP and asking whether they should keep their algorithm a secret to protect the cryptography out there. My typical response is that they should use their algorithm to mine a few bitcoins and then get back to me.<br/>
<br/>
The fictional characters of Pied Piper faced this dilemma when they AI they created "developed a general solution to discrete log in polynomial time" with some nice complexity class diagrams in the background.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0wC_yidITsY/Xg9oKlfZkrI/AAAAAAABu-g/OhzquwGwXbUqNDSDmGlpkU66wrjOcW62QCKgBGAsYHg/s1600/IMG_20200101_200809.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0wC_yidITsY/Xg9oKlfZkrI/AAAAAAABu-g/OhzquwGwXbUqNDSDmGlpkU66wrjOcW62QCKgBGAsYHg/s320/IMG_20200101_200809.jpg" width="320"/></a></div>
<br/>
Pied Piper was about to roll out its new internet, a distributed network that communicated between cell phones based on a compression algorithm developed by Pied Piper's CEO. Rolling out the network would reveal even more advanced compression based on breaking discrete log. "If we cancel it or shut it down, then others will try to copy or reverse engineer everything that we've built ... Our launch has to fail, publicly and spectacularly."<br/>
<br/>
But here comes the P v NP dilemma: "And what about all the other stuff we're gonna do? I mean, give internet to underserved communities, students in the homework gap, refugees, genomic research. Pied Piper can help scientists cure cancer."<br/>
<br/>
I'd take broken encryption over cancer any day. You can still do encryption even if P = NP, one-time pads distributed via USB drives or quantum. And cancer sucks.<br/>
<br/>
They should have mined a few bitcoins.</div>

In this post I want to state the Brown-Erdős-Sós conjecture and one of its variants. The trigger was a beautiful talk I heard from <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~liorgis1/">Lior Gishboliner</a> on some impressive progress toward this very difficult problem.  Yet the solution of the problem seems far, and some people even doubt if the conjecture is true.

<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pv.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16790" height="169" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pv.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>Lior’s talk reminded me that Peter Frankl and Voita Rodl told me in the late 80s about strong variants of the Brown-Erdős-Sós problem that implies the Szemeredi theorem. With the kind help of Voita Rodl  who is here I can tell you about two such variants. (But I am solely responsible for all mistakes.)</p>
<p>Let <em>f(n,v,e)</em> be the largest number of edges in an 3-uniform hypergraph with <em>n</em> vertices and no v vertices spanning e edges or more.</p>
<p><strong>Brown-Erdős-Sós Conjecture:</strong> <img alt="f(n,e+3,e)=o(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%2Ce%2B3%2Ce%29%3Do%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f(n,e+3,e)=o(n^2)"/>, for every <img alt="e\ge 3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5Cge+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="e\ge 3"/>.</p>
<p>For <img alt="e=3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%3D3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="e=3"/> the BES conjecture is the famous Ruzsa-Szemeredi theorem (that implies Roth’s theorem on 3-term arithmetic progressions). For <img alt="e=4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%3D4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="e=4"/> the conjecture is painfully open (and is stronger than Szemeredi theorem for 4-term APs).</p>
<p>Here is an even stronger conjectures that implies Szemeredi theorem arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length.</p>
<p>Consider the following 3-uniform hypergraph <em>H(v)</em> with<em> v+3</em> vertices and <em>v</em> edges: Start with a path with v+1 vertices (and v edges). Color the edges alternately with red and brown and add a red vertex and a brown vertex. Now form a 3-uniform hypergraph whose edges are the red edges of the path joined with the red vertex and the brown edges of the graph joined with the brown vertex.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/szem-voita1.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19110" height="205" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/szem-voita1.png?w=300&amp;h=205" width="300"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> Every <em>H(v)</em>-free 3-uniform hypergraph with <em>n</em> vertices has <img alt="o(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="o(n^2)"/> vertices.</p>
<p>For another strengthening of the BES-conjecture that implies the Szemeredi theorem see the paper <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publdoc.html?arg3=&amp;co4=AND&amp;co5=AND&amp;co6=AND&amp;co7=AND&amp;dr=all&amp;pg4=AUCN&amp;pg5=TI&amp;pg6=PC&amp;pg7=ALLF&amp;pg8=ET&amp;review_format=html&amp;s4=Rodl%20and%20Erdos&amp;s5=&amp;s6=&amp;s7=&amp;s8=All&amp;sort=Newest&amp;vfpref=html&amp;yearRangeFirst=&amp;yearRangeSecond=&amp;yrop=eq&amp;r=2&amp;mx-pid=1393704">A remark of Pisier-type theorems</a> of Erdos, Nesetril and Rodl. Famously, the celebrated hypergraph regularity lemma (and associated counting lemma) implies another Turan type theorem for hypergraphs that in turn implies Szemeredi’s theorem and its high dimensional extensions.</p>
<h2>The new bounds by Conlon, Gishboliner, Levanzov, and Shapira</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/bes2.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19114" height="173" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/bes2.png?w=640&amp;h=173" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Although the theorem is for 3-uniform hypergraph the proof relies on the hypergraph regularity lemma for higher dimensional hypergraphs.</p>

Larry David is an American comedian. He was the lead writer and producer of the <em>Seinfeld</em> TV series. During the previous and current election cycles he has played Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in skits on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. His “Bernie” rails about issues with passwords.</p>
<p>
Today I want to talk about reducing our dependence on passwords.<br/>
<span id="more-16539"/></p>
<p>
On SNL in October 2015, his “Bernie” branched off the topic of Hillary Clinton’s e-mails to famously <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2015/this-snl-skit-starring-larry-david-as-bernie-sanders-claiming-to-be-bad-at-tech-is-a-big-youtube-hit/">rant</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What’s the deal with e-mails anyway? I forgot my password the other day, so they say “We’ll email you a new one.” But I can’t get into my email to get the password. I mean, talk about a ball-buster. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
In the SNL <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/12/saturday-night-live-spoofs-democratic-debate-1202815760/">cold open</a> about the most recent debate three weeks ago, “Bernie” reprised the complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Apple lies, Amazon lies, even my I-Phone lies. Every time it says it’s at 1 percent battery, it stays on for at least 20 minutes. The other times it’s at 7 percent—it shuts down immediately. Apple, what are you trying to hide? And what’s my password?!! </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Passwords are still needed. But, and this is the key, we wish to reduce our dependency on them and still be safe. Also the method fits nicely with today’s need for access to encrypted information by law enforcement. We have already discussed this recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/03/end-to-end-encryption-a-problem/">here</a>. The trick is to make information safe enough to please us, but not have as many passwords that we need to remember. “Bernie” would be happy. </p>
<p/><p>
Let’s next review why we use passwords at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Why We Have Passwords </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Passwords have been used forever. See our friends at Wikipedia for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password">story</a> by Polybius, an ancient historian, on how eons ago the Roman military used watchwords. Passwords have been used since the beginning of computing, forever in our world, to safeguard computer systems. The MIT computer system, CTSS, used them starting in 1961 to protect users. This is the reason Fernando Corbató is credited with the invention of computer passwords. </p>
<p>
The goal of passwords and watchwords, is simple: Control access. Both the real and fake Bernies use e-mail passwords to keep their communications private. We try to select good passwords, but the management of them can be challenging. It’s not just that people like “Bernie” forget theirs—it’s that our efforts to keep them in our heads often make them too easy to figure out. Jimmy Kimmel showed this in a 2017 <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/jimmy-kimmel-gets-people-to-give-him-their-passwords/">segment</a> on his own show.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Passwords are Dead </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Managing passwords has lead to the theme, “passwords are dead.” If they are dead, then we must have alternative methods. Some are based on biometrics such as fingerprints and eye scans; others are based on additional hardware. Fingerprints are one of the most popular, but have major drawbacks: </p>
<ul>
<li>
They can be unreliable. <p/>
</li><li>
They can be attacked. <p/>
</li><li>
They cannot be changed.
</li></ul>
<p>I can attest that fingerprints are unreliable. I use a Global Pass to speed my re-entry into the US. After my flight arrives at the airport, I use a Global Pass machine that checks my fingerprints. The machine fails to recognize my fingerprints, every time. This forces me to talk to a custom agent and convince them am who I claim to be. Thus defeating the reason for using the Global Pass.</p>
<p>
A 2012 <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-817.html">study</a> by Joseph Bonneau, Cormac Herley, Paul Oorschot, and Frank Stajano tilted “The Quest to Replace Passwords” compared 35 alternatives to passwords on their security, usability, and deployability. They showed that most do better on security, many do better on usability. But all alternatives do worse on deployability. The authors conclude: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Marginal gains are often not sufficient to reach the activation energy necessary to overcome significant transition costs, which may provide the best explanation of why we are likely to live considerably longer before seeing the funeral procession for passwords arrive at the cemetery.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Colorful language, but the point is that passwords are hard to beat.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> How to Remove Them </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I have a proposal on how to avoid reliance on just passwords. At least for many applications. The idea is: You would use a password and add a secret password that you do not remember. You do not even know this password. You do not write it down. Clearly, this is additional security if you do not even know the secret password. No one can steal it from you or guess it.</p>
<p>
So the issue is: How do you access your own stuff without accessing the secret password? The answer is simple: You run a program that tries all the possibilities. Let this take some time <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/>. This point is that for many situations you will not mind if <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> is large. For example, when the access that you are protecting occurs rarely. The security that this affords is based on this: An attacker can and will definitely be able to get access by expending <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> time, if they also know you standard password. But this protects against mass attacks. An attacker may be able to get your data, but will not be able to get millions of people’s data.</p>
<p>
Let’s examine a few applications: </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>End-to-end Encryption:</i> The secret password could be protected by a <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of order years or even decades of computer time. This would allow law enforcement to get information it needs, while stopping causal attackers.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Recovery of your data:</i> The secret password could be protected by a <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of order days of computer time. Your computer backup data is secured by such a password. Then it crashes. You need to run such a computation to recover the data. In many situations this would be fine.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>A banking site:</i> You would still use a good password. The extra secret one could have a <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of an hour say. Then when you need to pay an on-line bill, you would have to wait a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Not need to place passwords in your will:</i> Omada King, in his 2013 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Identity-Passwords-Personal-Transformation/dp/1479781177">book</a> <em>The Making Identity</em>, wrote: </p>
<blockquote><p><em>[A]ccording to a recent survey from the University of London, one in ten people are now leaving their passwords in their wills to pass on this important information when they die. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This could be avoided by using a secret password with <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of order <em>months</em>. When it is needed the heirs would run the recovery program and get the access they need.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ken’s Words </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken points out that merely trying more than a few possibilities will usually generate a suspicious-activity message and usually a shutdown. So a system would have to be set up to permit “self-hacking.” Ken has a small rotation of “password extenders” not written down and often has to try two or three before gaining access to non-financial sites where he is registered.</p>
<p>
Ken is sometimes asked to monitor chess tournaments for possible cheating using the initial “screening” phase of his system. This phase requires minimal effort from Ken as it is supposed to be automated on a server that any chess tournament director would have quick access to, but for various reasons the International Chess Federation (FIDE) has not (yet) erected such a server. So Ken posts the auto-generated reports at a private location known only to him and the arbiter(s) of a particular tournament.</p>
<p>
Ken does not maintain a password scheme for the reports. This would become a headache precisely because of the difficulties people have with passwords. Ken does not want to assume the responsibility for managing them. Instead he includes a “quasi-password” as part of the URL he creates. These are often multi-lingual puns or references to quirky artists or factoids in the home country of the tournament. Being memorable and unusual enables the arbiter’s browser to learn the word and link without collision. </p>
<p>
This maximizes convenience: For Ken to e-mail reports or zipped folders as attachments would be cumbersome under daily updates. With Ken’s way, the arbiter can view updates even without having to pull up Ken’s previous e-mails with links, just by typing some letters of the weird word in the browser address bar. Hiding directory listings and a “no robots” directive completes minimal security for temporary use during the tournament.</p>
<p>
</p><h2> The First and Last Word? </h2><p/>
<p>We mentioned Fernando Corbató having originated passwords.  But before his passing last July 12, he came to regret them.  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-data-thefts-the-password-endures-1400725381">Here</a> he is quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“It’s become a kind of nightmare.  I don’t think anybody can possibly remember all the passwords.”
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
How practical do you find the “no-password” idea? At least the above suggestion may save us from having to place passwords in our wills. </p>

    <title>On leaving the EU</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">For someone based in the UK who works in any kind of international market, it looks reasonable to consider how his business strategy should be affected by leaving the EU. In the case of CS theory research, this perhaps runs counter to an idealised view in which all research is global, and should not be affected by squalid political considerations. The interest inherent in any specific problem or result ought to be independent of where it was studied. On a related note, it may be felt that it’s the research topic that chooses the researcher, not the researcher who chooses the topic. On the other hand, even in CS theory, ones political environment and associated social networks may have a stronger effect than we would like to acknowledge.<br/><br/>When I was a graduate student, Algorithms and Computational Complexity was relatively under-represented in the UK, compared with today. The UK theory community was dominated by so-called “Euro-theory”, which at the time did not seem to exhibit obvious points of contact with algorithms research. People like me had to look west for assurance that our research was of wider interest than what was apparent in our own backyard. To further justify that west-looking approach, it was clear that the USA was, in terms of research, the undisputed world leader. Then as now, it collected the lion’s share of Nobel prizes. It had industrial research labs producing leading CS theory research, such as IBM, AT&amp;T, and NEC, while Europe had nothing similar. For me, this sowed the seeds of a defiantly Atlanticist attitude to CS theory research — appropriate for Brexit Britain, perhaps? — that the best way to pursue high-quality research was via links with colleagues in the USA.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to about five years ago, and my attitude had softened. The UK’s algorithms-and-complexity community steadily grew, and is much larger than it was in the early 90’s. Travel within Europe is relatively quick and cheap, with no visa issues. The European research community became a bit of a comfort-zone, while the USA’s research ethic seemed comparatively intense and high-pressure. The perennial question of “Where’s my next STOC/FOCS paper going to come from?” has always seemed less urgent in Europe.<br/><br/>The EU has attempted to unify Europe’s academic research activity, which is supported by diverse governments, and gives rise to diverse complaints among European colleagues. I am reminded of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle">unhappy families</a>” quote from <i>Anna Karenina</i>. In an attempt to give it a bit of unity, there’s some EU funding for research, concerning which we have this criticism from <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/geim_lecture.pdf">Andre Geim’s Nobel prize speech</a>:  “I can offer no nice words for the EU Framework programmes which, except for the  European Research Council, can be praised only by Europhobes for discrediting the whole idea of an effectively working Europe.” For my part, I recently tried to get a grant from the European Research Council but they turned me down. If I were a rational agent, I should at this point be one of Geim’s Europhobes; of course in reality things are not quite so simple. But at this point I reckon the US research funding system looks like the least worst. <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/athenedonald/2019/12/16/post-election-christmas-reading-list/">A recent article</a> at Athene Donald’s blog discusses the post-EU era and the idea of a DARPA-like research agency for the UK.<br/><br/>So, leaving the EU looks like an opportune point to dust off the above-mentioned “Atlanticist attitude”. These days China is also becoming more important. But I hope that Europe will not give up on us, but will compete strenuously with them for our attention.</div></div>

    <title>The Wikipedia Entry on NP-Intermediary Problems lists one of mine! I'm not bragging about it.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I recently needed to look at what NP problems were possibly intermediary (neither in P nor NP-complete). So I went to Wikipedia and found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-intermediate">this</a>.<br/>
<br/>
They had many problems, though some I had never heard of. Those that I had never heard of<br/>
<br/>
<i>should they be on the list?</i><br/>
<i><br/>
</i> That is, are they natural? That is hard to define rigorously, but I will take you through my train of thought as I read the first few:<br/>
<br/>
<b>Factoring Integers</b>. Yes, quite possibly intermediary: If  its NPC then PH collapses, and, at least so far, does not seem to be in P.  (the NPC--&gt; PH collapse result: We take<br/>
<br/>
FACT = { (n,x) : n has a nontrivial factor ≤ x }<br/>
<br/>
FACT is clearly in NP:<br/>
a complete factorization of n provides evidence that some nontrivial factor is \le x.<br/>
<br/>
FACT is clearly in coNP:<br/>
a complete factorization of n provides evidence that no nontrivial factor is \le x<br/>
<br/>
so if FACT is NP-complete then SAT is in coNP.<br/>
<br/>
Factoring is clearly an important and well studied problem. It even has its own Wikipedia entry!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Discrete Log</b>. Similar to Factoring. And it is also an important and well studied problem. It even has its own Wikipedia Entry!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Isomorphism Problems</b> They list Group and Ring isomorphism. They don't list Graph, which is odd. (ADDED LATER- my bad, they do mention Graph Isom in the section on Graph Algorithms) Anyway, if Graph Isom is NPC then PH collapses, and, at least so far, there is no algorithm for Graph Isom in P. (I do not think it is know if Group Isom NPC means PH collapses, or if Ring Isom NPC means PH collapses---if you know of such a proof leave a comment and a pointer to it.)<br/>
<br/>
Graph Isomorphism is a well studied problem and seems important and natural (I don't know if Graph Isomorphism has any real applications they way that factoring and DL do).  It even has its own Wikipedia entry! Group and Ring Isomorphism also seem important and natural. And they have their own Wikipedia entry!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Numbers in Boxes Problem </b>My first reaction-Gee, whats that? For the Factoring, DL, and Isomorphism they did not define the problem-- they gave pointers to the Wikipedia entries on them. For this one there was no Wikipedia entry. There was one reference. I went to it. <i>It was a blog entry of mine</i>! Here it is: <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/07/what-is-complexity-of-these-problems.html">her</a>e, and to save you time I'll say what it is:<br/>
<br/>
{ (1<sup>n</sup>,1<sup>k</sup>) : you can partition 1,...,n into k boxes so that no box has x,y,z with x + y = z }<br/>
<br/>
Is this problem important? Does it exist anywhere outside of my blog entry? Yes--- a special case of it was in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Eccos-Cyberpuzzles-Dennis-Shasha/dp/0393325415/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Dr.+Ecco&amp;qid=1577931523&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2">Dr. Ecco's Cyperpuzzles by Dennis Shasha</a> (note- Dennis was a classmate of mine in graduate school at Harvard). I think the case was to try to partition {1,...,100} as best you can. Actually I first saw the case of the problem in his book and then generalized it.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is sparse so if it was NP-complete then P = NP, very good evidence that its not NPC. And its been studied for thousands of years, with people looking for poly time algorithms (I think Pythagoras studied it) without success, so its almost surely not in P. OR that last sentence was complete nonsense. Indeed, I don't think anyone has studied the problem computationally, or, for that matter, at all. So the evidence that its not in P is... sparse.<br/>
<br/>
But its worse than that. One could devise MANY sparse problems that are, since spares, likely NOT NPC, and hardly studied, so as-of-now, not in P. Should those count? Only if (a) more people study them so there is an attempt to point to to get it into P, and (b) the problem is natural (which is hard to define).<br/>
<br/>
Note that I can vary the problem: x+2y=z (this relates to lower bounds on VDW numbers)<br/>
or any other combination of x,y,z or more that I like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This raises a question:<br/>
<br/>
<b>When is a problem worthy of being put on lists of problems?</b><br/>
<b><br/>
</b> Here are some possibly criteria. One can take ANDS and ORS of them.<br/>
<br/>
1) The problem has a Wikipedia entry. This might fall victim to Goodhearts law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a measure.  That is, I could make a Wikipedia entry on the Number-in-boxes problem and then say LOOK, its on Wikipedia!<br/>
<br/>
2) More than X people have worked on the problem for some value of X. But here is a reason this might not be a good criteria: look at the problem<br/>
<br/>
{ α : α is a reg expression that allows numbers (so a<sup>1000</sup> is fine, makes reg expressions  VERY succint) such that L(α)=Σ<sup>*</sup> }<br/>
<br/>
This problem looks natural, and was proven by Meyer and Stockmeyer to be EXPSPACE complete.<br/>
That is the only paper on this problem, yet the problem really does look natural, and the result is rightly celebrated as a natural problem that is provably not in P.<br/>
<br/>
3) When people in the field look at the problem they say YEAH, thats a good problem.<br/>
<br/>
4) The problem relates to other problems or other fields.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt the Number-in-boxes problem satisfies any of these criteria. The variant with x+2y=z relates to Ramsey Theory. Great.<br/>
<br/>
NOW, back to the list-- I won't go through any more on the list, but I note that for some of them the only reference seems to be a conversation on stack-exchange.  Some of those end up referring to real papers so are more likely natural, but some do not.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, is there any harm in the list having on it some problems that are not ... worthy? Is that even the right word to use?<br/>
<br/>
Note that I don't have strong opinions on any of these matters, I am just wondering what criteria Wikipedia, and other sources, uses, when they have lists of problems.<br/>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Happy new year! And now for the last post of 2019 papers. We have found a diverse collection of six papers, ranging from classic property testing topics to new perspectives on sublinear computation. </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Optimal Policy Value Estimation in Contextual Bandits</strong> by Weihao Kong, Gregory Valiant, Emma Brunskill (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06111">arXiv</a>). This isn’t our usual sublinear paper, but it is definitely of interest to us sublinear folk. Let’s start with a stripped down definition of the problem (or rather, game). There are \(K\) “arms”, where the \(i\)th arm is represented by an unknown vector in \(\beta_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\). We are presented with a “context”, which is a vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\). Our job is to choose an arm \(i \in [K]\). We get the reward \(x \cdot \beta_i\) (with some noise added). The contexts appears from a known distribution. To aid us, we observe the rewards of \(N\) iid contexts, so we observe a total of \(T = KN\) rewards. There has been much work on figuring out the minimum value of \(T\) required to learn the optimal policy. One requires at least \(d\) (the dimension) samples to estimate any of the arm vectors. This papers shows that one can actually estimate the expected reward of the optimal policy, without being able to describe it, with sublinear in \(d\) (technically, \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})\)) samples. We see this a lot in property testing, where producing the “optimal” solution for a problem requires linear-in-dimension samples, but estimating the optimal value is much cheaper (consider, for example, the situation of linearity testing, where we wish to find the closest linear function).</p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Time Numerical Linear Algebra for Structured Matrices </strong>by Xiaofei Shi and David P. Woodruff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06060.pdf">arXiv</a>). This follows the recent linear of advances in sublinear time linear algebra. Given a matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\), the aim is to get algorithms that only look at \(o(nnz(A))\) entries (where \(nnz(A)\) is the number of non-zeroes, or the support). Consider the classic talk of low rank approximation. Unfortunately, suppose one entry is extremely large, and the others are extremely small. One has to find this large entry for any reasonable approximation, which (in the worst-case) requires \(nnz(A)\) queries into \(A\). Thus, previous papers make structural assumption (such as, \(A\) being a Vandermonde matrix) to get sublinear bounds. This paper gives a clean black box method to get a variety of such results. Basically, one can replace the usual \(nnz(A)\) term in many algorithms, by \(T(A)\), which is the time to compute the matrix-vector product \( Ay\), for \(y \in \mathbb{R}^d\). In many cases \(T(A) = \widetilde{O}(n)\), which can be significantly smaller than \(nnz(A)\). This paper gives such results for low-rank approximations and many regression problems.</p>



<p><strong>Robust and Sample Optimal Algorithms for PSD Low-Rank Approximation</strong> by Ainesh Bakshi, Nadiia Chepurko, and David P. Woodruff. Consider the low rank problem discussed above. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, we need structural assumptions on \(A\). Previous results gave sublinear time low-rank approximations assuming that \(A\) is positive semidefinite (PSD). The aim is to get a rank \(k\) matrix \(B\) such that \(\|A-B\|^2_2\) is at most \((1+\epsilon)\)-times the optimal such approximation. The previous algorithm of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03371">Musco-Woodruff</a> makes \(\widetilde{O}(nk/\epsilon^{2.5})\) queries in to \(A\), while there is a lower bound of \(\Omega(nk/\epsilon)\). This gap between the complexities is resolved in this paper with an upper bound of \(\widetilde{O}(nk/\epsilon)\) queries.</p>



<p><strong>Constructive derandomization of query algorithms </strong>by Guy Blanc, Jane Lange, and Li-Yang Tan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03042">arXiv</a>). This paper discusses an intriguing angle to sublinear question: when can they be derandomized? Abstractly, consider a randomized algorithm \(R\) that makes \(q\) queries. Think of \(R\) as a function \(R(x,r)\), where \(x\) is the input, and \(r\) is the randomness. We would like to design a deterministic algorithm \(D\) making, ideally, close to \(q\) queries and approximates \(\mathop{E}_r[R(x,r)]\). For starters, consider some distribution over \(x\), and suppose we want \(\mathbb{E}_x[D(x) – \mathbb{E}_r[R(x,r)]] &lt; \epsilon\). By (the easy direction of) Yao’s minimax lemma, one can show the existence of such an algorithm \(D\) that makes \(O(q/\epsilon)\) queries. But how to explicitly construct it? Indeed, the first result of this paper gives a “meta-algorithm” that takes as input the description of \(R\) (which is of size \(N\)), has running time \(poly(N)2^{O(q/\epsilon)}\) and outputs a description of \(D\). When \(R\) satisfies the stronger property of “bounded error”, one can get a \(O(q^3)\)-query algorithm \(D\) that approximates \(\mathop{E}_r[R(x,r)]\) for all \(x\) (again, the existence is proven by a classic theorem of Nisan). Overall, this paper gives a method to derandomize sublinear time algorithms, and I wonder if there could be some applications of this method for proving lower bounds. After all, Yao’s minimax theorem is <em>the</em> tool for property testing lower bounds, and any perspective on Yao’s theorem is likely of relevance. </p>



<p><strong>Testing Membership for Timed Automata</strong> by Richard Lassaigne and Michel de Rougemont (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08277">arXiv</a>). Property testing for regular languages is a classic result in sublinear algorithms. This paper focuses on the more complex notion of timed automata. The technical definition is quite complicated, but here’s an overview. There is a finite automaton and a collection of “clocks”. Imagine a string being processed, where each alphabet symbol appears with a new timestamp. Thus, the input word is called a “timed word”. The transitions of the automaton involve the new symbol read, as well as constraints involving the clock times and the timestamp. Thus, we can enforce conditions like “only transition if another symbol is read within a single time unit”. In general, deciding whether a timed word is accepted by a timed automaton is NP-complete. This papers studies the property testing viewpoint. The paper gives a new definition of “timed edit distance” between timed words. The main result shows that one can distinguish time words accepted by a timed automaton from words that are far (according to timed edit distance), by querying a constant number of word positions.</p>



<p><strong>On the query complexity of estimating the distance to hereditary graph properties</strong> by Carlos Hoppen, Yoshiharu Kohayakawa, Richard Lang, Hanno Lefmann, and Henrique Stagni (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01081">arXiv</a>). This paper concerns the classic setting of property testing of dense graphs. It is well-known that all hereditary graph properties are testable, and are moreover, one can estimate the distance to the property in time that only depends on \(\varepsilon\). Unfortunately, the queries complexities have large tower dependencies on \(\varepsilon\), arising from the use of the Szemeredi regularity lemma. The question of property testing in dense graphs can be reduced to finding “removal” lemmas (such as the classic triangle remove lemma). Such a lemma states that if at least \(\varepsilon n^2\) edges need to be removed from \(G\) to destroy all “forbidden subgraphs”, then there must be “many” forbidden subgraphs in \(G\). There is much recent research on finding families of forbidden subgraphs, where the “many” (in the above statement) is at least \(poly(\varepsilon)\) times  the trivial upper bound. This paper shows that one can also estimate the distance to any hereditary property, in a query complexity that depends directly on the corresponding removal lemma parameters. As a compelling example, one can estimate the distance to being chordal in \(\exp(1/\varepsilon)\) queries, a significant improvement over standard tower bounds.</p></div>

<p>M. Night Shyamalan is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan">creator</a> of many wonderful horror movies, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_(2004_film)">The Village</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense">The Sixth Sense</a>. His films often have a twist ending.</p>
<p>
Today I thought I would try to apply math and logic to his latest creation, the TV show called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_(TV_series)">Servant</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-16522"/></p>
<p>
I am not kidding. No number theory, no complexity theory, no strange theorems today. I thought I would try and apply some logic to attempt and understand M. Night’s story. The story was created by Tony Basgallop but M. Night’s direction modulates what we can see and how we feel it. <em>Servant</em> is on cable, on Apple TV, and is close to the end. It is a series of ten short episodes and the last two are due out in the next few days. </p>
<p>
The story is strange, scary, and unusual. M. Night likes to play with his viewers and make stories that are difficult to understand. Like many of our problems: Think P=NP or the Riemann Hypothesis, or the <img alt="{3x+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3x+1}"/> function problem. Our problems are strange, scary, and unusual too. Our difficulty is that we do not have a date when all will be explained. As we discussed <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/22/predicting-when-pnp-is-resolved/">here</a>, we might be waiting a long time before we get the “last” episode for P=NP, for example.</p>
<p>
Take a look at the rest even if you have not watched the series. I would like to think that working out the “solution” to the Servant is possible, but probably hard. I am not likely to have the answer here, but I think I may be on the right track, at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Story in Short </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is a brief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_(TV_series)">summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Six weeks after the death of their 13-week-old son, Philadelphia couple Dorothy and Sean Turner hire a young nanny, Leanne, to move in and take care of Baby Jericho, a reborn doll. The doll, which Dorothy believes is her real child, was the only thing that brought her out of her catatonic state following Jericho’s death. While Sean deals with the grief on his own, he becomes deeply suspicious of Leanne. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The players are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
The baby, Jericho. <p/>
</li><li>
The mom, Dorothy <p/>
</li><li>
The dad, Sean. <p/>
</li><li>
The brother, Julian. <p/>
</li><li>
The nanny, Leanne.
</li></ul>
<p>
I like this statement about <a href="https://netflixlife.com/2019/12/28/servant-s1e7-darkest-theory-jericho/">Servant</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <em>Servant</em> continues to frighten viewers while at the same time not providing audiences with answers. But have they been telling us more than we know? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> On-line Comments </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Like P=NP there is much debate and discussion about <em>Servant</em>. Here is a typical comment: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Never mind the mystery of whether Jericho is truly alive again or not, there’s also the fact that we have no idea how he died in the first place. New theory is that Dorothy killed him, either on accident or due to a bad postpartum depression episode. This would mean Julian and Sean covered it up. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
There are lots of details in the story that may or may not be important. There are many theories about what could be going on. One thing seems clear is that what is happening is mystery. Is it one that we can shed any light on?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Jericho is the Key </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The discussions on-line about what is happening seem to miss the key: Is the baby, Jericho, a plastic baby or a real baby? Most seem to accept that the baby was plastic and then was replaced by a real baby. This is where I can apply logical analysis. Let’s walk through the possible cases:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Perhaps Jericho is a magical object. Than the whole story is a dream. Or the players are ghosts. Or some other magical possibility. This reflects the fact that we do not have precise rules or axioms. M. Night could do anything he wishes. But I like to think that he plays by some rules. So let’s agree that this case is out.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Perhaps Jericho was a plastic baby at first and then became a real baby. This is the consensus of almost all viewers. At least if we can rely on their comments. The issue here is how does this work? How can a living baby suddenly appear? How can the mom and the nanny not notice the baby has become real? </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Perhaps Jericho was always a plastic baby. This seems to not be considered as a plausible case. It does require that the father and the brother are crazy. I like this idea. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Perhaps Jericho was always a real baby. This seems to be the most unusual idea. I think M. Night might like this direction. It would be the biggest twist. The baby was always real. Here M. Night is laughing at us: he would get the biggest shock if Jericho is always real. It would explain much. Then the mom and the nanny are just fine, we do not need to assume that they are crazy at all. Then the father and the brother are nuts. </p>
<p>
I think the last is my favorite. I wish I could “prove” that the last is the case. In a few days we should know what M. Night selected for the answer. I feel that our methods at least forced us to consider all the logical possibilities. Is this the right answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I hope you did not mind this diversion from hard core math. I think that applying logic may be useful here. Too bad we do not have a reveal date for our problems like P=NP.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241717-publish-and-perish/fulltext">Moshe Vardi’s latest insight in the Communications of the ACM </a>(whose title we adopt for this post) agrees with our previous post “<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2019/08/04/because-of-pollution-conferences-should-be-virtual/">Because of pollution, conferences should be virtual.</a>” Vardi calls for “sweeping policy change […] requiring that authors of accepted papers that must fly to  participate in a conference may opt out from in-person involvement and  contribute instead by video.”  Vardi gives some indication of the environmental impact of the travel-based system, and further suspects that in-person conference participation is “much less valuable than we would like to believe.”</p>



<p>These issues are closely related to the decades-old discussion of journals vs. conferences. <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia/">Several older posts on this blog </a>were devoted to that. Lance Fortnow, back in 2009, wrote that it’s <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/abstract">Time for computer science to grow up</a>.  The full text of this article is premium content, but you can read a pre-publication version <a href="http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/growup.pdf">here</a>. Basically, he argues in favor of a journal-based publication system.</p>



<p>Apparently in response, judging from the title, Boaz Barak wrote a piece titled <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/6/202644-computer-science-should-stay-young/abstract">Computer science should stay young.</a> I can’t quickly find a link to the whole thing, but his bottom line is online “I disagree with the conclusion that we should transition to a classical journal-based model similar to that of other fields. I believe conferences offer a number of unique advantages that have helped make computer science dynamic and successful, and can continue to do so in the future.”</p>



<p>I disagree that conferences are young. They belong to the BI (before internet) era, and so look rather anchored in the past to me.  Historically, I also suppose in-person discussion predates writing, though this is irrelevant.  What is young is the health impact of pollution (Fortnow and Barak’s pieces don’t touch on health issues). (By health impact I include climate change, but I prefer not to use that term for various reasons.)</p>



<p>And what is young and cool is arxiv overlay journals, TCS+ talks, videoconferences,  <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/">ECCC</a>, etc.</p>



<p>Instead, we impose on our community most inconvenient transoceanic flights.  To end I’ll quote from <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/MC/269.html">Oded Goldreich’s my choices</a>:</p>



<p><b>Phoenix in June:</b> […] One must be out of their mind to hold a conference under such weather conditions. I guess humans can endure such weather conditions and even worse ones, but why choose to do so? Why call upon people from all over the world to travel to one of the least comfortable locations (per the timing)?</p>

    <title>TR20-001 |  Nullstellensatz Size-Degree Trade-offs from Reversible Pebbling | 

	Or Meir, 

	Susanna de Rezende, 

	Jakob Nordström, 

	Robert Robere</title>
    <summary>We establish an exactly tight relation between reversible pebblings of graphs and Nullstellensatz refutations of pebbling formulas, showing that a graph $G$ can be reversibly pebbled in time $t$ and space $s$ if and only if there is a Nullstellensatz refutation of the pebbling formula over $G$ in size $t+1$ and degree $s$ (independently of the field in which the Nullstellensatz refutation  is made). We use this correspondence to prove a number of strong size-degree trade-offs for Nullstellensatz, which to the best of our   knowledge are the first such results for this proof system.</summary>

Ben Orlin is a funny mathematician. His <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Only-Constant-Wisdom-Calculus/dp/0316509086/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=math0b2-20&amp;linkId=4b0342416ae54d5080032b8cc09bfc93&amp;language=en_US">book</a> title <i>Change Is the Only Constant</i> was <a href="https://math-frolic.blogspot.com/2019/12/books-closing-out-2019-with-some-faves.html">selected</a> by the blog <em>Math-Frolic</em> as the best mathematics book of 2019.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to try to get you to at least smile, if not laugh.</p>
<p>
Orlin is a funny chap—okay I just got back from London—so forgive me for using “chap”. Check Orlin’s site out for <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2015/12/30/a-mathematicians-new-years-resolutions/">proof</a> that he is funny. Here are some of his <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/09/13/literatures-greatest-opening-lines-as-written-by-mathematicians/">examples</a> of math types rewriting famous opening lines from books. We will make this into a kind of quiz. You must guess the book title from the modified quote:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The times had high variance. <p/>
</li><li>
Up to isomorphism there is one happy family. <p/>
</li><li>
It was a bright cold day, and the clocks were not mod 12. <p/>
</li><li>
All this happened, but not with equality. <p/>
</li><li>
<img alt="{2^2 \cdot 31}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E2+%5Ccdot+31%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^2 \cdot 31}"/> was spiteful, full of a baby’s venom. <p/>
</li><li>
It was zero at the leading ordinal of viewing.
</li></ol>
<p>
The third is the first hard one—I did not get it. The last one (of three from Ken not Ben) is probably unfair. All six of them, however, are on the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Lines-Literature-Coffee-Slaughterhouse/dp/B01D6TGVHW">First Lines Literature Coffee Mug</a>” which Ken received a year ago as a Christmas present from his sister. I did not know this when I chose the first three.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Orlin’s Resolutions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Many of us make resolutions for the new year. Here are some examples from Orlin:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Be better at explaining what I do to family and friends. I, Dick, have trouble with this one.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Not to prove by contradiction what can be proved directly. Assume that <img alt="{1+1 \neq 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B1+%5Cneq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1+1 \neq 2}"/> and <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/></p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Stop using the word “obviously.” Here at GLL we try to avoid this, at least when it is not obvious. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/">posted</a> about phrases to avoid a year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Our Resolutions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are some of ours:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Stop doubting quantum computer claims. Unless, adds Ken, you have a possible concrete way of challenging them…</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Start trying to apply AI methods to complexity theory. Could there be a new learning approach to 3-SAT? Note that PAC learning kind-of came from there. See for instance the end of <a href="https://elmos.scripts.mit.edu/mathofdeeplearning/2017/05/08/mathematics-of-deep-learning-lecture-4/">this</a>.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Stop trying to understand proofs that Peano arithmetic is inconsistent. I still do not understand what logic they use to prove that Peano is inconsistent. What if that logic is inconsistent? </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Start up some fundamental research ideas and attempts on hard problems again.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> And try to make GLL better, including making it appeal to a wider community. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The answers are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> by Charles Dickens: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Anna Karenina</em> by Leo Tolstoy: “Happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unlike in its own way.” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>1984</em> by George Orwell: “It was a bright cold day, and the clocks were striking thirteen.” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> by Kurt Vonnegut: “All this happened, more or less.” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Beloved</em> by Toni Morrison, who died this year: “124 was spiteful, full of a baby’s venom.” This <a href="https://www.shmoop.com/quotes/124-was-spiteful.html">explanation</a> of the line continues: “We know all about numbers being spiteful. We took high school algebra. We’ve experienced the pain. But in this instance, the quote isn’t actually referring to a number. There’s not some mysterious mathematical entity that’s come to wreak havoc on the characters in our story. Here, ‘124’ refers to…” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Lolita</em> by Vladimir Nabokov: “It was love at first sight…” But wait—this is not the first line of the novel. The first line is maybe not suitable for a coffee mug or family-friendly blog. Instead it is the first line of chapter 29 of part II. We did say it was unfair. <b>Update: Oops</b>—as noted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/resolutions-for-2020/#comment-107459">here</a>, it is the first line of <em>Catch-22</em> by Joseph Heller.  Maybe Ken’s Google engine shares his tendency toward chess-playing authors…
</li></ol>
<p>
Have a happy new year, and make some fun resolutions. Please let us know some of them, or ideas for ours.</p>

I mostly use a mix of Google Scholar (for searching), MathSciNet (for more targeted searches, reviews, and high-quality bibtex), and DBLP (for bibtex of CS papers not in MathSciNet) but maybe this will convince me to add ZB into the mix.</p>

Whatever, it’s now on “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomathematics">Pseudomathematics</a>” where it belongs.</p>

It’s fast and (for realistic error rates) uses fewer bits than Bloom or cuckoo. Cuckoo still wins if you need your sets dynamic, though: you can insert or delete elements easily, while Bloom can only insert and xor can’t handle any change.</p>

They all appear to generate random tree-like mazes in a square grid, but with different probability distributions on the trees. E.g. Kruskal and Prim generate minimum spanning trees for random weights, different from the uniformly random trees of Aldous–Broder and Wilson, and many others appear quite different from both.
The alternative algorithm at the main link of the via link is probably not the best choice.</p>

I’ve been working on cleaning up Wikipedia’s main convex hull article (not yet finished) and added this one to fill in some details. The problem has an interesting history: it’s been known to be solvable in linear time since 1979, and many different algorithms for the same problem have been published before and since, but most of them are wrong.</p>

We still don’t know whether the differential equations governing fluid flow lead to consistent and unique solutions for all time. But if you simplify the equations to throw away viscosity and compressability, and you allow the initial state of the fluid to have discontinuous boundaries between volumes of fluid with very different motion, you can cause it to reach a point at which it spins infinitely quickly.</p>

It’s not a good fit for my own research, and the word “fuzzy” in the title of one of the initial papers is kind of a red flag for me, but I think it’s a good thing that the move towards diamond-model open access is continuing.</p>

    <title>Complexity Year in Review 2019</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some great theorems this year including <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">non-deterministic double exponential time by quantumly entangled provers</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/integer-multiplication-in-nlogn-time/">integer multiplication in O(n log n) time</a>. But the result of the year has to go to a paper that gave a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/07/local-kid-makes-history.html">shockingly simple proof of a major longstanding conjecture</a>.<br/>

As we move into the 2020s, we tend to look back and look forward. The 2010s will go down as the decade computing and data transformed society, for better and worse. Google turned 21 this year as its OG leadership stepped down. I turned 21 in 1984, but 1984 seems closer than ever.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Last year we ended the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/12/complexity-year-in-review-2018.html">year in review</a> by </div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
We end the year with craziness, the stock market is going through wild gyrations, we have a partial government shutdown including all of NSF and an uncertain political landscape with different parties leading the two houses of congress. We're still in the midst of a technological revolution and governments around the world try to figure how to regulate it. I find it hard to predict 2019 but it will not be quiet.</blockquote>
2019 was not quiet and we're about to head into an impeachment trial, Brexit and a critical US presidential election. The real challenges of the twenties will come from massive transformation from automation, climate change and deepening divisions in our society. How will academia cope with changing demographics, financial challenges and educating to manage the technological revolution?<br/>
<br/>
Let's all take a deep breath, roll up our sleeves and get the decade going.</div>

    <title>TR19-186 |  Lifting with Simple Gadgets and Applications to Circuit and Proof Complexity | 

	Or Meir, 

	Susanna de Rezende, 

	Jakob Nordström, 

	Robert Robere, 

	Toniann Pitassi</title>
    <summary>We significantly strengthen and generalize the theorem lifting Nullstellensatz degree to monotone span program size by Pitassi and  Robere (2018) so that it works for any gadget with high enough rank, in particular, for useful gadgets such as  equality and greater-than. We apply our generalized theorem to solve two open problems:

* We present the first result that demonstrates a separation in proof power for cutting planes with unbounded versus polynomially bounded    coefficients.
Specifically, we exhibit CNF formulas that can be refuted in quadratic length and constant line space in cutting planes with unbounded coefficients, but for which there are no refutations in subexponential length and subpolynomial line space if coefficients are restricted to be of polynomial magnitude.

* We give the first explicit separation between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone real formulas. Specifically, we give an explicit family of functions that can be computed with monotone real formulas of nearly linear size but require monotone Boolean formulas of exponential size. Previously only a non-explicit separation was known.  
  
An important technical ingredient, which may be of independent interest, is that we show that the Nullstellensatz degree of refuting the pebbling formula over a DAG $G$ over any field coincides exactly with the reversible pebbling price of $G$. 
In particular, this implies that the standard decision tree complexity and the parity  decision tree complexity of the corresponding falsified clause search problem are equal.</summary>

    <title>A bet for the new decade</title>
    <summary>I am in Tel Aviv Theory Fest this week – a fantastic collection of talks and workshops organized by Yuval Filmus , Gil Kalai, Ronen Eldan, and Muli Safra.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I am in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tau-theory-fest/home">Tel Aviv Theory Fest</a> this week – a fantastic collection of talks and workshops organized by Yuval Filmus , Gil Kalai, Ronen Eldan, and Muli Safra.</p>



<p>It was a good chance to catch up with many friends and colleagues. In particular I met Elchanan Mossel and Subhash Khot, who asked me to serve as a “witness” for their bet on the unique games conjecture. I am recording it here so we can remember it a decade from noe.</p>



<p>Specifically, Elchanan bets that the Unique Games conjecture will be proven in the next decade – sometime between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2029 there will be a paper uploaded to the arxiv with a correct proof of the conjecture. Subhash bets that this won’t happen. They were not sure what to bet on, but eventually agreed to take my offer that the loser will have to collaborate on a problem chosen by the winner, so I think science will win in either case. (For what it’s worth, I think there is a good chance that Subhash will lose the bet because he himself will prove the UGC in this decade, though it’s always possible Subhash can both win the bet and prove the UGC if he manages to do it by tomorrow <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> )</p>

<p>The conference itself is, as I mentioned, wonderful with an amazing collection of speakers.  Let me mention just a couple of talks from this morning. Shafi Goldwasser talked about “Law and Algorithms”. There is a recent area of research studying how to regulate algorithms, but Shafi’s talk focused mostly on the other direction: how algorithms and cryptography can help achieve legal objectives such as the “right to be forgotten” or the ability to monitor secret proceedings such as wiretap requests. </p>



<p>Christos Papadimitriou  talked about “Language, Brain, and Computation”.  Christos is obviously excited about understanding the language mechanisms in the brain. He said that studying the brain gives him the same feeling that you get when you sit in a coffee shop in Cambridge and hear intellectual discussions all around you: you don’t understand why everyone is not dropping everything they are doing and come here. (Well, his actual words were “sunsets over the Berkeley hills” but I think the Cambridge coffee shops are a better metaphor <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> )</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I started out this decade with the project of writing a survey of the multi-armed bandit literature, which I had read thoroughly during the graduate studies that I was about to finish. At the time we resisted the temptation to name the survey “modern banditology”, which was indeed the right call given how much this “modern” picture has evolved over the decade! It is truly wonderful to now end the decade with two new iterations on the work we did in that survey: </p>
<ol>
<li><a class="lipdf" href="https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf">Bandit algorithms</a> by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesvari</li>
<li><a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07272">Introduction to bandits</a> by Alex Slivkins</li>
</ol>
<p>These new references very significantly expand the 2012 survey, and they are wonderful starting points for anyone who wants to enter the field.</p>
<p>Here are some of the discoveries in the world of bandits that stood out for me this decade:</p>
<ol>
<li>We now understand very precisely Thompson Sampling, the first bandit strategy that was proposed back in 1933. The most beautiful reference here is the one by Dan Russo and Ben Van Roy: <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/14-087/14-087.pdf">An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Thompson Sampling</a>, JMLR 2016. Another one that stands out is <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v23/agrawal12/agrawal12.pdf">Analysis of thompson sampling for the multi-armed bandit problem</a> by S. Agrawal and N. Goyal at COLT 2012.</li>
<li>T^{2/3} lower bound for  *non-stochastic* bandit with switching cost by Dekel, Ding, Koren and Peres at <u><font color="#000121"><a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2997">STOC 201</a></font></u><a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2997">4</a>. This is a striking result for several reasons. In particular the proof has to be based on a non-trivial stochastic process, since for the classical stochastic i.i.d. model one can obtain \sqrt{T} (very easily in fact). </li>
<li>We now know that bandit convex optimization is “easy”, in the sense that it is a \sqrt{T}-regret type problem. What’s more is that in our <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03084">STOC 2017 paper</a> with Y.T. Lee and R. Eldan we introduced a new way to do function estimation based on bandit feedback, using kernels (I have written at length about this on <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2016/08/06/kernel-based-methods-for-bandit-convex-optimization-part-1/">this blog</a>).</li>
<li>A very intriguing model of computation for contextual bandit was proposed, where one can access the policy space only through an offline optimization oracle. With such access, the classical Exp4 algorithm cannot be simulated, and thus one needs new strategies. We now have a reasonable understanding that \sqrt{T} is doable with mild assumptions (see e.g. this ICML 2014 paper on “<u><font color="#000117"><a class="liexternal" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0555">Taming the Monster</a></font>“</u> by Agarwal, Hsu, Kale, Langford, L. Li and Schapire) and that it is impossible with no assumptions (work of Hazan and Koren at <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02089">STOC 2016</a>).</li>
<li>Honorable mentions also go to the work of Wei and Luo showing that very strong variation bounds are possible in bandits (see this <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03265">COLT 2018 paper</a>), and Zimmert and Seldin who made striking progress on the best of both worlds phenomenon that we discovered with Slivkins at the beginning of the decade (I blogged about it <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/06/10/amazing-progress-in-adversarially-robust-stochastic-multi-armed-bandits/">here</a> already).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Life beyond bandits</h2>
<p>In addition to starting the decade with the bandit survey, I also started it with being bored with the bandit topic altogether. I thought that many (if not most) of the fundamental results were now known, and it was a good idea to move on to something else. Obviously I was totally wrong, as you can see with all the works cited above (and many many more for stochastic bandits, including much deeper understanding of best arm identification, a topic very close to my heart, see e.g., <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/kaufman16a/kaufman16a.pdf">[Kaufmann, Cappe, Garivier, JMLR 16]</a>). In fact I am now optimistic that there is probably another decade-worth of exploration left for the bandit problem(s). Nevertheless I ventured outside, and explored the world of optimization (out of which first came <a class="lipdf" href="http://sbubeck.com/Bubeck15.pdf">a survey</a>, and more recently <a class="liinternal" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAPSKVSdi0oZPbS-UD_kwT4ePZQx_CiME">video lectures</a>) and briefly networks (another <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03511">modest survey</a> came out of this too). </p>
<p>Here are some of the landmark optimization results of this decade in my view:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perhaps the most striking result of the decade in optimization is the observation that for finite sum problems, one can reduce the variance in stochastic gradient descent by somehow centering the estimates (e.g., using a slowly moving sequence on which we can afford to compute full gradients; but this is not the only way to perform such variance reduction). This idea, while very simple, has a lot of implications, both in practice and in theory! The origin of the idea are in the SAG algorithm of <a class="liexternal" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4633-a-stochastic-gradient-method-with-an-exponential-convergence-_ra">[Schmidt, Le Roux, Bach, NIPS 2012]</a> and SDCA <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/shalev-shwartz13a/shalev-shwartz13a.pdf">[Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang, JMLR 2013]</a>. A simpler instantiation of the idea, called SVRG appeared shortly after in <a class="lipdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4937-accelerating-stochastic-gradient-descent-using-predictive-variance-reduction.pdf">[Johnson and Zhang, NIPS 2013]</a> (and also independently at the same NeurIPS, in <a class="liinternal" href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4941-mixed-optimization-for-smooth-functions">[M. Madhavi, L. Zhang, R. Li, NIPS 2013]</a>).</li>
<li>An intriguing direction that I pursued fervently is the use of convex optimization for problems that have a priori nothing to do with convex optimization. A big inspiration for me was the COLT 2008 paper by Abernethy, Hazan and Rakhlin, who showed how mirror descent naturally solves bandit problems. In this decade, we (this we includes myself and co-authors, but also various other teams) explored how to use mirror descent for other online decision making problems, and made progress on some long-standing problems (k-server and MTS), see for example this set of <a class="liinternal" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAPSKVSdi0obG1b3w4k41JMLFbyBJS5AQ">video lectures</a> on the “Five miracles of mirror descent”.</li>
<li>Arnak Dalalyan showed how to use ideas inspired from convex optimization to <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7392">analyze the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm</a>. This was absolutely beautiful work, that led to many many follow-ups.</li>
<li>There has been a lot of rewriting of Nesterov’s acceleration, to try to demystify it. Overall the enterprise is not yet a resounding success in my opinion, but certainly a lot of progress has been made (again I have written a lot about it on this blog already). We now even have optimal acceleration for higher order of smoothness (see this 15 authors <u><font color="#000117"/><font><a class="lipdf" href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v99/gasnikov19b/gasnikov19b.pdf">paper at COLT 2019</a></font></u>), but these techniques are clouded with the same shroud of mystery as was Nesterov’s original method.</li>
<li>Yin Tat Lee and Aaron Sidford obtained an <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08033">efficient construction of a universal barrier</a>.</li>
<li>We now know that certain problems cannot be efficiently represented by SDPs (the so-called “extension complexity), see e.g. this work by <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6317">Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer</a>.</li>
<li>We now know how to chase convex bodies, and we can even do so very elegantly with <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/11/05/convex-body-chasing-steiner-point-sellke-point-and-soda-2020-best-papers/">the Steiner/Sellke point</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Some other things that captivated me</h2>
<p>The papers above are mostly topics on which I tried to work at some point. Here are some questions that I didn’t work on but followed closely and was fascinated by the progress:</p>
<ol>
<li>The stochastic block model was essentially solved during this decade, see for example <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~eabbe/publications/abbe_FNT_2.pdf">this survey</a> by Emmanuel Abbe.</li>
<li>The computational/statistical tradeoffs were extensively explored, yet they remain mysterious. A nice impulse to the field was given by this <a class="liinternal" href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1378386239">COLT 2013 paper</a> by Berthet and Rigollet relating sparse PCA and planted clique. In a similar spirit I also enjoyed the more recent work by Moitra, Jerry Li, and many co-authors on computationally efficient robust estimation (see e.g., <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11366">this recent paper</a>)</li>
<li>Adaptive data analysis strikes me as both very important in practice, and quite deep theoretically, see e.g. <a class="lipdf" href="http://nematilab.info/bmijc/assets/091218_paper.pdf">the reusable holdout by Dwork et al</a>. A related paper that I liked a lot is this <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04585">ICML 2015 paper</a> by Blum and Hardt, which essentially explores the regularization effect of publishing only models that beat the state of the art significantly (more generally this is an extremely interesting question, of why we can keep using the same datasets to evaluate progress in machine learning, see this provokingly titled paper “<a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Do ImageNet Classifiers Generalize to ImageNet?</a>“).</li>
<li>A general trend has been in finding very fast (nearly linear time) method for many classical problems. Sometimes these investigations even led to actually practical algorithm, as with this now classical paper by Marco Cuturi at NIPS 2013 titled “<a class="liexternal" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4927-sinkhorn-distances-lightspeed-computation-of-optimal-transport">Sinkhorn Distances: Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transport</a>“.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Oh, one last thing</h2>
<p>I also heard that, surprisingly, gradient descent can work to optimize highly non-convex functions such as training loss for neural networks. Not sure what this is about, it’s a pretty obscure topic, maybe it will catch up in the decade 2020-2029…</p>
<h2>Share some more in the comments!</h2>
<p>The above is only a tiny sample, there were many many more interesting directions being explored (tensor methods for latent variable models <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/anandkumar14b/anandkumar14b.pdf">[Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, Telgarsky, JMLR 14]</a>; phenomenon of “all local minima are good” for various non-convex learning problems, see e.g., <a class="liexternal" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6048-matrix-completion-has-no-spurious-local-minimum">[Ge, Lee, Ma, NIPS 2016]</a>; etc etc).

    <title>TR19-185 |  Strategy-Stealing is Non-Constructive | 

	Greg Bodwin, 

	Ofer Grossman</title>
    <summary>In many combinatorial games, one can prove that the first player wins under best play using a simple but non-constructive argument called strategy-stealing.
This work is about the complexity behind these proofs: how hard is it to actually find a winning move in a game, when you know by strategy-stealing that one exists? 
We prove that this problem is PSPACE-Complete already for Minimum Poset Games and Symmetric Maker-Maker Games, which are simple classes of games that capture two of the main types of strategy-stealing arguments in the current literature.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>[The post below is by Dorit Aharonov who co-organized the wonderful school on quantum computing last week which I attended and greatly enjoyed. –Boaz] </em></p>



<p><strong>TL;DR: </strong> Last week we had a wonderful one-week intro course into the math of quantum computing at Hebrew U;  It included a one day crash course on the basics, and 7 mini-courses on math-oriented research topics (quantum delegation, Hamiltonian complexity, algorithms and more) by top-notch speakers. Most importantly – it is all online, and could be very useful if you want to take a week or two to enter the area and don’t know <a href="https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">where to start</a>.   </p>



<p><br/><br/><br/></p>



<p>Hi Theory people!  </p>



<p>I want to tell you about a 5-days winter school called “<a href="https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Mathematics of Quantum Computation</a>“, which we (me, Zvika Brakerski, Or Sattath and Amnon Ta-Shma) organized last week at the Institute for advanced studies (IIAS) at the Hebrew university in Jerusalem. </p>



<p>There were two reasons I happily agreed to Boaz’s suggestion to write a guest blogpost about this school. <br/><br/>a) The school was really great fun. We enjoyed it so much, that I think you might find it interesting to hear about it even if you were not there, or are not even into quantum computation. <br/><br/>And b), it might actually be useful for you or your quantum-curious friends. We put all material online, with the goal in mind that after the school, this collection of talks+written material will constitute all that is needed for an almost self-contained <strong>very-intensive-one-week-course of introduction into the mathematical side of quantum computation</strong>; I think this might be of real use for any theoretical computer scientist or mathematician interested in entering this fascinating but hard-to-penetrate area, and not knowing where to start.<br/>Before telling you a little more about what we actually learned in this school, let’s start with some names and numbers. We had:  </p>



<ul><li>160 participants (students and faculty) from all over the world. </li><li>7 terrific speakers: Adam Bouland (UC Berkeley), Sergey Bravyi (IBM), Matthias Christandl (Coppenhagen), András Gilyén (Caltech), Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), Avishay Tal (Berkeley), and Thomas Vidick (Caltech); </li><li>2 great TAs:  András Gilyén (Caltech) and Chinmay Nirkhe (UC Berkeley)</li><li>4 busy organizers: myself (Hebrew U), Zvika Brakerski (Weizmann), Or Sattath (Ben Gurion U), and Amnon Ta-Shma (Tel Aviv U)</li><li>1 exciting and very intensive <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OcFzE1PHxBN4l87sOQB033FZLTgY934GHxnpVKi3NaM/edit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">program</a></li><li>5 challenging and fascinating days of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTn74Qx5mPsS2dqTpEq_2zxq8kWBmPUfb" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> talks</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">problem sessions</a> and really <a href="https://shvil.im/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">nice food</a>.   </li><li>1 great <a href="https://huji.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=599bc3e9-855e-42c1-ab1d-ab1f0062c481" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Rabin’s lecture</a> by Boaz Barak (Harvard)</li><li>1 beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxrxXneg3lU&amp;list=PLTn74Qx5mPsS2dqTpEq_2zxq8kWBmPUfb&amp;index=21&amp;t=0s" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Quantum perspective lecture</a> by Sergey Bravyi (IBM)</li><li>8 panelists in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4t2G2gay7Q&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">supremacy panel</a> we had on the fifth day: Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), our wise moderator, and 7 panelists on stage and online: myself, Scott Aaronson (Austin, online), Boaz Barak, Adam Bouland, Sergio Boixo (Google, online), Gil Kalai (Hebrew U), and Umesh Vazirani (UC Berkeley, online) </li><li>8 brave speakers in the gong show, our very last session, each talking for 3 minutes;    </li><li>1 group-tour to 1 UNESCO site (<a href="https://everything-everywhere.com/caves-of-maresha-and-bet-guvrin-in-the-judean-lowlands-as-a-microcosm-of-the-land-of-the-caves/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Tel Maresha</a>) and <a href="https://www.srigim-beer.co.il/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">6 beers tasted</a> by ~80 tour participants</li><li>3 problem sets with 43 <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">problems</a> and (!) their <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">solution</a>s.   </li></ul>



<p>So why did we decide to organize this particular quantum school, given the many quantum schools around? Well, the area of quantum computation is just bursting now with excitement and new mathematical challenges; But there seems to be no easy way for theoreticians to learn about all these things unless you are already in the loop… The (admittedly) very ambitious goal of the school was to assume zero background in quantum computation, and quickly bring people up to speed on six or seven of the most interesting mathematical research forefronts in the area. </p>



<p>The first day of the school was intended to put everyone essentially on the same page: it included four talks about the very basics (qubits by Or Sattath, circuits, by myself, algorithms by Adam Bouland, and error correction by Sergey Bravyi). By the end of this first day everyone was at least supposed to be familiar with the basic concepts, and capable of listening to the mini-courses to follow. The rest of the school was devoted mainly to those mini-courses, whose topics included what I think are some of the most exciting topics on the more theoretical and mathematical side of quantum computation.</p>



<p>Yes, it was extremely challenging… the good thing was that we had two great TAs, András and Chinmay, who helped prepare problem sets, which people actually seriously tried to solve (!) during the daily one+ hour TA problem-solving sessions (with the help of the team strolling around ready to answer questions…). It seems that this indeed helped people follow, despite the fact that we did get into some hard stuff in those mini-courses… The many questions that were asked throughout the school proved that many people were following and interested till the bitter end. </p>



<p>So here is a summary of the mini-courses, by order of appearance. <br/>I added some buzz words of interesting related mathematical notions so that you know where these topics might lead you if you take the paths they suggest.   <br/></p>



<ul><li> Thomas Vidick gave a three-lecture wonderfully clear mini-course providing an intro to the recently very active and exciting area of <strong>quantum verification and delegation</strong>, connecting cryptography and quantum computational complexity. [Thomas didn’t have time to talk about it, but down the road this eventually connects to  approximate representation theory, as well as to Connes embedding conjecture, and more.]</li><li> Sandy Irani gave a beautiful exposition (again, in a a three lecture mini-course) on <strong>quantum Hamiltonian complexity</strong>. Sandy started with Kitaev’s quantum version of the Cook Levin theorem, showing that the local Hamiltonian problem is quantum NP complete; she then explained how this can be extended to more physically relevant questions such as translationally invariant 1D systems, questions about the thermodynamical limit, and more. [This topic is related to open questions such as quantum PCP, which was not mentioned in the school, as well as to beautiful recent results about undecidability of the spectral gap problem, and more.]    </li><li> Matthias Christandl gave an exciting two-lecture mini-course on the fascinating connection between <strong>tensor ranks and matrix product multiplication</strong>. Starting from what seemed to be childish games with small pictures in his first talk, he cleverly used those as his building blocks in his second talk, to enable him to talk about Strassen’s universal spectral points program for approaching the complexity of matrix multiplication, asymptotic ranks, border ranks and more. That included also very beautiful pictures of polytopes! Matthias explained the connection that underlines this entire direction, between entanglement properties of three body systems, with these old combinatorial problems.  </li><li> Avishay Tal gave a really nice two-lecture exposition on his recent breakthrough result with Ran Raz, proving that <strong>quantum polynomial time computation is not contained in the polynomial Hierarchy, in the oracle model</strong>. This included talking about AC0, a problem called forrelation, Fourier expansion, Gaussians and much more.</li><li>  András Gilyén gave a wonderful talk about a recent development: the evolution of the <strong>singular value approach to quantum algorithms</strong>. He left us all in awe showing that essentially almost any quantum algorithm you can think of falls into this beautiful framework… Among other things, he mentioned Chebychev’s polynomials, quantum walks, Hamiltonian simulations, and more. What else can be done with this framework remains to be seen.</li><li>Sergey Bravyi gave two talks (on top of his intro to quantum error correction). The first was as part of a monthly series at Hebrew university, called  “quantum perspectives”; in this talk, Sergey gave a really nice exposition of his breakthrough result (with Gosset and Konig) demonstrating an <strong><em>information theoretical</em> separation between quantum and classical constant depth circuits</strong>; this uses in a clever way the well known quantum magic square game enabling quantum correlations to win with probability one, while classical correlations are always bounded away from one;  somehow this result manages to cleverly turn this game into a computational advantage. In Sergey’s last talk, he gave the basics of the beautiful topic of <strong>stoqaustic Hamiltonians </strong>–  a model in between quantum Hamiltonians and classical constrained satisfaction problems, which poses many fundamental and interesting open questions (and is tightly related to classical Markov chains, and Markov chain Monte Carlo). </li><li>Finally, Adam Bouland gave two superb talks on <strong>quantum supremacy</strong>, explaining the beautiful challenges in this area – including his recent average case to worst case hardness results about sampling using quantum circuits, which is related to Google’s supremacy experiment.  </li><li>Ah, I also gave a talk – it was about three of the many different equivalent models of quantum computation – <strong>adiabatic computation</strong>, <strong>quantum walks</strong>, and the <strong>Jones polynomial </strong>(I also briefly mentioned a differential geometry model). The talk came out way too disordered in my mind (never give a talk when you are an organizer!), but hopefully it gave some picture about the immense variety of ways to think about quantum computation and quantum algorithms.</li></ul>



<p>In addition to the main lectures, we also had some special events intertwined: </p>



<ul><li>Boaz Barak gave the distinguished annual Rabin lecture, joint with the CS colloquium; His talk, which was given the intriguing title  <strong>“Quantum computing and classical algorithms: The best of frenemies”</strong>, focused on the fickle relationships between quantum and classical algorithms. The main players in this beautiful talk were SDPs and sums of squares, and it left us with many open questions.     </li><li>Last but not least, we had an <strong>international panel about the meaning of Google’s recent experiment claiming supremacy</strong>, joined by Sergio Boixo from Google explaining the experiment, as well as Scott Aaronson and Umesh Vazirani who woke up very early in the US to join us. I feared we would have some friction and fist fights, but this actually became a deep and interesting discussion! We went with quite some depth into the most important question in my mind about the supremacy experiment, which is the issue of noise; Unbelievably, it all went well even from the technological aspect! I really recommend watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4t2G2gay7Q&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">discussion</a>. </li></ul>



<p>So, we had a great time…. and as I said, one of the best things is that it is all recorded and saved. You are welcome to follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OcFzE1PHxBN4l87sOQB033FZLTgY934GHxnpVKi3NaM/edit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">program</a>, watch the recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTn74Qx5mPsS2dqTpEq_2zxq8kWBmPUfb" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">talks</a>, consult the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1M9F0zha6LY8DX58eKxjkiI1Dxq9uvptE" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">slides</a><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1y_sHH1NsKzHeZwQ_xa2aVR_HKgOczytm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">, lecture notes</a><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">, exercises and solutions</a> and also read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-DLl_M-Dpqh9RdSqn6f9l01e09AaLndMlbxDEmlPrw/edit?ts=5dc7c2b3" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reading material</a> if you want to extend your knowledge beyond what is covered in the school. In case you know of any math or TCS-oriented person who wants to enter the field and start working on some problem at the forefront of research, just send him or her this post, or the link of the <a href="https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">school’s website</a>;  It will take a very intensive week (well, maybe two) of following lectures and doing the exercises, but by the end of that time, one is guaranteed to be no longer a complete amateur to the area, as the set of topics covered gives a pretty good picture of what is going on in the field.   <br/>  </p>



<p>Last but not least, I would like to thank the Israeli quantum initiative, Vatat, and the IIAS, for their generous funding which enabled this school and the funding of students; the IIAS team for their immense help in organization;   and of course, thanks a lot to all participants who attended the school!<br/></p>



<p>Wishing everyone a very happy year of 2020,  </p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the wake of two culture-war posts—the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">first</a> on the term “quantum supremacy,” the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4476">second</a> on the acronym “NIPS”—it’s clear that we all need to cool off with something anodyne and uncontroversial.  Fortunately, this holiday season, I know just the thing to bring everyone together: groaning about quantum computing hype!</p>



<p>When I was at the <a href="https://q2b.qcware.com/">Q2B conference</a> in San Jose, I learned about lots of cool stuff that’s happening in the wake of Google’s quantum supremacy announcement.  I heard about the 57-qubit superconducting chip that the Google group is now building, following up on its 53-qubit one; and also about their first small-scale experimental demonstration of my certified randomness protocol.  I learned about recent progress on costing out the numbers of qubits and gates needed to do fault-tolerant quantum simulations of useful chemical reactions (IIRC, maybe a hundred thousand qubits and a few hours’ worth of gates—scary, but not Shor’s algorithm scary).</p>



<p>I also learned about two claims about quantum algorithms that startups have made, and which are being wrongly interpreted.  The basic pattern is one that I’ve come to know well over the years, and which you could call a science version of the <a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/SHATVO-2.pdf">motte-and-bailey</a>.  (For those not up on nerd blogosphere terminology: in medieval times, the motte was a dank castle to which you’d retreat while under attack; the bailey was the desirable land that you’d farm once the attackers left.)</p>



<p>To wit:</p>



<ol><li>Startup makes claims that have both a true boring interpretation (e.g., you can do X with a quantum computer), as well as a false exciting interpretation (e.g., you can do X with a quantum computer, <em>and it would actually make sense to do this, because you’ll get an asymptotic speedup over the best known classical algorithm</em>).</li><li>Lots of business and government people get all excited, because they assume the false exciting interpretation must be true (or why else would everyone be talking about this?).  Some of those people ask me for comment.</li><li>I look into it, perhaps by asking the folks at the startup.  The startup folks clarify that they meant only the true boring interpretation.  To be sure, they’re actively <em>exploring</em> the false exciting interpretation—whether some parts of it might be true after all—but they’re certainly not making any claims about it that would merit, say, a harsh post on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>.</li><li>I’m satisfied to have gotten to the bottom of things, and I tell the startup folks to go their merry way.</li><li>Yet many people continue to seem as excited as if the false exciting interpretation had been shown to be true.  They continue asking me questions that presuppose its truth.</li></ol>



<p>Our first instance of this pattern is the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2227387-quantum-computer-sets-new-record-for-finding-prime-number-factors/">recent claim</a>, by <a href="https://www.zapatacomputing.com/">Zapata Computing</a>, to have set a world record for integer factoring (1,099,551,473,989 =  1,048,589 × 1,048,601) with a quantum computer, by running a QAOA/variational algorithm on IBM’s superconducting device.  Gosh!  That sure sounds a lot better than the 21 that’s been factored with Shor’s algorithm, doesn’t it?</p>



<p>I read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08927">Zapata paper</a> that this is based on, entitled “Variational Quantum Factoring,” and I don’t believe that a single word in it is false.  My issue is something the paper <em>omits</em>: namely, that once you’ve reduced factoring to a generic optimization problem, you’ve thrown away all the mathematical structure that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s algorithm</a> cleverly exploits, and that makes factoring asymptotically easy for a quantum computer.  And hence there’s no reason to expect your quantum algorithm to scale any better than brute-force trial division (or in the most optimistic scenario, trial division enhanced with Grover search).  On large numbers, your algorithm will be roundly outperformed even by <em>classical</em> algorithms that do exploit structure, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve">Number Field Sieve</a>.  Indeed, the quantum computer’s success at factoring the number will have had little or nothing to do with its being <em>quantum</em> at all—a classical optimization algorithm would’ve served as well.  And thus, the only reasons to factor a number on a quantum device in this way, would seem to be stuff like calibrating the device.</p>



<p>Admittedly, to people who work in quantum algorithms, everything above is so obvious that it doesn’t need to be said.  But I learned at Q2B that there are interested people for whom this is <em>not</em> obvious, and even comes as a revelation.  So that’s why I’m saying it.</p>



<p>Again and again over the past twenty years, I’ve seen people reinvent the notion of a “simpler alternative” to Shor’s algorithm: one that cuts out all the difficulty of building a fault-tolerant quantum computer.  In every case, the trouble, typically left unstated, has been that these alternatives <em>also</em> cut out the exponential speedup that’s Shor’s algorithm’s raison d’être.</p>



<p>Our second example today of a quantum computing motte-and-bailey is the claim, by Toronto-based quantum computing startup <a href="https://www.xanadu.ai/">Xanadu</a>, that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01199">Gaussian BosonSampling</a> can be used to solve all sorts of graph problems, like graph isomorphism, graph similarity, and densest subgraph.  As the co-inventor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson_sampling">BosonSampling</a>, few things would warm my heart more than finding an actual application for that model (besides quantum supremacy experiments and, perhaps, certified random number generation).  But I still regard this as an open problem—if by “application,” we mean outperforming what you could’ve done classically.</p>



<p>In papers (see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10644">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12646">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10730">here</a>), members of the Xanadu team have given all sorts of ways to take a graph, and encode it into an instance of Gaussian BosonSampling, in such a way that the output distribution will then reveal features of the graph, like its isomorphism type or its dense subgraphs.  The trouble is that so far, I’ve seen no indications that this will actually lead to quantum algorithms that outperform the best classical algorithms, for any graph problems of practical interest.</p>



<p>In the case of Densest Subgraph, the Xanadu folks use the output of a Gaussian BosonSampler to seed (that is, provide an initial guess for) a classical local search algorithm.  They say they observe better results this way than if they seed that classical local search algorithm with completely random initial conditions.  But of course, the real question is: could we get equally good results by seeding with the output of some <em>classical</em> heuristic?  Or by solving Densest Subgraph with a different approach entirely?  Given how hard it’s turned out to be just to <em>verify</em> that the outputs of a BosonSampling device come from such a device at all, it would seem astonishing if the answer to these questions wasn’t “yes.”</p>



<p>In the case of Graph Isomorphism, the situation is even clearer.  There, the central claim made by the Xanadu folks is that given a graph G, they can use a Gaussian BosonSampling device to sample a probability distribution that encodes G’s isomorphism type.  So, isn’t this “promising” for solving GI with a quantum computer?  All you’d need to do now is invent some fast classical algorithm that could look at the samples coming from two graphs G and H, and tell you whether the probability distributions were the same.</p>



<p>Except, not really.  While the Xanadu paper never says so, if all you want is to sample a distribution that encodes a graph’s isomorphism type, that’s easy to do classically!  (I even put this on the final exam for my undergraduate Quantum Information Science course a couple weeks ago.)  Here’s how: given as input a graph G, just output G but with its vertices randomly permuted.  Indeed, this will even provide a further property, better than anything the BosonSampling approach has been shown to provide (or than it probably does provide): namely, if G and H are <em>not</em> isomorphic, then the two probability distributions will not only be different but will have disjoint supports.  Alas, this still leaves us with the problem of distinguishing which distribution a given sample came from, which is as hard as Graph Isomorphism itself.  None of these approaches, classical or quantum, seem to lead to any algorithm that’s subexponential time, let alone competitive with the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2521">“Babai approach”</a> of thinking really hard about graphs.</p>



<p>All of this stuff falls victim to what I regard as the Fundamental Error of Quantum Algorithms Research: namely, to treat it as “promising” that a quantum algorithm works at all, or works better than some brute-force classical algorithm, without asking yourself whether there are any indications that your approach will <em>ever</em> be able to exploit interference of amplitudes to outperform the <em>best</em> classical algorithm.</p>



<p>Incidentally, I’m not sure exactly why, but in practice, a major red flag that the Fundamental Error is about to be committed is when someone starts talking about “hybrid quantum/classical algorithms.”  By this they seem to mean: “outside the domain of traditional quantum algorithms, so don’t judge us by the standards of that domain.”  But I liked the way someone at Q2B put it to me: <em>every</em> quantum algorithm is a “hybrid quantum/classical algorithm,” with classical processors used wherever they can be, and qubits used only where they must be.</p>



<p>The other thing people do, when challenged, is to say “well, admittedly we have no <em>rigorous proof</em> of an asymptotic quantum speedup”—thereby brilliantly reframing the whole conversation, to make people like me look like churlish theoreticians insisting on an impossible and perhaps irrelevant standard of rigor, blind to some huge practical quantum speedup that’s about to change the world.  The real issue, of course, is not that they haven’t given a <em>proof</em> of a quantum speedup (in either the real world or the black-box world); rather, it’s that they’ve typically given no reasons whatsoever to think that there <em>might</em> be a quantum speedup, compared to the best classical algorithms available.</p>



<p>In the holiday spirit, let me end on a positive note.  When I did the Q&amp;A at Q2B—the same one where Sarah Kaiser asked me to comment on the term “quantum supremacy”—one of my answers touched on the most important theoretical open problems about sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments.  At the top of the list, I said, was whether there’s some interactive protocol by which a near-term quantum computer can not only exhibit quantum supremacy, but <em>prove</em> it to a polynomial-time-bounded classical skeptic.  I mentioned that there was <em>one</em> proposal for how to do this, in the IQP model, due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0847">Bremner and Shepherd</a>, from way back in 2008.  I said that their proposal deserved much more attention than it had received, and that trying to break it would be one obvious thing to work on.  Little did I know that, <strong>literally while I was speaking</strong>, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05547">paper was being posted to the arXiv</a>, by Gregory Kahanamoku-Meyer, that claims to break Bremner and Shepherd’s protocol.  I haven’t yet studied the paper, but assuming it’s correct, it represents the first clear progress on this problem in years (even though of a negative kind).  Cool!!</p></div>

<p>
Kathryn Farley is my dear wife. We just celebrated Christmas together and then went off to London for a holiday.</p>
<p>
Today I thought I would share a gift with you.<br/>
<span id="more-16497"/></p>
<p>
Kathryn and I exchange books for the holiday. We do not wrap them—our tradition, which she started years ago. I like doing this. Ken’s family re-uses wrapping paper year-to-year. I am pleased to see that there is a call to save wrapping on three <a href="https://frugalkite.com/zero-waste-christmas-three-genius-wrapping-methods/">gifts</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If every American family wrapped just 3 presents in reused materials, it would save enough paper to cover 45,000 football fields. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Kathryn gave me a wonderful collection of books. One of them is not the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computers-Rigidity-Moduli-Large-Scale-Riemannian/dp/B01FJ1E910">book</a>: <i>Computers, Rigidity, and Moduli: The Large-Scale Fractal Geometry of Riemannian Moduli Space</i>. The author is Shmuel Weinberger a mathematician from the University of Chicago. I already had his book but finally took a look at it while browsing my other gifts. So it is a delayed gift, from a Christmas past.</p>
<p>
The book is a combination of computer results, basic math results, and advanced math results. The last are a variety of topics that are well outside of my zone. I did like the book. Weinberger is a terrific writer, a terrific explainer, a gifted selector of topics. I was surprised to see that his book contained a puzzle that I had not thought about before. The puzzle is, like all good puzzles, easy to state—but hard to solve. At least for me. I did not see how to solve it. I hope you like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Puzzle </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Imagine that there are <img alt="{2n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2n}"/> distinct points in the plane. No three points are collinear. Half of them, <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> are labeled <font color="red"><b>red</b></font> and the other half are labelled <font color="green"><b>green</b></font>. Festive colors. Your job is to connect each red point with a unique green point by a straight line. That is easy, of course. But we hate when lines cross. So your job is more: Please select the lines so that the fewest ones cross.</p>
<p>
Thus the problem is. Find the fewest line crossings possible. As usual we wish to know the answer as a function of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. Is it <img alt="{\sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{n}}"/>? Or <img alt="{\log(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\log(n)}"/>? What is the best possible in the worst case?</p>
<p>
The artwork on the wall behind Kathryn suggests a possible arrangement, likewise the floor. The art object directly behind her is in 3D space which is not allowed—but this is a photograph so its points are projected onto a plane anyway. Again, it’s important that no three points are collinear. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> There is a Best </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
For start we note that there is always a best. Each of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> red points can match one of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> green points. So there are only a finite number of possible matchings, namely 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  n! = n \times (n-1) \times \cdots \times 1. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++n%21+%3D+n+%5Ctimes+%28n-1%29+%5Ctimes+%5Ccdots+%5Ctimes+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  n! = n \times (n-1) \times \cdots \times 1. "/></p>
<p>This shows that there is always a best answer; moreover, it can be found. But <img alt="{n!}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%21%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n!}"/> can be huge, so another part of the question is: Can you find the best answer fast? How about finding the best answer in polynomial time?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Solution </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The best answer is that the number of crossings is always at most 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  b(n) = c \log(n), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++b%28n%29+%3D+c+%5Clog%28n%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  b(n) = c \log(n), "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> is the constant 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  10^{2}+11^{2}+12^{2}- 13^{2} - 14^{2}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++10%5E%7B2%7D%2B11%5E%7B2%7D%2B12%5E%7B2%7D-+13%5E%7B2%7D+-+14%5E%7B2%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  10^{2}+11^{2}+12^{2}- 13^{2} - 14^{2}. "/></p>
<p>
Here is a proof that this bound is correct. Suppose that you have selected the fewest number of line crossings. We will argue that there are at most <img alt="{b(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b(n)}"/> line crossings. The plan is to show that we can descend—that is given a matching we can try and decrease the number of lines that cross. </p>
<p>
Given any two red nodes and any two green nodes, we can define the operation <em>swap</em> by having them exchange partners. If their lines cross before the swap, then after the swap the lines will <em>not</em> cross. The following figure shows this:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/points.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16500" height="217" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/points.png?w=300&amp;h=217" width="300"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Oops. I thought the idea was to define an operation so that the number of line crossing could always be decreased. Wait the argument does not work. In the above figure the switch <em>increases</em> the number of crossings.</p>
<p>
There is a saving trick, however. Do not attempt to decrease the number of lines that cross. Instead decrease the total <i>length</i> of the lines selected. The above figure can be turned into a proof of a lemma that a <em>swap</em> of two crossing lines always decreases the sum of their lengths. The cool idea is that the swaps may actually increase the number of crossings, but they will always decrease the total length. </p>
<p>
In the end the length is minimal and there are <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> crossings. Thus 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  b(n) = 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++b%28n%29+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  b(n) = 0. "/></p>
<p>I cheated and used that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  10^{2}+11^{2}+12^{2} = 13^{2} + 14^{2}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++10%5E%7B2%7D%2B11%5E%7B2%7D%2B12%5E%7B2%7D+%3D+13%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+14%5E%7B2%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  10^{2}+11^{2}+12^{2} = 13^{2} + 14^{2}, "/></p>
<p>and so the constant <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> is zero. Finally, no swap is ever undone—since the length always decreases—and so the process must finish within <img alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n^2)}"/> swaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Hope that you liked this puzzle. I think it shows that are sometimes methods that while simple may be hard to find. Is <img alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n^2)}"/> really the needed number of swaps? Are more than a linear number of swaps ever required?<br/>
 Happy holidays to all.</p>

Later in the afternoon we had  <strong>a panel/debate on quantum supremacy </strong>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4t2G2gay7Q&amp;feature=youtu.be">click for the video</a>) moderated by Sandy Irani and featuring Scott Aaronson, Dorit Aharonov, Boaz Barak, Sergio Boixo, Adam Bouland,  Umesh Vazirani, and me. It was a thoughtful and interesting discussion. (The presentation was initially prepared for the afternoon debate but at the end I gave it as a separate talk and presented just one slide at the panel itself. The plan was also to post it as a background material before the discussion, but not untypically, I was too slow, so here it is a week later.) I am thankful to Dorit for inviting me to the panel (and for organizing a great school!), to Sandy for her excellent moderation, and to all the panelists for their good spirit.

<h2>My Presentation on the Google Quantum Supremacy Demonstration</h2>

<p>My lecture is not about quantum computers and quantum supremacy in general but about the Google quantum supremacy claims. (If you want to know more about my general argument against quantum computers, quantum supremacy and quantum error correction go to the previous post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/" rel="bookmark">Gil’s Collegial Quantum Supremacy Skepticism FAQ </a>and to <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/main-pr.pdf">several</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">my</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">papers</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/cern.pptx">presentations</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR-ufBz13Eg">linked</a> there.)</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide12.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18875" height="362" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide12.png?w=640&amp;h=362" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>In this presentation I will concentrate on aspects of the Google experiment that are “too good to be true”. (Which is a bad sign, not a good sign.)</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide13.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18874" height="350" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide13.png?w=640&amp;h=350" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>There is an amazing agreement between the fidelity as estimated from the experimental data and a very simple high-school model based on the probability of individual qubits and gates to malfunction.  (An even simplified version, below in purple, requires just three parameters – the number n of qubits, the number g1 of 1-qubit gates and the number g2 of 2-qubit gates.)</p>
<p>Formula (77) itself is not surprising but the terrific success of Formula (77) may serve as a smoking gun for the claim that the Google’s experiment has serious methodological problems.</p>
<p>I was not the only one to be amazed. Here is what John Martinis, the scientific leader of the Google supremacy experiment told about it. (Nov 1., 2019) Read carefully!</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide6.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18849" height="400" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide6.png?w=640&amp;h=400" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>The accuracy of Formula (77) is the most amazing thing about the data, something that came as a big surprise, and that (jokingly) will let quantum scientists keep their jobs.</p>
<p>And here is what I think</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide7.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18851" height="367" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide7.png?w=640&amp;h=367" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>No no, you cannot estimate with precision of 10-20% the probability of failure of a physical system with 1000 interacting elements as the product of 1000 error-probabilities.</p>
<p><strong>This remarkable agreement is a major new discovery, and it is <em>not needed</em> for building quantum computers. It is only needed for the extrapolation argument leading the Google team to supremacy.</strong></p>
<p>Even if quantum computers will be built this is something that we are not going to witness. It is interesting to check if we see anything remotely like this for the IBM quantum computers.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide8.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18853" height="334" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide8.png?w=640&amp;h=334" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Here on the left you see for various values of <em>n</em>, the number of qubits, two experiments with different circuits that leads to entirely different probability distributions. Since each pair have a similar number of gates, Formula (77) leads to very close fidelity estimates which are so accurate that the green and blue lines coincide! We do not expect to see such close agreements in experimental data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide9.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18857" height="350" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide9.png?w=640&amp;h=350" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Blue, orange and green analytic smooth curves representing three distributions. For all three you see also empirical samples from the distributions. For two of them the samples are perfect, for the other one you see a sample based on a complicated physical experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Test your intuition:</strong> can you tell the difference? Can you tell which is which?</p>
<p>(You can also test your intuition which was the single slide presented at the afternoon debate.)</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide10.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18860" height="360" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide10.png?w=640&amp;h=360" width="640"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Blind tests</strong> are standard in scientific experiments and are quite easy to implement here.</p>
<p>The meaning of the surprising statistical success of Formula (77) should be <strong>carefully examined</strong>.</p>
<h2>Two extra slides</h2>
<p>To put my view in context,  I devote one slide for my general argument against quantum computers, quantum supremacy and quantum error correction.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide2.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18839" height="363" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide2.png?w=640&amp;h=363" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>I mentioned that most experts do not agree with my argument or do not even understand it, and for some of them, this may give reasons for skepticism also about my critique on the Google experiment. I  personally think that my general argument is good, but  I don’t think it is ironclad and I am pleased to see this matter explored experimentally (properly). I also think that my critique on the Google demo stands well on its own.</p>
<p>And what may convince me to change my mind? poetry!</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/dslide16.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19013" height="362" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/dslide16.png?w=640&amp;h=362" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Let me add that all my critique as described here and elsewhere was first presented to the Google team.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/fp12.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19089" height="178" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/fp12.png?w=640&amp;h=178" width="640"/></a></p>

<p><span id="more-18835"/></p>
<p><strong>Answer to Test your intuition:</strong> The orange graph is the one that comes from the experiments.</p>
<h2>Some recollections, reactions, and comments from the debate:</h2>
<h3>Uploading data for verification</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the debate, I nudged Sergio to upload some (additional; promised) data that is needed for verification and analysis of their results.</p>
<h3>Formula (77)</h3>
<p>Formula (77) was discussed in some details in Q/A of the the informal talk and also in the panel/debate. (I raised the question if the Google experiment is correct and specifically the issue with Formula (77) at <a href="https://youtu.be/H4t2G2gay7Q?t=2097">35:00</a> and Formula (77) was discussed for the next 25 minutes.) Of course, the surprising issue is the accurate predictions that Formula (77) gives.</p>
<p>Sergio briefly explained the statistical rationale for such a precision. The way I see it, the quality of the prediction for (77) requires two assumptions: (1) No systematic errors, (2) statistical independence. Both these assumptions seem utterly unrealistic. No systematic errors means that the average error estimation say for read-out errors or for gate errors are precise and fluctuations are symmetric. This is very unrealistic. The assumption of statistical independence also seems unrealistic. (Positive correlations will actually lead to better fidelity.)  Dorit, Boaz and several other people (and also Peter Shor earlier <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/#comment-61697">here on the blog</a>) proposed that the remarkable predictive power of (77) and, in particular, the required statistical independence may follow from having a random circuit. I don’t understand that.</p>
<p>Beside the concrete attempts to understand the predictive power of Formula (77) there were some general comments about it. Adam opined that <em>in physics</em> the data fits the models very well. Scott  joked that here I am arguing that the results fits the model too well and he could imagine me arguing in another universe that the results don’t fit the model well enough. At another point he said “First the data is not good enough, and now the data is too good, what will make you happy, Gil” and I answered that the data should be <em>reliable.</em></p>
<h3>The extended Church-Turing thesis (ECTT)</h3>
<p>Does “supremacy” (or HQCA), in general and in the context of Google’s experiment violates the extended Church-Turing thesis? Dorit claimed that the answer is negative since (roughly) the experiments cannot be scaled. Sergio sort of agreed and said they only claim to <em>challenge</em> the ECCT. (Indeed the fidelity goes exponentially to zero and even if producing such samples is beyond the power of a classical computer the sample sizes need to be exponential; it is an interesting question if every scalable supremacy demonstration requires quantum fault tolerance.)  A point that I made is that if we assume further certain “naturalness” principle, namely that, in practice,  constants in computational complexity asymptotic behavior are mild, then an astronomical speed-up as claimed by Google, can be considered as violating ECCT.</p>
<h3>Trillions</h3>
<p>Actually, in the early lecture I presented another slide about my initial feeling towards the Google (then licked) paper. I was surprised by the trillions-time speed up, and regarded the 300,000,000,000 speed-up as expressing some “supremacy fever:” why not start with a more modest speed-up but with convincing direct evidence?</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide3.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18841" height="170" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide3.png?w=300&amp;h=170" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>Why the trillions speed up should not surprise us? Adam Bouland commented that this is to be expected when we think about exponential speed-up. BTW, Adam gave very nice lectures on quantum algorithms and quantum supremacy.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ol>
<li>I was slowly loosing my voice so in the earlier lecture Or Sattath read the quote from Martinis, and Adam read the poem by Renan. (I should try that also in talks where I am not loosing my voice.)</li>
<li> Sandy asked about other reasons for skepticism regarding the Google claims and Scott mentioned the possibility that much better classical algorithms will be found.</li>
<li>Both me and Scott (and perhaps others in the panel as well) emphasized the importance of replications.</li>
<li>Adam was Scott’s Ph. D student and Scott was Umesh’s Ph. D. student so we had on the panel three academic generations!</li>
<li>Toward the end Scott described briefly the decade-old history, theory+experiment, of quantum supremacy.</li>
<li>There were various other interesting issues that were raised.</li>
<li>For history: The video flipped left and right. In reality Sandy was right farthermost and I was second to the right.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Quantum error-correction</h3>
<p>Dorit asked about quantum error correction and I asked specifically about distance-3 surface code and Sergio said that the quality of gates is insufficient for that. If I understood correctly the error rate needs to be reduced by a factor of five. (The fact that good quality quantum error correction requires achieving lower error rate than what is required for quantum supremacy is an important ingredient of my general argument against quantum computers.)</p>
<h3>Noise models and the noisy data.</h3>
<p>Dorit and others raised the issue of the noise model and discussed some toy noise models.  There was some discussion on correlated errors. (This is unrelated to the statistical dependence of (77).) I pointed out that correlated errors are irrelevant to random circuits (but relevant to quantum error-correction). Later in the debate I mentioned the concern regarding not having large enough samples to determine the empirical noisy distribution.</p>
<p>At some point Umesh referred to another issue that I raised which is that the noisy model in the Google paper seems oversimplified. I came back to it briefly but we did not discuss this further. (At the Q/A part of my early lecture Boaz have made some interesting comments about identifying the effect of the errors in the last round of the computation.)</p>
<p>I also repeated my suggestion of “Beckner noise” (and correlated variants) as a good toy noise model for noisy quantum circuits.</p>
<h3>My argument against quantum computers</h3>
<p>At the panel I mentioned my general argument against quantum computers, quantum supremacy and quantum error correction only in a few sentences.</p>
<p>BTW, one way to think about the argument is as comparing four thresholds for the level of noise (on gates) <img alt="\rho_{\bf R}, \rho_{\bf S}, \rho_{\bf QEC}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%2C+%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+S%7D%2C+%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+QEC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf R}, \rho_{\bf S}, \rho_{\bf QEC}"/> and <img alt="\rho_{\bf U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+U%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf U}"/>. <img alt="\rho_{\bf S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf S}"/> is what is required for <strong>HQCA</strong> (quantum supremacy); <img alt="\rho_{\bf QEC}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+QEC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf QEC}"/> is what is required for good quality quantum error correction (say, distance-5 surface code); <img alt="\rho_{\bf U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+U%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf U}"/> is what is required for universal quantum computing; <img alt="\rho_{\bf R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+R%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf R}"/> is the lower error rate that can realistically be achieved. I have a computational complexity argument (based on naturalness) that <img alt="\rho_{\bf R} &gt; \rho_{\bf S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+R%7D+%3E+%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf R} &gt; \rho_{\bf S}"/>. I also rely on <img alt="\rho_{\bf S} &gt; \rho_{\bf QEC}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+S%7D+%3E+%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+QEC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf S} &gt; \rho_{\bf QEC}"/>.</p>
<h3>Comparisons to Wright brothers’s first flight or to Fermi’s 1942 nuclear chain reaction</h3>
<p>Nobody in the afternoon panel discussion (to the best of my memory) repeated earlier enthusiastic comparisons between Google’s experiment and the first flight in 1903, the first landing on the moon in 1968 (well, I referred to that), Fermi’s 1942 nuclear chain reaction, the first vacuum tubes computers, the discovery of the Higgs boson, etc. etc.</p>
<h3>Silver lining (after-thought)</h3>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/silverlining.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19048" height="192" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/silverlining.png?w=300&amp;h=192" width="300"/></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The beach of Tel Aviv</span></p>
<p>Major advances in human ability to simulate quantum physics and quantum chemistry are expected both if quantum supremacy can be demonstrated and quantum computers can be built and also if quantum supremacy cannot be demonstrated and quantum computers cannot be built.</p>

<p>We have mentioned the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A">Numberphile video channel</a> before (<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/01/an-interview-with-noga-alon/">here</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/09/8866128975287528%c2%b3-8778405442862239%c2%b3-2736111468807040%c2%b3/">here</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/20/beyond-the-g-conjecture-algebraic-combinatorics-of-cellular-spaces-i/">here</a>). It has amazing videos for the very general public about mathematics. And the general public is interested! The channel has more than 3 millions subscribers and a Numberphile video gets usually well over 100,000 views.  While the videos are for very general audiences it is quite common that I learn new mathematics while watching these videos. Today I mention four recent Numberphile videos on graph theory.</p>
<p>Before that, let me mention that, while combinatorics has a special appeal for general audiences, it is a hard challenge to explain to a very large audience (or even to the large audience of Quanta Magazine) some very abstract areas of mathematics. It is not impossible: Here is <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/with-category-theory-mathematics-escapes-from-equality-20191010/">Kevin Hartnett’s article</a> in Quanta Magazine on ∞-categories and Jacob Lurie’s work and here is a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/peter-scholze-and-the-future-of-arithmetic-geometry-20160628/">2016 article by Erica Klarreich</a> on perfectoid spaces and Peter Schotze’s work. I hope to see Numberphile moving into these areas as well.</p>
<h2>A breakthrough in Graph theory:  Yaroslav Shitov’s counterexample to Hedetniemi’s conjecture as told by Erica Klarreich.</h2>
<p/>
<p>For more on this development see<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/05/10/sansation-in-the-morning-news-yaroslav-shitov-counterexamples-to-hedetniemis-conjecture/"> this post</a>. The video contains nice pictures of Stephen Hedetniemi and his 1966 thesis. An exciting <strong>open question</strong> is: Given two graphs of chromatic number <em>n </em>is the chromatic number of their tensor product at least some <em>f(n)</em>, where <em>f(n)</em> tends to infinity with <em>n</em>.</p>
<h2>Maria Chudnovsky – perfect graphs</h2>
<p/>
<p>Starting with the definition and ending with the strong perfect graph theorem (conjectured by Claud Berge) by Chudnovsky, Seymour, Robertson and Thomas.</p>
<p>An exciting <strong>open question</strong>: Find a good definition for perfect <em>r</em>-uniform hypergraphs.</p>
<p>We discussed perfect graphs and related notions in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/gerard-cornuejolss-bakers-eighteen-5000-dollars-conjectures/">this post</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/02/05/extremal-combinatorics-v-posets/">this one</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/when-a-few-colors-suffice/">this one</a>.</p>
<p>(<strong>Remark:</strong> Numberphile misguidedly regarded this video as a continuation of the “planar graph” video. The truth of the matter is that these are separated topics and the perfect graph video should be a separate Numperphile video.)</p>
<h2>Maria Chudnovsky – planar graphs</h2>
<p/>
<p>Planar graphs are deep and fascinating (and miraculous, and always surprising) mathematical objects.  In Hebrew we can say about the topic that it is “Olam Umelo’o” (עולם ומלואו) (=a whole world with all its content). There are many fascinating properties of planar graphs and many open problems about them.</p>
<p>There are also many fascinating generalizations. Let me mention <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2014/12/06/coloring-simple-polytopes-and-triangulations/">Abby Thompson’s </a><strong>problem:</strong> Suppose that <em>G</em> is the graph of a simple <em>d</em>-polytope with <em>n</em> vertices. Suppose also that <em>n</em> is even (this is automatic if <em>d</em> is odd). Can we always properly color the edges of <em>G</em> with <em>d</em> colors? (For <em>d=3</em>, the answer is yes and this is the four color theorem.)</p>
<p>(We discussed planar graphs here and on MO, many times.)</p>
<h2>Discussing vertex covers and Alcuin numbers for graphs – and a famous old puzzle. Filmed at MSRI with Annie Raymond.</h2>
<p/>
<p>We <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/hardness-of-approximating-vertex-cover-polytope-integrality-gap-the-alswede-kachaterian-theorem-and-more/">discussed here</a> and in other posts the important notion of vertex covers, but the mathematics of the video was completely new to me.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Scott’s Update (Dec. 26):</strong> Comments on this post are now closed, since I felt that whatever progress could be made, had been, and I wanted to move on to more interesting topics.  Thanks so much to everyone who came here to hash things out in good faith—which, as far as I’m concerned, included the majority of the participants on both sides.</p>



<p>If you want to see the position paper that led to the name change movement, see <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/pubs/NIPS_Name_Debate.pdf">What’s In A Name? The Need to Nip NIPS</a>, by Daniela Witten, Elana Fertig, Anima Anandkumar, and Jeff Dean.  I apologize for not linking to this paper in the original post.</p>



<p>To recap what I said many times in this post and the comments: I myself am totally fine with the name NeurIPS.  I think several of the arguments for changing the name were good arguments—and I thank some of the commenters on this post for elucidating those arguments without shaming anybody or calling them names.  In any case the decision is done, and it belongs to the ML community, not to me and not to Steven Pinker.</p>



<p>The one part that I’m against is <em>the bullying of anyone who disagrees by smearing them as a misogynist</em>.  And then, recursively, the smearing as a misogynist of anyone who objected to <em>that</em> bullying, and so on and so on.  Most supporters of the name change did not engage in such bullying, but one leader of the movement very conspicuously did, and continues to do it even now (to, I’m told, the consternation even of many of her allies).</p>



<p>Since this post went up, something extremely interesting happened: Steven Pinker and I started getting emails from researchers in the NeurIPS community that said, in various words: “thank you for openly airing perspectives that we could not air, without jeopardizing our careers.”  We were told that even women in ML, and even those who agreed with the activists on most points, could no longer voice opposition without risking their hiring or tenure.  This put into a slightly different light, I thought, the constant claims of some movement leaders about their own marginalization and powerlessness.</p>



<p>Since I was 7 or 8 years old, the moral lodestar of my life has been my yearning (too often left unfulfilled) to stand up to the world’s bullies.  Bullies come in all shapes and sizes: some are gangsters or men who sexually exploit vulnerable women; one, alas, is even the President of the United States.  But bullying knows no bounds of ideology or gender.  Some bullies resort to whisper networks, or Twitter shaming campaigns, or their power in academic hierarchies, to shut down dissenting voices.  With the latter kinds of bully—well, to whatever extent this blog is now in a position to make some difference, I’d feel morally complicit if it didn’t.</p>



<p>As I wrote in the comments: may the 2020s be an era of intellectual freedom, compassion, and understanding for all people regardless of background. –SA</p>



<p><strong>Scott’s prologue:</strong></p>



<p>Happy Christmas and Merry Chanukah!</p>



<p>As a followup to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">last Thursday’s post</a> about the term “quantum supremacy,” today all of us here at <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> are humbled to host a guest post by <a href="https://stevenpinker.com/">Steven Pinker</a>: the Johnstone Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, and author of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Language-Instinct-How-Mind-Creates/dp/1491514981">The Language Instinct</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Mind-Works-Steven-Pinker/dp/0393318486">How the Mind Works</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial-Nature/dp/0142003344/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+blank+slate&amp;qid=1577123601&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">The Blank Slate</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570">Enlightenment Now</a></em> (which I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3654">reviewed here</a>), and other books.</p>



<p>The former NIPS—<a href="https://nips.cc/">Neural Information Processing Systems</a>—has been the premier conference for machine learning for 30 years.  As many readers might know, last year NIPS <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07476-w">changed its name to NeurIPS</a>: ironically, giving greater emphasis to an aspect that I’m told has been <em>de</em>-emphasized at that conference over time.  The reason, apparently, was that some male attendees had made puns involving the acronym “NIPS” and nipples.</p>



<p>I confess that the name change took me by surprise, simply because it had never occurred to me to make the NIPS/nipples connection—not when I gave a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1246">plenary at NIPS</a> in 2012, and not when my collaborators and I coauthored a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09025">NIPS paper</a>.  It’s not that I’m averse to puerile humor.  It’s just that neither I, nor anyone else I knew, had apparently ever felt the need for a shorthand for “nipples.”  Of course, once I <em>did</em> learn about this controversy, it became hard to hear “NIPS” without thinking about it.</p>



<p>Back when this happened, Steven Pinker <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1070364941494992896?lang=en">tweeted</a> about NIPS being “forced to change its acronym … because some thought it was sexist. ?????,” apparently as part of a longer <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1070364369207341056?lang=en">thread</a> about “the new Victorians.”  In response, a computer science professor sent Pinker an extremely stern email, saying that Pinker’s tweeting about this had “caused harm to our community” and “just [made] the world a bleaker place for everyone.”   After linking to a <em>National Academies</em> report on bias in STEM, the email ended: “I hope you will choose to inform yourself on the discussion to which you have just contributed and that you will offer a well-considered follow up.”   I won’t risk betraying confidences by quoting further.  Of course, the author is warmly welcomed to share anything they wish in the comments here (or I can add it to the main post).</p>



<p>Steve’s guest post today consists of his response to this email.  (He told me that, after sending it, he received no further responses.)</p>



<p>I don’t have any dog in the NIPS/NeurIPS debate, being at most on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(machine_learning)">“margin”</a> (har!) of machine learning.  And in any case the debate ended a year ago: the name is now NeurIPS and it’s not changing back.  Reopening the issue would seem to invite a strong risk of social-media denunciation for no possible gain.</p>



<p>So why am I doing this?  Mostly because I thought it was in the interest of humanity to know that, even when Steven Pinker is answering someone’s email, with no expectation that his reply will be made public, he writes the same way he does in his books: with clarity, humor, and an amusing quote from his mom.</p>



<p>But also because—again, without taking a position on the NIPS vs. NeurIPS issue itself—there’s a tactic displayed by Pinker’s detractors that fundamentally grates on me.  This is where you pretend to an open mind, but it turns out that you’re open only to the possibility that your opponent might not have read enough reports and studies to “do better”—i.e., that they sinned out of ignorance rather than out of malice.  You don’t open your mind even a crack to the possibility that the opponent might have a point.</p>



<p><strong>Without further ado, here’s Steven Pinker’s email:</strong></p>



<p>I appreciate your frank comments. At the same time, I do not agree with them. Please allow me to explain.</p>



<p>If this were a matter of sexual harassment or other hostile behavior toward women, I would of course support strong measures to combat it. Any member of the Symposium who uttered demeaning comments toward or about women certainly deserves censure.</p>



<p>But that is not what is at issue here. It’s an utterly irrelevant matter: the three-decades-old acronym for the Neural Information Processing Symposium, the pleasingly pronounceable NIPS. To state what should be obvious: <em>nip</em> is not a sexual word. As Chair of the Usage Panel of the <em>American Heritage Dictionary, </em>I can <a href="https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=nip">support this claim</a>.</p>



<p>(And as my mother wrote to me: “I don’t get it. I thought Nips was a brand of caramel candy.”)  [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nips-Coffee-Candy-4-Ounce-Boxes/dp/B000V9EIEE">Indeed</a>, I enjoyed those candies as a kid. –SA]  Even if people with an adolescent mindset think of nipples when hearing the sound “nips,” the society should not endorse the idea that the concept of nipples is sexist. Men have nipples too, and women’s nipples evolved as organs of nursing, not sexual gratification. Indeed, many feminists have argued that it’s sexist to conceptualize women’s bodies from the point of view of male sexuality.</p>



<p>If some people make insulting puns that demean women, the society should condemn them for the insults, not concede to their puerility by endorsing their appropriation of an innocent sound. (The Linguistics Society of America and Boston Debate League do not change their names to disavow jejune clichés about cunning linguists and master debaters.) To act as if anything with the remotest connection to sexuality must be censored to protect delicate female sensibilities is insulting to women and reminiscent of prissy Victorian taboos against uncovered piano legs or the phrase “with the naked eye.”</p>



<p>Any harm to the community of computer scientists has been done not by me but by the pressure group and the Symposium’s surrender. As a public figure who hears from a broad range of people outside the academic bubble, I can tell you that this episode has not played well. It’s seen as the latest sign that academia has lost its mind—that it has traded reasoned argument, conceptual rigor, proportionality, and common sense for prudish censoriousness, snowflake sensibility, and virtue signaling. I often hear from intelligent non-leftists, “Why should I be impressed by the scientific consensus on climate change? Everyone knows that academics just fall into line with the politically correct position.” To secure the credibility of the academy, we have to make reasoned distinctions, and stop turning our enterprise into a laughingstock.</p>



<p>To repeat: none of this deprecates the important effort to stamp out harassment and misogyny in science, which I’m well aware of and thoroughly support, but which has nothing to do with the acronym NIPS.</p>



<p>You are welcome to share this note with interested parties.</p>



<p>Best,<br/>Steve</p></div>
