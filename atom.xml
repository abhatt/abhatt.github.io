    <title>TR19-160 |  Tractable Unordered 3-CNF Games | 

	Md Lutfar Rahman, 

	Thomas Watson</title>
    <summary>The classic TQBF problem can be viewed as a game in which two players alternate turns assigning truth values to a CNF formula's variables in a prescribed order, and the winner is determined by whether the CNF gets satisfied. The complexity of deciding which player has a winning strategy in this game is well-understood: it is NL-complete for 2-CNFs and PSPACE-complete for 3-CNFs.

We continue the study of the unordered variant of this game, in which each turn consists of picking any remaining variable and assigning it a truth value. The complexity of deciding who can win on a given CNF is less well-understood; prior work by the authors showed it is in L for 2-CNFs and PSPACE-complete for 5-CNFs. We conjecture it may be efficiently solvable on 3-CNFs, and we make progress in this direction by proving the problem is in P, indeed in L, for 3-CNFs with a certain restriction, namely that each width-3 clause has at least one variable that appears in no other clause. Another (incomparable) restriction of this problem was previously shown to be tractable by Kutz.</summary>

    <title>TR19-159 |  SETH-hardness of Coding Problems | 

	Noah Stephens-Davidowitz, 

	Vinod Vaikuntanathan</title>
    <summary>We show that assuming the strong exponential-time hypothesis (SETH), there are no non-trivial algorithms for the nearest codeword problem (NCP), the minimum distance problem (MDP), or the nearest codeword problem with preprocessing (NCPP) on linear codes over any finite field. More precisely, we show that there are no NCP, MDP, or NCPP algorithms running in time $q^{(1-\epsilon)n}$ for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ for codes with $q^n$ codewords. (In the case of NCPP, we assume non-uniform SETH.)

We also show that there are no sub-exponential-time algorithms for $\gamma$-approximate versions of these problems for some constant $\gamma &gt; 1$, under different versions of the exponential-time hypothesis.</summary>

    <title>TR19-158 |  Sorting Can Exponentially Speed Up Pure Dynamic Programming | 

	Stasys Jukna, 

	Hannes Seiwert</title>
    <summary>Many discrete minimization problems, including various versions of the shortest path problem, can be efficiently solved by dynamic programming (DP) algorithms that are ``pure'' in that they only perform basic operations, as $\min$, $\max$, $+$, but no conditional branchings via if-then-else in their recursion equations. It is known that any pure $(\min,+)$ DP algorithm solving the minimum weight spanning tree problem on undirected $n$-vertex graphs must perform at least $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ operations. We show  that this problem \emph{can} be solved by a pure  $(\min,\max,+)$ DP algorithm performing only $O(n^3)$ operations. The algorithm is essentially a $(\min,\max)$ algorithm: addition operations are only used to output the final values. The presence of both $\min$ and $\max$ operations means that now DP algorithms can sort: this explains the title of the paper.</summary>

Andrew Granville writes brilliant papers that explain hard results in number theory. He also proves hard results in number theory. </p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I use the famous Goldbach conjecture to discuss a third rail: how to identify which results “should be” true even though they have been too hard to prove.</p>
<p>
Granville has just recently published a graphic novel, <i>Prime Suspects: The Anatomy of Integers and Permutations</i>, with his sister Jennifer Granville and illustrator Robert Lewis. It features constables named Green and Tao, a detective Jack von Neumann, and students named Emmy Germain and Sergei Langer among other allusions to real (and complex) mathematicians. It grew out of a 2009 musical <a href="https://dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/PDF/MSIProgram.pdf">play</a> that premiered at IAS. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/11/goldbach-a-curious-conjecture/graphic/" rel="attachment wp-att-16380"><img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-16380" height="300" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/graphic.jpg?w=240&amp;h=300" width="240"/></a></p>
<p>
The driver of the plot is a deep connection between the frequency of primes below a number <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and that of permutations in <img alt="{S_N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_N}"/> that are “prime” in the sense of having only one cycle. Substituting <img alt="{\log(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\log(x)}"/> for <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> and vice-versa tends to create correspondences of known results in number theory vis-à-vis permutation group theory. See this MAA <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/prime-suspects-the-anatomy-of-integers-and-permutations">review</a>. Going beyond the known theorems described in the novel, we wonder how far such heuristic sleuthing methods can go on long-unsolved cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Goldbach Reminder </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The statement we know as the (Strong) Goldbach Conjecture is that every even number <img alt="{n \ge 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cge+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n \ge 4}"/> can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. It was made in 1742 by Christian Goldbach. He wrote to Leonhard Euler:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Every integer that can be written as the sum of two primes can also be written as the sum of as many primes as desired, until all terms are <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Well, that is not what we call Goldbach’s conjecture. He and many others at the time considered <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> to be a prime number. What he’s getting at can be seen from this snippet of his letter:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/11/goldbach-a-curious-conjecture/goldbachsnippet/" rel="attachment wp-att-16388"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16388" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/goldbachsnippet.png?w=300"/></a></p>
<p>
Above his sums, Goldbach put an asterisk * to the note in the margin, in which he asserts his conjecture:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Wait—that is not the Goldbach conjecture either. It is the “Weak” one and was apparently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7748">proved</a> in 2013 by Harald Helfgott. We discussed this in a 2014 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/is-this-a-proof-2/">post</a> whose larger theme we are continuing here. It also proves the first conjecture, but not the strong conjecture.</p>
<p>
But what Goldbach seems to be driving at with his drawing of sums is having one of the “primes” be <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. Then the strong conjecture is needed. Euler pointed this out in his reply to Goldbach’s letter. But Euler, who was a <a href="https://luthscitech.org/saintly-scientists/">saint</a> in many ways, charitably reminded Goldbach of a communication earlier that year when Goldbach had observed that his first conjecture followed from the strong statement. Euler went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “That every even number should be a sum of two primes I hold to be a completely certain theorem, irrespective of my not being able to prove it.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Ken has translated this a little differently from Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture#Origins">article</a> and its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030616020619/http://claymath.org/Popular_Lectures/U_Texas/Riemann_1.pdf">source</a>, reading into Euler’s words the stance of truth shining apart from proof. How one can justify this stance is what we want to discuss.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Curious Conjecture </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The conjecture is curious on several fronts. For one it is usually said to be “obviously correct.” It has been checked to about <img alt="{10^{18}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%5E%7B18%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{10^{18}}"/> or so by computation. There are many open conjectures in number theory that are likely to be true. But few are claimed to be “true” with such a strong bias. Many other conjectures are likely to be true, but none as likely as the Goldbach. </p>
<p>
In 1975, Hugh Montgomery and Robert Vaughan proved that the Goldbach is true for most even numbers. That is that the number of possible even numbers <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> less than some <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> are not sums of two primes grows like <img alt="{o(N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{o(N)}"/>. Thus if one picks a random even number <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> it is likely to be the sum of two primes. Here the “likely” is a mathematical certainty.</p>
<p>
How do we “know” that it is likely to be true? One source is the method of prime models. Primes are quite mysterious and hard to understand. So there are heuristic models that suggest we think of the primes as “random”. Of course this is silly, since the primes are a deterministic fixed sequence of numbers. But the hope is that the following is true. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If <img alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Gamma}"/> is a statement about the primes that is with high probability in the random model, then it is true. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Of course this is nonsense. </p>
<p>
But it is interesting nonsense. Harald Cramér has a model that is simple. Granville add some refinements to this model <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.facm/1229618748">here</a> and <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/chance_news/for_chance_news/Riemann/cramer.pdf">here</a>. More recently William Banks and Kevin Ford and Terence Tao have a new model for the primes <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08613.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>
These models are useful for making and thinking about number theory conjectures. Perhaps one day they will be able to really be used to determine truth. They are certainly good heuristics to have when studying the prime numbers. We are jealous. In complexity theory it would be wonderful to have anything like these models. Perhaps <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Model Example </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Cramér’s model is simple to state. Imagine that the primes <img alt="{\cal P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+P%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal P}"/> are replaced by a random set <img alt="{\cal R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+R%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal R}"/> by placing <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> in with probability <img alt="{1/\ln n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F%5Cln+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1/\ln n}"/>. And we make these choices independently. The Fermat numbers are those 	</p>

<p>An interesting problem is are there any more prime Fermat numbers? Many believe that there are no more, or art most there are a finite number in total. Let’s look at using the model to understand the Fermat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fermat_number&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4">numbers</a>: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\ln F_{n}} = \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\log_{2}\left(2^{2^{n}}+1 \right)} = \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n}  = \frac{2}{\ln 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cln+F_%7Bn%7D%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cln+2%7D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Clog_%7B2%7D%5Cleft%282%5E%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D%2B1+%5Cright%29%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cln+2%7D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+2%5E%7B-n%7D++%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Cln+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\ln F_{n}} = \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\log_{2}\left(2^{2^{n}}+1 \right)} = \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n}  = \frac{2}{\ln 2}"/>. </p>
<p>Therefore, the total expected number of Fermat primes is at most finite. Of course this is assuming the model is predictive. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Proved? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our friends at Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture">say</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> As with many famous conjectures in mathematics, there are a number of purported proofs of the Goldbach conjecture, none of which are accepted by the mathematical community. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Try a Google search yourself for “Goldbach conjecture proved”. The top hits include several “proofs” that the conjecture is true. The proofs are all short and simple. All are believed to be wrong. I find it interesting that the proofs, in many cases, use a random like argument in there “proofs”. The trouble is that the above models are only heuristics. So the proofs seem to be incomplete. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Can we imagine getting heuristic models for complexity theory? For quantum algorithms perhaps. What would such heuristic models even look like? We wonder.</p></font></font></div>

    <title>A non-moral dilemma about cheating, but it brings up some points</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I often give two versions of an exam and TELL THE STUDENTS I am doing this so that they don't even try to cheat. I've even had two different classes take the midterm at the same time, same room, every other seat, so the person next to you is in a different course. And I TELL THE STUDENTS that I am doing this.  A colleague of mine says I shouldn't TELL THE STUDENTS. Here are our arguments<br/>
<br/>
1) Don't tell: students cheat a lot and this is a way to catch them.<br/>
<br/>
2) Tell:  Dealing with cheating distracts from our mission of teaching so best to be preventative so it does not happen. Less noble- tell them so that you don't have to deal with the cheating issue.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard of the following case at a diff school some years ago and want your take on it:<br/>
there was one question on the midterm that was different on the two exams- the prof changed the key number, but they were the same question really. The prof was in a hurry for some reason and <i>FORGOT TO TELL THE STUDENTS</i>. You can probably guess what happened next, but not what happened after that<br/>
<br/>
One of the students exams had the solution to THE OTHER PROBLEM on it. Clearly cheating. When called in the student said:<br/>
<br/>
<i>Since you didn't tell us that they were different exams the cheating claim is unfair!</i><br/>
<i><br/>
</i> They DID admit their guilt, but they DID NOT have any contrition.<br/>
<br/>
 Options for what penalty to go for:<br/>
<br/>
1) A 0 on the exam itself<br/>
<br/>
2) An F in the course<br/>
<br/>
3) A notation on the transcript indicating Failed-because-cheated. I don't know what that notation was at the schol the story took place, but at UMCP its XF. (Side Note- not clear if someone outside of UMCP looks at a transcript and sees an XF they'll know what the means. But the F part makes it look bad.)<br/>
<br/>
4) Expulsion from school. (This might not be the profs call- this may depend on if its a first offense.)<br/>
<br/>
The lack of contrition bothers me, though the prof who told me the story said that the student may have said it out of shock- the first thing that came into their mind. I asked the prof how the student was doing in the class and the prof said, CORRECTLY, that that is irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
SO- what penalty would you go for?<br/>
<br/>
The professor went for XF. The student, at the hearing, once again said<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Since you didn't tell us that they were different exams the cheating claim is unfair!</i><br/>
<br/>
The professor told me that he thinks the student was trying to claim it was entrapment, though he had a hard time expressing this coherently. If the student had been a coherent thinker, he probably wouldn't have needed to cheat.<br/>
<br/>
He got the equivalent of an XF. <br/>
<br/>
But here is my real question: Should we TELL THE STUDENTS that they are different exams (I think yes) or<br/>
should we NOT tell them so can catch them?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

question is whether the graph presently admits a planar embedding. We give a
deterministic fully-dynamic algorithm for general graphs, running in amortized
$O(\log^3 n)$ time per edge insertion or deletion, that maintains a bit
indicating whether or not the graph is presently planar. This is an exponential
improvement over the previous best algorithm [Eppstein, Galil, Italiano,

    <title>Approximation Bounds for Interpolation and Normals on Triangulated Surfaces and Manifolds</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1573430400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Khoury:Marc.html">Marc Khoury</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Shewchuk:Jonathan_Richard.html">Jonathan Richard Shewchuk</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03424">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>How good is a triangulation as an approximation of a smooth curved surface or
manifold? We provide bounds on the {\em interpolation error}, the error in the
position of the surface, and the {\em normal error}, the error in the normal
vectors of the surface, as approximated by a piecewise linearly triangulated
surface whose vertices lie on the original, smooth surface. The interpolation
error is the distance from an arbitrary point on the triangulation to the
nearest point on the original, smooth manifold, or vice versa. The normal error
is the angle separating the vector (or space) normal to a triangle from the
vector (or space) normal to the smooth manifold (measured at a suitable point
near the triangle). We also study the {\em normal variation}, the angle
separating the normal vectors (or normal spaces) at two different points on a
smooth manifold. Our bounds apply to manifolds of any dimension embedded in
Euclidean spaces of any dimension, and our interpolation error bounds apply to
simplices of any dimension, although our normal error bounds apply only to
triangles. These bounds are expressed in terms of the sizes of suitable medial
balls (the {\em empty ball size} or {\em local feature size} measured at
certain points on the manifold), and have applications in Delaunay
triangulation-based algorithms for provably good surface reconstruction and
provably good mesh generation. Our bounds have better constants than the prior
bounds we know of---and for several results in higher dimensions, our bounds
are the first to give explicit constants.

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Angriman:Eugenio.html">Eugenio Angriman</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Grinten:Alexander_van_der.html">Alexander van der Grinten</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Meyerhenke:Henning.html">Henning Meyerhenke</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03360">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In network analysis and graph mining, closeness centrality is a popular
measure to infer the importance of a vertex. Computing closeness efficiently
for individual vertices received considerable attention. The NP-hard problem of
group closeness maximization, in turn, is more challenging: the objective is to
find a vertex group that is central as a whole and state-of-the-art heuristics
for it do not scale to very big graphs yet.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present new local search heuristics for group closeness
maximization. By using randomized approximation techniques and dynamic data
structures, our algorithms are often able to perform locally optimal decisions
efficiently. The final result is a group with high (but not optimal) closeness
centrality.
</p>
<p>We compare our algorithms to the current state-of-the-art greedy heuristic
both on weighted and on unweighted real-world graphs. For graphs with hundreds
of millions of edges, our local search algorithms take only around ten minutes,
while greedy requires more than ten hours. Overall, our new algorithms are
between one and two orders of magnitude faster, depending on the desired group
size and solution quality. For example, on weighted graphs and $k = 10$, our
algorithms yield solutions of $12,4\%$ higher quality, while also being
$793,6\times$ faster. For unweighted graphs and $k = 10$, we achieve solutions
within $99,4\%$ of the state-of-the-art quality while being $127,8\times$
faster.

of its vertices such that each color is used either
$\left\lfloor{n/k}\right\rfloor$ or $\left\lceil{n/k}\right\rceil$ times. While
classic Vertex Coloring is fixed parameter tractable under well established
parameters such as pathwidth and feedback vertex set, equitable coloring is
W[1]-hard. We prove that Equitable Coloring is fixed parameter tractable when
parameterized by distance to cluster or co-cluster graphs, improving on the FPT
algorithm of Fiala et al. (2011) parameterized by vertex cover. In terms of
intractability, we adapt the proof of Fellows et al. (2011) to show that
Equitable Coloring is W[1]-hard when simultaneously parameterized by distance
to disjoint paths and number of colors. We also revisit the literature and
derive other results on the parameterized complexity of the problem through
minor reductions or other simple observations.

programs with probabilistic choice. Programs in this class can be seen as
randomized Boolean circuits. We focus on two different questions: first,
deciding whether a program satisfies a prescribed level of privacy; second,
approximating the privacy parameters a program realizes.
</p>
<p>We show that the problem of deciding whether a program satisfies
$\varepsilon$-differential privacy is $coNP^{\#P}$-complete. In fact, this is
the case when either the input domain or the output range of the program is
large. Further, we show that deciding whether a program is
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private is $coNP^{\#P}$-hard, and in
$coNP^{\#P}$ for small output domains, but always in $coNP^{\#P^{\#P}}$.
Finally, we show that the problem of approximating the level of differential
privacy is both $NP$-hard and $coNP$-hard.

polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for a large class of Max-2-CSPs
parametrised by the class of allowed constraint graphs (with arbitrary
constraints on an unbounded alphabet). Our result applies more generally to the
maximum homomorphism problem between two rational-valued structures.
</p>
<p>The condition unifies the two main approaches for designing PTASes. One is
Baker's layering technique, which applies to sparse graphs such as planar or
excluded-minor graphs. The other is based on Szemer\'{e}di's regularity lemma
and applies to dense graphs. Albeit with some limitations, we extend the
applicability of both techniques to new classes of Max-CSPs.
</p>
<p>Treewidth-pliability turns out to be a robust notion that can be defined in
several equivalent ways, including characterisations via size, treedepth, or
the Hadwiger number. We show connections to the notions of
fractional-treewidth-fragility from structural graph theory, hyperfiniteness
from the area of property testing, and regularity partitions from the theory of
dense graph limits. These may be of independent interest. In particular we show
that a monotone class of graphs is hyperfinite if and only if it is
fractionally-treewidth-fragile and has bounded degree.

The
$k^2$-tree data structure is one of the succinct data structures proposed for
representing static graphs, and binary relations in general. It relies on
compact representations of bit vectors. Hence, by relying on compact
representations of dynamic bit vectors, we can also represent dynamic graphs.
In this paper we follow instead the ideas by Munro {\em et al.}, and we present
an alternative implementation for representing dynamic graphs using
$k^2$-trees. Our experimental results show that this new implementation is
competitive in practice.

experimenters to control the robustness and efficiency of their experiments.
The designs build on a recently introduced algorithm in discrepancy theory, the
Gram-Schmidt walk. We provide a tight analysis of this algorithm, allowing us
to prove important properties of the designs it produces. These designs aim to
simultaneously balance all linear functions of the covariates, and the variance
of an estimator of the average treatment effect is shown to be bounded by a
quantity that is proportional to the loss function of a ridge regression of the
potential outcomes on the covariates. No regression is actually conducted, and
one may see the procedure as regression adjustment by design. The class of
designs is parameterized so to give experimenters control over the worse case
performance of the treatment effect estimator. Greater covariate balance is
attained by allowing for a less robust design in terms of worst case variance.
We argue that the trade-off between robustness and efficiency is an inherent
aspect of experimental design. Finally, we provide non-asymptotic tail bounds
for the treatment effect estimator under the class of designs we describe.

distribution has important applications in computer science, statistical
physics, machine learning, and statistics. In this work, we consider the
problem of estimating the normalizing constant $Z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}
e^{-f(x)}\,\mathrm{d}x$ to within a multiplication factor of $1 \pm
\varepsilon$ for a $\mu$-strongly convex and $L$-smooth function $f$, given
query access to $f(x)$ and $\nabla f(x)$. We give both algorithms and
lowerbounds for this problem. Using an annealing algorithm combined with a
multilevel Monte Carlo method based on underdamped Langevin dynamics, we show
that $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\Bigl(\frac{d^{4/3}\kappa +
d^{7/6}\kappa^{7/6}}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$ queries to $\nabla f$ are
sufficient, where $\kappa= L / \mu$ is the condition number. Moreover, we
provide an information theoretic lowerbound, showing that at least
$\frac{d^{1-o(1)}}{\varepsilon^{2-o(1)}}$ queries are necessary. This provides
a first nontrivial lowerbound for the problem.

Thankachan</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03035">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present the first set of results on the computational complexity of
minimizing BWT-runs via alphabet reordering. We prove that the decision version
of this problem is NP-complete and cannot be solved in time $2^{o(\sigma)}n$
unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, where $\sigma$ is the size of the
alphabet. Moreover, we show that optimization variations of this problem yield
strong inapproximability results. In doing so we relate two previously
disparate topics: the size of a path cover of a graph and the number of runs in
the BWT of a text. This provides a surprising connection between problems on
graphs and string compression. As a result we are able to prove (all assuming P
$\neq$ NP): (i) No PTAS exists if we define the cost of a solution as exactly
the number of runs exceeding $\sigma$; (ii) For all $\delta &gt; 0$, no polytime
$\epsilon n^{1/2}$-approximation algorithm exists for $\epsilon &gt; 0$ small
enough if we consider the number of runs exceeding $(1+\delta)\sigma$ as the
cost of a solution. In this case the problem is APX-hard as well. To the best
of our knowledge these are the first ever inapproximability results pertaining
to the BWT. In addition, by relating recent results in the field of dictionary
compression, we demonstrate that if we define cost purely as the number of
runs, we obtain a $\log^2 n$-approximation algorithm. Finally, we provide an
efficient algorithm for the more restricted problem of finding an optimal
ordering on a subset of symbols (occurring only once) under ordering
constraints which runs in optimal time for small values of $\sigma$. We also
look at a version of the problem on the newly discovered class of graphs with
BWT like properties called Wheeler graphs. Here also we show NP-hardness
results on a related problem which we call Source Ordering.

Hopscotch
Hashing is an open addressing algorithm originally proposed by Herlihy, Shavit,
and Tzafrir, which is known for fast performance and excellent cache locality.
The algorithm allows users of the table to skip or jump over irrelevant
entries, allowing quick search, insertion, and removal of entries. Unlike
traditional linear probing, Hopscotch Hashing is capable of operating under a
high load factor, as probe counts remain small. Our lock-free version improves
on both speed, cache locality, and progress guarantees of the original, being a
chimera of two concurrent hash tables. We compare our data structure to various
other lock-free and blocking hashing algorithms and show that its performance
is in many cases superior to existing strategies. The proposed lock-free
version overcomes some of the drawbacks associated with the original blocking
version, leading to a substantial boost in scalability while maintaining
attractive features like physical deletion or probe-chain compression.

path on $k$ vertices in $G$ contains at least one vertex from $I$. The
\textsc{$k$-Path Vertex Cover Reconfiguration ($k$-PVCR)} problem asks if one
can transform one $k$-path vertex cover into another via a sequence of $k$-path
vertex covers where each intermediate member is obtained from its predecessor
by applying a given reconfiguration rule exactly once. We investigate the
computational complexity of \textsc{$k$-PVCR} from the viewpoint of graph
classes under the well-known reconfiguration rules: $\mathsf{TS}$,
$\mathsf{TJ}$, and $\mathsf{TAR}$. The problem for $k=2$, known as the
\textsc{Vertex Cover Reconfiguration (VCR)} problem, has been well-studied in
the literature. We show that certain known hardness results for \textsc{VCR} on
different graph classes including planar graphs, bounded bandwidth graphs,
chordal graphs, and bipartite graphs, can be extended for \textsc{$k$-PVCR}. In
particular, we prove a complexity dichotomy for \textsc{$k$-PVCR} on general
graphs: on those whose maximum degree is $3$ (and even planar), the problem is
$\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete, while on those whose maximum degree is $2$ (i.e.,
paths and cycles), the problem can be solved in polynomial time. Additionally,
we also design polynomial-time algorithms for \textsc{$k$-PVCR} on trees under
each of $\mathsf{TJ}$ and $\mathsf{TAR}$. Moreover, on paths, cycles, and
trees, we describe how one can construct a reconfiguration sequence between two
given $k$-path vertex covers in a yes-instance. In particular, on paths, our
constructed reconfiguration sequence is shortest.

that has been drawn from a topological space with higher homology groups on its
filtration. A particular difficulty with this algorithm are the boundary
points. Its core is based on the Voronoi diagram, which induces a natural dual
map to the Delaunay triangulation. Advantage is taken from this fact and the
persistent homology is therefore calculated after each iteration to capture the
changing topology of the data. The Bottleneck and Wasserstein distance serve as
a measure of quality between the original data and the interpolation. If the
norm of two distances exceeds a heuristically determined threshold, the
algorithm terminates. The theoretical basis for this procedure is given and the
validity of this approach is justified with numerical experiments.

computes a minimum spanning forest which connects every pixel / unlabeled node
to a seed / labeled node. We propose instead to consider all possible spanning
forests and calculate, for every node, the probability of sampling a forest
connecting a certain seed with that node. We dub this approach "Probabilistic
Watershed". Leo Grady (2006) already noted its equivalence to the Random Walker
/ Harmonic energy minimization. We here give a simpler proof of this
equivalence and establish the computational feasibility of the Probabilistic
Watershed with Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem. Furthermore, we show a new
connection between the Random Walker probabilities and the triangle inequality
of the effective resistance. Finally, we derive a new and intuitive
interpretation of the Power Watershed.

    <title>Extended Formulation Lower Bounds for Refuting Random CSPs</title>

conjectured to be computationally intractable. The average case hardness of
random $3$-SAT and other CSPs has broad and far-reaching implications on
problems in approximation, learning theory and cryptography.
</p>
<p>In this work, we show subexponential lower bounds on the size of linear
programming relaxations for refuting random instances of constraint
satisfaction problems. Formally, suppose $P : \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}$ is a
predicate that supports a $t-1$-wise uniform distribution on its satisfying
assignments. Consider the distribution of random instances of CSP $P$ with $m =
\Delta n$ constraints. We show that any linear programming extended formulation
that can refute instances from this distribution with constant probability must
have size at least
$\Omega\left(\exp\left(\left(\frac{n^{t-2}}{\Delta^2}\right)^{\frac{1-\nu}{k}}\right)\right)$
for all $\nu &gt; 0$. For example, this yields a lower bound of size
$\exp(n^{1/3})$ for random $3$-SAT with a linear number of clauses.
</p>
<p>We use the technique of pseudocalibration to directly obtain extended
formulation lower bounds from the planted distribution. This approach bypasses
the need to construct Sherali-Adams integrality gaps in proving general LP
lower bounds. As a corollary, one obtains a self-contained proof of
subexponential Sherali-Adams LP lower bounds for these problems. We believe the
result sheds light on the technique of pseudocalibration, a promising but
conjectural approach to LP/SDP lower bounds.

achieved by combining the methods for masking and error correction for stuck

present two constructions for masking $u&lt;q$ cells and error correction: one is

require less redundancy for masking partially stuck cells than previous work on
stuck cells, which in turn can result in higher code rates at the same masking

multicollisions, often denoted by $\ell$-collisions, where an $\ell$-collision
for a function is a set of $\ell$ distinct inputs that are mapped by the
function to the same value. The tight bound of quantum query complexity for
finding a $2$-collisions of a random function has been revealed to be
$\Theta(N^{1/3})$, where $N$ is the size of the range of the function, but
neither the lower nor upper bounds are known for general $\ell$-collisions. The
paper first integrates the results from existing research to derive several new
observations, e.g.,~$\ell$-collisions can be generated only with $O(N^{1/2})$
quantum queries for any integer constant $\ell$. It then provides a quantum
algorithm that finds an $\ell$-collision for a random function with the average
quantum query complexity of $O(N^{(2^{\ell-1}-1) / (2^{\ell}-1)})$, which
matches the tight bound of $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ for $\ell=2$ and improves upon the
known bounds, including the above simple bound of $O(N^{1/2})$. More generally,
the algorithm achieves the average quantum query complexity of $O\big(c_N \cdot
N^{({2^{\ell-1}-1})/({ 2^{\ell}-1})}\big)$ and runs over $\tilde{O}\big(c_N
\cdot N^{({2^{\ell-1}-1})/({ 2^{\ell}-1})}\big)$ qubits in $\tilde{O}\big(c_N
\cdot N^{({2^{\ell-1}-1})/({ 2^{\ell}-1})}\big)$ expected time for a random
function $F\colon X\to Y$ such that $|X| \geq \ell \cdot |Y| / c_N$ for any
$1\le c_N \in o(N^{{1}/({2^\ell - 1})})$. With the same complexities, it is
actually able to find a multiclaw for random functions, which is harder to find
than a multicollision.

systems. In this problem, we are given an integer linear system $I$ and two
feasible solutions $\boldsymbol{s}$ and $\boldsymbol{t}$ of $I$, and then asked
to transform $\boldsymbol{s}$ to $\boldsymbol{t}$ by changing a value of only
one variable at a time, while maintaining a feasible solution of $I$
throughout. $Z(I)$ for $I$ is the complexity index introduced by Kimura and
Makino (Discrete Applied Mathematics 200:67--78, 2016), which is defined by the
sign pattern of the input matrix. We analyze the complexity of the
reconfiguration problem of integer linear systems based on the complexity index
$Z(I)$ of given $I$. We then show that the problem is (i) solvable in constant
time if $Z(I)$ is less than one, (ii) weakly coNP-complete and
pseudo-polynomially solvable if $Z(I)$ is exactly one, and (iii)
PSPACE-complete if $Z(I)$ is greater than one. Since the complexity indices of
Horn and two-variable-par-inequality integer linear systems are at most one,
our results imply that the reconfiguration of these systems are in coNP and
pseudo-polynomially solvable. Moreover, this is the first result that reveals
coNP-completeness for a reconfiguration problem, to the best of our knowledge.

Mining communities that are bursting in a
period of time is essential to seek emergency events in temporal graphs.
Unfortunately, most previous studies for community mining in temporal networks
ignore the bursting patterns of communities. In this paper, we are the first to
study a problem of seeking bursting communities in a temporal graph. We propose
a novel model, called (l, {\delta})-maximal dense core, to represent a bursting
community in a temporal graph. Specifically, an (l, {\delta})-maximal dense
core is a temporal subgraph in which each node has average degree no less than
{\delta} in a time segment with length no less than l. To compute the (l,
{\delta})-maximal dense core, we first develop a novel dynamic programming
algorithm which can calculate the segment density efficiently. Then, we propose
an improved algorithm with several novel pruning techniques to further improve
the efficiency. In addition, we also develop an efficient algorithm to
enumerate all (l, {\delta})-maximal dense cores that are not dominated by the
others in terms of the parameters l and {\delta}. The results of extensive
experiments on 9 real-life datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency
and scalability of our algorithms.

computationally-efficient truthful mechanisms for (approximately) maximizing
welfare in combinatorial auctions with submodular bidders. The first such
mechanism was obtained by Dobzinski, Nisan, and Schapira [STOC'06] who gave an
$O(\log^2{m})$-approximation where $m$ is the number of items. This problem has
been studied extensively since, culminating in an
$O(\sqrt{\log{m}})$-approximation mechanism by Dobzinski [STOC'16].
</p>
<p>We present a computationally-efficient truthful mechanism with approximation
ratio that improves upon the state-of-the-art by an exponential factor. In
particular, our mechanism achieves an $O((\log\log{m})^3)$-approximation in
expectation, uses only $O(n)$ demand queries, and has universal truthfulness
guarantee. This settles an open question of Dobzinski on whether
$\Theta(\sqrt{\log{m}})$ is the best approximation ratio in this setting in
negative.

categorical variables are frequently represented as one-hot encoded vectors.
For example, given 8 distinct values, we map each value to a byte where only a
single bit has been set. We are motivated to quickly compute statistics over
such encodings. Given a stream of k-bit words, we seek to compute k~distinct
sums corresponding to bit values at indexes 0, 1, 2, ..., k-1. If the k-bit
words are one-hot encoded then the sums correspond to a frequency histogram.
This multiple-sum problem is a generalization of the population-count problem
where we seek the sum of all bit values. Accordingly, we refer to the
multiple-sum problem as a positional population-count. Using SIMD (Single
Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions from recent Intel processors, we
describe algorithms for computing the 16-bit position population count using
less than half of a CPU cycle per 16-bit word. Our best approach uses up to 400
times fewer instructions and is up to 50 times faster than baseline code using
only regular (non-SIMD) instructions, for sufficiently large inputs.

least-squares problems, where the Hessian is approximated based on a random
projection of the data matrix. We consider a random subspace embedding which is
either drawn at the beginning and then fixed, or, refreshed at each iteration.
We provide an exact finite-time analysis of the refreshed embeddings method for
a broad class of random matrices, an exact asymptotic analysis of the fixed
embedding method with a Gaussian matrix, and a non-asymptotic analysis of the
fixed embedding method for Gaussian and SRHT matrices, with and without
momentum acceleration. Surprisingly, we show that, for Gaussian matrices, the
refreshed sketching method with no momentum yields the same asymptotic rate of
convergence as the fixed embedding method accelerated with momentum.
Furthermore, we characterize optimal step sizes and prove that, for a broad
class of random matrices including the Gaussian ensemble, momentum does not
accelerate the refreshed embeddings method. Hence, among the class of
randomized algorithms we consider, a fixed subspace embedding with momentum
yields the fastest rate of convergence, along with the lowest computational
complexity.
</p>
<p>Then, picking the accelerated, fixed embedding method as the algorithm of
choice, we obtain a faster algorithm by optimizing over the choice of the
sketching dimension. Our choice of the sketch size yields an algorithm, for
solving overdetermined least-squares problem, with a lower computational
complexity compared to current state-of-the-art least-squares iterative methods
based on randomized pre-conditioners. In particular, given the sketched data
matrix, as the sample size grows, the resulting computational complexity
becomes sub-linear in the problem dimensions. We validate numerically our
guarantees on large sample datasets, both for Gaussian and SRHT embeddings.

    <title>Analysis of Two-variable Recurrence Relations with Application to Parameterized Approximations</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1573430400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kulik:Ariel.html">Ariel Kulik</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Shachnai:Hadas.html">Hadas Shachnai</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02653">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we introduce randomized branching as a tool for parameterized
approximation and develop the mathematical machinery for its analysis. Our
algorithms improve the best known running times of parameterized approximation
algorithms for Vertex Cover and $3$-Hitting Set for a wide range of
approximation ratios. One notable example is a simple parameterized random
$1.5$-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover, whose running time of
$O^*(1.01657^k)$ substantially improves the best known runnning time of
$O^*(1.0883^k)$ [Brankovic and Fernau, 2013]. For $3$-Hitting Set we present a
parameterized random $2$-approximation algorithm with running time of
$O^*(1.125^k)$, improving the best known $O^*(1.29^k)$ algorithm of [Brankovic
and Fernau, 2012].
</p>
<p>To evaluate the running times of our algorithms we develop mathematical tools
for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of a family of two variables recurrence
relations. To this end, we show an equivalence between the recurrence and a
random process. We analyze this process via an adaptation of Sanov's theorem to
our setting, which facilitates the use of method of types and information
theory for the first time in the analysis of branching algorithms. We believe
our novel analysis of recurrence relations may be of independent interest and
is one of the main contributions of this paper.

    <title>Distributed MST: A Smoothed Analysis</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1573430400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Chatterjee:Soumyottam.html">Soumyottam Chatterjee</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Pandurangan:Gopal.html">Gopal Pandurangan</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Pham:Nguyen_Dinh.html">Nguyen Dinh Pham</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02628">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study smoothed analysis of distributed graph algorithms, focusing on the
fundamental minimum spanning tree (MST) problem. With the goal of studying the
time complexity of distributed MST as a function of the "perturbation" of the
input graph, we posit a {\em smoothing model} that is parameterized by a
smoothing parameter $0 \leq \epsilon(n) \leq 1$ which controls the amount of
{\em random} edges that can be added to an input graph $G$ per round.
Informally, $\epsilon(n)$ is the probability (typically a small function of
$n$, e.g., $n^{-\frac{1}{4}}$) that a random edge can be added to a node per
round. The added random edges, once they are added, can be used (only) for
communication.
</p>
<p>We show upper and lower bounds on the time complexity of distributed MST in
the above smoothing model. We present a distributed algorithm that, with high
probability,\footnote{Throughout, with high probability (whp) means with
probability at least $1 - n^{-c}$, for some fixed, positive constant $c$.}
computes an MST and runs in $\tilde{O}(\min\{\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon(n)}}
2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}, D + \sqrt{n}\})$ rounds\footnote{The notation $\tilde{O}$
hides a $\polylog(n)$ factor and $\tilde{\Omega}$ hides a
$\frac{1}{\polylog{(n)}}$ factor, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the
graph.} where $\epsilon$ is the smoothing parameter, $D$ is the network
diameter and $n$ is the network size. To complement our upper bound, we also
show a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(\min\{\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon(n)}},
D+\sqrt{n}\})$. We note that the upper and lower bounds essentially match
except for a multiplicative $2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})} \polylog(n)$ factor.
</p>
<p>Our work can be considered as a first step in understanding the smoothed
complexity of distributed graph algorithms.

    <title>TR19-157 |  How QBF Expansion Makes Strategy Extraction Hard | 

	Judith Clymo, 

	Leroy Chew</title>
    <summary>In this paper we show that the QBF proof checking format QRAT (Quantified Resolution Asymmetric Tautologies) by Heule, Biere and Seidl cannot have polynomial-time strategy extraction unless P=PSPACE. In our proof, the crucial property that makes strategy extraction PSPACE-hard for this proof format is universal expansion, even expansion on a single variable. 

While expansion reasoning used in other QBF calculi can admit polynomial time strategy extraction, we find this is conditional on a property studied in proof complexity theory. We show that strategy extraction on expansion based systems can only happen when the underlying propositional calculus has the property of feasible interpolation.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Ten weeks into my move to Italy I am feeling more and more settled. I even eventually got a Milan bus card, which proves that if you really believe in yourself you can achieve anything. I held a midterm for my theoretical computer science undergraduate class, and there were zero students asking for special accommodations and zero students complaining to me about their grade.</p>
<p>According to our national tradition, I like to complain, but Bocconi is really not giving me much to work with.</p>
<p>But enough about me, let’s talk about you. I am going to assume that you want to come to Milan, because, really, why not? Here are some ways in which this can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You are a high school senior and you would like to study computer science in college, but you like math as well</b>: next academic year, Bocconi is starting a new <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/bachelor+of+science/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence">undergraduate program on math and CS</a>
</li>
<li><strong>You are an undergraduate or masters student applying to PhD programs and you would like to work with me</strong>: next academic year, Bocconi is starting a new <a>PhD program on statistics and computer science</a></li>
<li><strong>You are a theory PhD student and you are looking for what to do next summer</strong>: I would be interested in hosting graduate students for part of next summer, especially during the month of July. Ask your advisor to contact me if this is something that you would be interested in</li>
<li><strong>You are a graduating theory PhD student and you are looking for a postdoc next year</strong>: I will have one or two openings for postdocs next year. The call for applications will be up soon. The tax-free salary will be very competitive and Bocconi has exceptionally well-functioning processes to get non-Italian-speakers settled in, help them do the immigration paperwork, look for housing, finding English-speaking primary care physicians, etc.</li>

<li><strong>You are (or might be tempted to be) on the job market for a faculty position</strong>: in light of all the new initiatives on computing, and the current staff of one computer science professor, Bocconi would like to hire at all levels, preferably at the levels of Associate Professor or Full Professor, in computer science, especially in theory and in AI. Salaries are very competitive, they are essentially tax-free for six years for people who have not lived in Italy in the past two years, all teaching is in English, and the university makes it very easy for foreigners to settle in.</li>
<li><strong>You are a professor and your sabbatical is coming up, or you arranged your teaching to have a semester without teaching to do some traveling</strong>: contact me if you are interested in visiting for any length of time.
</li></ul>
<p>I am in Baltimore for FOCS through Tuesday morning if you want to talk to me in person.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This morning a humanities teacher named Richard Horan, having read my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/google-quantum-computer-sycamore.html">NYT op-ed on quantum supremacy</a>, emailed me the following question about it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Is this pursuit [of scalable quantum computation] just an arms race? A race to see who can achieve it first? To what end? Will this achievement yield advances in medical science and human quality of life, or will it threaten us even more than we are threatened presently by our technologies? You seem rather sanguine about its possible development and uses. But how close does the hand on that doomsday clock move to midnight once we “can harness an exponential number of amplitudes for computation”?</p></blockquote>



<p>I thought this question might possibly be of some broader interest, so here’s my response (with some light edits).</p>



<p>Dear Richard,</p>



<p>A radio interviewer asked me a similar question a couple weeks ago—whether there’s an ethical dimension to quantum computing research.  I replied that there’s an ethical dimension to everything that humans do.</p>



<p>A quantum computer is not like a nuclear weapon: it’s not going to directly kill anybody (unless the dilution refrigerator falls on them or something?).  It’s true that a full, scalable QC, if and when it’s achieved, will give a temporary advantage to people who want to break certain cryptographic codes.  The morality of that, of course, could strongly depend on whether the codebreakers are working for the “good guys” (like the Allies during WWII) or the “bad guys” (like, perhaps, Trump or Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping).</p>



<p>But in any case, there’s already a push to switch to new cryptographic codes that already exist and that we think are quantum-resistant.  An actual scalable QC on the horizon would of course massively accelerate that push.  And once people make the switch, we expect that security on the Internet will be more-or-less back where it started.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the big upside potential from QCs is that they’ll provide an unprecedented ability to simulate physics and chemistry at the molecular level.  That could at least <em>potentially</em> help with designing new medicines, as well as new batteries and solar cells and carbon capture technologies—all things that the world desperately needs right now.</p>



<p>Also, the theory developed around QC has already led to many new and profound insights about physics and computation.  Some of us regard that as an inherent good, in the same way that art and music and literature are.</p>



<p>Now, one could argue that the climate crisis, or various other crises that our civilization faces, are so desperate that instead of working to build QCs, we should all just abandon our normal work and directly confront the crises, as (for example) Greta Thunberg is doing.  On some days I share that position.  But of course, were the position upheld, it would have implications not just for quantum computing researchers but for almost everyone on earth—including humanities teachers like yourself.</p>

    <title>TR19-156 |  Almost Optimal Testers for Concise Representations | 

	Nader Bshouty</title>
    <summary>We give improved and almost optimal testers for several classes of Boolean functions on $n$ inputs that have concise representation in the uniform and distribution-free model. Classes, such as $k$-Junta, $k$-Linear Function, $s$-Term DNF, $s$-Term Monotone DNF, $r$-DNF, Decision List, $r$-Decision List, size-$s$ Decision Tree, size-$s$ Boolean Formula, size-$s$ Branching Program, $s$-Sparse Polynomial over the binary field and functions with Fourier Degree at most $d$.</summary>
