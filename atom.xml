    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Ten weeks into my move to Italy I am feeling more and more settled. I even eventually got a Milan bus card, which proves that if you really believe in yourself you can achieve anything. I held a midterm for my theoretical computer science undergraduate class, and there were zero students asking for special accommodations and zero students complaining to me about their grade.</p>
<p>According to our national tradition, I like to complain, but Bocconi is really not giving me much to work with.</p>
<p>But enough about me, let’s talk about you. I am going to assume that you want to come to Milan, because, really, why not? Here are some ways in which this can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You are a high school senior and you would like to study computer science in college, but you like math as well</b>: next academic year, Bocconi is starting a new <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/bachelor+of+science/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence">undergraduate program on math and CS</a>
</li>
<li><strong>You are an undergraduate or masters student applying to PhD programs and you would like to work with me</strong>: next academic year, Bocconi is starting a new <a>PhD program on statistics and computer science</a></li>
<li><strong>You are a theory PhD student and you are looking for what to do next summer</strong>: I would be interested in hosting graduate students for part of next summer, especially during the month of July. Ask your advisor to contact me if this is something that you would be interested in</li>
<li><strong>You are a graduating theory PhD student and you are looking for a postdoc next year</strong>: I will have one or two openings for postdocs next year. The call for applications will be up soon. The tax-free salary will be very competitive and Bocconi has exceptionally well-functioning processes to get non-Italian-speakers settled in, help them do the immigration paperwork, look for housing, finding English-speaking primary care physicians, etc.</li>

<li><strong>You are (or might be tempted to be) on the job market for a faculty position</strong>: in light of all the new initiatives on computing, and the current staff of one computer science professor, Bocconi would like to hire at all levels, preferably at the levels of Associate Professor or Full Professor, in computer science, especially in theory and in AI. Salaries are very competitive, they are essentially tax-free for six years for people who have not lived in Italy in the past two years, all teaching is in English, and the university makes it very easy for foreigners to settle in.</li>
<li><strong>You are a professor and your sabbatical is coming up, or you arranged your teaching to have a semester without teaching to do some traveling</strong>: contact me if you are interested in visiting for any length of time.
</li></ul>
<p>I am in Baltimore for FOCS through Tuesday morning if you want to talk to me in person.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This morning a humanities teacher named Richard Horan, having read my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/google-quantum-computer-sycamore.html">NYT op-ed on quantum supremacy</a>, emailed me the following question about it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Is this pursuit [of scalable quantum computation] just an arms race? A race to see who can achieve it first? To what end? Will this achievement yield advances in medical science and human quality of life, or will it threaten us even more than we are threatened presently by our technologies? You seem rather sanguine about its possible development and uses. But how close does the hand on that doomsday clock move to midnight once we “can harness an exponential number of amplitudes for computation”?</p></blockquote>



<p>I thought this question might possibly be of some broader interest, so here’s my response (with some light edits).</p>



<p>Dear Richard,</p>



<p>A radio interviewer asked me a similar question a couple weeks ago—whether there’s an ethical dimension to quantum computing research.  I replied that there’s an ethical dimension to everything that humans do.</p>



<p>A quantum computer is not like a nuclear weapon: it’s not going to directly kill anybody (unless the dilution refrigerator falls on them or something?).  It’s true that a full, scalable QC, if and when it’s achieved, will give a temporary advantage to people who want to break certain cryptographic codes.  The morality of that, of course, could strongly depend on whether the codebreakers are working for the “good guys” (like the Allies during WWII) or the “bad guys” (like, perhaps, Trump or Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping).</p>



<p>But in any case, there’s already a push to switch to new cryptographic codes that already exist and that we think are quantum-resistant.  An actual scalable QC on the horizon would of course massively accelerate that push.  And once people make the switch, we expect that security on the Internet will be more-or-less back where it started.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the big upside potential from QCs is that they’ll provide an unprecedented ability to simulate physics and chemistry at the molecular level.  That could at least <em>potentially</em> help with designing new medicines, as well as new batteries and solar cells and carbon capture technologies—all things that the world desperately needs right now.</p>



<p>Also, the theory developed around QC has already led to many new and profound insights about physics and computation.  Some of us regard that as an inherent good, in the same way that art and music and literature are.</p>



<p>Now, one could argue that the climate crisis, or various other crises that our civilization faces, are so desperate that instead of working to build QCs, we should all just abandon our normal work and directly confront the crises, as (for example) Greta Thunberg is doing.  On some days I share that position.  But of course, were the position upheld, it would have implications not just for quantum computing researchers but for almost everyone on earth—including humanities teachers like yourself.</p>



<p>Best,<br/>Scott</p></div>

    <title>TR19-155 |  Pseudorandomness and the Minimum Circuit Size Problem | 

	Rahul Santhanam</title>
    <summary>We explore the possibility of basing one-way functions on the average-case hardness of the fundamental Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP[$s$]), which asks whether a Boolean function on $n$ bits specified by its truth table has circuits of size $s(n)$. 

1. (Pseudorandomness from Zero-Error Average-Case Hardness) We show that for a given size function $s$, 
the following are equivalent: Pseudorandom distributions supported on strings describable by $s(O(n))$-size circuits exist; Hitting sets supported on strings describable by $s(O(n))$-size circuits exist; MCSP[$s(O(n))$] is zero-error average-case hard. Using similar techniques, we show that Feige's hypothesis for random $k$-CNFs implies that there is a pseudorandom distribution (with constant error) supported entirely on satisfiable formulas. Underlying our results is a general notion of semantic sampling, which might be of independent interest.

2. (A New Conjecture) In analogy to a known universal construction of succinct hitting sets against arbitrary polynomial-size adversaries, we propose the Universality Conjecture: there is a universal construction of succinct pseudorandom distributions against arbitrary polynomial-size adversaries. We show that under the Universality Conjecture, the following are equivalent: One-way functions exist; Natural proofs useful against sub-exponential size circuits do not exist; Learning polynomial-size circuits with membership queries over the uniform distribution is hard; MCSP[$2^{\epsilon n}$] is zero-error hard on average for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$; Cryptographic succinct hitting set generators exist.

3. (Non-Black-Box Results) We show that for weak circuit classes C against which there are natural proofs [Razborov-Rudich97], pseudorandom functions secure against poly-size circuits in C imply superpolynomial lower bounds in P against poly-size circuits in C. We also show that for a certain natural variant of MCSP, there is a polynomial-time reduction from approximating the problem well in the worst case to solving it on average. These results are shown using non-black-box techniques, and in the first case we show that there is no black-box proof of the result under standard crypto assumptions.</summary>

    <title>TR19-154 |  Ar?kan meets Shannon: Polar codes with near-optimal convergence to channel capacity | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Andrii Riazanov, 

	Min Ye</title>
    <summary>Let $W$ be a binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel with Shannon capacity $I(W)$ and fix any $\alpha &gt; 0$. We construct, for any sufficiently small $\delta &gt; 0$, binary linear codes of block length $O(1/\delta^{2+\alpha})$ and rate $I(W)-\delta$ that enable reliable communication on $W$ with quasi-linear time encoding and decoding. Shannon's noisy coding theorem established the existence of such codes (without efficient constructions or decoding) with block length $O(1/\delta^2)$. This quadratic dependence on the gap $\delta$ to capacity is known to be best possible. Our result thus yields a constructive version of Shannon's theorem with near-optimal convergence to capacity as a function of the block length. This resolves a central theoretical challenge associated with the attainment of Shannon capacity. Previously such a result was only known for the erasure channel.

Our codes are a variant of Ar?kan’s polar codes based on multiple carefully constructed local kernels, one for each intermediate channel that arises in the decoding. A crucial ingredient in the analysis is a strong converse of the noisy coding theorem when communicating using random linear codes on arbitrary BMS channels. Our converse theorem shows extreme unpredictability of even a single message bit for random coding at rates slightly above capacity.</summary>

    <title>TR19-153 |  Optimally Resilient Codes for List-Decoding from Insertions and Deletions | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Bernhard Haeupler, 

	Amirbehshad Shahrasbi</title>
    <summary>We give a complete answer to the following basic question: ``What is the maximal fraction of deletions or insertions tolerable by $q$-ary list-decodable codes with non-vanishing information rate?''

This question has been open even for binary codes, including the restriction to the binary insertion-only setting, where the best known results was that a $\gamma \leq 0.707$ fraction of insertions is tolerable by some binary code family.

For any desired $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we construct a family of binary codes of positive rate which can be efficiently list-decoded from any combination of $\gamma$ fraction of insertions and $\delta$ fraction of deletions as long as $ \gamma + 2\delta \leq 1 -\epsilon$. On the other hand, for any $\gamma, \delta$ with $\gamma + 2\delta = 1$ list-decoding is impossible. Our result thus precisely characterizes the feasibility region of binary list-decodable codes for insertions and deletions. 

We further generalize our result to codes over any finite alphabet of size $q$. Surprisingly, our work reveals that the feasibility region for $q&gt;2$ is *not* the natural generalization of the binary bound above. We provide tight upper and lower bounds that precisely pin down the feasibility region, which turns out to have a $(q-1)$-piece-wise linear boundary whose $q$ corner-points lie on a quadratic curve.  

The main technical work in our results is proving the existence of code families of sufficiently large *size* with good list-decoding properties for any combination of $\delta,\gamma$ within the claimed feasibility region. We achieve this via an intricate analysis of codes introduced by [Bukh, Ma; SIAM J. Discrete Math; 2014]. Finally we give a simple yet powerful concatenation scheme for list-decodable insertion-deletion codes which transforms any such (non-efficient) code family (with vanishing information rate) into an efficiently decodable code family with constant rate.</summary>

    <title>TR19-152 |   Quantum versus Randomized Communication Complexity, with Efficient Players | 

	Uma Girish, 

	Ran Raz, 

	Avishay Tal</title>
    <summary>We study a new type of separation between quantum and classical communication complexity which is obtained using quantum protocols where all parties are efficient, in the sense that they can be implemented by small quantum circuits with oracle access to their inputs. More precisely, we give an explicit partial Boolean function that can be computed in the quantum-simultaneous-with-entanglement model of communication, however, every interactive randomized protocol is of exponentially larger cost. Furthermore, all the parties in the quantum protocol can be implemented by quantum circuits of small size with blackbox access to the inputs. Our result qualitatively matches the strongest known separation between quantum and classical communication complexity and is obtained using a quantum protocol where all parties are efficient.</summary>

<div>We prove bounds on the generalization error of convolutional networks. The bounds are characterized in terms of the training loss, the number of parameters, the Lipschitz constant of the loss, and the distance of the initial and final weights. The bounds are independent of the number of pixels in the input, as well as the width and height of hidden feature maps. These are the first bounds for DNNs with such guarantees.  We present experiments with CIFAR-10, varying hyperparameters of a deep convolutional network, comparing our bounds with practical generalization gaps.</div>

<p>Existing techniques for derandomizing algorithms based on circuit lower bounds yield a large polynomial slowdown in running time. We show that assuming exponential lower bounds against nondeterministic circuits, we can convert any randomized algorithm running in time T to a deterministic one running in time nearly T^2. Under complexity-theoretic assumptions, such a slowdown is nearly optimal.</p>
<p>In this talk I will concentrate on the role of error-correcting codes in those techniques. We will see which properties of error-correcting codes are useful for constructing pseudorandomness primitives sufficient for derandomization, where they came short of achieving better slowdown, and how we can overcome that.</p>

<div> There are many basic problems over sequences. For example, computing the edit distance between two sequences, detecting how RNA sequences fold, finding the distance between a sequence and a language (collection of sequences), understanding how disbalanced a parenthesis sequence is. They have natural applications in various areas including computational biology, natural language processing, compiler optimization, and data cleaning. The last few years have seen a plethora of results where new faster algorithms have been developed for these problems with various trade-offs between approximation (quality of solution) and running time (scalability). In this talk, I will present some of the tools that have been developed from my work related to these problems. Depending on time and audience choices, we will cover one or more of the following.</div>
<div/>
<div>(i) A random walk based technique useful to measure how disbalanced a parenthesis sequence is, which has also been useful for streaming computation of edit distance.</div>
<div/>
<div>(ii) A dependent rounding technique that gives nearly optimal result in nearly optimal time for estimating distance between a sequence and a language, which can also be used to speed up other polynomial time problems, such as the all pairs shortest path computation on graphs.</div>
<div/>
<div>(iii) An amnesic dynamic programming technique that gives significantly faster approximation algorithm for RNA-folding, which can also be useful for many dynamic programming based problems that have Lipschitz property (most sequence problems have it).</div>
<div/>
<div>(iv) An elimination of shortest path technique that gives sublinear time algorithms for estimating edit distance for certain regimes of edit distance.</div>

<p><em>Local Computation Algorithms</em></p>
<p>Consider a setting in which inputs to and outputs from a computational problem are so large, that there is not time to read them in their entirety.   However, if one is only interested in small parts of the output at any given time, is it really necessary to solve the entire computational problem? Is it even necessary to view the whole input? We survey recent work in the model of  “local computation algorithms” which for a given input, supports queries by a user to values of specified bits of a legal output.  The goal is to design local computation algorithms in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order to determine the value of any single bit of the output. Though this model describes sequential computations, techniques from local distributed algorithms have been extremely important in designing efficient local computation algorithms. In this talk, we describe results on a variety of problems for which sublinear time and space local computation algorithms have been developed — we will give special focus to finding maximal independent sets and sparse spanning graphs.</p>

    <title>TR19-151 |  Optimal Inapproximability with Universal Factor Graphs | 

	Johan Hastad, 

	Per Austrin, 

	Jonah Brown-Cohen</title>
    <summary>The factor graph of an instance of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is the bipartite graph indicating which variables appear in each constraint.  An instance of the CSP is given by the factor graph together with a list of which predicate is applied for each constraint. We establish that many Max-CSPs remains as hard to approximate as in the general case even when the factor graph is fixed (depending only on the size of the instance) and known in advance.

Examples of results obtained for this restricted setting are:

Optimal inapproximability for Max-3-Lin.

Approximation resistance for predicates supporting pairwise independent subgroups.

Hardness of the ``$(2+\epsilon)$-Sat'' problem and other Promise CSPs.

The main technical tool used to establish these results is a new way of folding the long code which we call ``functional folding''.</summary>

    <title>TR19-150 |  A Logical Characteristic of Read-Once Branching Programs | 

	Stanislav Žák</title>
    <summary>We present a mathematical model of the intuitive notions such as the
knowledge or the information arising at different stages of
computations on branching programs (b.p.). The model has two
appropriate
properties:\\
i) The "knowledge" arising at a stage of computation in question is
derivable from the "knowledge" arising at the previous stage
according to the rules of the model and according to the local
arrangement of the b.p.\\
ii) The model confirms the intuitively well-known fact that the
knowledge arising at a node of a computation depends not only on
it but in some cases also on a "mystery" information. (I. e.
different computations reaching the same node may have different
knowledge(s) arisen at it.)\\
We prove that with respect to our model no such information exists
in read-once b.p.`s but on the other hand in b. p.`s which are not
read-once such information must be present. The read-once property
forms a frontier.\\
More concretely, we may see the instances of our models as a systems
$S=(U,D)$ where $U$ is a universe of knowledge and $D$ are
derivation rules. We say that a b.p. $P$ is compatible with a system
$S$ iff along each computation in $P$ $S$ derives $F$ ($false$) or
$T$ ($true$) at the end correctly according to the label of the
reached sink. This key notion modifies the classic paradigm
according to which the computational complexity is defined with
respect to different classes of restricted b.p.`s (e.g. read-once
b.p.`s, k-b.p.`s, b.p.`s computing in limited time etc.). Now, the
restriction is defined by a subset of systems and only these
programs are taken into account which are compatible with
at least one of the chosen systems.\\
Further  we may understand the sets $U$ of knowledge(s) as a sets of
admissible logical formulae.  More rich  sets $U$`s imply the larger
(= more free) restrictions on b.p.`s and consequently the smaller
complexities of Boolean functions are detected. More rich logical
equipment implies stronger computational effectiveness.\\</summary>

They obtain a linear in the dimension competitive ratio for convex body chasing, a problem which was entirely open for any <img alt="d \geq 3" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e001a3fd5bcc2fc507220b28ff996717_l3.png?resize=42%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="42"/> just two years ago. What’s more is that they found <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11968">the algorithm (and proof)</a> from The Book! Let me explain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Convex body chasing</strong></p>
<p>In convex body chasing an online algorithm is presented at each time step with a convex body <img alt="K_t \subset \mathbb{R}^d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3fdc69e932e1950b410306bf5e91f317_l3.png?resize=65%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="65"/>, and it must choose a point <img alt="x_t \in K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-dcddd0271254f09cb70e59f7636af336_l3.png?resize=58%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="58"/>. The online algorithm is trying to minimize its total movement, namely <img alt="\sum_{t \geq 0} \|x_{t+1} - x_{t}\|" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="21" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ac0ba40fd0d872561b9bbfe0c2430fa6_l3.png?resize=132%2C21&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="132"/> (all the norms here will be Euclidean, for simplicity). To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, one benchmarks it against the smallest movement one could achieve for this sequence of bodies, if one knew in advance the whole sequence. A good example to have in mind is if the sequence <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> corresponds to lines rotating around some fixed point, then the best thing to do is to move to this fixed point and never move again, while a greedy algorithm might have infinite movement (in the continuous time limit). The competitive ratio is the worst case (over all possible sequences of convex bodies) ratio of the algorithm’s performance to those of the oracle optimum. This problem was introduced in 1993 by Linial and Friedman, mainly motivated by considering a more geometric version of the <a class="liimagelink" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2017/12/16/k-server-part-1-online-learning-and-online-algorithms/"><img alt="k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>-server problem</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this problem in fact has a lot of “real” applications. It is not too surprising given how elementary the problem is. Just to give a flavor, <a class="liexternal" href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/">Adam Wierman</a> and friends show that <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.caia.swin.edu.au/cv/landrew/pubs/capacity_provision_ToN.pdf">dynamic powering of data centers</a> can be viewed as an instance of convex *function* chasing. In convex function chasing, instead of a convex body one gets a convex function <img alt="f_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9bdb4107531e167960c3d7ea0ac6c6e3_l3.png?resize=14%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/>, and there is then a movement cost <img alt="\|x_t - x_{t-1}\|" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="19" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a5c985c7efa58f7b4fc27244d6ceecab_l3.png?resize=85%2C19&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="85"/> and a *service cost* <img alt="f_t(x_t)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9a9f0c7799e133ea6e52dce0ee96f00f_l3.png?resize=43%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="43"/>. While this is more general than convex body chasing, it turns out that convex body chasing in dimension <img alt="d+1" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c9bf571295c1727c51ef654b528967d2_l3.png?resize=39%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="39"/> is enough to solve convex function chasing in dimension <img alt="d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> (this is left to the reader as an exercise). Roughly speaking in dynamic power management, one controls various power levels (number of servers online, etc), and a request correspond to a new set of jobs. Turning on/off servers has an associated cost (the movement cost), while servicing the jobs with a certain number of servers has an associated delay (the service cost). You get the idea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Steiner point</strong></p>
<p>In <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00999">a paper</a> to appear at SODA too, we propose (with <a class="liexternal" href="http://yintat.com/">Yin Tat Lee</a>, <a class="liinternal" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~yuanzhil/">Yuanzhi Li</a>, <a class="liinternal" href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/klartag/home">Bo’az Klartag</a>, and <a class="liexternal" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~msellke/main">Mark Sellke</a>) to use the <strong>Steiner point</strong> for the nested convex body chasing problem. In nested convex body chasing the sequence of bodies is nested, and to account for irrelevant additive constant we assume that the oracle optimum starts from the worst point in the starting set <img alt="K_0" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-145ecd5f60fadeca35a63e23997d92f2_l3.png?resize=22%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="22"/>. In other words, opt is starting at the point the furthest away in <img alt="K_0" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-145ecd5f60fadeca35a63e23997d92f2_l3.png?resize=22%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="22"/> from the closest point in <img alt="K_T" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c59edf016e3136f9eb4e117bb8f69221_l3.png?resize=25%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>, so its movement is exactly equal to the <a class="liinternal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance" rel="nofollow">Hausdorff distance</a> between <img alt="K_0" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-145ecd5f60fadeca35a63e23997d92f2_l3.png?resize=22%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="22"/> and <img alt="K_T" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c59edf016e3136f9eb4e117bb8f69221_l3.png?resize=25%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>. So all we have to do is to give an online algorithm whose movement is proportional to this Hausdorff distance. Some kind of Lipschitzness in Hausdorff distance. Well, it turns out that mathematicians have been looking at this for centuries already, and Steiner back in the 1800’s introduced just what we need: a <strong>selector</strong> (a map from convex sets to points in them, i.e. <img alt="S(K) \in K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9a5879256c4564abf0f19723bdcbd0f2_l3.png?resize=80%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="80"/> for any convex set <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/>) which is Lipschitz with respect to the Hausdorff distance, that is:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 21px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[ \|S(K) - S(K')\| \leq L \cdot \mathrm{dist}_H(K,K') \,. \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="21" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-88bc573a98d3513706bc117297bfc04e_l3.png?resize=281%2C21&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="281"/></p>
<p>Note that obtaining such a selector is not trivial, for example the first natural guess would be the center of gravity, but it turns out that this is <strong>not</strong> Lipschitz (consider for example what happens with <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/> being a very thin triangle and <img alt="K'" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="14" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b063268581b06951ebc5637f21fad0fd_l3.png?resize=20%2C14&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> being the base of this triangle). Crazy thing is, this Steiner point selector (to be defined shortly) is not only Lipschitz, it is in fact <strong>the most Lipschitz selector</strong> for convex sets. How would you prove such a thing? Well, you clearly need a miracle to happen, and the miracle here is that the Steiner point satisfies some symmetries, which define it uniquely. From there all you need to do is that starting with any selector, you can add some of these symmetries while also improving the Lipschitz constant (for more on this see the references in the linked paper above).</p>
<p>OK, so what is the Steiner point? It has many definitions, but a particular appealing one from an optimizer’s viewpoint is as follows. For a convex set <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/> and a vector <img alt="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-24a3864c0a0fdb33b8b28c5c9e29f616_l3.png?resize=51%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="51"/> let <img alt="g_K(\theta)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d1ee2708d01f3d597e257c20c654f8bc_l3.png?resize=43%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="43"/> be the maximizer of the linear function <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/> in the set <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/>. Then the Steiner point of <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/>, <img alt="\mathrm{St}(K)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-47dba33d5bf995134c83d02ac5b3b458_l3.png?resize=46%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="46"/> is defined by:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 21px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[ \mathrm{St}(K) = \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| \leq 1} [g_K(\theta)] \,. \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="21" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1ed1a61ff1d6b62cd71a620f8bdeebb5_l3.png?resize=193%2C21&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="193"/></p>
<p>In words: for any direction take the furthest point in <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/> in that direction, and average over all directions. This feels like a really nice object, and clearly it satisfies <img alt="\mathrm{St}(K) \in K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0600d9b6a7b40aa047e56d5b11f0f0d3_l3.png?resize=85%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="85"/> (i.e., it is a selector). The algorithm we proposed in our SODA paper is simply to move to <img alt="x_t = \mathrm{St}(K_t)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-07cd7d19d64122c29f27b6976bbe68f2_l3.png?resize=90%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="90"/>. Let us now see how to analyze this algorithm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The nested case proof</strong></p>
<p>First we give an alternative formula for the Steiner point.

Thus using the <a class="liinternal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem" rel="nofollow">divergence theorem</a> one obtains:</p>

<p>Now we have the following one-line inequality to control the movement of the Steiner point:</p>

<p>This proves that the Steiner point is <img alt="d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/>-competitive for nested convex body chasing. How to generalize this to the non-nested case seemed difficult, and the breakthrough of Mark and the CMU team is to bring back an old friend of the online algorithm community: the work function.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The work function</strong></p>
<p>The work function <img alt="W_t : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c06617c85ba7669c6be3e632519a2dec_l3.png?resize=99%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="99"/> is defined as follows.

First observe that this function is convex.

In the definition of the work function there is an associated trajectory for both <img alt="x" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1b9fbfb207b6d17d74b33c6d8342a1a4_l3.png?resize=10%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> and <img alt="y" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0e13c52c4764efa3f5b1e98e3c2cf98a_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>. By convexity of the requests, the sequence of mid points between those two trajectories is a valid trajectory for <img alt="z" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d9d772a59543419785ce66946592259a_l3.png?resize=9%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>! And moreover the movement of this mid trajectory is (by triangle inequality) less than the average of the movement of the trajectory for <img alt="x" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1b9fbfb207b6d17d74b33c6d8342a1a4_l3.png?resize=10%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> and <img alt="y" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0e13c52c4764efa3f5b1e98e3c2cf98a_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>.

<p>A very simple property we will need from the work function is that the norm of its gradient carries some information on the current request.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Sellke point</strong></p>
<p>Mark’s beautiful idea (and the CMU team very much related –in fact equivalent– idea) to generalize the Steiner point to the non-nested case is to use the work function as a surrogate for the request. Steiner of <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> will clearly not work since all of <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> does not matter in the same way, as some points might be essentially irrelevant because they are very far from the previous requests, a fact which will be uncovered by the work function (while on the other hand the random direction from the Steiner point definition is oblivious to the geometry of the previous requests). So how to pick an appropriately random point in <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> while respecting the work function structure? Well we just saw that <img alt="\|\nabla W_t(x)\| &lt; 1 \Rightarrow x \in K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="19" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d5613103c6538abdfe07fb8a6f0bdf73_l3.png?resize=189%2C19&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="189"/>. So how about taking a random direction <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>, and applying the inverse of the gradient map, namely the gradient of the <strong>Fenchel dual</strong> <img alt="W_t^*" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="17" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef52bfe9fd84a48a8585c0d4cc7445c5_l3.png?resize=25%2C17&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>? Recall that the Fenchel dual is defined by:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 29px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[ W_t^*(\theta) = \max_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} \theta \cdot x - W_t(x) \,. \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="29" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-38f4e45e13b56402f2542d6d10104c23_l3.png?resize=216%2C29&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="216"/></p>
<p>This is exactly the algorithm Mark proposes and it goes like this (Mark calls it the *functional Steiner point*):</p>

<p>Crucially this is a valid point, namely <img alt="\mathrm{Se}(K_t) \in K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-4a1a15b2c69480b3c0cad98acf3b2ad9_l3.png?resize=94%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="94"/>. Moreover just like for the Steiner point we can apply the divergence theorem and obtain:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 22px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[ \mathrm{Se}(K_t) = d \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [\theta W_t^*(\theta)] \,. \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="22" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-329630ec5ed1634f7880d91ce9666807_l3.png?resize=235%2C22&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="235"/></p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that we can now <strong>exactly</strong> repeat the nested convex body argument, since <img alt="W_{t+1}^*(\theta) \leq W_t^*(\theta)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="21" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3dd6961afcbaae41b54d8e7651b9cd94_l3.png?resize=135%2C21&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="135"/> for all <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/> (just like we had in the nested case <img alt="h_{K_{t+1}}(\theta) \leq h_{K_t}(\theta)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="21" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f34e37633e4a00d3fa90457f5a676ef7_l3.png?resize=139%2C21&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="139"/>) and so we get:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 40px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[ \sum_{t \geq 0} \|\mathrm{Se}(K_t) - \mathrm{Se}(K_{t+1})\| \leq d \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [ W_{0}^*(\theta) - W^*_{{T}}(\theta) ] \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="40" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-593f9a9e90a2740715be744ac89275ac_l3.png?resize=426%2C40&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="426"/></p>
<p>The first term with <img alt="W_0^*" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-03b6bb14cb85145aa8efb2ba6b6fba23_l3.png?resize=25%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/> is just some additive constant which we can ignore, while the second term is bounded as follows:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 105px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\begin{align*} \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [ - W^*_{{T}}(\theta) ] &amp; = \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [ \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} W_t(x) - \theta \cdot x ] \\ &amp; \leq \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1}[ W_t(x) - \theta \cdot x ] \\ &amp; = \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} W_t(x) \,. \end{align*}" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="105" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f7d98d503b4ecd2f79bb081ccddccceb_l3.png?resize=364%2C105&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="364"/></p>
<p>Thus we exactly proved that the movement of the Sellke point is upped bounded by a constant plus <img alt="d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> times the minimum of the work function, and the latter is nothing but the value of the oracle optimum!</p>
<p>Note that once everything is done and said, the proof has only <strong>two</strong> inequalities (triangle inequality as in the nested case, and the minimum of the expectation is less than the expectation of the minimum). It doesn’t get any better than this!</p></div>

    <title>TR19-149 |  Log-Seed Pseudorandom Generators via Iterated Restrictions | 

	Dean Doron, 

	William Hoza, 

	Pooya Hatami</title>
    <summary>There are only a few known general approaches for constructing explicit pseudorandom generators (PRGs). The ``iterated restrictions'' approach, pioneered by Ajtai and Wigderson [AW89], has provided PRGs with seed length $\mathrm{polylog} n$ or even $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ for several restricted models of computation. Can this approach ever achieve the optimal seed length of $O(\log n)$?

In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative. Using the iterated restrictions approach, we construct an explicit PRG for read-once depth-$2$ $\mathbf{AC}^0[\oplus]$ formulas with seed length $O(\log n) + \tilde{O}(\log(1/\epsilon))$. In particular, our PRG achieves optimal seed length $O(\log n)$ with near-optimal error $\epsilon = \exp(-\tilde{\Omega} (\log n))$. Even for constant error, the best prior PRG for this model (which includes read-once CNFs and read-once $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomials) has seed length $\Theta(\log n \cdot (\log \log n)^2)$ [Lee19]. 

A key step in the analysis of our PRG is a tail bound for subset-wise symmetric polynomials, a generalization of elementary symmetric polynomials. Like elementary symmetric polynomials, subset-wise symmetric polynomials provide a way to organize the expansion of $\prod_{i = 1}^m (1 + y_i)$. Elementary symmetric polynomials simply organize the terms by degree, i.e., they keep track of the number of variables participating in each monomial. Subset-wise symmetric polynomials keep track of more data: for a fixed partition of $[m]$, they keep track of the number of variables from each subset participating in each monomial. Our tail bound extends prior work by Gopalan and Yehudayoff [GY14] on elementary symmetric polynomials.</summary>

    <title>Limits of using the web for info- self-reference</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(I wrote this a while back so when I say `I Googled BLAH' I meant back then. It is prob different now.)<br/>
<br/>
While the web is a <i>wonderful</i> to find things out there are times when it doesn't quite work.  <br/>
<ol>
<li> An old blog of Scott Aaronson's  had as part of its title <a href="http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=240">a Woitian Link</a>. Wanting to find out what <i>a Woitian Link</i> is but not wanting to bother Scott (he's busy enough making comments on Shtetl-Optimized) I went to google and typed in <i>"Woitian Link"</i>. The ONLY hits I got back were to Scotts blog. I finally had to email Scott. He told me that it was referring to the blog <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress">not even wrong</a> by Peter Woit which often has links that... Well, Scott never told me quite what it was but I'll go there myself and try to figure it out.<br/>
</li>
<li> An old blog of mine was <a href="http://weblog.fortnow.com/2007/05/man-who-loved-algorithms.html">the man who loved algorithms</a>. Part of my blog said that I thought the man would be Knuth but it was not. (It was Thomas Kailath) One of the commenters said that it couldn't be Knuth since he was still alive. This made me want to check the original article to see if  Thomas Kailath, is also still alive (he is). I didn't have the issue with me at the time so I typed "the man who loved algorithms" into google. The first page of hits all refered to my posting.  Eventually I found one to verify that yes, indeed, he was still alive.<br/>
</li>
<li> Donald Knuth VOLUME FOUR was originally published in a series of fascicile's. Whats a fascicle? Here the web was helpful- Wikipedia said it was a book that comes out in short pieces, the pieces of which are called `fascicle'. They gave only one example: <i>Donald Knuth's Volume 4 will be coming out in Fascicle.</i> Still, they DID tell me what I want to know. (Note- this was a while back, they have since removed that comment.) For most things the web is great. But for some more obscure things, better off asking someone who knows stuff. </li>
</ol>
<div>
Do you have experiences where you ask the web for a question and you end up in a circle?</div></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Last month was a lean month, with only three papers: one on direct product testing,  one on finding forbidden patterns in a sequence, and one (an update of a paper which we had missed in the Spring) on quantum distribution testing.</p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Direct sum testing – the general case</strong>, by Irit Dinur and Konstantin Golubev (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/139/">ECCC</a>). Say a function \(f\colon \prod_{i=1}^d [n_i] \to \mathbb{F}_2\) is a direct product if it can be factored as \(f(x_1,\dots,x_d)=\sum_{i=1}^d f_i(x_i)\), where \(f_i\colon [n_i]\to\mathbb{F}_2\).<br/>This paper provides a 4-query tester (i.e., a <em>proximity oblivious tester</em> (POT)) for the direct product property, reminiscent of (and relying on) the BLR linearity test: specifically, draw two subsets \(S,T\subseteq [d]\) and two inputs \(x,y\in \prod_{i=1}^d [n_i]\) u.a.r., and accept iff<br/>\(f(x)+f(x_Sy)+f(x_Ty)+f(x_{S\Delta T}y) = 0\,.\)<br/>The main theorem of the paper is to show that the probability that this simple test rejects is lower bounded (up to a constant factor) by the distance of \(f\) to direct-product-ness. (The authors also provide a different POT making \(d+1\) queries, but with a simpler analysis.)</p>



<p><strong>Finding monotone patterns in sublinear time</strong>, by Omri Ben-Eliezer, Clément Canonne, Shoham Letzter, and Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/134/">ECCC</a>). Given a function \(f\colon [n]\to\mathbb{R}\), a <em>monotone subsequence</em> of size \(k\) is a \(k\)-tuple of indices \(i_1 &lt; \dots &lt;i_k\) such that \(f(i_j) &lt; f(i_{j+1})\) for all \(j\). This work considers (non-adaptive) one-sided testing of monotone-subsequence-freeness, or, equivalently, the task of <em>finding</em> such a monotone subsequence in a function promised to contain many of them. (This, in particular, generalizes the problem of one-sided monotonicity testing, which is the case \(k=2\).) The main result is a full characterization of the query complexity of this question (for constant \(k\)): strange as the exponent may seem, \(\Theta_\varepsilon( (\log n)^{\lfloor \log_2 k\rfloor} )\) queries are necessary and sufficient. The  proof relies on a structural dichotomy result, stating that any  far-from-free sequence either contains “easy to find” increasing  subsequences with increasing gaps between the elements, or has a specific hierarchical structure.</p>



<p><strong>Quantum Closeness Testing: A Streaming Algorithm and Applications</strong>, by Nengkun Yu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03218">arXiv</a>). This paper is concerned with quantum distribution testing in the <em>local</em> model, which only allows a very restricted (albeit, as the author argues, more natural and easier to implement) type of measurements, and is particularly well-suited to a streaming setting. The main contribution of this paper is to show a connection to <em>classical</em> distribution testing, allowing one to obtain quantum distribution testing upper bounds from their classical distribution testing counterparts. In more detail, the paper shows that, from local measurements to two \(d\)-dimensional quantum states \(\rho,\sigma\), one can provide access to two classical distributions \(p,q\) on \(\approx d^2\) elements such that (i) \(\| p-q\|_2 \approx \|\rho-\sigma\|_2/d\) and (ii) \(\| p\|_2,\| q\|_2 = O(1/d)\).<br/>Using this connection, the paper proceeds to establish a variety of upper bounds for testing several distribution properties in the local quantum model.</p></div>

    <title>Call for opinions: Length of papes in conference proceedings in TCS</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As current chair of the editorial board of <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/lipics/">LIPIcs, Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics</a>, I have been looking at some data about the length of the papers published in the series. The average length of the articles published in LIPIcs in 2019 so far is of 15.8 pages, including front matter and bibliography. However, three of the published papers are over 40 pages and three conferences have an average article length above 20 pages (22,  23.9 and 28.4, respectively).<br/><br/>I have seen that some conferences in TCS have no limit on the length of the submitted papers. A colleague whose opinions I hold in high esteem wrote to me saying: <br/><blockquote>Some people in the "conference name removed" community strongly feel there should be no page limit. My opinion may not be as strong as some, but I believe these people have a point. </blockquote><blockquote>Whether we like it or not, most papers in the TOC community only appear in conferences. Many of those conferences have no page limit for submissions, and encourage authors to include all proofs while making sure that the key ideas are presented in the first 10 pages or so. Scientific progress is hindered when authors are then forced to take out parts of their writeups for the conference proceedings in order for their papers to fit within the page limits. One may wish that they'd publish a full version of their paper in a journal subsequently, but most of them won't bother. The net effect is that there is no actual paper with all the details, which is no good. </blockquote>I share the point made in the last sentence, but I am somewhat bothered by the fact that full versions of papers in TCS are increasingly not being submitted to journals. I am probably very old fashioned, but I feel that it is desirable to see our published results vetted by a journal-strength review process. I still view conferences as means for the rapid dissemination of results and as a meeting point for their community of reference, and I consider journals as the media for final archival publication of mature pieces of research. However, with my LIPIcs EB chair hat on and out of personal interest, I am keen to hear your opinion on whether it is good for the TCS community to publish only in conferences and to publish conference papers without page limits, bearing in mind that, quoting from the <a href="http://focs2019.cs.jhu.edu/cfp/">FOCS 2019 call for papers</a>:<br/><blockquote>Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the title page, references, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee’s discretion.  </blockquote>I'd be grateful if you could post your thoughts on this matter in the comment section. Let's focus on what is best for the dissemination of science, even though long articles are more expensive than those whose average length is around 15 pages.<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing your opinions. Thanks in advance!<br/><br/></div>

    <title>TR19-148 |  Simultaneous Max-Cut is harder to approximate than Max-Cut | 

	Amey Bhangale, 

	Subhash Khot</title>
    <summary>A systematic study of simultaneous optimization of constraint satisfaction problems was initiated in [BKS15]. The simplest such problem is the simultaneous Max-Cut. [BKKST18] gave a $.878$-minimum approximation algorithm for simultaneous Max-Cut which is {\em almost optimal} assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). For a single instance Max-Cut, [GW95] gave an $\alpha_{GW}$-approximation algorithm where $\alpha_{GW}\approx .87856720...$ which is {\em optimal} assuming the UGC.

It was left open whether one can achieve an $\alpha_{GW}$-minimum approximation algorithm for simultaneous Max-Cut. We answer the question by showing that there exists an absolute constant $\varepsilon_0\geq 10^{-5}$ such that it is NP-hard to get an $(\alpha_{GW}- \varepsilon_0)$-minimum approximation for simultaneous Max-Cut assuming the UGC.</summary>

    <title>TR19-147 |  Capacity-Approaching Deterministic Interactive Coding Schemes Against Adversarial Errors | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Shahar Samocha</title>
    <summary>We devise a deterministic interactive coding scheme with rate $1-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon\log(1/\varepsilon)})$ against $\varepsilon$-fraction of adversarial errors. The rate we obtain is tight by a result of Kol and Raz (STOC 2013). Prior to this work, deterministic coding schemes for any constant fraction $\varepsilon&gt;0$ of adversarial errors could obtain rate no larger than $1/2$. Achieving higher rate was obtained either using probabilistic coding schemes by Haeupler (FOCS 2014) or otherwise assumed weaker error models such as binary symmetric channels, erasure channels or feedback channels.</summary>

Paul Painlevé was a French mathematician who specialized in classical mechanics. He is known for a conjecture in 1895 about anomalies in Isaac Newton’s equations that was proved in 1988.</p>
<p>
Tonight, Ken and I celebrate Halloween with some mathematical horrors that may have real physical consequences.</p>
<p>
Painlevé is also known for having been Prime Minister of France for two short stints in 1917 and 1925. He was also Minister of War under President Raymond Poincaré, a cousin of Henri Poincaré. He was the first Frenchman in powered flight—alongside Wilbur Wright in 1908—and at the end of his life headed the French Air Force. </p>
<p>
A basic fact about Newtonian gravity is that the gravitational potential energy of two point masses <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> and <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/> is proportional to </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  -\frac{mM}{R}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++-%5Cfrac%7BmM%7D%7BR%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  -\frac{mM}{R}, "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> is the distance between them. We usually think of how gravity becomes weaker as <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> grows but when <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> is tiny it becomes quite strong. Since the potential is negative, it is possible for an individual particle in a finite <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-body system to accelerate to arbitrary speed without violating the conservation of energy. But can it happen in a finite amount of time—and without <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> actually becoming zero in a collision? </p>
<p>
Painlevé proved a ‘no’ answer for <img alt="{n = 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 3}"/> but suspected ‘yes’ for <img alt="{n \geq 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n \geq 4}"/>. Zhihong Xia proved in 1988 it can happen for <img alt="{n = 5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 5}"/>, extending earlier advances by his thesis advisor, Donald Saari. The case <img alt="{n = 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 4}"/> is still open; in all cases, the initial conditions for it to happen form a measure-zero subset of the configuration space. </p>
<p>
The difference from <img alt="{n = 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 3}"/> is shown by this diagram from their 1995 <em>AMS Notices</em> <a href="http://copernico.dm.unipi.it/~gronchi/PDF/didattica/2006_07/mecc_sup/inf.pdf">paper</a>, which has a greatly understandable telling of the whole story. We, however, envision a fantasy story about what could have happened much earlier.</p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Fantasy </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We want to imagine that Xia’s result was proved not near the end of the 20th century but near the start—in particular, before Albert Einstein’s creation of General Relativity, but after Special Relativity. Say the result was obtained in 1908 by Painlevé after his flight with Wright. That same year, Hugo von Zeipold proved a startling consequence of Painlevé’s conjecture, which we now know to be a theorem:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Under Newtonian gravity, a <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-body set of point masses can eject a particle to infinity in finite time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
That is, without collisions, a Newtonian <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-body problem of point masses can create separations <img alt="{R'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R'}"/> between particles that grow to infinity within a finite time. Saari and Xia say that the effect can be partially seen if you do the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Place a tennis ball on top of a basketball and drop the pair from chest height. The tennis ball rebound is pretty dramatic—enough so that it should be done outside. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Ken tried it and it works. It does not work so well if the tennis ball is replaced by a piece of Halloween candy. If the basketball is replaced by a pumpkin, it definitely will not work.</p>
<p>
We know already, however, from Einstein’s theory of special relativity that it cannot work. We would have an instant before the singular time at which the point mass has just passed the speed of light. At that time it has acquired infinite energy according to special relativity, but cannot have withdrawn it from the potential by then. </p>
<p>
In 1908 this would have been an internal indication that Newton’s theory of gravity must break down. There were of course external indicators, such as the theory’s incorrect prediction of the orbit of Mercury. Maybe internal ones were known, but this seems most glaring in retrospect. Are we right in this interpretation? The result by Xia is shocking enough as it stands, and makes us wonder what other surprises lurk in equations.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> It Could End With a Bang </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Other possibilities of singularities happening within finite time have not been ruled out by any physical theories. The New York Times Magazine in July 2015 ran a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-singular-mind-of-terry-tao.html">profile</a> titled “The Singular Mind of Terry Tao” with a great opening sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This April, as undergraduates strolled along the street outside his modest office on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles, the mathematician Terence Tao mused about the possibility that water could spontaneously explode. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Indeed, Tao <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/finite-time-blowup-for-an-averaged-three-dimensional-navier-stokes-equation/">proved</a> it can happen under a plausible modification of the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics. He writes there:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Intriguingly, the method of proof in fact hints at a possible route to establishing blowup for the true Navier-Stokes equations, which I am now increasingly inclined to believe is the case (albeit for a very small set of initial data). </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
As with Painlevé’s conjecture—Xia’s theorem—the point would be not that the initial conditions could happen with any perceptible probability, but that our world is capable of their happening at all. At least, that is, with the equations by which we describe our world. Our own <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/01/04/mathematics-its-about-the-future/">mention</a> at the start of 2015 alluded to the possibility of Tao’s blowup applying to fluid-like fields in cosmological theories.</p>
<p>
Just last week, a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/10/18/dark-matters-biggest-problem-might-simply-be-a-numerical-error/#167c398d8979">column</a> on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/">Starts With a Bang</a> blog alerted us to an issue with equations that could be skewing cosmological theories today. The blog is written by Ethan Siegel for <em>Forbes</em> and its items are linked regularly on <a href="https://www.realclearscience.com/">RealClear Science</a>. Siegel draws an analogy to a phenomenon with Fourier series that feeds into things Dick and I (Ken writing this part) have already been thinking about. Things used all the time in theory…</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Hobgoblins You Can Hear </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The Fourier phenomenon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon">named</a> for the American physicist Josiah Gibbs, but Gibbs was not the original discoverer. We could add this to our old <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/04/08/why-is-everything-named-after-gauss/">post</a> on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler's_law_of_eponymy">law</a> named for Stephen Stigler, who did not discover it, that no scientific law is named for its original discoverer. The first discoverer of the Gibbs Phenomenon was—evidently—Henry Wilbraham in 1848. Through the magic of the Internet we can convey it by lifting Wilbraham’s original figure straight from his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JrQ4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">paper</a>:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/wilbrahamfigure.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-16359" height="385" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/wilbrahamfigure.png?w=365&amp;h=385" width="365"/></a></p>
<p>
What this shows is the convergence of a sum of sine waves to a square wave. The convergence is pointwise except at the jump discontinuities <img alt="{x = t\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+t%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x = t\pi}"/>, but it is not uniform. The <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>-values do not converge on any interval crossing <img alt="{t\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t\pi}"/> but instead rise about <img alt="{18\%}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B18%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{18\%}"/> above the square wave function value <img alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x)}"/> in the vicinity of <img alt="{t\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t\pi}"/>, no matter how many terms are summed in the approximations <img alt="{f_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_n}"/>. Wilbraham’s middle drawing depicts this in finer detail than any other rendering I have found. The persistent overshoot is physically real—it is the cause of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_artifacts">ringing</a> artifacts in signal processing.</p>
<p>
Now the convergence does satisfy a criterion of <b><img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/>-approximation</b> of a function <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> that we use all the time in theory: for any <img alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0}"/> and large enough <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>, <img alt="{|f_n(x) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7Cf_n%28x%29+-+f%28x%29%7C+%3C+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{|f_n(x) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon}"/> except for an <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/> fraction of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> in the domain. This kind of convergence is used internally in the proofs of quantum algorithms for linear algebra which we recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/26/quantum-switch-em/">discussed</a>. If the value <img alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x)}"/> is explicitly what you’re after, this is fine. But if you use the value only implicitly while composing the approximation with some other function <img alt="{g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g}"/>, you must beware that the compositions <img alt="{g_n = g\circ f_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg_n+%3D+g%5Ccirc+f_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g_n = g\circ f_n}"/> are not thrown off in a constant way by the overshoots.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Dark Matter in Shadows? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Siegel draws attention to what is alleged as something similar actually happening to current physical theories that use a well-known class of algorithmic simulations. The details are in a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03088v2">paper</a> by Anton Baushev and Sergey Pilipenko, titled “The central cusps in dark matter halos: fact or fiction?” To show the relation between this and the opening example in this post, we need only quote the paper (page 2)—</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> However, the present state-of-art of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-body simulation tests … can hardly be named adequate. The commonly-used criterion of the convergence of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-body simulations in the halo center is solely the density profile stability [per which] the central cusp (close to <img alt="{\rho \propto r^{-1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho+%5Cpropto+r%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\rho \propto r^{-1}}"/>) is formed quite rapidly (<img alt="{t &lt; \tau_r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3C+%5Ctau_r%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t &lt; \tau_r}"/>). </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
—and then quote Siegel’s own description of the core-cusp problem and the allegation:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In theory, matter should fall into a gravitationally bound structure and undergo what’s known as violent relaxation, where a large number of interactions cause the heaviest-mass objects to fall towards the center (becoming more tightly bound) while the lower-mass ones get exiled to the outskirts (becoming more loosely bound) and can even get ejected entirely. </em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Since similar phenomena to the expectations of violent relaxation were seen in the simulations, and all the different simulations had these features, we assumed that they were representative of real physics. However, it’s also possible that they don’t represent real physics, but rather represent a numerical artifact inherent to the simulation itself. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is all this real physics? Or is it artifacts showing that current theories and/or algorithms are flawed? Whichever is the truth, our equations have tricks that may not lead to treats.</p>
<p>
For a relevant postscript, Painlevé did not abandon physics when he rose in politics. In 1921, he <a href="https://astromontgeron.fr/Painleve-article-english.pdf">effectively</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullstrand-Painleve_coordinates">removed</a> an apparent singularity at the event horizons of black holes in general relativity. He and colleagues <a href="https://astromontgeron.fr/Painleve-article-english.pdf">discussed</a> this with Einstein the following year, but apparently not the <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-body conjecture. How far are we right in our interpretation that the (proved) conjecture plus special relativity suffices to disprove Newtonian gravity by itself?</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>by Naman Agarwal, Karan Singh and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">this paper</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05062">this paper</a>. </em></p>
<p>The mainstream thought in classical control operates under the simplifying principle that nature evolves according to well-specified dynamics perturbed by i.i.d. Gaussian noise, a field called <b>Optimal Control</b>. While this principle has proven very successful in some real world systems, it does not lend itself to the construction of truly <b>robust</b> controllers. In the real world one can expect all sorts of deviations from this setting, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherent correlations between perturbations across time due to the environment.</li>
<li>Modeling misspecification, which can introduce unforeseeable, non-stochastic deviations from the assumed dynamics.</li>
<li>Completely adversarial perturbations introduced by a malicious entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, in the world of classical supervised learning, the presence of the above factors has led to the adoption of <a href="https://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">online learning</a> in lieu of statistical learning, which allows for robust noise models and game-theoretic / strategic learning. A natural question arises: <i>what is the analogue of online learning and worst-case regret in robust control? </i></p>
<h2>Linear Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control</h2>
<p>Dynamical systems constitute the formalism to describe time-dependent, dynamic real-world phenomenon, ranging from fluid flow through a pipe, the movement of a pendulum, to the change of weather. The archetypal example here is a linear dynamical system, which permits a particularly intuitive interpretation as a (configurable) vector field (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system">wikipedia</a>):</p>
<p><img alt="" height="158" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null.png?w=624&amp;h=158" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>A linear dynamical system (LDS) posits the state of a system evolves via the following dynamical relation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+Ax_t+%2B+Bu_t+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t"/></p>

<p>Here <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t"/> represents the state of the system, <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> represents a control input and <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> is a perturbation introduced to the dynamics, for the time step t. The vector fields above illustrate the behavior of the system for a few different choices of A, when the control input <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> is set to zero. The control inputs, when correctly chosen, can modify the dynamics to induce a particular desired behavior. For example, controlling the thermostat in a data center to achieve a particular temperature, applying a force to a pendulum to keep it upright, or driving a drone to a destination.</p>
<p>The goal of the controller is to produce a sequence of control actions <img alt="u_1 \ldots u_T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_1+%5Cldots+u_T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_1 \ldots u_T"/> aimed at minimizing the cumulative loss <img alt="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_t+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)"/>. In classical control the loss functions are convex quadratics and known ahead of time. However, in the quest for more robust controllers, henceforth we will consider a broader class of general (possibly non-quadratic) convex cost functions, which may be adversarially chosen, and only be revealed online per-time-step to the controller.</p>
<h2>Previous notions: LQR and H-infinity control</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most fundamental setting in control theory is a LDS is with quadratic costs <img alt="c_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t"/> and i.i.d Gaussian perturbations <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>. The solution known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear&#x2013;quadratic_regulator">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a>, derived by solving the Riccati equation, is well understood and corresponds to a linear policy (i.e. the control input is a linear function of the state).</p>
<p>The assumption of i.i.d perturbations has been relaxed in classical control theory, with the introduction of a min-max notion, in a subfield known as <a href="https://stephentu.github.io/blog/h-infinity-control/2018/07/01/hinf-optimal-control-dynamic-games.html"><img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control</a>. Informally, the idea behind <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control is to design a controller which performs well against <i>all </i>sequences of bounded perturbations. There are two shortcomings of this approach; firstly computing such a controller can be a difficult optimization problem in itself. While a closed form for such a controller is known for linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, no such form is known when costs can be non-quadratic. Secondly and perhaps more importantly, the min-max notion is non-adaptive and hence often too pessimistic. It is possible that during the execution of the system, nature produces a <i>benign (predictable)</i> sequence of perturbations (say, for instance, the perturbations are, in truth, highly correlated). The <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> controller in this setting could be overly pessimistic and lead to a higher cost than what could be achieved via a potentially more adaptive controller. This motivates our approach of minimizing regret, which we describe next.</p>
<h2>A less pessimistic metric: Policy regret</h2>
<p>Our starting point for more robust control is regret minimization in games. Regret minimization is a well-accepted metric in online learning, and we consider applying it to online control.</p>
<p>Formally, we measure the efficacy of a controller through the following notion of <i>policy </i>regret.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BRegret%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bt%7D+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29+-+%5Cmin_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bstable+%7D+K%7D+c_t%28x_t%28K%29%2C+-Kx_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)"/></p>
<p>Here in, <img alt="x_t(K)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t%28K%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t(K)"/> represents the state encountered when executing the linear policy $K$. In particular, the second term represents the total cost paid by the best(in hindsight) stable linear policy had it executed in the system facing the same sequence of perturbations as the controller. In this regard the above notion of regret is <b>counterfactual</b> and hence more challenging than the more common stateless notion of regret.<br/>
(Remark: a <span style="font-weight: 400;">stable linear policy K is one which ensures that the spectral radius of  A-BK is strictly less than one. For a formal quantitative definition, please see the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, the choice of comparing to a linear policy is made keeping tractability in mind. Note that this nevertheless generalizes the standard Linear Quadratic Regulator and <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control on Linear Dynamical Systems, as the optimal choice of controllers in those settings is indeed a linear policy (if the cost functions are quadratic, our setting allows more general loss functions).</p>
<p>Algorithms which achieve low regret on the above objective are naturally adaptive as they perform as well as the best controller (upto a negligible additive regret) oblivious to whether the sequence is <i>friendly </i>or <i>adversarial. </i></p>
<h2>A new type of controller</h2>
<p>In successive recent works (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1] </a>and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05062">[2]</a>), we show that the above notion of policy regret is tractable and can be sublinear (even logarithmic under certain conditions). Using a new parameterization for controller that we detail next, we obtain the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Robustness to Adversarial Perturbations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1]</a>) – </b>For arbitrary, but bounded, perturbations $w_t$, which may even be chosen adversarially, we provide an efficient algorithm that achieves regret of <b><img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/></b>.</li>
<li><b>Fast Rates under Stochastic Perturbations (</b>[2]<b>) – </b>Further, for strongly convex costs, and i.i.d. perturbations, we give an efficient algorithm with a poly-logarithmic (in T) regret guarantee.</li>
</ul>
<p>The former result is the first such result to establish vanishing average regret in an online setting for control with adversarial perturbations. The latter result offers a significant improvement over the work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07104">Cohen et al. </a>who established a rate of <img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/> in a similar (stochastic) setting.</p>
<p>We assume that the dynamical system i.e. (A,B) is completely known to us and the state is fully observable. These assumptions have been eliminated in further work with our collaborators, and will be a subject of a future blog post. We now describe the core ideas which go into achieving both our results.</p>
<h2>The Gradient Perturbation Controller</h2>
<p>Consider how the choice of the linear controller determines the control input.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="120" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-1.png?w=624&amp;h=120" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>The above display demonstrates that the action, state, and hence the cost are <b>non-convex</b> functions of the linear controller K. The first piece of our result evades this lack of convexity by over-parametrization, ie. relaxing the notion of a linear policy as described next.</p>
<p>In place of learning a direct representation of a linear controller K, we learn a sequence of matrices <img alt="M_1, M_2 \ldots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%2C+M_2+%5Cldots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="M_1, M_2 \ldots "/> which represent the dependence of <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> on <img alt="w_{t - i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_%7Bt+-+i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_{t - i}"/> under the execution of some linear policy. Schematically, we parameterize our policy as follows</p>
<p><img alt="" height="62" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-2.png?w=624&amp;h=62" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Note that, the assumption that the dynamics is known permits the exact inference of <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>’s and thereby making the execution of such a controller possible. While the choice of the controller ensures that control inputs are linear in <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/>, the superposition principle for linear dynamical systems ensures that the state sequence too is linear in the same variables. Therefore, the cost of execution of such a controller parameterized via <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/> is convex and we can hope to learn them using standard techniques like Gradient Descent. Observe that, by construction, it is possible to emulate the behavior any linear controller K by a suitable choice of <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/>’s.</p>
<p>There are two barriers though. First, the number of parameters grows with time $T$ and so can regret and running time. Secondly, since there is a state, the decision a controller makes at a particular instance affects the future. We deal with these two problems formally in the paper and show how they may be circumvented. One of the important techniques we use is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Online Convex Optimization with Memory</a>.</p>
<p>With all the core components in place, we provide a brief specification of our algorithm. Let’s fix some memory length H, and a time step t. Define a proxy cost as</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)"/> =</p>
</td>
<td>Cost Paid at Time t, had we execute the policy <img alt="\{M_1, \ldots M_H\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_1, \ldots M_H\}"/> for t-H steps, with the system reset to 0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The algorithm now as suggested by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Anava, Hazan and Manor</a>, is to take a gradient step on the above proxy.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="29" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-3.png?w=624&amp;h=29" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>The above algorithm achieves <img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/> regret against <b>worst-case</b> noise. For the full proof and the precise derivation of the algorithm, check out the paper.</p>
<h2>Achieving Logarithmic Regret</h2>
<p>Algorithms for (state-less) online learning often enjoy logarithmic regret guarantees in the presence of strongly convex loss functions. Prima facie, one could hope that for dynamical systems with strongly convex costs, such a stronger regret guarantee would hold. The cautionary note here is that <b>strong convexity of the cost <img alt="c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(x_t, u_t)"/> in the control input does not imply strong convexity in the controller representation</b>.,</p>
<p>In fact, the strong convexity of our proxy cost function <img alt="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)"/> in its natural parameterization over M’s is further hindered by the fact that the space of M’s constitutes a highly over-parametrized representation (say, vs. K). Indeed in the case of adversarial perturbations, it is easy to construct a case where the strong convexity does not transfer over from the control to the controller.</p>
<p>In a future blog post we detail how this technical difficulty can be overcome using the natural gradient method, giving rise to a logarithmic regret algorithm for control.</p>
<h2>Experimental Validation</h2>
<p>Below we provide empirical evaluations of the GPC controller in various scenarios, demonstrating it is indeed more robust to correlated noise than previous notions. <b>(All the plots below are produced by a new research-first control and time series library in the works — Alpha version scheduled to be released soon! STAY TUNED!!!) </b></p>
<p>To start, let’s reproduce the classical setting of controlling an LDS with i.i.d. Gaussian noise. Here, the LQR program is <i>optimal</i>. Yet, the plot below attests that our new control methodology offers a slightly suboptimal, yet comparable, performance. This observation also underlines the message the the proposed controller tracks the optimal controller without any foreknowledge of the structure of the perturbations. Here, for example, GPC is not made aware of the i.i.d. nature of the perturbations.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-4.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Moving on to correlated perturbations across time, a simple such setting is when the perturbations are drawn from a Gaussian Random Walk (as opposed to independent Gaussians). Note that here it is possible to derive the <i>optimal </i>controller via the separation principle. Here is the performance plot:</p>
<h1><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-5.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></h1>
<p>Note that the default LQR controller performs much worse, where as GPC is able to track the performance of the optimal controller quite closely. Next up, <b>sinusoidal noise</b>:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-6.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Here the full power of regret minimization is exhibited as the consecutive samples of the sine function are very correlated, yet predictable. GPC vastly outperforms LQR as one would expect. But, is this fundamentally a hard setting? What would happen if we use the H-infinity controller, or, god forbid, no control at all? We see this in the next plot (on the log-linear scale):</p>
<p><img alt="" height="202" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-7.png?w=624&amp;h=202" title="" width="624"/></p>
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>We have surveyed a new family of controls that are fundamentally different than classical optimal control: they are adaptive and attain regret guarantees vs. adversarial noise. Their preliminary experimental tests seem quite promising.</p>
<p>In the coming posts we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain how GPC can obtain the first logarithmic regret in the tracking/Kalman setting,</li>
<li>Reveal our new research-first library for control / time-series prediction,</li>
<li>Tackle more general settings.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Stay tuned! Preferably using the GPC… <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></h1>

A study in JAMA Pediatrics this year found that the average Halloween resulted in four additional pedestrian deaths compared with other nights. For 4- to 8-year-olds, the rate was 10 times as high.</blockquote>
The paragraph  means the percent increase for pedestrian deaths for 4-8 year olds was ten time the percent increase for people as a whole, a number you cannot determine from the information given. Using the fact that roughly 7% of Americans are in the 4-8 year range, that yields a little under three additional deaths for 4-8 year olds and about one for the other age ranges.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.4052">paper</a> unfortunately sits behind a firewall. But I found a <a href="http://10.0.3.233/jamapediatrics.2018.4052">press release</a>.<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Children in the United States celebrate Halloween by going door-to-door collecting candy. New research suggests the popular October 31 holiday is associated with increased pedestrian traffic fatalities, especially among children. Researchers used data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to compare the number of pedestrian fatalities from 1975 to 2016 that happened on October 31 each year between 5 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. with those that happened during the same hours on a day one week earlier (on October 24) and a day one week later (on November 7). During the 42-year study period, 608 pedestrian fatalities happened on the 42 Halloween evenings, whereas 851 pedestrian fatalities happened on the 84 other evenings used for comparison. The relative risk (an expression of probability) of a pedestrian fatality was higher on Halloween than those other nights. Absolute mortality rates averaged 2.07 and 1.45 pedestrian fatalities per hour on Halloween nights and the other evenings, respectively, which is equivalent to the average Halloween resulting in four additional pedestrian deaths each year. The biggest risk was among children ages 4 to 8. Absolute risk of pedestrian fatality per 100 million Americans was small and declined from 4.9 to 2.5 between the first and final decades of the study interval. </blockquote>
Doing the math, we see a 43% increase and a more than quintupling the number of pedestrian deaths for the youngsters. That sounds scary indeed. though it only adds up to a handful of deaths.  Moreover the authors didn't take into account the larger number of pedestrians on Halloween, particularly among 4-8 year olds.<br/>
<br/>
A smaller fraction of people die as pedestrians on Halloween today then on a random day when I was a kid. I wonder if that's because there are fewer pedestrians today.<br/>
<br/>
Also from the New York Times, a sociologist has found "no evidence that any child had been seriously injured, let alone killed, by strangers tampering with candy." I feel lied to as a kid.<br/>
<br/>
So the upshot: Tell your kids to take the usual precautions but mostly let them dress up, have fun trick-or-treating and enjoy their candy.</div>

    <title>TOC for Society</title>
    <summary>I am delighted that the Symposium on Foundations of Responsible Computing (FORC) is on its way. This is a new forum that will host mathematical research in computation and society, under an inclusive umbrella. A major purpose is to give a home and to nurture the growing community within the Theory of Computing and neighboring fields whose research is focused on the societal impact of computing. This vision is shared by many in this area, and I am very proud of the remarkable list of steering committee members that have volunteered to create and promote the new conference. The call for papers for FORC 2020 is out. The PC chair, Aaron Roth, has done a remarkable job forming a strong program committee, and we are off to a great start. Please consider sending your research papers and looking forward to seeing many of you at FORC 2020 in the beginning of June at Harvard.</summary>

<p>I’d like to offer special thanks to the editor in charge, <a href="https://twitter.com/eleanorbarkhorn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Eleanor Barkhorn</a>, who commissioned this piece and then went way, <strong>way</strong> beyond the call of duty to get it right—including relaxing the usual length limit to let me squeeze in amplitudes and interference, and working late into the night to fix last-minute problems.  Obviously I take sole responsibility for whatever errors remain.</p>



<p>Of course a lot of material still ended up on the cutting room floor, including a little riff about Andrew Yang’s tweet that because of quantum supremacy, now “no code is uncrackable,” as well as Ivanka Trump’s tweet giving credit for Google’s experiment (one that Google was working toward since 2015) partly to her father’s administration.</p>



<p>While I’m posting: those of a more technical bent might want to check out my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12085">new short preprint</a> with UT undergraduate Sam Gunn, where we directly study the complexity-theoretic hardness of spoofing Google’s linear cross-entropy benchmark using a classical computer.  Enjoy!</p></div>

<h2>Thresholds versus fractional expectation-thresholds</h2>
<p class="title mathjax">This morning the following paper appeared on the arXive: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13433">Thresholds versus fractional expectation-thresholds</a> by Keith Frankston, Jeff Kahn, Bhargav Narayanan, and Jinyoung Park.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proving a conjecture of Talagrand, a fractional version of the ‘expectation-threshold’ conjecture of Kalai and the second author, we show for any increasing family <strong>F</strong> on a finite set <strong>X</strong> that <img alt="p_c(F)=O(q_f(F) \log \ell ({\bf F}))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_c%28F%29%3DO%28q_f%28F%29+%5Clog+%5Cell+%28%7B%5Cbf+F%7D%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p_c(F)=O(q_f(F) \log \ell ({\bf F}))"/>, where <img alt="p_c({\bf F})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_c%28%7B%5Cbf+F%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p_c({\bf F})"/> and <img alt="q_f({\bf F})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q_f%28%7B%5Cbf+F%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="q_f({\bf F})"/> are the threshold and ‘fractional expectation-threshold’ of <strong>F</strong>, and ℓ(<strong>F</strong>) is the largest size of a minimal member of <strong>F</strong>. This easily implies various heretofore difficult results in probabilistic combinatorics, e.g. thresholds for perfect hypergraph matchings (Johansson-Kahn-Vu) and bounded-degree spanning trees (Montgomery). We also resolve (and vastly extend) one version of the ‘random multi-dimensional assignment’ problem of Frieze and Sorkin. Our approach builds on recent breakthrough work of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang on the Erdős-Rado ‘sunflower’ conjecture.</p>
<h2>The expectation-threshold conjecture</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kahn-kalai.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18406" height="476" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kahn-kalai.png?w=640&amp;h=476" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>The 2006 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0603218">expectation threshold conjecture</a> gives a justification for a naive way to estimate the threshold probability of a random graph property. Suppose that you are asked about the critical probability for a random graph in G(n,p) for having a perfect matching (or a Hamiltonian cycle). You compute the expected number of perfect matchings and realize that when p is C/n this expected number equals 1/2. (For Hamiltonian cycles it will be C’/n.) Of course, if the expectation is one half the probability for a perfect matching can be very low, indeed in this case, an isolated vertex is quite likely but when there is no isolated vertices the expected number of perfect matchings is rather large. Our 2006 conjecture boldly asserts that the gap between the value given by such a naive computation and the true threshold value is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. Jeff and I tried hard to find a counterexample but instead we managed to find more general and stronger forms of the conjecture that we could not disprove.</p>
<h2>Conjectures by Talagrand</h2>
<p>The expectation threshold conjecture had some connections with a 1995 paper of Michel Talagrand entitled <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-0348-9090-8_25">Are all sets of positive measure essentially convex?</a> In a 2010 STOC paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.6973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Are Many Small Sets Explicitly Small?</a> Michel formulated a weaker fractional version of the expectation threshold conjecture which is sufficient for the various applications of the original conjecture. This conjecture (as well as a stronger form also posed by Talagrand) is now verified in the new paper!</p>
<h2>Connection to isoperimetry</h2>
<p>In our 2006 paper we tried to relate the expectation threshold conjecture to various questions of independent interest related to stability theorems for discrete isoperimetric inequalities. This direction did not play a role in the new paper. Let me note that the isoperimetric problems served as partial motivation for the recent breakthrough results by Peter Keevash, Noam Lifshitz, Eoin Long, and Dor Minzer that are reported in this <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/10/30/exciting-beginning-of-the-year-activities-and-seminars/">October 2018 post</a>. See their paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05568">Hypercontractivity for global functions and sharp thresholds</a>.</p>
<h2>A sample from the applications</h2>
<ol>
<li>The threshold value for perfect matching – this was proved already by Erdos and Renyi (1960)  and it follow from the new results. The same goes for the threshold for connectivity.</li>
<li>The threshold value for Hamiltonian circuits – posed as a problem by  Erdos and Renyi it was solved by Korshunov (1976) and by Posa (1976).</li>
<li>The threshold for perfect matching in 3-uniform hypergraphs – was posed by Schmidt and Shamir (1983) and was settled by  Johansson, Kahn, and Vu. (It was one of the motivation for my 2006 paper with Jeff.)</li>
<li>The threshold for bounded degree spanning trees that was open for a long time and was settled by Montgomery (2019).</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me mention that in various cases the gap between the (fractional) expectation threshold and threshold is a smaller power of log <em>n, </em>or is a constant, or has different behavior. Understanding this through a general theory is still unknown.</p>
<h2><strong>Connection to the sunflower breakthrough</strong></h2>
<p>What did play a major role in the new development was the recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483">breakthrough work</a> of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang on the Erdős-Rado ‘sunflower’ conjecture. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/amazing-ryan-alweiss-shachar-lovett-kewen-wu-jiapeng-zhang-made-dramatic-progress-on-the-sunflower-conjecture/">this post</a>.)  I expected that the method of the sunflower paper will have major applications but this application took me by a surprise.</p>

    <title>Incidences: Open Problems (part 2)</title>
    <summary>We now continue our journey of seeing how we still don’t know much about geometric incidences. So far, we looked at two main problems concerning incidences with curves in the plane (see the first post of the series). It might make sense to move to study incidences in higher dimensions. Instead, we are now regressing […]</summary>
