    <title>TR22-034 |  Fourier Growth of Regular Branching Programs | 

	Chin Ho Lee, 

	Edward Pyne, 

	Salil Vadhan</title>
    <summary>We analyze the Fourier growth, i.e. the $L_1$ Fourier weight at level $k$ (denoted $L_{1,k}$),  of read-once regular branching programs.
We prove that every read-once regular branching program $B$ of width $w \in [1,\infty]$ with $s$ accepting states on $n$-bit inputs must have its $L_{1,k}$ bounded by
$$
  \min\left\{ \Pr[B(U_n)=1] (w-1)^k , s \cdot O\left((n \log n)/k\right)^{\frac{k-1}{2}} \right\}.
$$
For any constant $k$, our result is tight up to constant factors for the AND function on $w-1$ bits, and is tight up to polylogarithmic factors for unbounded width programs. In particular, for $k=1$ we have $L_{1,1}(B)\leq s$, with no dependence on the width $w$ of the program.

Our result gives new bounds on the coin problem and new pseudorandom generators (PRGs). Furthermore, we obtain an explicit generator for unordered permutation branching programs of unbounded width with a constant factor stretch, where no PRG was previously known.

Applying a composition theorem of B{\l}asiok, Ivanov, Jin, Lee, Servedio and Viola (RANDOM 2021), we extend our results to ``generalized group products,'' a generalization of modular sums and product tests.</summary>

    <title>TR22-033 |  A better-than-$3\log{n}$ depth lower bound for De Morgan formulas with restrictions on top gates | 

	Ivan Mihajlin, 

	Anastasia Sofronova</title>
    <summary>We prove that a modification of Andreev's function is not computable by $(3 + \alpha - \varepsilon) \log{n}$ depth De Morgan formula with $(2\alpha - \varepsilon)\log{n}$ layers of AND gates at the top for any $1/5 &gt; \alpha &gt; 0$ and any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In order to do this, we prove a weak variant of Karchmer-Raz-Wigderson conjecture. To be more precise, we prove the existence of two functions $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ and $g \colon \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ such that $f(g(x) \oplus y)$ is not computable by depth $(1 + \alpha - \varepsilon) n$ formulas with $(2 \alpha - \varepsilon) n$ layers of AND gates at the top. We do this by a top-down approach, which was only used before for depth-$3$ model. 

Our technical contribution includes combinatorial insights into structure of composition with random boolean function, which led us to introducing a notion of well-mixed sets. A set of functions is well-mixed if, when composed with a random function, it does not have subsets that agree on large fractions of inputs. We use probabilistic method to prove the existence of well-mixed sets.</summary>

<em>Cybermen: You will be upgraded.<br/>
Cyberman: Upgrading is compulsory.</em><br/>
<font color="#000000"/></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
I am now carrying a full power CPU embedded in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberman">chest</a>. If I could use it directly I would have new powers, but it is dedicated to monitor my heart function. Alas.<br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/05/i-am-now-a-cyberman/bed/" rel="attachment wp-att-19722"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19722" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bed.png?resize=285%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="285"/></a></p>
<p/><h2> The Procedure </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My heart has not been beating well. So they had to implant a device that monitors the heart and also can restart the beating if needed. It was not a long operation—about one hour—but took two days recovering in the hospital. </p>
<p>
The worst part of the recovery is that it is not restful. And it is boring. I am now home and resting much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Am I Turing Universal? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Well, according to Alan Turing, I was universal as soon as I began to use my brain. But can I leverage my new processing power?</p>
<p>
The doctors told Kathryn that some ideas from DNA computing went into my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantable_cardioverter-defibrillator">ICD</a> device. Of course, I cannot implement any DNA computing algorithms on my device. </p>
<p>
I wonder, however, whether I can get useful outputs by varying the input—such as my pulse. Maybe I do not want to experiment on myself there. But it is not too far-fetched to imagine that in the not too distant future many of us could be controlling computations with our heartbeats. Or at least powering them while controlling with brainwaves. Call it “heartbeat computing”—?</p>
<p>
Ken has a more immediate concern: could the computing power in the device be used to cheat at chess? Already many chess tournament prohibit electronic physio devices, even watches, because of this potential. A cognitive <em>implant</em>, however, could bend the rules on what it means to be a human player.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I want to thank all who sent some best wishes. I really thank you all for your thoughts. </p>
<p>
I must also especially thank my dear wife Dr.Kathryn Farley for her tremendous support. And also thank Ken for helping her make some calls on our behalf. Thank you both.</p>

We prove that this conjecture is true.</span></p>
<p>Congratulations to Chaim, Tsviqa, and Ran!</p>
<p>Quick remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The introduction to the paper give a very friendly introduction of the topic as well as a variety of results between 2013 and today.</li>
<li>Ran Tessler gave recently a lovely colloquium talk about the result in Tel Aviv University, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uKYef392Fc3HrgyxJzRED6U8p0nqsR7/view?usp=sharing">here are the slides</a>.</li>
<li>For a 2015 post about these objects and some thoughts about the combinatorial side: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/the-simplex-the-cyclic-polytope-the-positroidron-the-amplituhedron-and-beyond/" rel="bookmark">The Simplex, the Cyclic polytope, the Positroidron, the Amplituhedron, and Beyond.</a> See also this post for <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/midrasha-mathematicae-18-in-and-around-combinatorics/">a related lecture series by Alexander Postnikov.</a> (Here are <a href="https://4gravitons.com/category/amplitudes-methods/">quite a few blog posts</a> on the physics side from “4-gravitons”.)</li>

<p>(Click for a larger image.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Questions that arise naturally: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is there an analog for the “moment curve”? Are there analogs for “neighborly polytopes”? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do amplituhedra maximize numbers of cells or related parameters like the cyclic polytopes do? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are they amplituhedra “universal” objects like vertices of the cyclic polytopes? </span></p></div>

    <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms and Lower Bounds for Search-Diversification Problems</title>

We give
improved approximation algorithms in each of the following problems, together
with some lower bounds.
</p>
<p>- We give a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for a diversified
search ranking problem [Bansal et al., ICALP 2010] whose objective is to
minimizes the discounted cumulative gain. Our PTAS runs in time
$n^{2^{O(\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon)}} \cdot m^{O(1)}$ where $n$ denotes the
number of elements in the databases. Complementing this, we show that no PTAS
can run in time $f(\epsilon) \cdot (nm)^{2^{o(1/\epsilon)}}$ assuming Gap-ETH;
therefore our running time is nearly tight. Both of our bounds answer open
questions of Bansal et al.
</p>
<p>- We next consider the Max-Sum Dispersion problem, whose objective is to
select $k$ out of $n$ elements that maximizes the dispersion, which is defined
as the sum of the pairwise distances under a given metric. We give a
quasipolynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem which runs in time
$n^{O_{\epsilon}(\log n)}$. This improves upon previously known polynomial-time
algorithms with approximate ratios 0.5 [Hassin et al., Oper. Res. Lett. 1997;
Borodin et al., ACM Trans. Algorithms 2017]. Furthermore, we observe that known
reductions rule out approximation schemes that run in
$n^{\tilde{o}_\epsilon(\log n)}$ time assuming ETH.
</p>
<p>- We consider a generalization of Max-Sum Dispersion called Max-Sum
Diversification. In addition to the sum of pairwise distance, the objective
includes another function $f$. For monotone submodular $f$, we give a
quasipolynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratio arbitrarily close to
$(1 - 1/e)$. This improves upon the best polynomial-time algorithm which has
approximation ratio $0.5$ by Borodin et al. Furthermore, the $(1 - 1/e)$ factor
is tight as achieving better-than-$(1 - 1/e)$ approximation is NP-hard [Feige,
J. ACM 1998].

two-dimensional polygonal curve $P$, such that for any query segment
$\overline{ab}$ one can efficiently compute the Fr\'{e}chet distance between
$P$ and $\overline{ab}$. First we present a data structure of size $O(n \log
n)$ that can compute the Fr\'{e}chet distance between $P$ and a horizontal
query segment $\overline{ab}$ in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of
vertices of $P$. In comparison to prior work, this significantly reduces the
required space. We extend the type of queries allowed, as we allow a query to
be a horizontal segment $\overline{ab}$ together with two points $s, t \in P$
(not necessarily vertices), and ask for the Fr\'{e}chet distance between
$\overline{ab}$ and the curve of $P$ in between $s$ and $t$. Using
$O(n\log^2n)$ storage, such queries take $O(\log^3 n)$ time, simplifying and
significantly improving previous results. We then generalize our results to
query segments of arbitrary orientation. We present an
$O(nk^{3+\varepsilon}+n^2)$ size data structure, where $k \in [1..n]$ is a
parameter the user can choose, and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ is an arbitrarily small
constant, such that given any segment $\overline{ab}$ and two points $s, t \in
P$ we can compute the Fr\'{e}chet distance between $\overline{ab}$ and the
curve of $P$ in between $s$ and $t$ in $O((n/k)\log^2n+\log^4 n)$ time. This is
the first result that allows efficient exact Fr\'{e}chet distance queries for
arbitrarily oriented segments.
</p>
<p>We also present two applications of our data structure: we show that we can
compute a local $\delta$-simplification (with respect to the Fr\'{e}chet
distance) of a polygonal curve in $O(n^{5/2+\varepsilon})$ time, and that we
can efficiently find a translation of an arbitrary query segment
$\overline{ab}$ that minimizes the Fr\'{e}chet distance with respect to a
subcurve of $P$.

    <title>High Multiplicity Scheduling on Uniform Machines in FPT-Time</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Brinkop:Hauke.html">Hauke Brinkop</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jansen:Klaus.html">Klaus Jansen</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01741">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In high-multiplicity scheduling, jobs of the same size are encoded in an
efficient way, that is, for each size the number of jobs of that size is given
instead of a list of jobs. Similarly, machines are encoded. We consider
scheduling on uniform machines where a job of size $p_j$ takes time $p_j/s_i$
on a machine of speed $s_i$. Classical (NP-hard) objectives are Makespan
minimization ($C_{\max}$) and Santa Claus ($C_{\min}$). We show that both
objectives can be solved in time $\mathcal O( p_{\max}^{\mathcal O(d^2)}
\operatorname {poly} |I| )$ where $p_{\max}$ is the largest jobs size, $d$ the
number of different job sizes and $|I|$ the encoding length of the instance.
Our approach incorporates two structural theorems: The first allows us to
replace machines of large speed by multiple machines of smaller speed. The
second tells us that some fractional assignments can be used to reduce the
instance significantly. Using only the first theorem, we show some additional
results. For the problem Envy Minimization ($C_{\mathit{envy}}$), we propose an
$\mathcal O(s_{\max} \cdot p_{\max}^{\mathcal O(d^3)} \operatorname{poly} |I|)$
time algorithm (where $s_{\max}$ is the largest speed). For $C_{\max}$ and
$C_{\min}$ in the Restricted Assignment setting, we give an $\mathcal O( (d
p_{\max})^{\mathcal O(d^3)} \operatorname{poly} |I|)$ time algorithm. As far as
we know, those running times are better than the running times of the
algorithms known until today.

    <title>Uniform Approximations for Randomized Hadamard Transforms with Applications</title>

efficient alternative to the use of dense unstructured random matrices across a
range of domains in computer science and machine learning. For several
applications such as dimensionality reduction and compressed sensing, the
theoretical guarantees for methods based on RHTs are comparable to approaches
using dense random matrices with i.i.d.\ entries. However, several such
applications are in the low-dimensional regime where the number of rows sampled
from the matrix is rather small. Prior arguments are not applicable to the
high-dimensional regime often found in machine learning applications like
kernel approximation. Given an ensemble of RHTs with Gaussian diagonals,
$\{M^i\}_{i = 1}^m$, and any $1$-Lipschitz function, $f: \mathbb{R} \to
\mathbb{R}$, we prove that the average of $f$ over the entries of $\{M^i v\}_{i
= 1}^m$ converges to its expectation uniformly over $\| v \| \leq 1$ at a rate
comparable to that obtained from using truly Gaussian matrices. We use our
inequality to then derive improved guarantees for two applications in the
high-dimensional regime: 1) kernel approximation and 2) distance estimation.
For kernel approximation, we prove the first \emph{uniform} approximation
guarantees for random features constructed through RHTs lending theoretical
justification to their empirical success while for distance estimation, our
convergence result implies data structures with improved runtime guarantees
over previous work by the authors. We believe our general inequality is likely
to find use in other applications.

high-dimensional distributions. Specifically, for $d$-dimensional Gaussian
distributions with known covariance $\Sigma$, we can test whether the
distribution comes from $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*, \Sigma)$ for some fixed $\mu^*$ or
from some $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ with total variation distance at least
$\alpha$ from $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*, \Sigma)$ with $(\varepsilon, 0)$-differential
privacy, using only \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} +
\frac{d^{1/3}}{\alpha^{4/3} \cdot \varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{1}{\alpha \cdot
\varepsilon}\right)\] samples if the algorithm is allowed to be computationally
inefficient, and only \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} +
\frac{d^{1/4}}{\alpha \cdot \varepsilon}\right)\] samples for a computationally
efficient algorithm. We also provide a matching lower bound showing that our
computationally inefficient algorithm has optimal sample complexity. We also
extend our algorithms to various related problems, including mean testing of
Gaussians with bounded but unknown covariance, uniformity testing of product
distributions over $\{\pm 1\}^d$, and tolerant testing.
</p>
<p>Our results improve over the previous best work of Canonne, Kamath, McMillan,
Ullman, and Zakynthinou \cite{CanonneKMUZ20} for both computationally efficient
and inefficient algorithms, and even our computationally efficient algorithm
matches the optimal \emph{non-private} sample complexity of
$O\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\alpha^2}\right)$ in many standard parameter settings.
In addition, our results show that, surprisingly, private identity testing of
$d$-dimensional Gaussians can be done with fewer samples than private identity
testing of discrete distributions over a domain of size $d$ \cite{AcharyaSZ18},
which refutes a conjectured lower bound of Canonne et al. \cite{CanonneKMUZ20}.

demand i.i.d. buyers where there is an exogenous bound of $k$ on the number of
price levels the auction clock can take. The auctioneer's problem is to choose
price levels $p_1 &gt; p_2 &gt; \cdots &gt; p_{k}$ for the auction clock such that
auction expected revenue is maximized. The prices levels are announced prior to
the auction. We reduce this problem to a new variant of prophet inequality,
which we call \emph{batched prophet inequality}, where a decision-maker chooses
$k$ (decreasing) thresholds and then sequentially collects rewards (up to $m$)
that are above the thresholds with ties broken uniformly at random. For the
special case of $m=1$ (i.e., selling a single item), we show that the resulting
descending auction with $k$ price levels achieves $1- 1/e^k$ of the
unrestricted (without the bound of $k$) optimal revenue. That means a
descending auction with just 4 price levels can achieve more than 98\% of the
optimal revenue. We then extend our results for $m&gt;1$ and provide a closed-form
bound on the competitive ratio of our auction as a function of the number of
units $m$ and the number of price levels $k$.

    <title>Combinatorial Exploration: An algorithmic framework to automate the proof of results in combinatorics</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Are you interested in combinatorial mathematics? If so, I am happy to welcome you to the future! </p><p>I am proud to share with you a new, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07715" target="_blank">99-page preprint</a> by three colleagues from my department (<a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/bean.html" target="_blank">Christian Bean</a>, <a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/nadeau.html" target="_blank">Émile Nadeau </a>and <a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/ulfarsson.html" target="_blank">Henning Ulfarsson</a>) and three of their collaborators (<a href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/malbert/index.php" target="_blank">Michael Albert</a>, <a href="https://akc.is/" target="_blank">Anders Claesson</a> and <a href="http://jaypantone.com/" target="_blank">Jay Pantone</a>) that is the result of years of work that led to the birth of  Combinatorial Exploration.   <i>Combinatorial Exploration</i> is an algorithmic framework that can prove results that so far have required the ingenuity of human combinatorialists. More specifically, it can study, at the press of a button, the structure of combinatorial objects and derive their counting sequences and generating functions. The applicability and power of Combinatorial Exploration are witnessed by the applications to the domain of permutation patterns given in the paper. My colleagues use it to re-derive <i>hundreds</i> of results in the literature in a uniform manner and prove many new ones. See the <a href="https://permpal.com/" target="_blank">Permutation Pattern Avoidance Library (PermPAL)</a> and Section 2.4 of the article for a more comprehensive list of notable results. The paper also gives three additional proofs-of-concept, showing examples of how Combinatorial Exploration can prove results in the domains of alternating sign matrices, polyominoes, and set partitions. Last, but by no means least, the github repository at <a href="https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/comb_spec_searcher">https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/comb_spec_searcher</a> contains the open-source python framework for Combinatorial Exploration, and the one at <a href="https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/Tilings">https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/Tilings</a> contains the code needed to apply it to the field of permutation patterns. </p><p> "Det er svært at spå, især om fremtiden", as Niels Bohr and Piet Hein famously said. However, let me stick my neck out and predict that this work will have substantial impact and will be the basis for exciting future work. </p><p> Congratulations  to my colleagues! With my department chair hat on, I am very proud to see work of this quality stem from my department and humbled by what my colleagues have achieved already. As an interested observer, I am very excited to see what their algorithms will be able to prove in the future. For the moment, let's all enjoy what they have done already. <br/></p></div>

    <summary>The consensus layers of different blockchain protocols can look very different from one another.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: In this talk I’ll show how to revise the classical hardness-vs-randomness framework, so that it can work in a non-black-box fashion. Specifically, we will construct derandomization algorithms that don’t rely on classical PRGs, and instead “extract pseudorandomness” from the given input on which we want to simulate the probabilistic machine.</p>
<p>Using a non-black-box approach allows us to deduce stronger conclusions (or alternatively rely on weaker hypotheses), compared to classical approaches. In one instantiation of the new framework, we reveal a close connection between the promiseBPP = promiseP conjecture and a new type of uniform lower bounds. In another instantiation, we simulate probabilistic algorithms with essentially no observable runtime overhead, under plausible hypotheses.</p>
<p>Based on a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/080/">joint work</a> with <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~lijieche/">Lijie Chen</a>.</p></blockquote></div>

    <title>REU programs in general, and two at Univ of MD this summer.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>REU stands for Research Experience for Undergraduates. </p><p>REU programs are funded by the NSF. The NSF website of REU programs is <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp">here</a>. </p><p>Univ if MD at College Park dept of Comp Sci is running two REU programs this summer:</p><p>I (William Gasarch) am running  REU-CAAR (Combinatorics and AI Applied to Real problems) whose theme is applying theory to practice. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/">here</a>.</p><p> Jacquelyn Michaelis and Mihai Pop are running REU-BRIDGe (Bioinformatics Research In Data science for Genomics) which, as you can probably tell from the name, is in bio-comp. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cbcb.umd.edu/summer-internships">here</a>.</p><p>Most REU programs have the following: </p><p>1) There is an admissions period where many people apply (I had around 200 applicants last year) of which only about 10 get in. Some have money for a few extra students. This year both REU-CAAR and REU-BRIDGe have applications due March 22; however, in the past I have admitted students before then, so students who apply March 21 may be at a severe disadvantage. </p><p>2) Students apply from across the United states and these programs are competitive, so good to apply to several that you would definitely goto. Students ask me how many- I'll say 10 though temper that with only applying to those you REALLY would goto, and if there are MORE THAN 10 that look awesome, you could apply to more. </p><p>3) Students stay in the dorms (the last two years some programs cancelled, and some were virtual- mine was virtual) and get stipend of $6000, and a meal card. The program is 10 weeks.</p><p>4) Students work on projects in teams of 2-5. Some programs have the students pick what projects they would be happy to work on when they apply (mine does that) while others assign projects once students arrive (REU-BRIDGe will do that). The later makes sense if the program is very focused so the projects do not differ that much. </p><p>5) These programs are excellent for giving ugrads a chance to do research (NSF wants at least half of the students to come from non-research schools) and a sense of what grad school is like. So I recommend students thinking of grad school, or just want to do research, to apply to these programs. </p><p>6) Some students get papers out of the research. In these cases the research usually continues after the program is over. </p><p>7) It is healthy for a student to go to an REU program that is at a DIFFERENT school then where they are an ugrad for broadening. There may be mitigating circumstances where this is not possible. </p><p><br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Yesterday, Bocconi’s Rector signed the decree that created the new Computing Sciences department. This is only the ninth department to be created in our 120 year old university, and the first, I believe, in a couple of decades. It is the first department with an engineering and science mission (the other eight department are, in random order, Accounting, Marketing, Finance, Economics, Managements, Social Sciences, Law, and Decision Sciences).</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, we were joined by <a href="https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/team/francesca-buffa">Francesca Buffa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_M%C3%A9zard">Marc Mezard</a>. </p>



<p>Francesca, a computational biologist formerly at Oxford medical school, is now the fourth out of four computer science tenured faculty in our new department to have an active ERC grant.</p>



<p>Marc’s work has spanned theoretical physics, information theory and computation, including his collaboration with Giorgio Parisi’s Nobel Prize winning work, and he has been most recently the president of the Ecole National Superieure in Paris. When we asked for letters for his tenure case, one of the reviewers wrote, more or less in so many words, “you would be lucky to have Marc in your university, though it’s very unlikely that he will accept your offer”. At that point Marc had already accepted.</p>

    <title>TR22-032 |  Incompressiblity and Next-Block Pseudoentropy | 

	Noam Mazor, 

	Iftach Haitner, 

	Jad Silbak</title>
    <summary>A distribution is k-incompressible, Yao [FOCS ’82], if no efficient compression scheme compresses it to less than k bits. While being a natural measure, its relation to other computational analogs of entropy such as pseudoentropy, Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [SICOMP 99], and to other cryptographic hardness assumptions, was unclear.

We advance towards a better understating of this notion, showing that a k-incompressible distribution has (k?2) bits of next-block pseudoentropy, a refinement of pseudoentropy introduced by Haitner, Reingold, and Vadhan [SICOMP ’13]. We deduce that a samplable distribution X that is (H(X) + 2)-incompressible, implies the existence of one-way functions.</summary>

<p><img alt="" src="https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/news/theory_at_the_institute_and_beyond-february_2022.png" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 328px; height: 219px;"/>It has been only a few months since the last time this column appeared. Yet there is so much to write about that it feels like a year has passed. For one area in particular, a decade’s worth of developments seems to have emerged in a few months’ time. I am talking of course about the phenomenal developments on error-correcting codes that we witnessed in the past few months.</p>



<p><strong>Error-correcting codes</strong><br/>
	Error-correcting codes encode a message into a longer codeword so that the original message can be recovered even if many of the bits of the codeword are corrupted. Clearly, there is a trade-off between the amount of redundancy introduced by the error-correcting code and the number of errors it can recover from. A gold standard for error-correcting codes is being “constant rate, constant distance,” also referred to as being “asymptotically good.” An asymptotically good code can recover from a constant fraction of bit errors in the codeword, and the codeword is only a constant factor longer than the original message.</p>



<p>Error-correcting codes can be described using a family of “parity checks,” where a parity check on a subset \(S\) of bits is a constraint that there are an even number of \(1\)s within the subset \(S\). A codeword is then a sequence of bits that satisfy all of the parity check constraints. In a low-density parity check (LDPC) code, there is a family of parity checks on constantly many bits each, that together define the code.</p>



<p>Introduced by Gallager in 1960, LDPC codes are central objects in both the theory and the practice of error correction. In 1996, Sipser and Spielman showed how to use expander graphs to construct LDPCs with constant distance and constant rate. Their construction is a thing of beauty. Pick an expander graph and associate one bit on each edge of the graph. For each vertex of the expander graph, the parity of the sum of bits on its edges is even. This construction also admits linear time encoding and decoding algorithms for the same.</p>



<p><strong>Asymptotically good locally testable codes and quantum LDPCs</strong><br/>
	A locally testable code is one that admits a highly efficient procedure to detect the presence of errors. More precisely, it admits a testing procedure that queries a small number of randomly selected bits in the codeword, and will reject a corrupted codeword with, say, 1% of errors with constant probability. The gold standard would be a constant-query locally testable code, where the testing procedure queries only a constantly many (say, 100) bits of the corrupted codeword.</p>



<p>Locally testable codes have been central to many of the developments in complexity theory for close to three decades now. Linearity testing, aka locally testing the Hadamard code, is still the prime example for property testing and lies at the gateway to the world of probabilistically checkable proofs.</p>



<p>Intuitively for a code to be locally testable, it needs to admit a large number of constant-size parity checks. In other words, locally testability seemingly necessitates the code to have a lot of redundancy. In fact, the classic examples of locally testable codes, such as Hadamard codes or Reed-Muller codes, have codewords that are superpolynomially larger than the message.</p>



<p>Irit Dinur’s ingenious proof of the PCP theorem yielded as a by-product the first locally testable codes where the codewords were only slightly superlinear in size. It was then that one would dare to ask: can locally testability be achieved for “free”? That is, can one have the best of all worlds: a constant-rate, constant-distance code that also admits a constant-query local-tester?</p>



<p>This long-standing open question always seemed out of reach until late last year, when it was resolved affirmatively by two independent groups of researchers simultaneously!</p>



<span id="more-627"/>



<p/>



<p>Irit Dinur, Shai Evra, Ron Livne, Alexander Lubotzky, and Shahar Mozes start their journey with the idea that analogous to how Sipser and Spielman use expander graphs to construct codes, one could potentially use high-dimensional expanders to construct codes that are also locally testable. Starting with this idea, they undertake a long and intensive journey through a terrain of Ramanujan complexes, Bruhat-Tits buildings, <em>p</em>-adic uniformization, and other advanced mathematics to eventually land on an elementary and elegant <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04808" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construction</u></a> (see Irit Dinur’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjc6GCRFnpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>talk</u></a> on this work in the <em>Breakthroughs</em> talk series).</p>



<p>In an independent work, Pavel Panteleev and Gleb Kalachev not only <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03654?context=quant-ph" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construct</u></a> asymptotically good locally testable codes, but also resolve yet another long-standing open question! They exhibit a construction of asymptotically good quantum LDPCs. Regular readers of this column might recall that we earlier <u><a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/theory-institute-and-beyond-january-2021" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">featured</a></u> a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03921" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breakthrough</u></a> by Hastings, Haah, and O’Donnell, who constructed quantum LDPCs on \(n\) qubits with distance \(n^{3/5}\), significantly beating \(\sqrt{n}\) for the first time. Panteleev and Kalachev essentially achieve the holy grail in this context — quantum LDPCs on \(n\) qubits with constant rate and distance \(\Omega(n)\).</p>



<p>It is uncanny how often a question that has remained open for years gets resolved by independent sets of researchers simultaneously. At first, one might remark that these results were really in the air. Yet on a closer look, one can only wonder how the authors masterfully pulled these results out of thin air.</p>



<p>These works are a treasure trove of ideas that are elementary, elegant, and ingenious. To leave you with a taste of things that lie inside, let me briefly describe a new combinatorial object, the “left-right Cayley complex,” that seems to underlie both these works. We are all familiar with Cayley graphs — objects studied for more than a hundred years. These are graphs where the vertices are elements of a group, and edges are of the form \((g,ag)\) — corresponding to left multiplication by a fixed set of group elements \(a\) called generators.</p>



<p>A left-right Cayley complex is a higher-dimensional object that has vertices, edges, and squares (\(4\)-tuples). The vertices are still elements of a group, and the squares are of the form \(\{g, ag, gb, agb\}\), corresponding to left and right multiplication of a group element \(g\) by generators \(a,b\). This simple and easily constructed combinatorial object (left-right Cayley complex) plays a central role in both these code constructions. Yet this object seems to have eluded study in more than a century of work on Cayley graphs.</p>



<p><strong>Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity</strong><br/>
	Reed-Muller codes are among the oldest of error-correcting codes and are probably the simplest to describe. Reed-Muller codewords of degree \(d\) are just the truth tables of degree \(d\) polynomials over the finite field \({0,1}\). Yet almost 70 years after their discovery, there are still fundamental questions about Reed-Muller codes that remain open.</p>



<p>Given the noise characteristics of a channel, Shannon’s theory establishes the fundamental upper bound on the rate of communication possible. An error-correcting code is said to “achieve capacity” if the rate of communication (aka, the number of message bits per codeword bit) matches Shannon’s upper bound.</p>



<p>A fundamental question on Reed-Muller codes is whether they do achieve capacity for a broad family of channels. In 2016, a beautiful <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7862912" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>work</u></a> by Shrinivas Kudekar, Santhosh Kumar, Marco Mondelli, Henry D. Pfister, Eren Şaşoğlu, and Rüdiger Urbanke showed that indeed, Reed-Muller codes do achieve capacity for erasure channels, namely channels that only erase bits instead of corrupting bits. Using one of the most ingenious applications of Boolean function analysis, they show a very general result that any code with a certain family of symmetries achieves capacity against erasures.</p>



<p>In a remarkable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14631" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breakthrough</u></a>, Galen Reeves and Henry D. Pfister show that Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity even against the broad family of binary memoryless channels. In particular, they achieve capacity for the most classic channel, namely the binary symmetric channel (BSC), where each bit is flipped with a fixed probability \(\epsilon\).</p>



<p><strong>An algorithmic surprise</strong><br/>
	Given a graph with weights on the edges, the best-known algorithm to compute shortest paths between all pairs of vertices takes \(O(n^3)\) time. In fact, it is hypothesized that the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem requires \(n^{3-o(1)}\) time, and this hypothesis is the starting point for a web of reductions in fine-grained complexity.</p>



<p>Now consider the problem of computing max-flow values between every pair of vertices in the graph, also known as the all-pairs max-flow (APMF) problem. It would seem that the APMF problem must be harder than APSP — after all, shortest paths are arguably much simpler to compute than maximum flows.</p>



<p>Yet, a phenomenal new result by Amir Abboud, Robert Krauthgamer, Jason Li, Debmalya Panigrahi, Thatchaphol Saranurak, and Ohad Trabelsi shatters this intuition. In particular, they exhibit a nearly quadratic-time algorithm for APMF!</p>



<p>Perhaps the first hint that max-flow values are arguably simpler objects than shortest paths lies in Gomory-Hu trees. In 1961, Gomory and Hu showed that the max-flow values between every pair of vertices in a graph can be succinctly represented using a weighted tree. More precisely, the Gomory-Hu tree is a weighted tree that one can construct for any given graph so that the maximum flow between every pair of vertices in the graph is equal to the same quantity on the Gomory-Hu tree.</p>



<p>Six decades after its introduction, this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04958" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>work</u></a> produces the first near-quadratic-time algorithm to compute the Gomory-Hu tree. Moreover, this work also shows that one can compute Gomory-Hu trees in unweighted graphs by using polylogarithmically many max-flow computations.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-031 |  Transparency Beyond VNP in the Monotone Setting | 

	Prerona Chatterjee, 

	Kshitij Gajjar, 

	Anamay Tengse</title>
    <summary>Recently Hrubes and Yehudayoff (2021) showed a connection between the monotone algebraic circuit complexity of \emph{transparent} polynomials and a geometric complexity measure of their Newton polytope. They then used this connection to prove lower bounds against monotone VP (mVP). We extend their work by showing that their technique can be used to prove lower bounds against classes that are seemingly more powerful than monotone VNP (mVNP).
	
In the process, we define a natural monotone analogue of VPSPACE --- a well-studied class in the non-monotone setting (Poizat (2008), Koiran Perifel (2009), Malod (2011), Mahajan Rao (2013) --- and prove an exponential separation between the computational powers of this class and mVNP. 
	
To show this separation, we define a new polynomial family with an interesting combinatorial structure which we use heavily in our lower bound. Both the polynomial and the combinatorial nature of our proof might be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>TR22-029 |  Quantum Tanner codes | 

	Anthony Leverrier, 

	Gilles Zémor</title>
    <summary>Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes.

In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a $c^3$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.</summary>

<p><b> 75 Years </b></p>
<p/><p>
I am 75 years old too. I do not have a committee for special events—maybe I should. I do recall what computers were in the beginning and what they have become now. I can only imagine what they might become in the next 75 years. I am thus quite interested in what the committee will do and how it might help celebrate the 75th anniversary. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
I started doing some research into the history of computers. I had the idea to look at old magazines that were monthly publications on all aspects of computers. Especially ones that were important in the early days: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datamation">Datamation</a> is one and another was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">Byte</a>. The later opened in 1975 and closed in 2013. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/02/26/acm-celebrating-75-years/teeth/" rel="attachment wp-att-19694"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19694" height="225" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/teeth.png?resize=225%2C225&amp;ssl=1" width="225"/></a></p>
<p>
As of 2022, the domain for Byte redirects to an unrelated website selling <a href="https://www.byteme.com/pages/why-byte">teeth aligners</a>. That says something, no?</p>

<p>… but these antiwar protesters in St. Petersburg know that they’re all going to be arrested and are doing it anyway.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I just spent an hour giving Lily, my 9-year-old, a crash course on geopolitics, including WWII, the Cold War, the formation of NATO, Article 5, nuclear deterrence, economic sanctions, the breakup of the USSR, Ukraine, the Baltic Republics, and the prospects now for WWIII. Her comment at the end was that from now on she’s going to refer to Putin as “Poopin,” in the hope that that shames him into changing course.</p>

    <title>I will be on instagram/If you have two reals in a box- Answer (Guest Post by David Marcus)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I will be on instragram:</p><p>We,  Prof. Mohammad Hajiaghayi and Prof. William Gasarch plan to have an Instagram Live at @mhajiaghayi this SAT FEB 26, 1:30PM EDT (in English).</p><p> We talk about our lives as well as blogging, research, and how to inspire young minds. Please join if you can.</p><p>#PvsNP #blogging #youngminds #instagram</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>This is the answer to the problem posted in the last post which was a guest post by David Marcus. This post is also a guest post by him. </p><p>We restate the problem:</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>PICK THE LARGEST NUMBER:</p><p>There are two distinct reals in a box (how do they fit! aren't reals infinite!). They are called the first and second number. </p><p>You want to pick the larger one. You can pick one of the numbers at random and look at it</p><p>before deciding which one you want. </p><p>Is there a strategy that will win with probability &gt; 1/2.</p><p>CLARIFICATIONS:</p><p>1) We do not want a strategy that does well on average or in the long run. Even if the games is played just once, we want the probability of winning to be &gt; 1/2.</p><p>2) It must have prob of winning &gt; 1/2 for EVERY pair of reals.</p><p>3) Here is an example of a strategy that does NOT work: Pick the first number with prob 1/2. If its positive then keep it, else dump it. If the numbers are{1,2} this only works half the time.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>There is a strategy. In fact, we give two.</p><p><br/></p><p>STRATEGY ONE</p><p>Before looking at any number, pick a number x on your own from the reals according to a distribution with full support (every open interval has prob greater than 0). Then pick a number from the box (prob 1/2-1/2), which we call y. If x&lt;y then keep y. If y\le x then take the other number.</p><p>If x is between the two numbers, then the strategy works. If not then the strategy does not hurt, so the prob in that case is 1/2. Hence you do better than 1/2. </p><p>STRATEGY TWO</p><p>Let f: R--&gt; (0,1) be strictly increasing. Pick a number from the box, call it y. Keep it with prob f(y).</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>
