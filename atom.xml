Beth Mynatt is heading north to become the new Dean of Computer Science at Northeastern University. Georgia Tech will miss her; she has been a key part of Tech for over twenty years. Northeastern is getting a great leader, a valued colleague, and an excellent PhD graduate of Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>
Today we hail her work on solving problems of <em>aging</em> and compare to what we do in theory. These musings wend toward solving problems of the kind raised in our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/11/13/popl-2022-et-tu-brute/">post</a>, on which we have an update from POPL General Chair Rajeev Alur that comes full circle to a Dean at Northeastern.</p>
<p>
One aspect of aging is having a long memory of a field. When Ken and I were young, it was all about what humans can do with computers. Now it is much more about what computers can do with humans. <em>With</em> humans, not just <em>for</em> humans—the aspect of collaboration is key. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Aging… </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Beth worked on various projects over her time at Tech. In 1999–2000, she was part of a team that launched the Aware Home Research Initiative (<a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fce/house/house.html">AHRI</a>), “whose goal is to develop the requisite technologies to create a home environment that can both perceive and assist its occupants.” She has led the Institute of People and Technology (IPaT) since 2011, its inaugural year, where her team has helped to support numerous, impactful research programs for faculty across Georgia Tech. </p>
<p>
To show how leadership and persistent work pay dividends, she is a co-PI on a new multi-institution grant led by Tech’s Sonia Chernova to build intelligent systems that support aging. The five-year, $20 million grant from the National Science Foundation, sponsored also by Amazon and Google, will go to create the NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (<a href="http://ai-caring.org/">AI-CARING</a>). The <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/649114/new-ai-institute-builds-tech-support-aging">announcement</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The institute aims to develop new longitudinal, collaborative AI systems that work with aging adults including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and their caregivers. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The AI-CARING front page says that they </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “will develop a discipline focused on personalized, longitudinal, collaborative AI, enabling the development of AI systems that learn personalized models of user behavior, understand how people’s behavior changes over time, and integrate that knowledge to support people and AIs working together. These networked Human-AI teams will work with elderly adults and their caregivers in order to provide sustainable long-term care solutions.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
As someone who is not young, I can definitely see why this is important. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Missed the … </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I sometimes feel that we in theory have missed the boat. The issue is that our problems are weighty—P=NP anyone?—but they do not directly impact practical computing. The areas that Beth is interested in, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing">ubiquitous computing</a>, have by definition had a large impact on real computing. The snippet from MIT’s <a href="http://oxygen.csail.mit.edu/Overview.html">Project Oxygen</a> quoted by Wikipedia expresses the direction of impact:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In the future, computation will be human centered. It will be freely available everywhere, like batteries and power sockets, or oxygen in the air we breathe. … [C]onfigurable generic devices, either handheld or embedded in the environment, will bring computation to us, whenever we need it and wherever we might be. … We won’t have to type, click, or learn new computer jargon. Instead, we’ll communicate naturally, using speech and gestures that describe our intent … and leave it to the computer to carry out our will. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This may conjure a “Star Trek” vision, but some people already live with substantial parts of this reality. Is there a market for P=NP? On the “equals” side, we can think of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_(1992_film)">couple</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_Salesman_(2012_film)">movies</a> featuring interested parties. For the “not equal” side, not so much?</p>
<p>
If pressed to think of a theory result that “launched a thousand ships” of practical effort, Peter Shor’s theorem about factoring belonging to quantum polynomial time springs to mind. But the ship of universal quantum computing needed to get it under steam won’t come in for decades.  It is <em>quantum devices with rudimentary computational features</em> that we see ruling in the meantime, while quantum communication protocols backed by quantum information theory are <a href="https://thequantuminsider.com/2021/06/23/11-global-banks-probing-the-wonderful-world-of-quantum-technologies/">banked on</a> now. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Solutions Business </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I, Ken writing from here, have often winced at the way the word “solutions” is used in business advertising. To a theorist, <em>solutions</em> are what make a conjecture become a theorem, what we grade in theory courses, what enjoyers of puzzles pursue for recreation. </p>
<p>
I described a <em>solution</em> of the more practical kind in my “Pandemic Lag” <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/07/30/pandemic-lag/">post</a> last July. It solves the problem of estimating the true current strength of rapidly developing young players (such as I was once) whose official ratings have been largely frozen for over a year and a half by the lack of in-person chess during the pandemic. Online play is not officially rated. </p>
<p>
For example, if a preteen’s frozen rating is <b>1575</b>, my formula will currently add 25 Elo points times 19 months of the pandemic to make <b>2050</b>. Players with higher ratings and longer track records are adjusted less. In some recent instances, when such kids have defeated players with more-established ratings near 2200, people seeing the 1500s rating in the official tournament table have raised questions. My answer is based on the average performance of <em>many</em> children keen enough to compete in similar-level championship events. Thus my computer-intensive studies are safeguarding the welfare of minors.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Gender Gap and Pipeline in Chess </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My rating solution raises another problem of the kind addressed in our last <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/11/13/popl-2022-et-tu-brute/">post</a>. For a fresh instance, on Monday I submitted my final report on the European Team Championship. This ten-day tournament finished Sunday with the <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/alireza-firouzja-youngest-chess-player-ever-to-break-2800">sensation</a> of Alireza Firouzja becoming the youngest player ever rated over 2800, six months younger than world champion Magnus Carlsen was in 2009. (Carlsen will <a href="https://www.fide.com/news/1445">defend</a> his title starting Friday in Dubai against the Russian Ian Nepomniachtchi.)</p>
<p>
My intrinsic rating performance projections for the men’s/open section were all accurate to within 10 Elo points, within two-sigma error bars about <img alt="{\pm 25}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. When restricted to the 32 juniors (out of 191 total players) whose ratings I adjusted, all projections were within 23 Elo points of the results and their average was within <b>2</b> Elo points—on adjustments averaging 80 Elo points per the 32 players. </p>
<p>
In the women’s section, my gender-neutral formula adjusted up 39 of the 153 female players by an average of 169 Elo. The prescribed amount was larger because their ratings (average 2168) were lower than the 32 junior males’ ratings (average 2419) to begin with. The formula overshot their performance by 113 Elo, and accounted for the bulk of a 36 Elo average shortfall of my projections for the women’s section overall. This continues a pattern of observing not only a lower starting point, but also a lower first derivative when compared to males of the <em>same</em> rating, in tournaments with high junior participation where my adjustments are involved.</p>
<p>
The <em>Queen’s Gambit</em> miniseries magnified awareness of the disparity—witness the <a href="https://womensagenda.com.au/latest/whats-behind-the-gender-imbalance-in-top-level-chess/">article</a> a year ago by the Australian economist and grandmaster David Smerdon, “What’s behind the gender imbalance in top-level chess?” My work offers a new way to pinpoint when and where the male and female pipelines diverge. I do not see how it could <em>solve</em> the disparity, however. Even converting my big spreadsheets of test results into publications is a tall ask—for one, they are considered sensitive data. </p>
<p>
I have discoursed about the theory of my predictive model on this blog, and could say more about the thrill of empirical success in ways much of theory doesn’t reach. But this is still short of solving human problems in the manner of Dick’s intro, let alone solving the gender gap. On that, we’re grateful to have a communication from Rajeev Alur, General Chair of POPL, on how the statistics we noted came about and what the conference is doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> More About POPL 2022 </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Rajeev began by observing that POPL PCs in previous years have been closer to the percentages we quoted for STOC and FOCS: </p>
<ul>
<li>
2021: 15.4% (8/52) <p/>
</li><li>
2020: 14.8% (8/54) <p/>
</li><li>
2019: 11.5% (6/52) <p/>
</li><li>
2018: 23.1% (12/52) <p/>
</li><li>
2017: 17.2% (5/29) <p/>
</li><li>
2016: 21.4% (6/28) <p/>
</li><li>
2015: 20.0% (6/30)
</li></ul>
<p>
A more private figure that he gave us permission to divulge is that the proportion of PC <em>invitations</em> this year was just under 20% for women. Had they accepted at the same rate as them men, there would have been 12 women on the committee this year, as there was in the first year the PC size was expanded in 2018. </p>
<p>
He went on to note an issue also raised in comments to our last post, namely that among the smaller population of women the same people are asked multiple times, leading to more declines. We can put the scaling problem another way: nearly doubling the committee size in 2018 also doubled the ratio of women being invited to their total number. Not all effects of scaling-up keep equal proportion. The root cause of course is not only the smaller population but its smaller first derivative: as Rajeev noted, the latest figures from the Computing Research Association in 2019 show that out of 417 PhDs in POPL-core areas, only 42 (10%) were female.</p>
<p>
The main thing that they are doing is to take the kind of steps pointed up in the quotation from Valerie King in our post. As shown in the POPL 2022 Overview schedule on their <a href="https://popl22.sigplan.org/">front page</a>, they have special lunch and breakfast events for women and LGTBQ attendees (the latter held since <a href="https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-lgbtq-lunch">2020</a>) and mentoring workshops for graduate and undergraduate level students. POPL 2022 is the first to appoint a special Chair for organizing these events, Jeannette Paykin, who we note gave a special quantum-for-POPL <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVMm0PrF-j8">presentation</a> in 2020. </p>
<p>
Next year’s POPL PC will be chaired by <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/amal-ahmed/">Amal Ahmed</a>. Coincidentally, she is Associate Dean for Graduate Programs at Northeastern’s Khoury College where Beth Mynatt will be Dean. <a href="https://alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html">Alexandra Silva</a>, who was on the POPL 2020 PC and on the POPL 2021 Organizing Committee as Accessibility Chair, is one of three Keynote Speakers this year. Hope for the pipeline picking up was raised by the 2021 SIGPLAN Robin Milner Award for Junior Researchers going to <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~emina/">Emina Torlak</a> of UW. </p>
<p>
Of course, it will take a long time to translate the promotion of opportunity into closer parity. The low dip this year is what we noticed, but the long time effect is what our post highlighted at the end. Again we thank Rajeev for bringing both the time range and effort by SIGPLAN and POPL into greater context.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We’ve tried to “zoom out” where theory people are used to zooming in. How can that change perspectives on our field?</p>
<p>
We are also thankful for how our field has branched out and wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving.</p></font></font></div>

    <title>Inria Innovation Prize 2021 to Mateescu, Garavel, Lan and Serwe</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I just learnt that <a href="https://convecs.inria.fr/people/Radu.Mateescu/">Radu Mateescu</a>, <a href="http://convecs.inria.fr/people/Hubert.Garavel/">Hubert Garavel</a>, <a href="http://convecs.inria.fr/people/Frederic.Lang/">Frédéric Lang</a> and <a href="http://convecs.inria.fr/people/Wendelin.Serwe/">Wendelin Serwe</a> from the <a href="http://convecs.inria.fr/">Construction of Verified Concurrent Systems</a> project team at INRIA Grenoble – Rhône-Alpes Centre have been recently awarded the <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/convecs-team-safety-modeling-distributed-parallel-systems" target="_blank">Inria Innovation Prize – Académie des sciences – Dassault Systèmes</a>. Their work contributes to the development of the <a href="https://cadp.inria.fr/" target="_blank">CADP toolbox</a> for modelling and verifying parallel and distributed systems. The aim of that project is to automatically detect design flaws in highly complex systems.   Readers of this blog will be as delighted as I am by this news. CADP is one of the tools from the concurrency community that has the longest history, dating back to its early releases in 1989. It has been used to good effect in a variety of applications, is still under continuous development and makes excellent use of classic tools from concurrency theory in practice. By way of example, let me mention the recent successes by the Convecs team in dealing with difficult challenges posed by Bernhard Steffen and his team on the evaluation of CTL and LTL formulae on large products of automata. (See, for instance, the news items <a href="http://cadp.inria.fr/news12.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://cadp.inria.fr/news13.html#section-3" target="_blank">here</a>.) Traditional model checkers fail on those challenges because the state space of the product automata is too large for them. However, a wise use of bisimulations and congruence results allows CADP to solve many of those challenges.   Congratulations to the whole CADP team and to the concurrency community for this award!</div>

    <title>TR21-169 |  Hypercontractivity on High Dimensional Expanders: a Local-to-Global Approach for Higher Moments | 

	Max Hopkins, 

	Mitali Bafna, 

	Tali Kaufman, 

	Shachar Lovett</title>
    <summary>Hypercontractivity is one of the most powerful tools in Boolean function analysis. Originally studied over the discrete hypercube, recent years have seen increasing interest in extensions to settings like the $p$-biased cube, slice, or Grassmannian, where variants of hypercontractivity have found a number of breakthrough applications including the resolution of Khot’s 2-2 Games Conjecture (Khot, Minzer, Safra FOCS 2018). In this work, we develop a new theory of hypercontractivity on high dimensional expanders (HDX), an important class of expanding complexes that has recently seen similarly impressive applications in both coding theory and approximate sampling. Our results lead to a new understanding of the structure of Boolean functions on HDX, including a tight analog of the KKL Theorem and a new characterization of non-expanding sets. 

Unlike previous settings satisfying hypercontractivity, HDX can be asymmetric, sparse, and very far from products, which makes the application of traditional proof techniques challenging. We handle these barriers with the introduction of two new tools of independent interest: a new explicit combinatorial Fourier basis for HDX that behaves well under restriction, and a new local-to-global method for analyzing higher moments. Interestingly, unlike analogous second moment methods that apply equally across all types of expanding complexes, our tools rely inherently on simplicial structure. This suggests a new distinction among high dimensional expanders based upon their behavior beyond the second moment.</summary>

    <title>TR21-168 |  Hypercontractivity on High Dimensional Expanders | 

	Tom Gur, 

	Noam Lifshitz, 

	Siqi Liu</title>
    <summary>We prove hypercontractive inequalities on high dimensional expanders. As in the settings of the p-biased hypercube, the symmetric group, and the Grassmann scheme, our inequalities are effective for global functions, which are functions that are not significantly affected by a restriction of a small set of coordinates. As applications, we obtain Fourier concentration, small-set expansion, and Kruskal-Katona theorems for high dimensional expanders. Our techniques rely on a new approximate Efron-Stein decomposition for high dimensional link expanders.</summary>

obtained by solving a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Having introduced
our optimal noise design formulation, we derive closed form solutions for the

unbounded arity. It is well known that tractability of the problem can be
characterised in terms of the queries treewidth under the assumption of bounded
arity. We extend this result to cases with unbounded arity but degree 2. To do
so, we introduce hypergraph dilutions as an alternative method to primal graph
minors for studying substructures of hypergraphs. Using dilutions we observe an
analogue to the Excluded Grid Theorem for degree 2 hypergraphs. In consequence,
we show that that the tractability of conjunctive query answering can be
characterised in terms of generalised hypertree width. A similar
characterisation is also shown for the corresponding counting problem. We also
generalise our main structural result to arbitrary bounded degree and discuss
possible paths towards a characterisation of the bounded degree case.

indivisible goods in the setting where a social network on the agents is given.
Notions of fairness in this context are "localized", that is, agents are only
concerned about the bundles allocated to their neighbors, rather than every
other agent in the system. We comprehensively address the computational
complexity of finding locally envy-free and Pareto efficient allocations in the
setting where the agents have binary valuations for the goods and the
underlying social network is modeled by an undirected graph. We study the
problem in the framework of parameterized complexity.
</p>
<p>We show that the problem is computationally intractable even in fairly
restricted scenarios, for instance, even when the underlying graph is a path.
We show NP-hardness for settings where the graph has only two distinct
valuations among the agents. We demonstrate W-hardness with respect to the
number of goods or the size of the vertex cover of the underlying graph. We
also consider notions of proportionality that respect the structure of the
underlying graph and show that two natural versions of this notion have
different complexities: allocating according to the notion that accounts for
locality to the greatest degree turns out to be computationally intractable,
while for other notions, the allocation problem can be modeled as a structured
ILP which can be solved efficiently.

is measured as the total number of bits transmitted globally in the network. In
this paper, we study a variation called local communication complexity in which
performance instead measures the maximum number of bits sent or received at any
one player. We focus on a simple model where $n$ players, each with one input
bit, execute a protocol by exchanging messages to compute a function on the $n$
input bits. We ask what can and cannot be solved with a small local
communication complexity in this setting. We begin by establishing a
non-trivial lower bound on the local complexity for a specific function by
proving that counting the number of $1$'s among the first $17$ input bits
distributed among the participants requires a local complexity strictly greater
than $1$. We further investigate whether harder counting problems of this type
can yield stronger lower bounds, providing a largely negative answer by showing
that constant local complexity is sufficient to count the number $1$ bits over
the entire input, and therefore compute any symmetric function. In addition to
counting, we show that both sorting and searching can be computed in constant
local complexity. We then use the counting solution as a subroutine to
demonstrate that constant local complexity is also sufficient to compute many
standard modular arithmetic operations on two operands, including: comparisons,
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Finally we
establish that function $GCD(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are in the range $[1,n]$
has local complexity of $O(1)$. Our work highlights both new techniques for
proving lower bounds on this metric and the power of even a small amount of
local communication.

    <title>TR21-167 |  Post-Quantum Zero Knowledge, Revisited (or: How to Do Quantum Rewinding Undetectably) | 

	Alex Lombardi, 

	Fermi Ma, 

	Nicholas Spooner</title>
    <summary>A major difficulty in quantum rewinding is the fact that measurement is destructive: extracting information from a quantum state irreversibly changes it. This is especially problematic in the context of zero-knowledge simulation, where preserving the adversary's state is essential.
    
    In this work, we develop new techniques for quantum rewinding in the context of extraction and zero-knowledge simulation:
    
1. We show how to extract information from a quantum adversary by rewinding it without disturbing its internal state. We use this technique to prove that important interactive protocols, such as the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson protocol for graph non-isomorphism and the Feige-Shamir protocol for NP, are zero-knowledge against quantum adversaries. 

2. We prove that the Goldreich-Kahan protocol for NP is post-quantum zero knowledge using a simulator that can be seen as a natural quantum extension of the classical simulator. 

Our results achieve (constant-round) black-box zero-knowledge with negligible simulation error, appearing to contradict a recent impossibility result due to Chia-Chung-Liu-Yamakawa (FOCS 2021). This brings us to our final contribution:

3. We introduce coherent-runtime expected quantum polynomial time, a computational model that (a) captures all of our zero-knowledge simulators, (b) cannot break any polynomial hardness assumptions, and (c) is not subject to the CCLY impossibility. In light of our positive results and the CCLY negative results, we propose coherent-runtime simulation to be the right quantum analogue of classical expected polynomial-time simulation.</summary>

In particular, I was a bit dismayed that the authors did not post the raw number of seropositive cases in their study, preventing me from computing standard statistical analyses of their results. I also objected to the number of statistical regressions run to pull signals out of a very complex intervention.</p>

<p>Recently, the authors were kind enough to release their <a href="https://gitlab.com/emily-crawford/bd-mask-rct">code and data</a>. I send nothing but kudos to them in this regard. Releasing code and data can help disambiguate questions that are not always answerable from papers alone. In fact, I was immediately able to answer my question by querying their data. In this post, I will walk through a simple analysis to estimate the efficacy of their proposed intervention.</p>

<p>In the Bangladesh Mask RCT, there were $n_C=$163,861 individuals from 300 villages in the control group. There were $n_T=$178,322 individuals from 300 villages in the intervention group. The main end point of the study was whether their intervention reduced the number of individuals who both reported covid-like symptoms and tested seropositive at some point during the trial. The number of such individuals appears nowhere in their paper, and one has to compute this from the data they kindly provided: There were $i_C=$1,106 symptomatic individuals confirmed seropositive in the control group and $i_T=$1,086 such individuals in the treatment group. The difference between the two groups was small: only <em>20 cases</em> out of over 340,000 individuals over a span of 8 weeks.</p>

<p>I have a hard time going from these numbers to the assured conclusions that “masks work” that was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/masks-were-working-all-along/619989/">promulgated</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02457-y">by</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/largest-study-masks-yet-details-importance-fighting-covid-19-rcna1858">the</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/01/masks-study-covid-bangladesh/">media</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/26/opinion/do-masks-work-for-covid-prevention.html">the authors</a> after this preprint appeared. This study was not blinded, as it’s impossible to blind a study on masks. The intervention was highly complex and included a mask promotion campaign and education about other mitigation measures including social distancing. Moreover, individuals were only added to the study if they consented to allow the researchers to visit and survey their household. There was a large differential between the control and treatment groups here, with 95% consenting in the treatment group but only 92% consenting in control. <em>This differential alone could wash away the difference in observed cases.</em> Finally, symptomatic seropositivity is a crude measure of covid as the individuals could have been infected before the trial began.</p>

<p>Given the numerous caveats and confounders, the study still only found a tiny effect size. My takeaway is that a complex intervention including an educational program, free masks, encouraged mask wearing, and surveillance in a poor country with low population immunity and no vaccination showed at best modest reduction in infection. I think this summary is fair to the study authors. And this is valuable information to have! It reaffirms my priors that non-pharmaceutical interventions are challenging to implement and have only modest benefits in the presence of a highly contagious respiratory infection. But your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, of course, this was not the message that the majority of the media took away from this study. Instead we were told that this trial finally confirmed that masks worked. I think one of the key confusing points was <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2021/08/13/relative-risk/">using “efficacy” instead of relative risk</a> as a measure of intervention power.</p>

<p>One of the dark tricks of biostatistics is moving away from absolute case counts to  measures of risk such as relative risk reduction, efficacy, or the odds ratio. All of these measures are relative, and they tend to exaggerate effects. The relative risk reduction is the ratio of the rate of infection in the treatment group to the rate of infection in the control group</p>

\[{\small
    RR = \frac{i_T/n_T}{i_C/n_C}\,.
}\]

<p>A small $RR$ corresponds to a large reduction in risk. For the mask study, $RR=$0.9. That’s not a lot of risk reduction: in this study, community masking improved an individual’s risk of infection by a factor of only 1.1x. As a convenient comparator, the $RR$ in the MRNA vaccine trials was 0.05. In this case, vaccines reduce the risk of symptomatic infection by a factor of 20x.</p>

<p>The academic vaccine community unfortunately uses “efficacy” or “effectiveness” to describe relative risk reduction. <a href="http://www.argmin.net/xxx">Efficacy is a confusing, commonly misinterpreted metric</a>. Efficacy in a trial is one minus the relative risk reduction:</p>

\[{\small
EFF = 1-RR\,,
}\]

<p>reported as a percentage. So if the $RR=$0.9, then $EFF=$10%.</p>

<p>The important thing to realize about efficacy is that the range from 0% to 20% is barely better than nothing. Here, even a 20% efficacy corresponds to a reduction of risk by a factor of 1.25x. 1.25x is not literally nothing, but it’s also not enough to halt a highly contagious respiratory infection. For what it’s worth, a vaccine with 20% efficacy would not be approved. Another major flaw of using efficacy as a metric is that it is highly nonlinear. The difference between 10% and 20% efficacy is very small whereas the difference between 85% and 95% is huge, corresponding to a 7-fold and 20-fold risk reduction respectively. Efficacy is a nonlinear metric, but these percentages are bandied around as if they are linear effects, and this adds confusion to the public dialogue.</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="The relationship between effectiveness and risk reduction is highly nonlinear" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/eff_v_rr.png" width="65%"/></p>

<p>To further dive into the absurdity of efficacy, let’s examine the claim that “cloth masks” worked less well than “surgical masks.” This is too strong an observation to be gleaned from the data. The preprint provides two stratified calculations to estimate the efficacy of types of masks. In the first case, the authors analyzed villages randomized to only be given surgical masks and their matched control villages. In this case there were 190 pairs of villages consisting of $n_C=$103,247 individuals in the control group and $n_T=$113,082 individuals in the treatment group. They observed $i_C=$774 symptomatic and seropositive individuals in the control group and $i_T=$756 symptomatic and seropositive individuals in the treatment group. <em>This is a difference of 18 individuals.</em> The corresponding efficacy is 11%, still woefully low.</p>

<p>We can do a similar analysis for the villages only given cloth masks. There were 96 pairs of villages consisting of $n_C=$53,691 individuals in the control group and $n_T=$57,415 individuals in the treatment group. They observed $i_C=$332 symptomatic and seropositive individuals in the control group and $i_T=$330 symptomatic and seropositive individuals in the treatment group. <em>This is a difference of only 2 individuals.</em> Certainly, no one would put much faith in an intervention where we see a difference of 2 cases in a study with over one hundred thousand people. However, to further demonstrate the absurdity of the notion of efficacy, the observed efficacy for cloth masks in this study is 7%. I think in many people’s minds, the difference between 7% and 11% is small. And 7% should be considered “no effect” as should 11%. <del>As a final absurd comparison, the study data shows cloth masks are more efficacious than purple surgical masks where the estimated efficacy is 0% ($n_C=$27,918, $n_T=$29,541, $i_C=$177, $i_T=$187)!</del> (<em>Ed note: turns out the purple masks were cloth. So the cloth purple masks did nothing, but the red masks “work.” Indeed, red masks were more effective than surgical masks!)</em> Certainly, comparing a bunch of such small effects is not telling us much.</p>

<p>Anyone who spends too much time around statisticians will note that I never once tried to compute a p-value for any of these results. As I’ve belabored, obsession with statistical significance distracts us from discussing effect sizes. We should be able to just look at the effect size and conclude the study did not find a significant impact of masks on coronavirus spread. We don’t need a p-value to tell us 10% efficacy is not helpful in this context. But it’s also important to note that you can’t just run a standard binomial test on this data because it is cluster-randomized and the subjects are anything but independent. In the next blog, just for the sake of academic navel gazing, I’ll discuss the lack of statistical significance of this study and show why cluster randomized trials are inherently more challenging to interpret than standard RCTs.</p></div>

    <title>Finding an element with nonadaptive questions</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Suppose you have a non-empty subset S of {1,...N} and want to find an element of S. You can ask arbitrary questions of the form "Does S contain an element in A?" for some A a subset of {1,...N}. How many questions do you need?</p><p>Of course you can use binary search, using questions of the form "is there number greater than <i>m</i> in S?". This takes log N questions and it's easy to show that's tight.</p><p>What if you have to ask all the questions ahead of time before you get any of the answers? Now binary search won't work. If |S|=1 you can ask "is there a number in S whose <i>i</i>th bit is one?" That also takes log N questions.</p><p>For arbitrary S the situation is trickier. With randomness you still don't need too many questions. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02579206">Mulmuley, Vazirani and Vazirani</a>'s isolating lemma works as follows: For each i &lt;= log N, pick a random weight w<sub>i</sub> between 1 and 2 log N. For each element m in S, let the weight of m be the sum of the weights of the bits of m that are 1. With probability at least 1/2 there will be an m with an unique minimum weight. There's a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/07/new-proof-of-isolation-lemma.html">cool proof</a> of an isolating lemma by Noam Ta-Shma.</p><p>Once you have this lemma, you can ask questions of the form "Given a list of w<sub>i</sub>'s and a value v, is there an m in S of weight v whose jth bit is 1?" Choosing w<sub>i</sub> and v at random you have a 1/O(log N) chance of a single m whose weight is v, and trying all j will give you a witness. </p><p>Randomness is required. The X-search problem described by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0000(88)90027-X">Karp, Upfal and Wigderson</a> shows that any deterministic procedure requires essentially N queries. </p><p>This all came up because Bill had some colleagues looking a similar problems testing machines for errors. </p><p>I've been interested in the related question of finding satisfying assignments using non-adaptive NP queries. The results are similar to the above. In particular, you can randomly find a satisfying assignment with high probability using a polynomial number of non-adaptive NP queries. It follows from the techniques above, and even earlier papers, but I haven't been able to track down a reference for the first paper to do so.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-166 |  Average-case Hardness of NP and PH from Worst-case Fine-grained Assumptions | 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Shuichi Hirahara, 

	Neekon Vafa</title>
    <summary>What is a minimal worst-case complexity assumption that implies non-trivial average-case hardness of NP or PH? This question is well motivated by the theory of fine-grained average-case complexity and fine-grained cryptography. In this paper, we show that several standard worst-case complexity assumptions are sufficient to imply non-trivial average-case hardness of NP or PH:
    
    1. NTIME[$n$] cannot be solved in quasi-linear time on average if UP is not in DTIME[$2^{\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{n}\right)}$].
    
    2. $\Sigma_2$TIME[$n$] cannot be solved in quasi-linear time on average if $\Sigma_k$SAT cannot be solved in time $2^{\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{n}\right)}$ for some constant $k$. Previously, it was not known if even average-case hardness of $\Sigma_3$SAT implies the average-case hardness of $\Sigma_2$TIME[$n$].
    
    3. Under the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH), there is no average-case $n^{1+\varepsilon}$-time algorithm for NTIME[$n$] whose running time can be estimated in time $n^{1+\varepsilon}$ for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$.
    
    Our results are given by generalizing the non-black-box worst-case-to-average-case connections presented by Hirahara (STOC 2021) to the settings of fine-grained complexity. To do so, we construct quite efficient complexity-theoretic pseudorandom generators under the assumption that the nondeterministic linear time is easy on average, which may be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>TR21-165 |  Improved Merlin-Arthur Protocols for Central Problems in Fine-Grained Complexity | 

	Shyan Akmal, 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Ce Jin, 

	Malvika Raj, 

	Ryan Williams</title>
    <summary>In a Merlin-Arthur proof system, the proof verifier (Arthur) accepts valid proofs (from Merlin) with probability $1$, and rejects invalid proofs with probability arbitrarily close to $1$. The running time of such a system is defined to be the length of Merlin's proof plus the running time of Arthur.  We provide new Merlin-Arthur proof systems for some key problems in fine-grained complexity. In several cases our proof systems have optimal running time. Our main results include:

$\bullet$ Certifying that a list of $n$ integers has no 3-SUM solution can be done in Merlin-Arthur time $\tilde{O}(n)$. Previously, Carmosino et al. [ITCS 2016] showed that the problem has a nondeterministic algorithm running in $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$  time (that is, there is a proof system with proofs of length $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ and a deterministic verifier running in $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ time).

$\bullet$ Counting the number of $k$-cliques with total edge weight equal to zero in an $n$-node graph can be done in Merlin-Arthur time $\tilde O(n^{\lceil k/2\rceil })$ (where $k\ge 3$). For odd $k$, this bound can be further improved for sparse graphs: for example, counting the number of zero-weight triangles in an $m$-edge graph can be done in Merlin-Arthur time $\tilde O(m)$. Previous Merlin-Arthur protocols by Williams [CCC'16] and Bj\"orklund and Kaski [PODC'16] could only count $k$-cliques in unweighted graphs, and had worse running times for small $k$.

$\bullet$ Computing the All-Pairs Shortest Distances matrix for an $n$-node graph can be done in Merlin-Arthur time $\tilde{O}(n^2)$. Note this is optimal, as the matrix can have $\Omega(n^2)$ nonzero entries in general. Previously, Carmosino et al. [ITCS 2016] showed that this problem has an $\tilde{O}(n^{2.94})$ nondeterministic time algorithm.

$\bullet$ Certifying that an $n$-variable $k$-CNF is unsatisfiable can be done in Merlin-Arthur time $2^{n/2 - n/O(k)}$. We also observe an algebrization barrier for the previous $2^{n/2}\cdot \mathrm{poly}(n)$-time Merlin-Arthur protocol of R. Williams [CCC'16] for $\#$SAT: in particular, his protocol algebrizes, and we observe there is no algebrizing protocol for $k$-UNSAT running in $2^{n/2}/n^{\omega(1)}$ time. Therefore we have to exploit non-algebrizing properties to obtain our new protocol.


$\bullet$ Certifying a Quantified Boolean Formula is true can be done in Merlin-Arthur time $2^{4n/5}\cdot \mathrm{poly}(n)$. Previously, the only nontrivial result known along these lines was an Arthur-Merlin-Arthur protocol (where Merlin's proof depends on some of Arthur's coins) running in $2^{2n/3}\cdot\mathrm{poly}(n)$ time. 

Due to the centrality of these problems in fine-grained complexity, our results have consequences for many other problems of interest. For example, our work implies that certifying there is no Subset Sum solution to $n$ integers can be done in Merlin-Arthur time $2^{n/3}\cdot\mathrm{poly}(n)$, improving on the previous best protocol by Nederlof [IPL 2017] which took $2^{0.49991n}\cdot\mathrm{poly}(n)$ time.</summary>

    <title>TR21-164 |  The Acrobatics of BQP | 

	Scott Aaronson, 

	DeVon Ingram, 

	William Kretschmer</title>
    <summary>We show that, in the black-box setting, the behavior of quantum polynomial-time (${BQP}$) can be remarkably decoupled from that of classical complexity classes like ${NP}$. Specifically:

-There exists an oracle relative to which ${NP}^{{BQP}}\not \subset {BQP}^{{PH}}$, resolving a 2005 problem of Fortnow. Interpreted another way, we show that ${AC^0}$ circuits cannot perform useful homomorphic encryption on instances of the Forrelation problem. As a corollary, there exists an oracle relative to which ${P} = {NP}$ but ${BQP} \neq {QCMA}$.
-Conversely, there exists an oracle relative to which ${BQP}^{{NP}}\not \subset {PH}^{{BQP}}$.
-Relative to a random oracle, ${PP} = {PostBQP}$ is not contained in the "${QMA}$ hierarchy" ${QMA}^{{QMA}^{{QMA}^{\cdots}}}$, and more generally ${PP} \not\subset ({MIP}^*)^{({MIP}^*)^{({MIP}^*)^{\cdots}}}$ (!), despite the fact that ${MIP}^{\ast}={RE}$ in the unrelativized world. This result shows that there is no black-box quantum analogue of Stockmeyer's approximate counting algorithm.
-Relative to a random oracle, ${\Sigma}_{k+1}^{P} \not\subset {BQP}^{{\Sigma}_{k}^{P}}$ for every $k$.
-There exists an oracle relative to which ${BQP} = {P^{\# P}}$ and yet ${PH}$ is infinite. (By contrast, if ${NP}\subseteq{BPP}$, then ${PH}$ collapses relative to all oracles.)
-There exists an oracle relative to which ${P}={NP} \neq {BQP}={P}^{{\#P}}$.

To achieve these results, we build on the 2018 achievement by Raz and Tal of an oracle relative to which ${BQP}\not \subset {PH}$, and associated results about the Forrelation problem. We also introduce new tools that might be of independent interest. These include a "quantum-aware" version of the random restriction method, a concentration theorem for the block sensitivity of ${AC^0}$ circuits, and a (provable) analogue of the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture for sparse oracles.</summary>

    <title>TR21-163 |  Algorithmizing the Multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel Lemma | 

	Siddharth Bhandari, 

	Prahladh Harsha, 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	A. Shankar</title>
    <summary>The multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma asserts that over a field, a low-degree polynomial cannot vanish with high multiplicity very often on a sufficiently large product set. Since its discovery in a work of Dvir, Kopparty, Saraf and Sudan [DKSS13], the lemma has found nu- merous applications in both math and computer science; in particular, in the definition and properties of multiplicity codes by Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin [KSY14].

In this work, we show how to algorithmize the multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma for ar- bitrary product sets over any field. In other words, we give an efficient algorithm for unique decoding of multivariate multiplicity codes from half their minimum distance on arbitrary product sets over all fields. Previously, such an algorithm was known either when the un- derlying product set had a nice algebraic structure (for instance, was a subfield) [Kop15] or when the underlying field had large (or zero) characteristic, the multiplicity parameter was sufficiently large and the multiplicity code had distance bounded away from 1 [BHKS21]. In particular, even unique decoding of bivariate multiplicity codes with multiplicity two from half their minimum distance was not known over arbitrary product sets over any field.

Our algorithm builds upon a result of Kim &amp; Kopparty [KK17] who gave an algorithmic version of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma (without multiplicities) or equivalently, an efficient al- gorithm for unique decoding of Reed-Muller codes over arbitrary product sets. We introduce a refined notion of distance based on the multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma and design a unique decoding algorithm for this distance measure. On the way, we give an alternate proof of Forney’s classical generalized minimum distance decoder that might be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>TR21-162 |  Fast, Algebraic Multivariate Multipoint Evaluation in Small Characteristic and Applications |

    <summary>Multipoint evaluation is the computational task of evaluating a polynomial given as a list of coefficients at a given set of inputs. Besides being a natural and fundamental question in computer algebra on its own, fast algorithms for this problem is also closely related to fast algorithms for other natural algebraic questions like polynomial factorization and modular composition. And while \emph{nearly linear time} algorithms have been known for the univariate instance of multipoint evaluation  for close to five decades due to a work of Borodin and Moenck \cite{BM74}, fast algorithms for the multivariate version have been much harder to come by. In a significant improvement to the state of art for this problem, Umans \cite{Umans08} and Kedlaya \&amp; Umans \cite{Kedlaya11} gave nearly linear time algorithms for this problem over field of small characteristic and over all finite fields respectively, provided that the number of variables $n$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ where the degree of the input polynomial in every variable is less than $d$. They also stated the question of designing fast algorithms for the large variable case (i.e. $n \notin d^{o(1)}$) as an open problem. 

In this work, we show that there is a deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over a field $\F_{q}$ of characteristic $p$ which evaluates an $n$-variate polynomial of degree less than $d$ in each variable on $N$ inputs in time $$\left((N + d^n)^{1 + o(1)}\poly(\log q, d, p, n)\right) \, ,$$ provided that $p$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$, and $q$ is at most $(\exp(\exp(\exp(\cdots (\exp(d)))))$, where the height of this tower of exponentials is fixed. When the number of variables is large (e.g. $n \notin d^{o(1)}$), this is the first {nearly linear} time algorithm for this problem over any (large enough) field.

Our algorithm is based on elementary algebraic ideas and this algebraic structure naturally leads to the following two independently interesting applications.

\begin{itemize}
\item We  show that there is an \emph{algebraic} data structure for univariate polynomial evaluation with nearly linear space complexity and sublinear time complexity over finite fields of small characteristic and quasipolynomially bounded size. This  provides a counterexample to a conjecture of Milterson \cite{M95} who conjectured that over small finite fields, any algebraic data structure for polynomial evaluation using  polynomial space must have linear query complexity. 

 \item We also show that over finite fields of small characteristic and quasipolynomially bounded size,  Vandermonde matrices are not rigid enough to  yield size-depth tradeoffs for linear circuits via the current quantitative bounds in Valiant's program \cite{Valiant1977}. More precisely, for every fixed prime $p$, we show that for every constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, and large enough $n$, the rank of any $n \times n$ Vandermonde matrix $V$ over the field $\F_{p^a}$ can be reduced to $
   \left(n/\exp(\Omega(\poly(\epsilon)\sqrt{\log n}))\right) $ by changing at most $n^{\Theta(\epsilon)}$ entries in every row of $V$, provided $a \leq \poly(\log n)$. Prior to this work, similar upper bounds on rigidity were known only for special Vandermonde matrices. For instance, the Discrete Fourier Transform matrices and Vandermonde matrices with generators in a geometric progression \cite{DL20}.

    <title>CS Slow to Change?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Back in March of 2019 <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/03/scooped.html">I wrote</a></p><blockquote><p>I was also going to post about Yann LeCun's Facebook rant about stodgy CS departments but then Yann goes ahead and wins a Turing award with Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio for their work on machine learning. I knew Yann from when we worked together at NEC Research in the early 2000's and let's just congratulate him and the others and let them bask in glory for truly transforming how we think of computing today. I'll get back to his post soon enough.</p></blockquote><p>So not that soon. Yann's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10152719972317143&amp;id=722677142">post</a> was from 2015 where he went after "stodgy" CS departments naming Yale, Harvard, Princeton and Chicago.</p><blockquote><p>CS is a quickly evolving field.  Because of excess conservatism, these departments have repeatedly missed important trends in CS and related field, such as Data Science. They seem to view CS as meaning strictly theory, crypto, systems and programming  languages, what some have called "core CS", paying lip service to graphics, vision, machine learning, AI, HCI, robotics, etc. But these areas are the ones that have been expanding the fastest in the last decades, particularly machine learning and computer vision in the last decade....It is quite common, and somewhat natural, that newer areas (eg ML) be looked down upon by members of older, more established areas (eg Theory and Systems). After all, scientists are professional skeptics. But in a fast evolving disciplines like CS and now Data Science, an excessive aversion to risk and change is a recipe for failure.</p></blockquote><p>We've seen some changes since. Yale's Statistics Department is now <a href="https://statistics.yale.edu/">Statistics and Data Science</a>. The University of Chicago has a new Data Science <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/new-college-data-science-major-foundations-insight-impact">undergrad major</a> and <a href="https://cdac.uchicago.edu/insights/introducing-the-uchicago-data-science-institute/">institute</a>.</p><p>I wonder if that's the future. CS doesn't really change that much, at least not quickly. Data science, and perhaps cybersecurity, evolve as separate fields which only have limited intersection with traditional CS. The CS degree itself just focuses on those interested in how the machines work and the theory behind them. We're busy trying to figure this out at Illinois Tech as are most other schools. And what about augmented/virtual reality and the metaverse, quantum computing, fintech, social networks, human and social factors and so on? How do you choose which bets to make? </p><p>Most of all, universities, traditionally slowly moving machines, need to far more agile even in fields outside computing since the digital transformation is affecting everything. How do you plan degrees when the computing landscape when students graduate is different from when they start? </p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>About IBM’s new <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/127-qubit-quantum-processor-eagle">127-qubit superconducting chip</a>:</strong> As I <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2297583-ibm-creates-largest-ever-superconducting-quantum-computer/">told <em>New Scientist</em></a>, I look forward to seeing the actual details!  As far as I could see, the marketing materials that IBM released yesterday take a lot of words to say absolutely nothing about what, to experts, is the single most important piece of information: namely, <em>what are the gate fidelities?</em>  How deep of a quantum circuit can they apply?  How have they benchmarked the chip?  Right now, all I have to go on is a <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services?services=systems&amp;order=qubits%20DESC&amp;view=table&amp;system=ibm_washington">stats page</a> for the new chip, <s>which reports its average CNOT error as 0.9388—in other words, close to 1, or terrible! (But see also a <a href="https://twitter.com/decodoku/status/1460622008916627456?s=21">tweet by James Wootton</a>, which explains that such numbers are often highly misleading when a new chip is first rolled out.)  Does anyone here have more information?</s>  <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (11/17):</span></strong> As of this morning, the average CNOT error has been updated to 2%.  Thanks to multiple commenters for letting me know!</p>



<p><strong>About the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14502">new simulation</a> of Google’s 53-qubit Sycamore chip in 5 minutes on a Sunway supercomputer (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01066">here</a>):</strong> This is an exciting step forward on the classical validation of quantum supremacy experiments, and—ironically, what currently amounts to almost the same thing—on the classical <em>spoofing</em> of those experiments.  Congratulations to the team in China that achieved this!  But there are two crucial things to understand.  First, “5 minutes” refers to the time needed to calculate a <em>single</em> amplitude (or perhaps, several correlated amplitudes) using tensor network contraction.  It doesn’t refer to the time needed to generate millions of <em>independent</em> noisy samples, which is what Google’s Sycamore chip does in 3 minutes.  For the latter task, more like a week still seems to be needed on the supercomputer.  (I’m grateful to Chu Guo, a coauthor of the new work who spoke in UT Austin’s weekly quantum Zoom meeting, for clarifying this point.)  Second, the Sunway supercomputer has parallel processing power equivalent to approximately ten million of your laptop.  Thus, even if we agreed that Google no longer had quantum supremacy as measured by time, it would still have quantum supremacy as measured by carbon footprint!  (And this despite the fact that the quantum computer itself requires a noisy, closet-sized dilution fridge.)  Even so, for me the new work underscores the point that quantum supremacy is not yet a done deal.  Over the next few years, I hope that Google and USTC, as well as any new entrants to this race (IBM? IonQ? Harvard? Rigetti?), will push forward with more qubits and, even more importantly, better gate fidelities leading to higher Linear Cross-Entropy scores.  Meanwhile, we theorists should try to do our part by inventing new and better protocols with which to demonstrate near-term quantum supremacy—<em>especially</em> protocols for which the classical verification is easier.</p>



<p><strong>About the new anti-woke <a href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/we-cant-wait-for-universities-to">University of Austin</a> (UATX):</strong> In general, I’m extremely happy for people to experiment with new and different institutions, and of course I’m happy for more intellectual activity in my adopted city of Austin.  And, as <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers will know, I’m probably more sympathetic than most to the reality of the problem that UATX is trying to solve—living, as we do, in an era when one academic after another has been cancelled for ideas that a mere decade ago would’ve been considered unexceptional, moderate, center-left.  Having said all that, I wish I could feel more optimistic about UATX’s prospects.  I found its <a href="https://www.uaustin.org/">website</a> heavy on free-speech rhetoric but frustratingly light on what the new university is actually going to <em>do</em>: what courses it will offer, who will teach them, where the campus will be, etc. etc.  Arguably this is all excusable for a university still in ramp-up mode, but had I been in their shoes, I might have held off on the public launch until I had at least some sample content to offer.  Certainly, the fact that Steven Pinker has <a href="https://www.uaustin.org/news/uatx-statement-about-robert-zimmer-and-steven-pinker">quit UATX’s advisory board</a> is a discouraging sign.  If UATX asks me to get involved—to lecture there, to give them advice about their CS program, etc.—I’ll consider it as I would any other request.  So far, though, they haven’t.</p>



<p><strong>About the Association for Mathematical Research:</strong> Last month, some colleagues invited me to join a brand-new society called the <a href="https://amathr.org/">Association for Mathematical Research</a>.  Many of the other founders (Joel Hass, Abigail Thompson, Colin Adams, Richard Borcherds, Jeff Cheeger, Pavel Etingof, Tom Hales, Jeff Lagarias, Mark Lackenby, Cliff Taubes, …) were brilliant mathematicians who I admired, they seemed like they could use a bit of theoretical computer science representation, there was no time commitment, maybe they’d eventually do something good, so I figured why not?  Alas, to say that AMR has proved unpopular on Twitter would be an understatement: it’s received the same contemptuous reception that UATX has.  The argument seems to be: starting a new mathematical society, even an avowedly diverse and apolitical one, is really just an implicit claim that the existing societies, like the <a href="https://www.maa.org/">Mathematical Association of America (MAA)</a>  and the <a href="https://www.ams.org/home/page">American Mathematical Society (AMS)</a>, have been co-opted by woke true-believers.  But that’s paranoid and insane!  I mean, it’s not as if an <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/inclusionexclusion/">AMS blog</a> has called for the <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/inclusionexclusion/2017/05/11/get-out-the-way/#more-772">mass resignation</a> of white male mathematicians to make room for the marginalized, or the boycott of Israeli universities, or the abolition of the criminal justice system <font size="-3"><em>(what to do about Kyle Rittenhouse though?)</em></font>.  Still, even though claims of that sort of co-option are obviously far-out, rabid fantasies, yeah, I did decide to give a new organization the benefit of the doubt.  AMR might well fail or languish in obscurity, just like UATX might.  On the other hand, the barriers to making a positive difference for the intellectual world, the world I love, the world under constant threat from the self-certain ideologues of every side, do strike me as orders of magnitude smaller for a new professional society than they do for a new university.</p></div>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Classic models of communication in economics typically assume agents can communicate any message.  However, many important communications, such as those in newspapers or politicians’ speeches, use data to convey information.  In this talk, we explore how the reliance on data impacts communication.  In our model, there are two Bayesian agents (a sender and a receiver) who wish to communicate. The receiver must take an action whose payoff depends on their personal preferences and an unknown state of the world. The sender has access to a collection of data points correlated with the state of the world and can send exactly one of these to the receiver in order to influence her choice of action. Importantly, the sender’s personal preferences may differ from the receiver’s, which affects the sender’s strategic choice of what to send. We show that in a Nash equilibrium even a small difference in preferences can lead to a significant bias in the communicated datum. This can significantly reduce informativeness of the communication, leading to substantial utility loss for both sides. One implication is informational homophily: a receiver can rationally prefer to obtain data from a poorly-informed sender with aligned preferences, rather than a knowledgeable expert whose preferences may differ from her own.  </p>

    <title>TR21-161 |  On Worst-Case Learning in Relativized Heuristica | 

	Mikito Nanashima, 

	Shuichi Hirahara</title>
    <summary>A PAC learning model involves two worst-case requirements: a learner must learn all functions in a class on all example distributions. However, basing the hardness of learning on NP-hardness has remained a key challenge for decades. In fact, recent progress in computational complexity suggests the possibility that a weaker assumption might be sufficient for worst-case learning than the feasibility of worst-case algorithms for NP problems.

In this study, we investigate whether these worst-case requirements for learning are satisfied on the basis of only average-case assumptions in order to understand the nature of learning. First, we construct a strong worst-case learner based on the assumption that DistNP $\subseteq$ AvgP, i.e., in Heuristica. Our learner agnostically learns all polynomial-size circuits on all unknown P/poly-samplable distributions in polynomial time, where the complexity of learning depends on the complexity of sampling examples. Second, we study the limitation of relativizing constructions of learners based on average-case heuristic algorithms. Specifically, we construct a powerful oracle such that DistPH $\subseteq$ AvgP, i.e., every problem in PH is easy on average, whereas UP $\cap$ coUP and PAC learning on almost-uniform distributions are hard even for $2^{n/\omega(\log n)}$-time algorithms in the relativized world, which improves the oracle separation presented by Impagliazzo (CCC 2011). The core concept of our improvements is the consideration of a switching lemma on a large alphabet, which may be of independent interest. The lower bound on the time complexity is nearly optimal because Hirahara (STOC 2021) showed that DistPH $\subseteq$ AvgP implies that PH can be solved in time $2^{O(n / \log n)}$ under any relativized world.</summary>

    <title>TR21-160 |  Tight Bounds for General Computation in Noisy Broadcast Networks | 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Gillat Kol, 

	Dmitry Paramonov, 

	Raghuvansh Saxena</title>
    <summary>Let $\Pi$ be a protocol over the $n$-party broadcast channel, where in each round, a pre-specified party broadcasts a symbol to all other parties. We wish to design a scheme that takes such a protocol $\Pi$ as input and outputs a noise resilient protocol $\Pi'$ that simulates $\Pi$ over the noisy broadcast channel, where each received symbol is flipped with a fixed constant probability, independently. What is the minimum overhead in the number of rounds that is incurred by any such simulation scheme?

A classical result by Gallager from the 80's shows that non-interactive $T$-round protocols, where the bit communicated in every round is independent of the communication history, can be converted to noise resilient ones with only an $\mathcal{O}(\log \log T)$ multiplicative overhead in the number of rounds. Can the same be proved for any protocol? Or, are there protocols whose simulation requires an $\Omega(\log T)$ overhead (which always suffices)? 

We answer both the above questions in the negative: We give a simulation scheme with an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log T})$ overhead for every protocol and channel alphabet. We also prove an (almost) matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log T})$ on the overhead required to simulate the pointer chasing protocol with $T=n$ and polynomial alphabet.</summary>

    <p>One of our instructor’s strategies for dealing with sites like Chegg that cater to homework answer-copiers <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/107217545955814360">\(\mathbb{M}\)</a>):</span> seek out and assign homework questions that already have particularly bad answers on Chegg. That way the copiers are more easily caught and the students who actually do the work have a better chance to shine over their copying peers. And if doing this ends up causing Chegg to get more of a reputation for inaccuracy, that’s not a bad thing either.</p>

This concerns the correspondence between compass-and-straightedge constructions and formulas using square roots, and the use of that correspondence to prove the impossibility of classical geometric construction problems.

    <title>When did Computer Science Theory Get so Hard?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> I posted on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/07/when-did-math-get-so-hard.html">When did Math get so hard?</a> a commenter pointed out that one can also ask </p><p><br/></p><p><i>When did Computer Science Theory Get so Hard?</i></p><p>For the Math-question I could only speculate. For CS- I WAS THERE! When I was in Grad School one could learn all of Complexity theory in a year-long course (a hard one, but still!). The main tools were logic and combinatorics. No Fourier Transforms over finite fields. I am NOT going to say</p><p><i>Those were the good old days.</i></p><p>I will say that it was easier to make a contribution without knowing much. Oddly enough, it is MORE common for ugrads and grad students to publish NOW then it was THEN, so that may be a pair of ducks.</p><p><b>Random Thoughts on This Question</b></p><p>1) The Graph Minor Theorem was when P lost its innocence. Before the GMT most (though not all)  problems in P had easy-to-understand  algorithms using algorithmic paradigms (e.g., Dynamic  Programming) and maybe some combinatorics. Computational Number Theory used.... Number Theory (duh), but I don't think it was hard number theory. One exception was Miller's Primality test which needed to assume the Extended Riemann Hypothesis- but you didn't have to understand ERH to use it. </p><p>1.5) GMT again. This did not only give hard-deep-math algorithms to get problems in P. It  also pointed to  how hard proving P NE NP would be--- to rule out something like a GMT-type result to get SAT in P seems rather hard. </p><p>2) Oracle Constructions were fairly easy diagonalizations. It was bummed out that I never had to use an infinite injury priority argument. That is, I knew some complicated recursion theory, but it was never used. </p><p>2.5) Oracles again. Dana Angluin had a paper which used some complicated combinatorics to construct an oracle, see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397580900274?via%3Dihub">here</a>. Later Andy Yao showed that there is an oracle A such that  PH^A NE  PSPACE^A. You might know that result better as</p><p><i>Constant depth circuits for parity must have exponential size. </i></p><p>I think we now care about circuits more than oracles, see my post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/04/the-new-oracle-result-new-circuit.html">here</a> about that issue. Anyway, oracle results since then have used hard combinatorial and other math arguments. </p><p>3) The PCP result was a leap forward for difficulty. I don't know which paper to pick as THE Leap since there were several. And papers after that were also rather difficult.  </p><p>4) I had a blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/04/do-any-np-reductions-use-deep.html#comment-form">here</a> where I asked if REDUCTIONS ever use hard math. Some of the comments are relevant here:</p><p>Stella Biderman: The deepest part of the original PCP theorem is the invention of the VC paradigm in the 1990's.</p><p>Eldar: Fourier Theory was introduced to CS with Hastad's Optimal Approximation results. Today it might not be considered deep, but I recall when it was.</p><p>Also there are Algebraic Geometry codes which use downright arcane mathematics...</p><p>Hermann Gruber refers to Comp Topology and Comp Geometry and points to the result that 3-manifold knot genus is NP-complete, see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/509907.510016">here</a>.</p><p>Anonymous (they leave many comments) points to the deep math reductions in arithmetic versions of P/NP classes, and Mulmuley's work (Geometric Complexity Theory).</p><p>Timothy Chow points out that `deep' could mean several things and points to a math overflow post on the issue of depth, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/139607/what-are-some-deep-theorems-and-why-are-they-considered-deep">here</a>.</p><p>Marzio De Biasi points out that even back in 1978 there was a poly reduction that required a good amount of number theory: the NPC of the Diophantine binary quad equation</p><p>ax^2 + by + c = 0 </p><p>by Manders and Adelman, see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000078900442?via%3Dihub">here</a>.</p><p>(Bill Comment) I tend to think this is an outlier- for the most part, CS theory back in the 1970's did not hard math. </p><p>4) Private Info Retrieval (PIR). k databases each have the same n-bit string and cannot talk to each other. a server wants the ith bit and (in the info-theoretic case) wants the DBs to know NOTHING about the question i. </p><p>Easy results (to understand) 2-server, n^{1/3}. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/TOPICS/pir/first.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>Hard results: 2-server n^{O(\sqrt{loglogn/log n)},  <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zdvir/papers/DvirGopi14.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>(I have a website on PIR, not maintained,  <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/TOPICS/pir/pir.html">here</a>.)</p><p>5) Babai's algorithm for GI in quasi-poly time used hard math. </p><p>6) If I knew more CS theory I am sure I would have more papers listed.</p><p>But now its your turn: </p><p>When did you realize Gee, <b>CS theory is harder than (a) you thought, (b) it used to be.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>
