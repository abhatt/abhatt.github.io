    <title>Ordering Beauty</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>First, congratulations to fellow complexity theorist and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/">blogger</a> Scott Aaronson for <a href="https://awards.acm.org/about/2020-acm-prize">receiving the 2020 ACM Prize in Computing</a> for "groundbreaking contributions to quantum computing". The prize is ACM's highest honor for mid-career researchers. Well deserved! </p><p>Now back to our regularly scheduled post...</p><p>Every freshman at Cornell back in 1981 had to take two seminar courses, basically one-shot courses in an usually humanities area which required no prerequisites but lots of writing. I took my first course in philosophy. The instructor, a PhD student, at one point described his research, a philosophical argument that there is an intrinsic total ordering of beauty, say that Beethoven would always sit above the Beatles, no matter the beholder. I didn't believe him then and still don't today. A few months ago the Washington Post ran a story with the same theme entitled <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/maradona-messi-ronaldo-zlatan-shakespeare-beatles/2020/12/23/27654712-38a9-11eb-9276-ae0ca72729be_story.html">Maradona was great, and maybe the greatest. Can we make similar claims about artists?</a></p><p>Somehow we have this belief when it comes to conference submissions, that there is some perfect ordering of the submissions and a good PC can suss it out. That's not really how it works. Let's say a conference has an accept rate of 30%. Typically 10% of the submissions are strong and will be accepted by any committee. About half the submissions are just okay or worse and would be rejected. The other 40% of the submissions will be chosen seemingly randomly based on the tastes of the specific members of the program committee. Experiments in the NeurIPS and ESA conferences have bourn this out. </p><p>Why not make the randomness explicit instead of implicit? Have the PC divide the papers into three piles, definite accepts, definite rejects and the middle. Take the third group and randomly choose which ones to accept. It will create a more interesting program. Also randomness removes biases, randomness doesn't care about gender, race and nationality or whether the authors are at senior professors at MIT or first year grad students at Southern North Dakota. </p><p>We put far too much weight on getting accepted into a conference given the implicit randomness of a PC. If we make the randomness explicit that would devalue that weight. We would have to judge researchers on the quality of their research instead of their luck in conferences.</p><p>Given that conferences, especially the virtual ones, have no real limits on the number of papers and talks, you might say why not just accept all the papers in the middle. Works for me.</p></div>

    <summary>We show that the Tree Evaluation Problem with alphabet size $k$ and height $h$ can be solved by branching programs of size $k^{O(h/\log h)} + 2^{O(h)}$. This answers a longstanding challenge of Cook et al. (2009) and gives the first general upper bound since the problem's inception.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Last week I got an email from Dina Katabi, my former MIT colleague, asking me to call her urgently.  <em>Am I in trouble?  For what, though??  I haven’t even worked at MIT for five years!</em></p>



<p>Luckily, Dina only wanted to tell me that I’d been <a href="https://awards.acm.org/about/2020-acm-prize">selected</a> to receive the 2020 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Prize_in_Computing">ACM Prize in Computing</a>, a mid-career award founded in 2007 that comes with $250,000 from Infosys.  Not the Turing Award but I’d happily take it!  And I could even look back on 2020 fondly for something.</p>



<p>I was utterly humbled to see the <a href="https://awards.acm.org/acm-prize/award-winners">list</a> of past ACM Prize recipients, which includes amazing computer scientists I’ve been privileged to know and learn from (like Jon Kleinberg, Sanjeev Arora, and Dan Boneh) and others who I’ve admired from afar (like Daphne Koller, Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat of Google MapReduce, and David Silver of AlphaGo and AlphaZero).</p>



<p>I was even more humbled, later, to read my <a href="https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/aaronson_9555914">prize citation</a>, which focuses on four things:</p>



<ol><li>The theoretical foundations of the sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments now being carried out (and in particular, my and Alex Arkhipov’s <a href="https://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v009a004/">2011 paper on BosonSampling</a>);</li><li>My and Avi Wigderson’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/alg.pdf">2008 paper</a> on the algebrization barrier in complexity theory;</li><li>Work on the limitations of quantum computers (in particular, the 2002 <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/collision.pdf">quantum lower bound for the collision problem</a>); and</li><li>Public outreach about quantum computing, including through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">QCSD</a>, popular talks and articles, and this blog.</li></ol>



<p>I don’t know if I’m worthy of such a prize—but I know that if I am, then it’s mainly for work I did between roughly 2001 and 2012.  This honor inspires me to want to be more like I was back then, when I was driven, non-jaded, and obsessed with figuring out the contours of BQP and efficient computation in the physical universe.  It makes me want to justify the ACM’s faith in me.</p>



<p>I’m grateful to the committee and nominators, and more broadly, to the whole quantum computing and theoretical computer science communities—which I “joined” in some sense around age 16, and which were the first communities where I ever felt like I belonged.  I’m grateful to the mentors who made me what I am, especially Chris Lynch, Bart Selman, Lov Grover, Umesh Vazirani, Avi Wigderson, and (if he’ll allow me to include him) John Preskill.  I’m grateful to the slightly older quantum computer scientists who I looked up to and tried to emulate, like Dorit Aharonov, Andris Ambainis, Ronald de Wolf, and John Watrous.  I’m grateful to my wonderful colleagues at UT Austin, in the CS department and beyond.  I’m grateful to my students and postdocs, the pride of my professional life.  I’m grateful, of course, to my wife, parents, and kids.</p>



<p>By coincidence, my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5437">last post</a> was also about prizes to theoretical computer scientists—in that case, two prizes that attracted controversy because of the recipient’s (or would-be recipient’s) political actions or views.  It would understate matters to point out that not everyone has always agreed with everything I’ve said on this blog.  I’m <em>ridiculously</em> lucky, and I know it, that even living through this polarized and tumultuous era, I never felt forced to choose between academic success and the freedom to speak my conscience in public under my real name.  If there’s been one constant in my public stands, I’d like to think that—inspired by memories of my own years as an unknown, awkward, self-conscious teenager—it’s been my determination to nurture and protect talented young scientists, whatever they look like and wherever they come from.  And I’ve tried to live up to that ideal in real life, and I welcome anyone’s scrutiny as to how well I’ve done.</p>



<p>What should I do with the prize money? I confess that my first instinct was to donate it, in its entirety, to some suitable charity—specifically, something that would make all the strangers who’ve attacked me on Twitter, Reddit, and so forth over the years realize that I’m fundamentally a good person.  But I was talked out of this plan by my family, who pointed out that<br/>(1) in all likelihood, <em>nothing</em> will make online strangers stop hating me,<br/>(2) in any case this seems like a poor basis for making decisions, and<br/>(3) if I really want to give others a say in what to do with the winnings, then why not everyone who’s stood by me and supported me?</p>



<p>So, beloved commenters!  Please mention your favorite charitable causes below, especially weird ones that I wouldn’t have heard of otherwise.  If I support their values, I’ll make a small donation from my prize winnings.  Or a larger donation, especially if you donate yourself and challenge me to match.  Whatever’s left after I get tired of donating will probably go to my kids’ college fund.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> And by an amusing coincidence, today is apparently <a href="https://worldquantumday.org/">“World Quantum Day”</a>!  I hope your Quantum Day is as pleasant as mine (and stable and coherent).</p></div>

centers such that the sum of the of distances raised to the power $z$ of every
point to its closest center is minimized. This encapsulates the famous
$k$-median ($z=1$) and $k$-means ($z=2$) clustering problems. Designing
small-space sketches of the data that approximately preserves the cost of the
solutions, also known as \emph{coresets}, has been an important research
direction over the last 15 years.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a new, simple coreset framework that simultaneously
improves upon the best known bounds for a large variety of settings, ranging
from Euclidean space, doubling metric, minor-free metric, and the general
metric cases.

quantified variables can be restricted in such a way that their current values
are independent of the future values of the other variables. This restriction
is tightly connected to the notion of behavioral strategies in game-theory and
allows the resulting logic to naturally express game-theoretic concepts. The
fragment where only restricted quantifications are considered, called
behavioral quantifications, can be decided, for both model checking and
satisfiability, in 2ExpTime and is expressively equivalent to QPTL, though
significantly less succinct.

    <title>Towards Better Understanding of User Authorization Query Problem via Multi-variable Complexity Analysis</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1618358400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Crampton:Jason.html">Jason Crampton</a>, Gregory Gutin, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Majumdar:Diptapriyo.html">Diptapriyo Majumdar</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05983">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>User authorization queries in the context of role-based access control have
attracted considerable interest in the last 15 years. Such queries are used to
determine whether it is possible to allocate a set of roles to a user that
enables the user to complete a task, in the sense that all the permissions
required to complete the task are assigned to the roles in that set. Answering
such a query, in general, must take into account a number of factors,
including, but not limited to, the roles to which the user is assigned and
constraints on the sets of roles that can be activated. Answering such a query
is known to be NP-hard. The presence of multiple parameters and the need to
find efficient and exact solutions to the problem suggest that a multi-variate
approach will enable us to better understand the complexity of the user
authorization query problem (UAQ). In this paper, we establish a number of
complexity results for UAQ. Specifically, we show the problem remains hard even
when quite restrictive conditions are imposed on the structure of the problem.
Our FPT results show that we have to use either a parameter with potentially
quite large values or quite a restricted version of UAQ. Moreover, our second
FPT algorithm is complex and requires sophisticated, state-of-the-art
techniques. In short, our results show that it is unlikely that all variants of
UAQ that arise in practice can be solved reasonably quickly in general.

graph is known and vertices of the other side arrive online. It is well known
that when the graph is edge-weighted, and vertices arrive in an adversarial
order, no online algorithm has a nontrivial competitive-ratio. To bypass this
hurdle we modify the rules such that the adversary still picks the graph but
has to reveal a random part (say half) of it to the player. The remaining part
is given to the player in an adversarial order. This models practical scenarios
in which the online algorithm has some history to learn from.
</p>
<p>This way of modeling a history was formalized recently by the authors (SODA
20) and was called the AOS model (for Adversarial Online with a Sample). It
allows developing online algorithms for the secretary problem that compete even
when the secretaries arrive in an adversarial order. Here we use the same model
to attack the much more challenging matching problem.
</p>
<p>We analyze a natural algorithmic framework that decides how to match an
arriving vertex $v$ by applying an offline matching algorithm to $v$ and the
sample. We get roughly $1/4$ of the maximum weight by applying the offline
greedy matching algorithm to the sample and $v$. Our analysis ties the
performance of this algorithm to the performance of the offline greedy matching
on the online part and we also prove that it is tight. Surprisingly, when
replacing greedy with an optimal algorithm for maximum matching, no constant
competitive-ratio can be guaranteed when the size of the sample is comparable
to the size of the online part. However, when the sample is quadratic in the
size of the online part, we do get a competitive-ratio of $1/e$.

    <title>Efficient Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for Multiple Weighted $l_{p\leq2}$ Distance Functions</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1618358400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Hu:Huan.html">Huan Hu</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Li:Jianzhong.html">Jianzhong Li</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11907">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Nearest neighbor search is fundamental to a wide range of applications. Since
the exact nearest neighbor search suffers from the "curse of dimensionality",
approximate approaches, such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), are widely
used to trade a little query accuracy for a much higher query efficiency. In
many scenarios, it is necessary to perform nearest neighbor search under
multiple weighted distance functions in high-dimensional spaces. This paper
considers the important problem of supporting efficient approximate nearest
neighbor search for multiple weighted distance functions in high-dimensional
spaces. To the best of our knowledge, prior work can only solve the problem for
the $l_2$ distance. However, numerous studies have shown that the $l_p$
distance with $p\in(0,2)$ could be more effective than the $l_2$ distance in
high-dimensional spaces. We propose a novel method, WLSH, to address the
problem for the $l_p$ distance for $p\in(0,2]$. WLSH takes the LSH approach and
can theoretically guarantee both the efficiency of processing queries and the
accuracy of query results while minimizing the required total number of hash
tables. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets, and
the results show that WLSH achieves high performance in terms of query
efficiency, query accuracy and space consumption.

    <title>TR21-053 |  Information in propositional proofs and algorithmic proof search | 

	Jan  Krajicek</title>
    <summary>We study from the proof complexity perspective the (informal) proof search problem:
Is there an optimal way to search for propositional proofs?
We note that for any fixed proof system there exists a time-optimal proof search algorithm. Using classical proof complexity results about reflection principles we prove that a time-optimal proof search algorithm exists w.r.t. all proof systems iff a p-optimal proof system exists.
To characterize precisely the time proof search algorithms need for individual formulas we introduce a new proof complexity measure based on algorithmic information concepts. In particular, to a proof system P we attach {\bf information-efficiency function} $i_P(\tau)$ assigning to a tautology a natural number, and we show that:
- $i_P(\tau)$ characterizes time any $P$-proof search algorithm has to use on $\tau$ and that for a fixed $P$ there is such an information-optimal algorithm,
- a proof system is information-efficiency optimal iff it is p-optimal,
- for non-automatizable systems $P$ there are formulas $\tau$ with short proofs but having large information measure $i_P(\tau)$.
We isolate and motivate the problem to establish {\em unconditional} super-logarithmic lower bounds for $i_P(\tau)$ where no super-polynomial size lower bounds are known. We also point out connections of the new measure with some topics in proof complexity other than proof search.</summary>

<p>
Lisa Randall is a professor of theoretical physics at Harvard. Her research has touched on many of the basic questions of modern physics: supersymmetry, Standard Model observables, cosmological inflation, baryogenesis, grand unified theories, and general relativity. She has also written popular books about her work and science in general. Thus she has a handle on aspects of science that overlap my expertise—not to mention those of her sister Dana Randall, whom I have known as a colleague for many years.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought we would talk about recent developments in particle physics, and their connection to two topics dear to us. </p>
<p>
Randall’s most recent popular book is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Matter_and_the_Dinosaurs">Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs</a>. The idea she advances is that the periodic extinctions in Earth’s history may have been caused when the solar system passes through a plane of dark matter within our galaxy. But dark matter and also dark energy have come under <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-mystery-deepens-demise-reported-detection">increasing</a> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-03-composition-percent-universe.html">recent</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/maybe-dark-matter-doesn-t-exist-after-all-new-research-n1252995">doubt</a>, even from their original <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24632851-400-why-the-universe-i-invented-is-right-but-still-not-the-final-answer/">formulator</a>. Maybe Niels Bohr’s quote should also say: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the past.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Randall’s previous book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocking_on_Heaven's_Door_(book)">Knocking on Heaven’s Door</a>, is most relevant to this post. The 1973 Bob Dylan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockin'_on_Heaven's_Door">song</a> title it pinches describes the feeling of doing frontier physical science. Insofar as her own work is mostly theoretical, much of it connects to feelings we have in computer science—especially complexity lower bounds where the door mostly feels slammed shut. </p>
<p>
But the book is also about the practice of experimental science—not only how to gather knowledge but when and how we can have confidence in it. Its long middle part is titled, “Machines, Measurements, and Probability.” All three elements are foremost in considering a new development that involves two measurements taken 20 years apart.</p>

<p/><h2> Muons </h2><p/>
<p>
Last Tuesday’s New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/science/particle-physics-muon-fermilab-brookhaven.html">highlighted</a> a potential discovery in particle physics. It was in their Tuesday science section. </p>
<p>
The result is an experimental discovery that could show that the current model of matter is wrong. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “This is our Mars rover landing moment,” said Chris Polly, a physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab, in Batavia, Ill., who has been working toward this finding for most of his career. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Indeed. It is a Mars landing moment. They both involved many people, lots of exotic machinery, lots of money, many years. Say three billion dollars or so for Mars. Say nearly the same amount for muons—the annual budget for Fermilab is over one half billion dollars. It was certainly enough to reassemble and upgrade a huge accelerator ring that was <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=112259">first used</a> at Brookhaven National Lab on Long Island in 2001:</p>

<p>
The study used the muon to probe the Standard Model of physics. Muons are useful because they are charged like an electron, which helps control them in an accelerator. Yet their mass is roughly 207 times larger than an electron. The same charge helps control their motion and the large mass makes collisions more interesting. As Polly stated in Natalie Wolchover’s <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/muon-g-2-experiment-at-fermilab-finds-hint-of-new-particles-20210407/">story</a> for <em>Quanta</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “[I]f you’re looking for particles that could explain the missing mass of the universe—dark matter—or you’re looking for [supersymmetry], that’s where the muon has a unique role.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Theory and Jealousy </h2><p/>
<p>
Computer science theory is so different from high end physics. We are closer to the type of research that Randall does. We involve few people, no exotic machinery, and small amounts of money. Maybe the closest attribute we have to high-end research is we also take years and years.</p>
<p>
Perhaps we are also jealous of high-end physics. Not just for money, but for the ability of particle physicists to get announcements into the New York Times. Polly said the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/articles/first-person-science-chris-polly-muon-physics">following</a> about the ending day of the muon experiment two decades ago:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When we revealed the results, people from all over the world flew in to visit the lab. These experiments take decades to build and analyze, so you don’t get to go to very many of these events. We did a little “Drumroll, please” and then had the postdoc managing the spreadsheet hit the button to show it on the projector. Lo and behold, you could see that there was still a three-sigma discrepancy! </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
At the time he was a graduate assistant assigned to machinery for measuring particle energies. He had fixed a problem where someone had touched a component with bare hands and thereby ruined its sheathing. All such problems were meant to be ironed-out by the drum-roll event. But all this raises two further interesting issues that connect the muon results with issues we think about in computer science. Let’s look at them next.</p>
<p/><h2> Three to Four Sigma </h2><p/>
<p>
In an experimental science one must be aware that results are not exact. They are samples from some random process. Flip a coin 10 times in a row. If they all come up heads what does that mean? Could be the coin is fair but this happens about one time in a thousand. Or the coin is biased. Or something else. </p>
<p>
Flip a muon many times. That is sample some muon experiment. The outcome is from a random process. Some of it comes from properties of the natural processes themselves and others from incidentals of the measurement apparatus. How do we decide if the experiment means what we think it does?</p>
<p>
The theory developed by Carl Gauss and others before and after to delineate the normal distribution was largely prompted by analysis of measurement errors <a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Allendoerfer/stahl96.pdf">to begin with</a>. This yields the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68-95-99.7_rule">rule of three</a>,” about the percentage of values that naturally lie within an interval estimate in a normal distribution: 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean, respectively.</p>
<p>
The question is, how to assess cases where the measurement result is well outside these intervals—when can we conclude it is more than a deviation by natural chance? In social sciences a result is “significant” provided it lies outside two-sigma. In particle physics, there is a convention of a five-sigma effect (99.99994% confidence) being required to qualify as a discovery. No Nobel prize for less. </p>
<p>
The situation with the muons has an extra factor of repeated measurements—but there have been only two measurements so far:</p>

The blue line in the left figure is the original Brookhaven measurement; the red is the new one. There is also <a href="https://4gravitons.com/2021/04/09/theoretical-uncertainty-and-uncertain-theory/">theoretical uncertainty</a> in the calculation of the Standard Model prediction, and that combines with the measurement error bars to give the sigma baseline. The chart at right normalizes the deviation to parts per billion—the measurements need to be incredibly fine. This scale appears to be about 25% under the current <img alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-scale (it shows about <img alt="{2.8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for Brookhaven compared to its <img alt="{3.7\sigma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3.7%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> after <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04822.pdf">revised</a> uncertainty) but it is close enough to get the picture.</p>
<p>
Although the new Fermilab result by itself deviates slightly less from the Standard Model, it corroborates the earlier measurement. It is not fully independent from it, but the combination is enough to raise the current claimed deviation to about <img alt="{4.2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4.2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> sigmas. This is well above social science level but below Nobel level. This is with respect to the probability that the effects are real. </p>
<p>
The social significance of <img alt="{4.2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4.2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is that it is above the “<img alt="{3+}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>” level where hoped-for anomalies have subsequently disappeared for reasons chalked up to natural chance. This is because physicists around the world do many a hundredfold amount of hopeful measurements. Some measurements get initial “bumps” up just because of the numbers. But <img alt="{4.2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4.2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> reduces the natural frequency under 1-in-40,000. This is why reproducing measurements is so important, why the new Fermilab team devoted all the expense and effort. A more independent measurement on other machines could give a higher boost that might get over the <img alt="{5.0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5.0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> line. Time to break out the wallets and hammers?</p>
<p>
The <img alt="{4.2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4.2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is not, however, beyond the realm of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly">recent</a> <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v11/s78">experience</a> with apparatus faults and modeling error. On the latter, there is <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12292">still</a> some <a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/2021/04/why-is-it-when-something-happens-it-is.html">doubt</a> about the theoretical prediction for the muon’s magnetic moment. In any event, the muon results are exciting but still below what is required for a true discovery. Time will tell.</p>
<p>
The second factor we draw attention to concerns the human “hoping” directly.</p>
<p/><h2> Blinding </h2><p/>
<p>
In any experimental science one must also be aware that people are not unbiased. Scientists have much invested in the outcome of their experiments. Think jobs, tenure even, funding, and more. So a big physics experiment like the muon one must be careful. They follow standard practice to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blinded_experiment">blinded</a> data analysis. </p>
<p>
This surprised me. This blinding is a crypto-type protocol, which is something we computer scientists study. The muon team performed a protocol that protected against cheating. Here is how they did it:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In this case, the master clock that keeps track of the muons’ wobble had been set to a rate unknown to the researchers. The figure was sealed in envelopes that were locked in the offices at Fermilab and the University of Washington in Seattle.</em></p><em>
<p>
In a ceremony on Feb. 25 that was recorded on video and watched around the world on Zoom, Dr. Polly opened the Fermilab envelope and David Hertzog from the University of Washington opened the Seattle envelope. The number inside was entered into a spreadsheet, providing a key to all the data, and the result popped out to a chorus of wows.</p>
</em><p><em>
“That really led to a really exciting moment, because nobody on the collaboration knew the answer until the same moment,” said Saskia Charity, a Fermilab postdoctoral fellow who has been working remotely from Liverpool, England, during the pandemic. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This mechanism for blinding suggests possible crypto questions. They hid the master clock rate. Can this be modeled as one of our crypto problems? Can we prove some security bounds? If they claim that hiding the rate protects against cheating then they should be able to make this claim precise. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves">discovery</a> of gravitational waves used a <a href="https://www.ligo.org/news/blind-injection.php">blind injection</a> scheme tailored for that experiment. How can this be generalized?</p>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
We have discussed two aspects that involve soft numbers rather than hard machines and hard-shelled particles. Perhaps they are interesting new problems for us? What do you think?</p>

    <title>TR21-052 |  Upslices, Downslices, and Secret-Sharing with Complexity of $1.5^n$ | 

	Oded Nir, 

	Benny Applebaum</title>
    <summary>A secret-sharing scheme allows to distribute a secret $s$ among $n$ parties such that only some predefined ``authorized'' sets of parties can reconstruct the secret, and all other ``unauthorized'' sets learn nothing about $s$. 
The collection of authorized/unauthorized sets can be captured by a monotone function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$. 
In this paper, we focus on monotone functions that all their min-terms are sets of size $a$, and on their duals -- monotone functions whose max-terms are of size $b$. We refer to these classes as $(a,n)$-upslices and $(b,n)$-downslices, and note that these natural families correspond to monotone $a$-regular DNFs and monotone $(n-b)$-regular CNFs. We derive the following results.

1. (General downslices) Every downslice can be realized with total share size of $1.5^{n+o(n)}&lt;2^{0.585 n}$. Since every monotone function can be cheaply decomposed into $n$ downslices, we obtain a similar result for general access structures improving the previously known $2^{0.637n+o(n)}$ complexity of Applebaum, Beimel, Nir and Peter (STOC 2020). We also achieve a minor improvement in the exponent of linear secrets sharing schemes. 

2. (Random mixture of upslices) Following Beimel and Farras (TCC 2020) who studied the complexity of random DNFs with constant-size terms, we consider the following general distribution $F$ over monotone DNFs: For each width value $a\in [n]$, uniformly sample $k_a$ monotone terms of size $a$, where $k=(k_1,\ldots,k_n)$ is an arbitrary vector of non-negative integers. We show that, except with exponentially small probability, $F$ can be realized with share size of $2^{0.5 n+o(n)}$ and
    can be linearly realized with an exponent strictly smaller than $2/3$. Our proof also provides a candidate distribution for ``exponentially-hard'' access structure. 
    
We use our results to explore connections between several seemingly unrelated questions about the complexity of secret-sharing schemes such as worst-case vs. average-case, linear vs. non-linear and primal vs. dual access structures. We prove that, in at least one of these settings, there is a significant gap in secret-sharing complexity.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oded_Goldreich">Oded Goldreich</a> is a theoretical computer scientist at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel.  He’s best known for helping to lay the rigorous foundations of cryptography in the 1980s, through seminal results like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard-core_predicate">Goldreich-Levin Theorem</a> (every one-way function can be modified to have a hard-core predicate), the <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Pseudo%20Randomness/How%20To%20Construct%20Random%20Functions.pdf">Goldreich-Goldwasser-Micali Theorem</a> (every pseudorandom generator can be made into a pseudorandom function), and the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hmaji/teaching/Fall%202017/lectures/39.pdf">Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson protocol</a> for secure multi-party computation.  I first met Oded more than 20 years ago, when he lectured at a summer school at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, barefoot and wearing a tank top and what looked like pajama pants.  It was a bracing introduction to complexity-theoretic cryptography.  Since then, I’ve interacted with Oded from time to time, partly around his <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/on-qc.html">firm belief</a> that quantum computing is impossible.</p>



<p>Last month a committee in Israel voted to award Goldreich the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Prize">Israel Prize</a> (roughly analogous to the US National Medal of Science), for which I’d say Goldreich had been a plausible candidate for decades.  But alas, Yoav Gallant, Netanyahu’s Education Minister, then rather <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/high-court-revokes-israel-prize-in-math-to-pro-bds-professor-664538">non-gallantly blocked the award</a>, solely because he objected to Goldreich’s far-left political views (and apparently because of various statements Goldreich signed, including in support of a boycott of Ariel University, which is in the West Bank).  The case went all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court (!), which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israeli-academic-wont-receive-prize-after-signing-petition/2021/04/08/d1e987ca-987b-11eb-8f0a-3384cf4fb399_story.html">ruled two days ago</a> in Gallant’s favor: he gets to “delay” the award to investigate the matter further, and in the meantime has apparently sent out invitations for an award ceremony next week that doesn’t include Goldreich.  Some are now calling for the other winners to boycott the prize in solidarity until this is righted.</p>



<p>I doubt readers of this blog need convincing that this is a travesty and an embarrassment, a <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shanda#:~:text=shanda%20(uncountable),(Jewish)%20shame%3B%20disgrace.">shanda</a></em>, for the Netanyahu government itself.  That I disagree with Goldreich’s far-left views (or <em>might</em> disagree, if I knew in any detail what they were) is totally immaterial to that judgment.  In my opinion, not even Goldreich’s belief in the impossibility of quantum computers should affect his eligibility for the prize. <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>



<p>Maybe it would be better to say that, as far as his academic colleagues in Israel and beyond are concerned, Goldreich <em>has</em> won the Israel Prize; it’s only some irrelevant external agent who’s blocking his receipt of it.  Ironically, though, among Goldreich’s many heterodox beliefs is a <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/on-awards1.html">total rejection of the value of scientific prizes</a> (although Goldreich has also said he wouldn’t refuse the Israel Prize if offered it!).</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>In unrelated news, the 2020 Turing Award has been given to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Aho">Al Aho</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Ullman">Jeff Ullman</a>.  Aho and Ullman have both been celebrated leaders in CS for half a century, having laid many of the foundations of formal languages and compilers, and having coauthored one of CS’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Analysis-Computer-Algorithms/dp/0201000296/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_1/140-9181226-0879049?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0201000296&amp;pd_rd_r=4c6cd308-4669-45ee-ad4d-292ee24e043f&amp;pd_rd_w=WxNWv&amp;pd_rd_wg=AAt3G&amp;pf_rd_p=337be819-13af-4fb9-8b3e-a5291c097ebb&amp;pf_rd_r=T95EJ78DHVE1V1G604D1&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=T95EJ78DHVE1V1G604D1">defining textbooks</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopcroft">John Hopcroft</a> (who already received a different Turing Award).</p>



<p>But again there’s a controversy.  <a href="https://lobelog.com/niac-calls-out-anti-iranian-stanford-professor/">Apparently</a>, in 2011, Ullman wrote to an Iranian student who wanted to work with him, saying that as “a matter of principle,” he would not accept Iranian students until the Iranian government recognized Israel.  Maybe I should say that I, like Ullman, am both a Jew and a Zionist, but I find it hard to imagine the state of mind that would cause me to hold some hapless student responsible for the misdeeds of their birth-country’s government.  Ironically, this is a mirror-image of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_boycott_of_Israel#Mona_Baker,_Miriam_Shlesinger_and_Gideon_Toury">tactics</a> that the BDS movement has wielded against Israeli academics.  Unlike Goldreich, though, Ullman seems to have gone beyond merely expressing his beliefs, actually turning them into a one-man foreign policy.</p>



<p>I’m <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3167">proud</a> of the Iranian students I’ve mentored and hope to mentor more.  While I don’t think this issue should affect Ullman’s Turing Award (and I haven’t seen anyone claim that it should), I do think it’s appropriate to use the occasion to express our opposition to all forms of discrimination.  I fully endorse Shafi Goldwasser’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SimonsInstitute/">response</a> in her capacity as Director of the Simons Institute for Theory of Computing in Berkeley:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As a senior member of the computer science community and an American-Israeli, I stand with our Iranian students and scholars and outright reject any notion by which admission, support, or promotion of individuals in academic settings should be impeded by national origin or politics. Individuals should not be conflated with the countries or institutions they come from. Statements and actions to the contrary have no place in our computer science community. Anyone experiencing such behavior will find a committed ally in me.</p></blockquote>



<p>As for Al Aho?  I knew him fifteen years ago, when he became interested in quantum computing, in part due to his then-student <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ksvore/">Krysta Svore</a> (who’s now the head of Microsoft’s quantum computing efforts).  Al struck me as not only a famous scientist but a gentleman who radiated kindness everywhere.  I’m not aware of any controversies he’s been involved in and never heard anyone say a bad word about him.</p>



<p>Anyway, this seems like a good occasion to recognize some foundational achievements in computer science, as well as the complex human beings who produce them!</p></div>

    <title>TR21-051 |  Binary Interactive Error Resilience Beyond $1/8$ (or why $(1/2)^3 &amp;gt; 1/8$) | 

	Raghuvansh Saxena, 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Gillat Kol</title>
    <summary>Interactive error correcting codes are codes that encode a two party communication protocol to an error-resilient protocol that succeeds even if a constant fraction of the communicated symbols are adversarially corrupted, at the cost of increasing the communication by a constant factor. What is the largest fraction of corruptions that such codes can protect against? 

If the error-resilient protocol is allowed to communicate large (constant sized) symbols, Braverman and Rao  (STOC, 2011) show that the maximum rate of corruptions that can be tolerated is $1/4$. They also give a binary interactive error correcting protocol that only communicates bits and is resilient to $1/8$ fraction of errors, but leave the optimality of this scheme as an open problem.

We answer this question in the negative, breaking the $1/8$ barrier. Specifically, we give a binary interactive error correcting scheme that is resilient to $5/39 &gt; 1/8$ fraction of adversarial errors. Our scheme builds upon a novel construction of binary list-decodable interactive codes with small list size.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Stories</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Scott Aaronson <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5387">wrote last month</a> about the hype over quantum computing. I'd thought I'd drop a few stories.</p><p>I was once asked to review a grant proposal (outside the US) that claimed it would find a quantum algorithm for NP-hard problems. I wrote a scathing review but the grant was funded because I failed to prove that it was impossible. I replied that they should fund my research to teleport people from Chicago to Paris because they couldn't prove I couldn't do it. I never got a response.</p><div>I was at an NSF sponsored meeting on quantum computing. I suggested, as a complexity theorist, that we need to explore the limits of quantum computing. A senior researcher said we shouldn't mention that in the report or it might hurt our chances of funding the field if they think quantum computing might not be a complete success.</div><p>I went to a Microsoft Faculty Research Summit which had a big focus on quantum computing. I complained of the quantum computing hype. My friends in the field denied the hype. Later at the summit a research head said that Microsoft will solve world hunger with quantum computing.</p><p>I was meeting with a congressional staffer who had worked on the National Quantum Initiative which coincidentally was being announced that day. I said something about high risk, high reward. He looked shocked--nobody had told him before that quantum computing is a speculative technology.</p><p>Quantum computing has generated a large number of beautiful and challenging scientific questions. Thinking about quantum has helped generate classical complexity and algorithmic results. But quantum computing having a real-world impact in the near or mid-term is unlikely. Most scientists I know working directly in quantum research are honest about the limitations and challenges in quantum computing. But somehow that message is not often getting to the next layers up, the policy makers, the research managers, the university administrators, the media and the venture capitalists. </p><p>But who knows, maybe some quantum heuristic that doesn't need much entanglement will change the world tomorrow. I can't prove it's impossible.</p></div>

    <title>Rip van Winkle's Razor, a Simple New Estimate for Adaptive Data Analysis</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>Can you trust a model whose designer had access to the test/holdout set?</em> This implicit question 
in <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6248/636.full">Dwork et al 2015</a> launched a new field, <em>adaptive data analysis</em>.
The question referred to the fact that in many scientific settings as well as modern machine learning (with its standardized datasets like CIFAR, 
ImageNet etc.) the model designer has full access to the holdout set and is free to ignore the</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Basic Dictum of Data Science) “Thou shalt not train on the test/holdout set.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, even researchers who scrupulously follow the Basic Dictum may be unknowingly violating it when they take inspiration (and design choices) 
from published works by others who presumably published <em>only the best of the many models they evaluated on the test set.</em></p>

<p>Dwork et al. showed that if the test set has size $N$, and the designer is allowed to see the error of the first $i-1$ models on the test set before designing the $i$’th model, then a clever designer can  use so-called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04585.pdf"><em>wacky boosting</em></a> (see this <a href="http://blog.mrtz.org/2015/03/09/competition.html">blog post</a>) to ensure the accuracy of the $t$’th model on the test set as high as $\Omega(\sqrt{t/N})$. In other words, the test set could become essentially useless once $t \gg N$, a 
condition that holds in ML, whereby in popular datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet etc.)  $N$ is no more than $100,000$ and the total number of models being trained 
world-wide is well in the millions if not higher (once you include hyperparameter searches).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Meta-overfitting Error (MOE)</strong> of a model is the difference between its average error on the test data and its expected error on the full distribution.
(It is closely related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate"><em>false discovery rate</em></a> in statistics.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This blog post concerns <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13189.pdf">our new paper</a>, which gives meaningful upper bounds on this sort of trouble for popular 
deep net architectures, whereas prior ideas from adaptive data analysis gave no nontrivial estimates. We call our estimate  <em>Rip van Winkle’s Razor</em> 
which combines references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam’s Razor</a> and the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle">mythical person who fell asleep for  20 years</a>.</p>

<h2 id="adaptive-data-analysis-brief-tour">Adaptive Data Analysis: Brief tour</h2>

<p>It is well-known that for a model trained <strong>without</strong> ever querying the test set, MOE scales (with high probability over choice of the test set) as $1/\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ 
is the size of the test set.  Furthermore standard concentration bounds imply that even if we train $t$ models without ever referring to the test set (in other words, 
using proper data hygiene) then the maximum meta-overfitting error among the $t$ models scales whp as $O(\sqrt{\log(t)/ N})$. The trouble pinpointed by Dwork et al. 
can happen only if models are designed adaptively, with test error of the previous models shaping the design of the next model.</p>

<p>Adaptive Data Analysis has come up with many good practices for honest researchers to mitigate such issues. For instance, Dwork et al. showed that using 
Differential Privacy on labels while evaluating models can lower MOE. Or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04585.pdf">Ladder mechanism</a> helps in Kaggle-like 
settings where the test dataset resides on a server that can choose to answers only a  selected subset of queries, which essentially takes away the MOE issue.</p>

<p>For several good practices  matching lower bounds exist showing a way to construct cheating models with MOE matching the upper bound.</p>

<p>However such recommended best practices do not help with understanding the MOE in the performance numbers of a new model  since there is no guarantee that the 
inventors never tuned models using the test set, or didn’t get inspiration from existing models that may have been designed that way.  Thus statistically 
speaking the above results still give no reason to believe that a modern deep net such as ResNet152 has low MOE.</p>

<p><a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/recht19a/recht19a.pdf">Recht et al. 2019</a> summed up the MOE issue in a catchy title: <em>Do ImageNet Classifiers Generalize to ImageNet?</em>  They tried to answer their question experimentally by creating new test sets from scratch –we discuss their results later.</p>

<h2 id="moe-bounds-and-description-length">MOE bounds and description length</h2>

<p>The starting point of our work is the following classical concentration bounds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Folklore Theorem</strong> With high probability over the choice of a test set of size $N$, the MOE of <em>all</em> models with description length at most $k$ bits is  $O(\sqrt{k/N})$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first sight this doesn’t seem to help us because one cannot imagine modern deep nets having a short description. The most obvious description involves reporting 
values of the net parameters, which requires millions or even hundreds of millions of bits, resulting in a vacuous upper bound  on MOE.</p>

<p>Another obvious description would be the computer program used to produce the model using the (publicly available) training and validation sets. However, these 
programs usually rely on imported libraries through layers of encapsulation and so the effective program size is pretty large as well.</p>

<h2 id="rip-van-winkles-razor">Rip van Winkle’s Razor</h2>
<p>Our new upper bound involves a more careful definition of <em>Description Length</em>: it is the smallest description that allows a referee  to reproduce a model of 
similar performance using the (universally available) training and validation datasets.</p>

<p>While this phrasing may appear reminiscent of the review process for conferences and journals, there is a subtle difference  with respect to what the referee 
can or cannot be assumed to know. (Clearly, assumptions about the referee can greatly affect description length —e.g,  a referee ignorant of even basic 
calculus might need a very long explanation!)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Informed Referee:</strong> “Knows everything that was known to humanity (e.g., about deep learning, mathematics,optimization, statistics etc.) right up to the 
moment of creation of the Test set.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unbiased Referee:</strong> Knows nothing discovered since the Test set was created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus <em>Description Length</em> of a model is the number of bits in the shortest description that allows an informed but unbiased referee to reproduce the claimed result.</p>

<p>Note that informed referees let descriptions get shorter. Unbiased require longer descriptions that rule out any statistical “contamination” due to any interaction whatsoever with the test set. For example, momentum techniques in optimization were 
well-studied before the creation of ImageNet test set, so informed referees can be expected to understand a line like “SGD with momentum 0.9.” But a 
line like “Use Batch Normalization” cannot be understood by unbiased referees since conceivably this technique (invented after 2012) might have
 become popular precisely because it leads to better performance on the test set of ImageNet.</p>

<p>By now it should be clear why the estimate is named after  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle">“Rip van Winkle”</a>: the referee can be thought 
of as an infinitely well-informed researcher who went into deep sleep at the moment of creation of the test set, and has just been woken up years later 
to start refereeing the  latest papers.  Real-life journal referees who luckily did not suffer this way should try to simulate the idealized Rip van Winkle 
in their heads while perusing the description submitted by the researcher.</p>

<p>To allow as short a  description as possible the researcher is allowed to compress the description of their new deep net non-destructively using any compression  that would make sense to Rip van Winkle (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman Coding</a>). The description of the compression method itself 
is not counted towards the description length – provided the same method is used for all papers submitted to Rip van Winkle. To give an example, a 
technique appearing in a text known to Rip van Winkle could be succinctly referred to using the book’s ISBN number and page number.</p>

<h2 id="estimating-moe-of-resnet-152">Estimating MOE of ResNet-152</h2>
<p>As an illustration, here we provide a suitable description allowing  Rip van Winkle to reproduce a mainstream ImageNet model, ResNet-152, which achieves $4.49\%$ top-5 
test error.</p>

<p>The description consists of three types of expressions: English phrases, Math equations, and directed graphs. In the paper, we describe in detail how to encode 
each of them into binary strings and count their lengths.  The allowed vocabulary includes primitive concepts that were known before 2012, such 
as <em>CONV, MaxPool, ReLU, SGD</em> etc., as well as a graph-theoretic notation/shorthand  for describing net architecture. The newly introduced concepts 
including <em>Batch-Norm</em>, <em>Layer, Block</em> are defined precisely using Math, English, and other primitive concepts.</p>

<figure align="center">
<img alt="drawing" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/resnet_description.png" width="80%"/>
  <b>Description for reproducing ResNet-152</b>
</figure>

<p>According to our estimate, the length of the above description is $1032$ bits, which translates into a upper bound on meta-overfitting error of merely $5\%$! 
This suggests the real top-5 error of the model on full distribution is at most $9.49\%$. In the paper we also provide a $980$-bit long description for 
reproducing DenseNet-264, which leads to $5.06\%$ upper bound on its meta-overfitting error.</p>

<p>Note that the number $5.06$ suggests higher precision than actually given by the method, since it is possible to quibble about the coding assumptions 
that led to it.  Perhaps others might use a more classical coding mechanism and obtain an estimate of $6\%$ or $7\%$.</p>

<p>But the important point is that unlike  existing bounds in Adaptive Data Analysis, there is <strong>no</strong> dependence on $t$, the number of models that have been tested before, and the bound is non-vacuous.</p>

<h2 id="empirical-evidence-about-lack-of-meta-overfitting">Empirical evidence about lack of meta-overfitting</h2>

<p>Our estimates indicate that the issue of meta-overfitting on ImageNet for these mainstream models is mild. The reason is that despite the vast number
 of parameters and hyper-parameters in today’s deep nets, the <em>information content</em> of these models is not high given  knowledge circa 2012.</p>

<p>Recently Recht et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">tried to reach an empirical upper bound on MOE</a> for
ImageNet and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00451">CIFAR-10</a>. They created new tests sets by carefully replicating the methodology used for constructing the original ones. They found that error of famous published models of the past seven years is as much as 10-15% higher on the new test set as compared to the original.  On the face of it, this seemed to confirm a case of bad meta-overfitting. But they  also presented evidence  that the swing in test error was due to systemic effects during test set creation. For instance, a comparable swing happens also for models that predated the creation of ImageNet (and thus were not overfitted to the ImageNet test set). 
<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/ee39e503b6bedf0c98c388b7e8589aca-Abstract.html">A followup study</a> of a hundred Kaggle competitions used fresh, 
identically distributed test sets that were available from the official competition organizers. The authors concluded that MOE does not appear to be significant in modern ML.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>To us the  disquieting takeaway from Recht et al.’s results was that  estimating MOE by creating a new test set is rife with systematic bias at best, and perhaps impossible, especially in datasets concerning rare or one-time phenomena (e.g., stock prices).  Thus their work still left a pressing need for effective upper bounds on  meta-overfitting error. Our Rip van Winkle’s Razor is elementary, and easily deployable by the average researcher. We hope it becomes part of the standard toolbox in Adaptive Data Analysis.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In this blog post, I outline how existing advertising platforms do not prevent high-stakes ads from reaching different demographics at different rates. The post then describes how pushing this responsibility down to advertisers rather than addressing it at the platform leaves manipulating a complex system to those least aware of the system’s inner workings. She then proposes a simpler, more unified solution to this problem: advertising slots should be either targetable or untargetable, and high-stakes ads should be in the untargeted segment. Finally, the post concludes with a discussion of how this segmentation need not cost these systems substantial revenue if reserve prices are used appropriately.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: In this talk I will cover a new technique for worst-case to average-case reductions. There are two primary concepts introduced in this talk: “factored” problems and a framework for worst-case to average-case fine-grained (WCtoACFG) self reductions.</p>
<p>We will define new versions of OV, kSUM and zero-k-clique that are both worst-case and average-case fine-grained hard assuming the core hypotheses of fine-grained complexity. We then use these as a basis for fine-grained hardness and average-case hardness of other problems. Our hard factored problems are also simple enough that we can reduce them to many other problems, e.g. to edit distance, k-LCS and versions of Max-Flow. We further consider counting variants of the factored problems and give WCtoACFG reductions for them for a natural distribution.</p>
<p>To show hardness for these factored problems we formalize the framework of [Boix-Adsera et al. 2019] that was used to give a WCtoACFG reduction for counting k-cliques. We define an explicit property of problems such that if a problem has that property one can use the framework on the problem to get a WCtoACFG self reduction. In total these factored problems and the framework together give tight fine-grained average-case hardness for various problems including the counting variant of regular expression matching.</p>

Kaisa Matomäki is a Finnish mathematician working in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaisa_Matomaki">number theory</a>. She has some terrific results on prime numbers—results that have won several important prizes including the 2021 Ruth Lyttle Satter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Lyttle_Satter_Prize_in_Mathematics">Prize</a>: It is presented to a woman who has made an outstanding contribution to mathematics research. The prize <a href="https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=6455">citation</a> specifically mentions a 2015 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04585">paper</a> with Maksym Radziwill that contributed to Terence Tao’s resolution of the Erdős discrepancy problem—and indeed we highlighted Tao’s followup work with her and Radziwill in our 2015 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/09/24/frogs-and-lily-pads-and-discrepancy/">post</a> on this.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought we would combine one of her new deep theorems with some shallow observations.<br/>
<span id="more-18492"/></p>
<p>
The set of primes is denoted by <img alt="{\mathsf{PRIMES}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPRIMES%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, as usual. As complexity theorists we have known that for decades that the Boolean circuit complexity of <img alt="{\mathsf{PRIMES}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPRIMES%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is polynomial. This follows from the existence of a polynomial random algorithm for <img alt="{\mathsf{PRIMES}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPRIMES%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> due to Robert Solovay and Volker Strassen, and then applying Len Adleman’s connection between such algorithms and Boolean circuit complexity.</p>
<p>
Matomäki views <img alt="{\mathsf{PRIMES}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPRIMES%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in a different way. As an analytic number theorist she is concerned with the density and structure of primes, not so much the complexity of recognizing or generating a prime.</p>
<p>
</p><h2> Relaxations </h2><p/>
<p>
Exact results on the set of primes are hard to come by. </p>
<p>
<b>Twin Primes</b>: We know that there are infinitely many <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{p+2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%2B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are prime. But not proved.</p>
<p>
<b>Goldbach</b>: We know that every even number from <img alt="{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> onward is the sum of two primes. But not proved.</p>
<p>
<b>Density of Primes</b>: We known that the gap between consecutive primes is at most <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> But not proved.</p>
<p>
The Riemann Hypothesis attempts to say more about density of the primes than the Prime Number Theorem does. It has been proved equivalent to some statements about approximate growth rates, yet even these forms have not been touched.</p>
<p>
Instead of trying for better approximate results about primes, can we learn more by relaxing the notion of “prime” itself? For each <img alt="{k \geq 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%5Cgeq+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, define <img alt="{P_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be the set of numbers that are products of at most <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> primes. Then <img alt="{P_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the set of primes (not the prime powers) and <img alt="{P_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the set of products of two primes—which include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blum_integer">Blum integers</a> of special interest to cryptography. Collectively the <img alt="{P_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> sets represent different levels of being “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_prime">almost prime</a>.” The motivating question is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> How well and in what ways does the structure of the sets of almost-primes model the structure of the primes? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In 2010, John Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec wrote a <a href="https://www.ams.org/books/coll/057/coll057-endmatter.pdf">monograph</a> titled <em>Opera de Cribro</em>, which is Latin for “Works of the Sieve.” They proved certain results about <img alt="{P_{13}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_%7B13%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and speculated whether their methods improve them to work at least for <img alt="{P_3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then they say, “It would be interesting to get integers with at most two prime divisors.” This is where Matomäki comes in—with a second kind of relaxing, one applying to “almost all” members of <img alt="{P_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>
</p><h2> New Result </h2><p/>
<p>
Matomäki has a brand new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11565">paper</a> (revised two weeks ago from a December original) titled, “Almost primes in almost all very short intervals.” It follows on from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06005">paper</a> by one of her students, Joni Teräväinen, titled “Almost all primes in almost all short intervals.” </p>
<p>
Her main result is the following theorem. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Suppose <img alt="{h_X \rightarrow \infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh_X+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as <img alt="{X \rightarrow \infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and put <img alt="{\Delta_X = h\log X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CDelta_X+%3D+h%5Clog+X%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then for almost all <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{x \in (\frac{X}{2},X]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cin+%28%5Cfrac%7BX%7D%7B2%7D%2CX%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the interval <img alt="{(x-\Delta_X,x]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x-%5CDelta_X%2Cx%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> contains a <img alt="{P_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Roger Heath-Brown had established the corresponding result for primes (that is, for <img alt="{P_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) but only assuming simultaneously the Riemann hypothesis and the pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. With no hypotheses, the presence of primes in almost all intervals is known only when the intervals have length <img alt="{X^{\Omega(1)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%5E%7B%5COmega%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>—concretely, <img alt="{X^{1/20}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%5E%7B1%2F20%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is known. Thus, Matomäki has traded off the use of conjectures for the relaxed notion of prime.</p>
<p>
The “almost call” is in the sense of average density of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> whose short interval is populated. This average instead of worst case mirrors our difficulties with circuit lower bounds. We can easily show that on average Boolean function have huge circuit lower bounds. But worst case bounds for specific functions is beyond reach. Hmmm.</p>
<p>
</p><h2> Lower Bounds </h2><p/>
<p>
We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2021/01/14/priming-random-restrictions/">previously</a> proved: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2 (Lower Bound)</b> <em> For any <img alt="{\epsilon&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the depth of a DeMorgan boolean circuit for <img alt="{\mathsf{PRIMES}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPRIMES%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is at least <img alt="{(2-\epsilon)\log_2 n + O(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282-%5Cepsilon%29%5Clog_2+n+%2B+O%281%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Recall a DeMorgan formula <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> variables <img alt="{x_1,\dots,x_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a binary tree whose leaves are labeled with variables or their negations, and whose internal nodes are labeled with either <img alt="{\vee}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvee%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for OR and <img alt="{\wedge}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cwedge%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for AND gates. </p>
<p>
Here is a high level view of this result. See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2021/01/14/priming-random-restrictions/">here</a> for details.</p>
<p>
Assume there is a DeMorgan Boolean circuit for <img alt="{\mathsf{PRIMES}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPRIMES%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is at most <img alt="{(2-\epsilon)\log_2 n + O(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282-%5Cepsilon%29%5Clog_2+n+%2B+O%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> depth. We can use the random restriction method to set lots of the inputs to random values <img alt="{0/1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%2F1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </p>
<p>
We claim that with high probability the input looks like 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_1,\dots,x_m, x_{m+1},\dots,x_n. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_m%2C+x_%7Bm%2B1%7D%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>The right-most bits 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{m+1},\dots,x_{n} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7Bm%2B1%7D%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bn%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>are left unset, and the other bits to the left have some bits randomly set. Moreover, the number of bits in the above right is order <img alt="{n^{\epsilon}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>
Now set all the bits in the left group that are unset also to random values <img alt="{0/1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%2F1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Leave the right group unset.</p>
<p>
The point of this is that if we assume that the formula had size at most order <img alt="{n^{2-\epsilon}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B2-%5Cepsilon%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then we have that the formula is likely to be constant. But this contradicts the density of primes and composites. </p>
<p>
</p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
Can Matomäki’s theorem be used to get stronger lower bounds on the complexity of <img alt="{\mathsf{PRIMES}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPRIMES%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? Can it go beyond the quadratic limit?</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">After several attempts, I finally found the energy to start writing a book. It grew out of lecture notes for a graduate class I taught last semester. I make the <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf">draft</a> available so that I can get feedback before a (hopefully) final effort next semester.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The goal of the book is to present old and recent results in learning theory, for the most widely-used learning architectures. This book is geared towards theory-oriented students as well as students who want to acquire a basic mathematical understanding of algorithms used throughout machine learning and associated fields that are large users of learning methods, such as computer vision or natural language processing.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A particular effort is made to prove <strong>many results from first principles</strong>, while keeping the exposition as simple as possible. This will naturally lead to a choice of key results that show-case in simple but relevant instances the important concepts in learning theory. Some general results will also be presented without proofs. Of course the concept of first principles is subjective, and a good knowledge of linear algebra, probability theory and differential calculus will be assumed.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, I will focus on the part of learning theory that does not exist outside of algorithms that can be run in practice, and thus all algorithmic frameworks described in this book are routinely used. For most learning methods, some simple <strong>illustrative experiments</strong> are presented, with the plan to have accompanying code (Matlab, Julia, and Python) so that students can see for themselves that the algorithms are simple and effective in synthetic experiments.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This is <em>not</em> an introductory textbook on machine learning. There are already several good ones in several languages [1, 2]. Many topics are not covered, and many more are not covered in much depth. There are many good textbooks on learning theory that go deeper [3, 4, 5].</p>



<p class="justify-text">The choice of topics is arbitrary (and thus personal). Many important algorithmic frameworks are forgotten (e.g.,  reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, etc.). Suggestions of extra themes are welcome! A few additional chapters are currently being written such as: ensemble learning, bandit optimization, probabilistic methods, structured prediction.</p>



<h2>Help wanted!</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This is still work in progress. In particular, there are still a lot of typos, probably some mistakes, and almost surely places where more details are needed; readers are most welcome to report them to me (and then get credit for it). Also, the bibliography is currently quite short and would benefit from some expansion (all suggestions welcome, in particular for giving proper credit).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, I am convinced that simpler mathematical arguments are possible in many places in the book. If you are aware of elegant and simple ideas that I have overlooked, please let me know.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A somewhat quieter month by recent standards. <s>Three</s> Two papers: graph property testing and quantum distribution testing. <em>(Ed: The distribution testing paper was a revision of a paper we already covered in Sept 2020.)</em></p>



<p><strong>Robust Self-Ordering versus Local Self-Ordering</strong> by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/034">ECCC</a>). In Nov 2020, we covered a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/160/">paper</a> that uses a tool called <em>self-ordered graphs, </em>that transferred bit string function lower bounds to graph property testing. Consider a labeled graph. A graph is self-ordered if its automorphism group only contains the identity element (it has no non-trivial isomorphisms). A graph is robustly self-ordered, if every permutation of the vertices leads to a (labeled) graph that is sufficiently “far” according to edit distance. Given a self-ordered graph \(G\), a local self-ordering procedure is the following. Given access to a copy \(G’\) of \(G\) and a vertex \(v \in V(G’)\), this procedure determines the (unique) vertex in \(V(G)\) that corresponds to \(v\) with sublinear queries to \(G\). In other words, it can locally “label” the graph. Intuitively, one would think that more robustly self-ordered graphs will be easier to locally label. This paper studies the relation between robust and local self-ordering. Curiously, this paper refutes the above intuition for bounded-degree graphs, and (weakly) confirms it for dense graphs. Roughly speaking, there are bounded degree graphs that are highly robustly self-ordered, for which any local self-ordering procedure requires \(\omega(\sqrt{n})\) queries. Moreover, there are bounded degree graphs with \(O(\log n)\)-query local self-ordering procedures, yet are not robustly self-ordered even for weak parameters. For dense graphs, the existence of fast non-adaptive local self-ordering procedures implies robust self-ordering.</p>



<p><strong>Testing identity of collections of quantum states: sample complexity analysis</strong> by Marco Fanizza, Raffaele Salvia, and Vittorio Giovannetti (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14511">arXiv</a>). This paper takes identity testing to the quantum setting. One should think of a \(d\)-dimensional quantum state as a \(d \times d\) density matrix (with some special properties). To learn the state entirely up to error \(\varepsilon\) would require \(O(\varepsilon^{-2} d^2)\) samples/measurements. A recent result of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06002.pdf">Badescu-O’Donnell-Wright</a> proves that identity testing to a known state can be done significantly faster using \(O(\varepsilon^{-2} d)\) measurements. This paper takes this result a step further by consider a set of \(N\) quantum states. A “sample” is like a classical sample, where one gets a sample from a distribution of quantum states. The YES (“uniform”) case is when all the states are identical. The NO (“far from uniform”) case is when they are “far” from being the same state. This paper proves that \(O(\varepsilon^{-2}\sqrt{N}d)\) samples suffices for distinguishing these cases.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (April 5, 2021):</span></strong> So it turns out that Adam Chalcraft and Michael Greene already <a href="http://www.monochrom.at/turingtrainterminal/Chalcraft.pdf">proved the essential result of this post back in 1994</a> (hat tip to commenter Dylan).  Not terribly surprising in retrospect!</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>My son Daniel had his fourth birthday a couple weeks ago.  For a present, he got an electric train set.  (For completeness—and since the details of the train set will be rather important to the post—it’s called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dinosaur-Flexible-Tracks-Create-Children/dp/B07ZDLXSXK">“WESPREX Create a Dinosaur Track”</a>, but this is not an ad and I’m not getting a kickback for it.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/yjunctions.MOV"/></figure>



<p>As you can see, the main feature of this set is a Y-shaped junction, which has a flap that can control which direction the train goes.  The logic is as follows:</p>



<ul><li>If the train is coming up from the “bottom” of the Y, then it continues to either the left arm or the right arm, depending on where the flap is.  It leaves the flap as it was.</li></ul>



<ul><li>If the train is coming down the left or right arms of the Y, then it continues to the bottom of the Y, <em>pushing the flap out of its way if it’s in the way</em>.  (Thus, if the train were ever to return to this Y-junction coming up from the bottom, not having passed the junction in the interim, it would necessarily go to the same arm, left or right, that it came down from.)</li></ul>



<p>The train set also comes with bridges and tunnels; thus, there’s no restriction of planarity.  Finally, the train set comes with little gadgets that can reverse the train’s direction, sending it back in the direction that it came from:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/train1.MOV"/></figure>



<p>These gadgets don’t seem particularly important, though, since we could always replace them if we wanted by a Y-junction together with a loop.</p>



<p>Notice that, at each Y-junction, the position of the flap stores one bit of internal state, and that the train can both “read” and “write” these bits as it moves around.  Thus, a question naturally arises: can this train set do any nontrivial computations?  If there are <em>n</em> Y-junctions, then can it cycle through exp(<em>n</em>) different states?  Could it even solve <strong>PSPACE</strong>-complete problems, if we let it run for exponential time?  (For a very different example of a model-train-like system that, as it turns out, <em>is</em> able to express <strong>PSPACE</strong>-complete problems, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00518">this recent paper</a> by Erik Demaine et al.)</p>



<p>Whatever the answers regarding Daniel’s train set, I knew immediately on watching the thing go that I’d have to write a “paperlet” on the problem and publish it on my blog (no, I don’t inflict such things on journals!).  Today’s post constitutes my third “paperlet,” on the general theme of a discrete dynamical system that someone showed me in real life (e.g. in a children’s toy or in biology) having more structure and regularity than one might naïvely expect.  My first such paperlet, from 2014, was <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1902">on a 1960s toy called the Digi-Comp II</a>; my second, from 2016, was <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2862">on DNA strings acted on by recombinase</a> (OK, that one <em>was</em> associated with a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6297/aad8559.full?ijkey=wzroPPh1eIu9k&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">paper in <em>Science</em></a>, but my combinatorial analysis wasn’t the main point of the paper).</p>



<p>Anyway, after spending an enjoyable evening on the problem of Daniel’s train set, I was able to prove that, alas, the possible behaviors are quite limited (I classified them all), falling far short of computational universality.</p>



<p>If you feel like I’m wasting your time with trivialities (or if you simply enjoy puzzles), then before you read any further, I encourage you to stop and try to prove this for yourself!</p>



<p>Back yet?  OK then…</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Assume a finite amount of train track.  Then after a linear amount of time, the train will necessarily enter a “boring infinite loop”—i.e., an attractor state in which at most two of the flaps keep getting toggled, and the rest of the flaps are fixed in place.  In more detail, the attractor must take one of four forms:</p>



<p>I. a line (with reversing gadgets on both ends),<br/>II. a simple cycle,<br/>III. a “lollipop” (with one reversing gadget and one flap that keeps getting toggled), or<br/>IV. a “dumbbell” (with two flaps that keep getting toggled).</p>



<p>In more detail still, there are seven possible topologically distinct trajectories for the train, as shown in the figure below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/trajectories.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/trajectories.png"/></a></figure>



<p>Here the red paths represent the attractors, where the train loops around and around for an unlimited amount of time, while the blue paths represent “runways” where the train spends a limited amount of time on its way into the attractor.  Every degree-3 vertex is assumed to have a Y-junction, while every degree-1 vertex is assumed to have a reversing gadget, unless (in IIb) the train starts at that vertex and never returns to it.</p>



<p>The proof of the theorem rests on two simple observations.</p>



<p><strong>Observation 1:</strong> While the Y-junctions correspond to vertices of degree 3, there are no vertices of degree 4 or higher.  This means that, if the train ever revisits a vertex <em>v</em> (other than the start vertex) for a second time, then there must be some edge <em>e</em> incident to <em>v</em> that it also traverses for a second time immediately afterward.</p>



<p><strong>Observation 2:</strong> Suppose the train traverses some edge <em>e</em>, then goes around a simple cycle (meaning, one where no edges or vertices are reused), and then traverses <em>e</em> again, <em>going in the same direction as the first time</em>.  Then from that point forward, the train will just continue around the same simple cycle forever.</p>



<p>The proof of Observation 2 is simply that, if there were any flap that might be in the train’s way as it continued around the simple cycle, then the train would already have pushed it out of the way its <em>first</em> time around the cycle, and nothing that happened thereafter could possibly change the flap’s position.</p>



<p>Using the two observations above, let’s now prove the theorem.  Let the train start where it will, and follow it as it traces out a path.  Since the graph is finite, at some point some already-traversed edge must be traversed a second time.  Let <em>e</em> be the first such edge.  By Observation 1, this will also be the first time the train’s path intersects itself at all.  There are then three cases:</p>



<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> The train traverses <em>e</em> in the same direction as it did the first time.  By Observation 2, the train is now stuck in a simple cycle forever after.  So the only question is what the train could’ve done <em>before</em> entering the simple cycle.  We claim that at most, it could’ve traversed a simple path.  For otherwise, we’d contradict the assumption that <em>e</em> was the first edge that the train visited twice on its journey.  So the trajectory must have type IIa, IIb, or IIc in the figure.</p>



<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Immediately after traversing e, the train hits a reversing gadget and traverses <em>e</em> again the other way.  In this case, the train will clearly retrace its entire path and then continue past its starting point; the question is what happens next.  If it hits another reversing gadget, then the trajectory will have type I in the figure.  If it enters a simple cycle and stays in it, then the trajectory will have type IIb in the figure.  If, finally, it makes a simple cycle and then <em>exits</em> the cycle, then the trajectory will have type III in the figure.  In this last case, the train’s trajectory will form a “lollipop” shape.  Note that there must be a Y-junction where the “stick” of the lollipop meets the “candy” (i.e., the simple cycle), with the base of the Y aligned with the stick (since otherwise the train would’ve continued around and around the candy).  From this, we deduce that every time the train goes around the candy, it does so in a different orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise) than the time before; and that the train toggles the Y-junction’s flap every time it exits the candy (although not when it enters the candy).</p>



<p><strong>Case 3:</strong> At some point after traversing <em>e</em> in the forward direction (but not <em>immediately</em> after), the train traverses <em>e</em> in the reverse direction.  In this case, the broad picture is analogous to Case 2.  So far, the train has made a lollipop with a Y-junction connecting the stick to the candy (i.e. cycle), the base of the Y aligned with the stick, and <em>e</em> at the very top of the stick.  The question is what happens next.  If the train next hits a reversing gadget, the trajectory will have type III in the figure.  If it enters a new simple cycle, disjoint from the first cycle, and never leaves it, the trajectory will have type IId in the figure.  If it enters a new simple cycle, disjoint from the first cycle, and <em>does</em> leave it, then the trajectory now has a “dumbbell” pattern, type IV in the figure (also shown in the first video).  There’s only one other situation to worry about: namely, that the train makes a new cycle that <em>intersects</em> the first cycle, forming a “theta” (θ) shaped trajectory.  In this case, there must be a Y-junction at the point where the new cycle bumps into the old cycle.  Now, if the base of the Y isn’t part of the old cycle, then the train never could’ve made it all the way around the old cycle in the first place (it would’ve exited the old cycle at this Y-junction), contradiction.  If the base of the Y <em>is</em> part of the old cycle, then the flap must have been initially set to let the train make it all the way around the old cycle; when the train then reenters the old cycle, the flap must be moved so that the train will never make it all the way around the old cycle again.  So now the train is stuck in a new simple cycle (sharing some edges with the old cycle), and the trajectory has type IIc in the figure.</p>



<p>This completes the proof of the theorem.</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>We might wonder: <em>why</em> isn’t this model train set capable of universal computation, of AND, OR, and NOT gates—or at any rate, of <em>some</em> computation more interesting than repeatedly toggling one or two flaps?  My answer might sound tautological: it’s simply that the logic of the Y-junctions is too limited.  Yes, the flaps can get pushed out of the way—that’s a “bit flip”—but every time such a flip happens, it helps to set up a “groove” in which the train just wants to continue around and around forever, not flipping any additional bits, with only the minor complications of the lollipop and dumbbell structures to deal with.  Even though my proof of the theorem might’ve seemed like a tedious case analysis, it had this as its unifying message.</p>



<p>It’s interesting to think about what gadgets would need to be added to the train set to <em>make</em> it computationally universal, or at least expressively richer—able, as <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1902">turned out</a> to be the case for the Digi-Comp II, to express some nontrivial complexity class falling short of <strong>P</strong>.  So for example, what if we had degree-4 vertices, with little turnstile gadgets?  Or multiple trains, which could be synchronized to the millisecond to control how they interacted with each other via the flaps, or which could even crash into each other?  I look forward to reading your ideas in the comment section!</p>



<p>For the truth is this: quantum complexity classes, BosonSampling, closed timelike curves, circuit complexity in black holes and AdS/CFT, etc. etc.—all these topics are great, but the same models and problems do get stale after a while.  I aspire for my research agenda to chug forward, full steam ahead, into new computational domains.</p>



<p>PS. Happy Easter to those who celebrate!</p></div>

    <title>TR21-050 |  Linear Threshold Secret-Sharing with Binary Reconstruction | 

	Marshall Ball, 

	Alper Cakan, 

	Tal Malkin</title>
    <summary>Motivated in part by applications in lattice-based cryptography, we initiate the study of the size of linear threshold (`$t$-out-of-$n$') secret-sharing where the linear reconstruction function is restricted to coefficients in $\{0,1\}$. We prove upper and lower bounds on the share size of such schemes. One ramification of our results is that a natural variant of Shamir's classic scheme [Comm. of ACM, 1979], where bit-decomposition is applied to each share, is optimal for when the underlying field has characteristic 2. Another ramification is that schemes obtained from some monotone formulae are optimal for certain threshold values when the field's characteristic is any constant. We prove our results by defining and investigating an equivalent variant of Karchmer and Wigderson's Monotone Span Programs [CCC, 1993]. 

We also study the complexity such schemes with the additional requirement that the joint distribution of the shares of any unauthorized set of parties is not only independent of the secret, but also uniformly distributed. This property is critical for security of certain applications in lattice-based cryptography. We show that any such scheme must use $\Omega(n\log n)$ field elements, regardless of the field. Moreover, for any field this is tight up to constant factors for the special cases where any $t=n-1$ parties can reconstruct, as well as for any threshold when the field characteristic is 2.</summary>

He applies machine learning to problems of text generation, summarizing long documents, and interactions between character and word-based models. Sasha is previously at Harvard, where he taught an awesome NLP class, and we are excited to have him as our guest!

<p>The first half of the talk will focus on how NLP works and what makes it interesting: a bird’s-eye view of the field. The second half of the talk will focus on current research.</p>



<h2>Basics of NLP</h2>



<p>Textual data has many different challenges that differ from computer vision (CV), since it is a human phenomenon. There are methods that work in computer vision / other ML models that just don’t work for NLP (e.g. GANs). As effective methods were found for computer vision around 2009-2014, we thought that these methods would also work well for NLP. While this was sometimes the case, it has not been true in general.</p>



<p>What are the difficulties of working with natural language? Language works at different scales:</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">word &lt; phrase &lt; sentence &lt; document &lt; ...
</pre></div>


<p>Here are examples of structure at each level:</p>



<ol><li>Zipf’s Law: The frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its popularity rank.</li><li>Given the last <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> symbols, it is often possible to predict the next one (The Shannon Game).</li><li>Linguists have found many rules about syntax and semantics of a language.</li><li>In a document, we have lots of discourse between different sentences. For example, “it” or other pronouns are context dependent.</li></ol>



<p>In NLP, we will talk about the <em>syntax</em> and <em>semantics</em> of a document. The syntax refers to how words can fit together, and semantics refers to the meaning of these words.</p>



<h2>Language Modeling</h2>



<p>There are many different NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, named entity recognition, and translation. However, recent research shows that these tasks are often related to language modeling.</p>



<p>Language modeling, as explained in Shannon 1948, aims to answer the following question: <em>Think of language as a stochastic process producing symbols. Given the last <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> symbols, can we predict the next one?</em></p>



<p>This question is challenging as is. Consider the following example:</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">A reading lamp on the desk shed glow on polished ___
</pre></div>


<p>There are many options: marble/desk/stone/engraving/etc., and it is already difficult to give a probability here. In general, language is hard to model because the next word can be connected to words from a long time ago.</p>



<p>Shannon proposes variants of Markov models to perform this prediction, based on the last couple characters or the context in general.</p>



<p>Since local context matters most, we assume that only the <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> most recent words matter. Then, we get the model<br/><img alt="p(w_{t+1}|w_{t-n},\ldots,w_t)=\frac{p(w_{t-n},\ldots,w_t,w_{t+1})}{p(w_{t-n},\ldots,w_t)}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28w_%7Bt%2B1%7D%7Cw_%7Bt-n%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cw_t%29%3D%5Cfrac%7Bp%28w_%7Bt-n%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cw_t%2Cw_%7Bt%2B1%7D%29%7D%7Bp%28w_%7Bt-n%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cw_t%29%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<h3>Measuring Performance</h3>



<p>As <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/02/24/unsupervised-learning-and-generative-models/">we have seen in the generative models lecture</a>, we can use cross entropy as a loss function for density estimation models. Given model density distribution <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and true distribution <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the cross entropy (which equals negative expected log-likelihood) is defined as follows:</p>



<p><img alt="H(p, q) = - E_p \log q(w_t | w_1, \ldots , w_{t-1})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28p%2C+q%29+%3D+-+E_p+%5Clog+q%28w_t+%7C+w_1%2C+%5Cldots+%2C+w_%7Bt-1%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>In NLP we tend to use the metric “perplexity”, which is the exponentiated negative cross entropy:</p>



<p><img alt="ppl(p, q) = \exp -H(p, q)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ppl%28p%2C+q%29+%3D+%5Cexp+-H%28p%2C+q%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>This corresponds to the equivalent vocabulary size of a uniformly distributed model. Lower perplexity means our model was closer to the underlying text distribution. As an example, the perplexity of the perfect dice-roll model would be 6.</p>



<p>Why do we care about perplexity anyway?</p>



<ol><li>With a good model we can determine the natural perplexity of a language, which is interesting.</li><li>Many NLP questions are language modeling with conditioning. Speech recognition is language modeling conditioned on some sound signal, and translation is language modeling conditioned on text from another language.</li><li>More importantly, we have found recent applications in <em>transfer learning</em>. That is, a language model can be trained on some (small) input data for a specific task. Then, such a model becomes effective at the given task!</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/model_task.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8081" src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/model_task.png?w=1024"/></a></figure>



<p>A few years ago, the best perplexity on WSJ text was 150. Nowadays, it is about 20! To understand how we got here, we look at modern language modeling.</p>



<h2>Predicting the next word</h2>



<p>We start with the model</p>



<p><img alt="p(w_t | w_{1:t-1}; \theta) = softmax(\mathbf{W}\phi(w_{1:t-1}; \theta))." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28w_t+%7C+w_%7B1%3At-1%7D%3B+%5Ctheta%29+%3D+softmax%28%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%5Cphi%28w_%7B1%3At-1%7D%3B+%5Ctheta%29%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>(The softmax function maps a vector <img alt="\vec{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> into the probability distribution <img alt="\vec{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that <img alt="p_i \propto \exp(v_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i+%5Cpropto+%5Cexp%28v_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. That is, <img alt="p_i = \exp(v_i)/\sum_j \exp(v_j)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i+%3D+%5Cexp%28v_i%29%2F%5Csum_j+%5Cexp%28v_j%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Note that this is a Boltzman distribution of the type we saw in the <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/04/02/inference-and-statistical-physics/">statistical physics and variational algorithms</a> lecture)</p>



<p>We call <strong>W</strong> the output word embeddings, <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is some neural basis (e.g. <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are all but the final layers of a neural net with weights <img alt="\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and <strong>W</strong> is the final layer). However, this means to use softmax to predict requires computing softmax over every word in your vocabulary (tens or hundreds of thousands). This was often infeasible until GPU computing became available.</p>



<p>As an aside, why not predict characters instead of words? The advantage is that there are much fewer characters than words. However, computation with characters is slower. Empirically, character-based models tend to perform worse than word-based. However, character-based models can handle words outside the vocabulary.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding">Byte-pair encoding</a> offers a bridge between character and word models. This greedily builds up new tokens as repetitive patterns are found in the original text.</p>



<p>In the last decade NLP has seen a few dominant architectures, all using SGD but with varying bases. First, we must cast the words as one-hot vectors, then embed them into vector space:<br/><img alt="x_t = Vw_t," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t+%3D+Vw_t%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/>where <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the one-hot encoded vector and <img alt="V" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the learned embedding transformation.</p>



<h3>NNLM</h3>



<p>NNLM (Neural Network Language Model) is like a CNN. The model predicts on possibly multiple NN transformations:<br/><img alt="\phi(w_{1:t-1}; \theta) = \sigma(U[x_{t-k-1} \oplus \ldots \oplus x_{t-1}]])," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28w_%7B1%3At-1%7D%3B+%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Csigma%28U%5Bx_%7Bt-k-1%7D+%5Coplus+%5Cldots+%5Coplus+x_%7Bt-1%7D%5D%5D%29%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>where <img alt="\oplus" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coplus&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> denotes concatenation, <img alt="U" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is some convolutional filter and <img alt="\sigma" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the activation function. This has the benefit of learning fast. The matrices it learns also transfer well.</p>



<p>As an example, GloVe is a NNLM-inspired model. It stores the words in 300-dimensional space. When we project the some words to 2-dimensions using PCA, we find semantic information in the language model.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Language structure" src="https://i.imgur.com/wesRAtM.png"/></figure>



<h3>Recurrent Models</h3>



<p>A recurrent model uses a fixed set of previous words to predict the next word. A recurrent network uses all previous words:<br/><img alt="\phi(w_{1:t-1}; \theta) = \sigma(U[x_{t-1}\oplus \phi(w_{1:t-2};\theta)])." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28w_%7B1%3At-1%7D%3B+%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Csigma%28U%5Bx_%7Bt-1%7D%5Coplus+%5Cphi%28w_%7B1%3At-2%7D%3B%5Ctheta%29%5D%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Previous information is ‘summarized’ in the <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on the right, so this model uses finite memory. Below is an illustration of the recurrent neural network.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rnn.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8080" src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/rnn.png?w=1024"/></a></figure>



<p>Since the recurrent model uses the full context, it is a more plausible model for how we really process language. Furthermore, the introduction of RNN saw drastically improved performance. In the graph below, the items in the chart are performances from previous NNLMs. The recurrent network performance is “off the chart”.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="RNN Performance" src="https://i.imgur.com/v5rgNeQ.png"/></figure>



<p>However, the model grows with sequence length. This requires gradient flow to backpropagate over arbitrarily long sequences, and often required baroque network designs to facilitate longer sequences while avoiding exploding/vanishing gradients.</p>



<h3>Attentional Models</h3>



<p>To understand modern NLP we must look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)">attention</a>. For a set of vectors <img alt="v" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, keys <img alt="k_1, \ldots, k_T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_1%2C+%5Cldots%2C+k_T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and a query <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we define attention as</p>



<p><img alt="Att(q, k, v) = \sum_t \alpha_t v_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Att%28q%2C+k%2C+v%29+%3D+%5Csum_t+%5Calpha_t+v_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>where <img alt="\alpha = softmax(q\cdot k_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus q \cdot k_T)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%3D+softmax%28q%5Ccdot+k_1+%5Coplus+%5Cldots+%5Coplus+q+%5Ccdot+k_T%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>Here, <img alt="\alpha" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be considered a probability density of the model’s ‘memory’ of the sequence. The model decides which words are important by combining <img alt="\alpha" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="v" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>The <em>attentional model</em> can be fully autoregressive (use all previously seen words), and the query <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be learned or be specific to an input. In general, we have:<br/><img alt="\phi(w_{1:t-1}; \theta) = \sigma(U[Att(q, x_{1:t-1}, x_{1:t-1})])" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28w_%7B1%3At-1%7D%3B+%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Csigma%28U%5BAtt%28q%2C+x_%7B1%3At-1%7D%2C+x_%7B1%3At-1%7D%29%5D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Since we condense all previous information into the attention mechanism, it is simpler to backpropagate.<br/>In particular attention enables looking at information from a large context without paying for this in the depth of the network and hence in the depth of back-propagation you need to cover. (Boaz’s note: With my crypto background, attention reminds me of the design of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher">block ciphers</a>, which use linear operations to mix between far away parts of the inputs, and then apply non-liearity locally to each small parts.)</p>



<p>Note that attention is defined with respect to a set of vectors. There is no idea of positional information in the attentional model. How do we encode positional information for the model? One way to do this is using <em>sinusoidal encoding</em> in the keys. We store the word <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as <img alt="\cos(\pi n/k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%28%5Cpi+n%2Fk%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for some period <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Notice that if we choose many different periods, then the cosine ways will almost never meet at the same point. As a result, only recent points will have high dot products between the different cosine values.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Sinusoidal" src="https://i.imgur.com/kAnYjAP.png"/></figure>



<h3>Transformers</h3>



<p>A transformer is a stacked attention model. Computation in one layer becomes query, keys and values for the next layer. This is a multiheaded attention model. We learn <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> projections for each query/key (generally between 8 and 32) then do softmax across these projections:<br/><img alt="\alpha^h = softmax((W^{(h)}q)\cdot(V^{(h)}k_1)\oplus \ldots \oplus (W^{(h)}q)\cdot(V^{(h)}k_T))." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%5Eh+%3D+softmax%28%28W%5E%7B%28h%29%7Dq%29%5Ccdot%28V%5E%7B%28h%29%7Dk_1%29%5Coplus+%5Cldots+%5Coplus+%28W%5E%7B%28h%29%7Dq%29%5Ccdot%28V%5E%7B%28h%29%7Dk_T%29%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Transformer Architecture" src="https://i.imgur.com/uUp2elD.png"/></figure>



<p>These heads can be computed in parallel and can be implemented with batch matrix multiplication. As a result, transformers can be massively scaled and are extremely efficient in modern hardware. This has led these models to be very dominant in the field. Here are some example models:</p>



<ol><li>GPT-1,2,3 are able to generate text that is quite convincing to a human. They also handle the syntax and semantics of a language quite well.</li><li>BERT is a transformer-based model that examines text both forwards and backwards in making its predictions. It works well with transfer fining tuning: train on a large data set, then take the feature representations and train a task on top of the learned representation.</li></ol>



<h2>Scaling</h2>



<p>In recent years we have had larger and larger models, from GPT1’s 110 million to GPT3’s 175 billion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Scaling Up" src="https://i.imgur.com/8drDknV.png"/></figure>



<p>On these massive scales, scaling has become a very interesting issue: how do we process more samples? How do we run distributed computation? How much autoregressive input should each model looks at? (Boaz’s note: To get a sense of how big these models are, GPT-3 was trained on about <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/">1000B tokens</a>. The total <a href="https://www.prb.org/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth/">number of people that ever lived</a> is about 100B, and only about half since the invention of the printing press, so this is arguably a non-negligible fraction of all text produced in human history.)</p>



<p>For a model like BERT, most of the cost still comes from feed-forward network — mostly matrix multiplications. These are tasks we are familiar with and can scale up.</p>



<p>One question is to have long-range attentional lookup, which is important for language modeling. For now, models often look at most 512 words back. Can we do longer range lookups? One approach to this is kernel feature attention.</p>



<h3>Kernel Feature Attention</h3>



<p>Recall that we have <img alt="\alpha=\mathrm{softmax}(q\cdot k_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%3D%5Cmathrm%7Bsoftmax%7D%28q%5Ccdot+k_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Can we approximate this with some kernel <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? The main approach is that <img alt="\alpha\propto \exp(q\cdot k_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%5Cpropto+%5Cexp%28q%5Ccdot+k_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which we approximate with the kernel <img alt="\exp(v_1\cdot v_2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28v_1%5Ccdot+v_2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. There is a rich literature on approximating <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where<br/><img alt="K(v_1, v_2) \approx \phi(v_1)\cdot\phi(v_2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%28v_1%2C+v_2%29+%5Capprox+%5Cphi%28v_1%29%5Ccdot%5Cphi%28v_2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>for some transfomration <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then, we can try to approximate <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with linear features.</p>



<p>Practically, transformers do well but are slower. For longer texts, we have faster models that do slightly worse. A recent model called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794">performer</a> is such an example.<br/><img alt="LRA Performance" src="https://i.imgur.com/S3vs2o5.png"/></p>



<h3>Scaling Down</h3>



<p>Ultimately, we want to make models run on “non Google scale” hardware once it has been trained to a specific task. This can often require scaling down.</p>



<p>One approach is to prune weights according to their magnitude. However, since models are often overparameterized and weights do not move much, the weights that get pruned according to this method are usually the weights that were simply initialized closest to 0. In the diagram below, we can consider only leaving the orange weights and cutting out the gray.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Pruning" src="https://i.imgur.com/MqY5jK2.png"/></figure>



<p>Another approach is to mask out the weights that are unnecessary for a specific task, if you’re trying to ship a model for a specific task.</p>



<h2>Research Questions</h2>



<p>Two major lines of research dominate NLP today:</p>



<ol><li>Attention / Transformer architecture,</li><li>Pretraining with language modeling as a deep learning paradigm.</li></ol>



<p>We are also in a space race to produce efficient models with more parameters, given how much scaling has been effective.</p>



<p>The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00854">Which BERT</a> classifies modern questions in NLP into the following categories:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Is (masked) language modeling the best task for pretraining? Language modeling emphasizes local information. We could imagine doing other types of denoising. See also <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">DALL-E</a>.</li><li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> We see that much fewer parameters are needed in practice after pruning. Does pruning lose something? Pruned models tend to do well on in-sample data, but out-of-sample data tends to make the pruned model do worse.</li><li><strong>Data:</strong> How does data used in pretraining impact task accuracy? How does the data of pretraining impact task bias?</li><li><strong>Interpretability:</strong> What does BERT know, and how can we determine this? Does interpretability need to come at a cost to performance?</li><li><strong>Multilinguality:</strong> Many languages don’t have the same amount of data as English. What methods apply when we have less data?</li></ol>



<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>



<p>We have many questions asked during and after lecture. Here are some of the questions.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Q:</strong> Should we say GANs fail at NLP or that other generative models are more advanced in NLP than in CV? <strong>A:</strong> One argument is that language is a human generated system, there are some inherent structures that help with generation. We can do language in left-to-right, but in CV this would be a lot more difficult. At the same time, this can change in the future!</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Why are computer vision and NLP somewhat close to each other? <strong>A:</strong> classically, they are both perception-style tasks under AI. Also, around 2014 we had lots of ideas that come from porting CV ideas into NLP, and recently we have seen NLP ideas ported to CV.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Since languages have unique grammars, is NLP better at some languages? Do we have to translate language to an “NLP-effective” language and back? <strong>A:</strong> In the past, some languages are better. Ex: we used to struggle with Japanese to other languages but do well with English to other languages. However, modern models are <em>extremely</em> data driven, so we have needed much less hardcoding.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Have we done any scatter plot of the form (data available for language X, performance on X) to see if performance is just a function of available data? <strong>A:</strong> Not right now, but these plots can potentially be really cool! Multilinguality is a broad area of research in general.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> What are some NLP techniques for low-resource languages? <strong>A:</strong> Bridging is commonly used. Iterative models (translate and translate back with some consistency) is also used to augment the data.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think old-school parsers will make a comeback? <strong>A:</strong> Unlikely to deploy parsers, but the techniques of parsing is interesting.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Given the large number of possible “correct” answers, has there been work on which “contexts” are most informative? <strong>A:</strong> Best context is the closest context, which is expected. The other words matter but matter a lot less.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Is there any model that captures the global structure first (e.g. an outline) before writing sequentially, like humans do when they write longer texts? <strong>A:</strong> Currently no. Should be possible, but we do not have data about the global structure of writing.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Why is our goal density estimation? <strong>A:</strong> It is useful because it tells us how “surprising” the next word is. This is also related to why a language feels “fast” when you first learn it: because you are not familiar with the words, you cannot anticipate the next words.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Why is lower perplexity better? <strong>A:</strong> Recall from past talk that lower cross-entropy means less distance between <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and intuitive you have more “certainty”.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Is the reason LM so important because evaluations are syntax-focused? <strong>A:</strong> Evaluations are actually more semantically focused, but syntax and semantics are quite connected.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Do we see attentional models in CV? <strong>A:</strong> Yes, we have seen more use of transformer in CV. In a standard model we use data only recently, and here we get to work with data across space and time. As such, we will need to encode time positionally.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Why is attention generalized convolution? <strong>A:</strong> If you have attention with all mass in the local area, that’s probably like convolution.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> How do we compare heads with depth? e.g. Is having 5 heads better than 5x depth? <strong>A:</strong> when we use heads we add a lot less parameters. As such, we can parallelize heads and increase performance.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think transformers are the be-all end-all of NLP models? <strong>A:</strong> Maybe. To dethrone transformers, you have to both show similar work on small-scale and show that it can be scaled easily.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> How does simplicity bias affect these transferrable models? <strong>A:</strong> surprising and we are not sure. In CV we found that the models quickly notice peculiarities in the data (e.g. how mechanical turks are grouped), but the models do work.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> We get bigger models every year and better performance. Will this end soon? <strong>A:</strong> Probably not, as it seems like having more parameters helps it recognize some additional features.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> If we prune models to the same size, will they have the same performance? <strong>A:</strong> for small models we can seem to prune them, but for the bigger models it is hard to run them in academica given the computational resource constraints.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> When we try to remember something from a long time ago we would look up a textbook / etc. Have we had similar approaches in practice? <strong>A:</strong> transformer training is static at first, and tasks happen later. So, we have to decide how to throw away information before we train on the tasks.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Are better evaluation metrics an important direction for future research? <strong>A:</strong> Yes — this has been the case for the past few years in academia.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> What is a benchmark/task where you think current models show deep lack of capability? <strong>A:</strong> During generation, models don’t seem to distinguish between information that makes it “sound good” and factually correct information.</li></ol></div>

<h2>Digression: Frequentism vs Bayesianism</h2>



<p>Before getting started, we’ll discuss the difference between the two dominant schools of thought in probability: Frequentism and Bayesianism.</p>



<p>Frequentism holds that the probability of an event is the long-run average proportion of something that happens many, many times, so a coin has 50% probability of being heads if on average half of the flips are heads. One consequence of this framework is that a one-off event like Biden winning the election doesn’t have any probability as by definition they can only be observed once.</p>



<p>Bayesians reject this model of the world. For example, a famous Bayesian, Jaynes, even wrote that “probabilities are frequencies only in an imaginary universe.”</p>



<p>While these branches of thought are different, generally the answers to most questions are the same, so the distinction will not matter for this class. However, these branches of thought inspire different types of methods, which we now discuss.</p>



<p>For example, suppose that we have a probability distribution <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that we can get samples from in the form of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In statistics, our goal is to calculate a hypothesis <img alt="h \in \mathcal{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> which minimizes <img alt="\mathcal{L}_{D}(h)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D_%7BD%7D%28h%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (possibly a loss function, but any minimand will do) where we estimate <img alt="\mathcal{L}_D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D_D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with our samples <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Wvujokc.png"/></figure>



<p>A <strong>frequentist</strong> does this by defining a family <img alt="\mathcal{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of potential distributions, and we need to find a transformation <img alt="\vec{x} \mapsto h(\vec{x})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Bx%7D+%5Cmapsto+h%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> which minimizes the cost for all <img alt="D \in \mathcal{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/CHDrLRW.png"/></figure>



<p>These equations amount to saying that <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is minimizing the worst-case loss over all distributions.</p>



<p>By contrast, a <strong>Bayesian</strong> approaches this task by assuming that <img alt="D = D_{\vec{w}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+%3D+D_%7B%5Cvec%7Bw%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="\vec{w} \sim P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Bw%7D+%5Csim+P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are latent variables sampled from a prior.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/GDhqJTT.png"/></figure>



<p>Then, let <img alt="Q_{\vec{x}}(\vec{w}) = P(w | D_{\vec{w}} = x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_%7B%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%7D%28%5Cvec%7Bw%7D%29+%3D+P%28w+%7C+D_%7B%5Cvec%7Bw%7D%7D+%3D+x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be the <em>posterior</em> distribution of <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> conditioned on the observations <img alt="\vec{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We now minimize</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/dNTPavw.png"/></figure>



<p>In fact, Bayesian approaches extend beyond this, as if you can sample from a posterior you can do more than just minimize a loss function.</p>



<p>In Bayesian inference, chosing the prior <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is often very important. One classical approach is a <em>maximum entropy prior</em>, because it’s the least informative (hence, the most entropy) and requires the fewest assumptions.</p>



<p>These two minimization equations con sometimes lead to identical results, but often in practice they work out differently once we introduce <strong>computational constraints</strong> into the picture. In the frequentist approach, we generally constrain the family of mappings <img alt="\vec{x} \rightarrow \vec{h}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Bx%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cvec%7Bh%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be efficiently computable. In the Bayesian approach, we typically approximate the posterior instead and either use approximate sampling or a restricted hypothesis class for the posterior to be able to efficiently sample from it.</p>

<h2>Part 1. An introduction to Statistical Physics</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/FOIcEVs.jpg"/></figure>



<p>Compare water and ice. Water is hotter, and the molecules move around more. In ice, by contrast, the molecules are more stationary. When the temperature increases, the objects move more quickly, and when they decrease the objects have less energy and stop moving. There are also phase transitions, where certain temperatures cause qualitative discontinuities in behavior, like solid to liquid or liquid to gas.<br/></p>



<p>See video from <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">here</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ezgif.com-gif-maker-1.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-8064" src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ezgif.com-gif-maker-1.gif?w=702"/></a></figure>



<p>An atomic state can be thought of as <img alt="x \in {0, 1}^{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%7B0%2C+1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Now, how do we represent the system’s state? The crucial observation that makes statistical physics different from “vanilla physics” is the insight to represent the system state as a probability distribution <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> supported on <img alt="{0, 1}^{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%2C+1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, rather than in a single state.</p>



<p>Each atomic state has a negative energy function (which we will think of as a utility function) <img alt="W: {0, 1}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%3A+%7B0%2C+1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In some sense, the system “wants” to have a high value of <img alt="\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p}[ W(x)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bx+%5Csim+p%7D%5B+W%28x%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In addition, when the temperature is high, the system “wants” to have a high value of entropy.</p>



<p>Thus, an axiom of thermodynamics states that to find the true distribution, we need only look at the maximizer of</p>



<p><img alt="p = \arg\max_{q} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim q}[W(x)] + \tau \cdot H(q)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+%5Carg%5Cmax_%7Bq%7D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bx+%5Csim+q%7D%5BW%28x%29%5D+%2B+%5Ctau+%5Ccdot+H%28q%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>That is, it is the probability distribution which maximizes a linear combination of the expected negative energy and the entropy, with the temperature controlling the coefficient of entropy in this combination (the higher the temperature, the more the system prioritizes having high entropy).</p>



<p>The <strong>variational principle</strong>, which we prove later, states that the <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> which maximizes this satisfies</p>



<p><img alt="p(x) \propto \exp(\tau^{-1} \cdot W(x))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29+%5Cpropto+%5Cexp%28%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+W%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>which is known as the <strong>Boltzmann Distribution</strong>. We often write this with a normalizing constant, so <img alt="p(x) = \exp(\tau^{-1} \cdot W(x) - A_{\tau}(W))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+W%28x%29+-+A_%7B%5Ctau%7D%28W%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="A_{\tau}(W) = \log (\int \exp(\tau^{1} \cdot W(x)))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7B%5Ctau%7D%28W%29+%3D+%5Clog+%28%5Cint+%5Cexp%28%5Ctau%5E%7B1%7D+%5Ccdot+W%28x%29%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>Before proving the variational principle, we will go through some examples of statistical physics.</p>



<h3>Example: Ising Model</h3>



<p>In the Ising model, we have <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> magnets that are connected in a square grid. The atomic state is each <img alt="x \in {\pm 1}^{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%7B%5Cpm+1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which represents “spin”. The value of <img alt="W(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="J\sum_{i \sim j} x_i x_j + J'\sum_{i} x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Csim+j%7D+x_i+x_j+%2B+J%27%5Csum_%7Bi%7D+x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="i \sim j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Csim+j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> denotes that <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are adjacent magnets. This encourages adjacent magnets to have aligned spins. One important concept, which we will return to later, is that the values of <img alt="{x_i, x_ix_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%2C+x_ix_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are sufficient to calculate the value of <img alt="W(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (these are known as <em>sufficient statistics</em>). Furthermore, if we wanted to calculate <img alt="\mathbb{E}[W(x)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BW%28x%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, it would be enough to calculate the values of <img alt="\mathbb{E}[x_i]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Bx_i%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="\mathbb{E}[x_i x_j]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Bx_i+x_j%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and then apply linearity of expectation. An illustration of an Ising model that we cool down slowly can be found here:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/VG1ION8.jpg"/></figure>



<p>and a video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjwKgpQ-l1s">here</a>.</p>



<p>This is what a low-temperature Ising model looks like – note that <img alt="W(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is high because almost all adjacent spins are aligned (hence the well-defined regions).</p>



<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1094">Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model</a> is a generalization of the Ising model to a random graph, which represents a disordered mean field model. Here, <img alt="x \in {\pm 1}^{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%7B%5Cpm+1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> still represents spin, and <img alt="W(x) = \sum w_{i, j} x_i x_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29+%3D+%5Csum+w_%7Bi%2C+j%7D+x_i+x_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="w_{i, j} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_%7Bi%2C+j%7D+%5Csim+%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%280%2C+1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The SK-model is deeply influential in statistical physics. We say that it is <em>disordered</em> because the utility function <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is chosen at random and that it is a <em>mean field</em> model because, unlike the Ising model, there is no geometry in the sense that every pair of individual variables <img alt="x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="x_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are equally likely to be connected.</p>



<p>Our third example is the posterior distribution, where <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a hidden variable with a uniform prior. We now makes, say, <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> independent observations <img alt="O_1, O_2, \ldots O_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_1%2C+O_2%2C+%5Cldots+O_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The probability of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is given by</p>



<p><img alt="p(x) \propto p(x\text{ satisfies } O_1) \cdot p(x\text{ satisfies } O_2) \ldots p(x\text{ satisfies } O_k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29+%5Cpropto+p%28x%5Ctext%7B+satisfies+%7D+O_1%29+%5Ccdot+p%28x%5Ctext%7B+satisfies+%7D+O_2%29+%5Cldots+p%28x%5Ctext%7B+satisfies+%7D+O_k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>so <img alt="p(x) \propto \exp(\log \sum \mathbb{P}(x\text{ satisfies } O_i))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29+%5Cpropto+%5Cexp%28%5Clog+%5Csum+%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28x%5Ctext%7B+satisfies+%7D+O_i%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Note that the RHS is easy to calculate, but in practice the normalizing factor (also known as the partition function) can be difficult to calculate and often represents a large barrier, in the sense that computing the partition function makes many of these questions far easier.</p>



<h3>Proof of the Variational Principle</h3>



<p>Now, we prove the variational principle, which states that if <img alt="p(x) = \exp(\tau^{-1} \cdot W(x) - A_\tau(W))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+W%28x%29+-+A_%5Ctau%28W%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="A_\tau(W) = \log \int \exp(\tau^{-1} \cdot W(x))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%5Ctau%28W%29+%3D+%5Clog+%5Cint+%5Cexp%28%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+W%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the normalizing factor, then</p>



<p><img alt="p = \arg\max_{q} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim q} W(x) + \tau \cdot H(q)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+%5Carg%5Cmax_%7Bq%7D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bx+%5Csim+q%7D+W%28x%29+%2B+%5Ctau+%5Ccdot+H%28q%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Before proving the variational principle, we make the following claim: if <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is defined as <img alt="p(x) = \exp(\tau^{-1} \cdot W(x) - A_\tau(W))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+W%28x%29+-+A_%5Ctau%28W%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/yACUUCV.png"/></figure>



<p><strong>Proof of claim:</strong><br/>Write<br/><img alt="H(p) = -\int \log p(x) p(x) dx = -\int (\tau^{-1} \cdot W(x) - A_{\tau}(W)) p(x) dx" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28p%29+%3D+-%5Cint+%5Clog+p%28x%29+p%28x%29+dx+%3D+-%5Cint+%28%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+W%28x%29+-+A_%7B%5Ctau%7D%28W%29%29+p%28x%29+dx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/>(where we plugged in the definition of <img alt="p(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in <img alt="\log p(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+p%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>).</p>



<p>We can now rewrite this as</p>



<p><img alt="H(p) = -\tau^{-1} \cdot \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} W(x) + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} A_{\tau}(W)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28p%29+%3D+-%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bx+%5Csim+p%7D+W%28x%29+%2B+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bx+%5Csim+p%7D+A_%7B%5Ctau%7D%28W%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>which means that</p>



<p><img alt="H(p) = -\tau^{-1} \cdot \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} W(x) + A{\tau}(W)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28p%29+%3D+-%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bx+%5Csim+p%7D+W%28x%29+%2B+A%7B%5Ctau%7D%28W%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>using the fact that <img alt="A_\tau(W)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%5Ctau%28W%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a constant (independent of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>). Multiplying by <img alt="\tau" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and rearranging, we obtain the claim. <img alt="\blacksquare" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cblacksquare&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p><strong>Proof of variational principle:</strong><br/>Given the claim, we can now prove the variational principle.<br/>Let <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be any distribution. We write</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/KVij2G2.png"/></figure>



<p>where the first equation uses our likelihood expression. This implies that <img alt="\mathbb{E}_{x \sim q} W(x) + \tau \cdot H(q)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bx+%5Csim+q%7D+W%28x%29+%2B+%5Ctau+%5Ccdot+H%28q%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is maximized at <img alt="q = p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3D+p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, as desired. <img alt="\blacksquare" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cblacksquare&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p><strong>Remarks:</strong></p>



<ul><li>When <img alt="\tau = 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau+%3D+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we have <img alt="A(W) = \max_{q} H(q) + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim q} W(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28W%29+%3D+%5Cmax_%7Bq%7D+H%28q%29+%2B+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bx+%5Csim+q%7D+W%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</li><li>In particular, for every value of <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we have that<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/F0NNlGQ.png"/></li></ul>



<p>which <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/02/24/unsupervised-learning-and-generative-models/">we’ve seen before</a>! Note that equality holds when <img alt="q = p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3D+p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, but to approximate <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> we can simply take more tractable values of <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>In many situations, we can compute <img alt="W(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, but can’t compute <img alt="A_{\tau}(W)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7B%5Ctau%7D%28W%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which stifles many applications. One upshot of this, though, is that we can calculate ratios of <img alt="p(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="p(x')" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%27%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which is good enough for some applications, like Markov Chain Monte Carlo.</p>



<h3>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</h3>



<p>An important task in statistics is to sample from a distribution <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, for very complicated values of <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. MCMC does this by constructing a Markov Chain whose stationary distribution is <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The most common instantiation of MCMC is Metropolis-Hastings, which we now describe. First, we assume that there exists an undirected graph on the states <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so that <img alt="x \sim x'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Csim+x%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> iff <img alt="x' \sim x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27+%5Csim+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and that for <img alt="x \sim x'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Csim+x%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the probabilities of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="x'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are similar in the sense that <img alt="W(x)/W(x')" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29%2FW%28x%27%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is neither too small nor too large. Then the Metropolis-Hastings algortihm is as follows.</p>



<p><strong>Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm</strong>:</p>



<ol><li>Draw <img alt="x_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at random.</li><li>For <img alt="i = 1, 2, \ldots" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+1%2C+2%2C+%5Cldots&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, choose an arbitrary <img alt="x' \sim x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27+%5Csim+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and let</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/HQBwr77.png"/></figure>



<p>Then, <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> eventually is distributed as <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>! To show that this samples from <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we show that the stationary distribution is of this Markov chain is <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In this case, this turns out to be easy, since we can check the <em>detailed balance conditions</em> <img alt="p(x' | x)p(x) = \min{(p(x), p(x'))} = p(x | x')p(x')" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%27+%7C+x%29p%28x%29+%3D+%5Cmin%7B%28p%28x%29%2C+p%28x%27%29%29%7D+%3D+p%28x+%7C+x%27%29p%28x%27%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> so <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the stationary distribution of the Markov Chain.</p>



<p>The stationary distribution is often unique, so we’ve proven that this samples from <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> eventually. In MCMC algorithms, however, often an important question is how fast we converge to the stationary distribution. Often this is rather slow, which is especially dissappointing because if it were faster many very difficult problems could be solved much more easily, like generic optimization.<br/>Indeed, there are examples where convergence to the stationary distribution would take exponential time.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> One way to make MCMC faster is to let <img alt="x'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be really close from <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, because the likelihood ratio will be closer to <img alt="1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> will spend less time stuck at its original location. There’s a tradeoff, however. If <img alt="x'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is too close to <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then the chain will not <em>mix</em> as quickly, where mixing is the convergence of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to the stationary distribution, because generally to mix the value <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> must get close to every point, and making each of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>‘s steps smaller will make that more difficult.</p>



<h3>Applications of MCMC: Simulated Annealing</h3>



<p>One application of MCMC is in simulated annealing. Suppose that we have <img alt="W: {0, 1}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%3A+%7B0%2C+1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and we want to find <img alt="x = \arg \max_{x} W(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmax_%7Bx%7D+W%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The most direct attempt at solving this problem is creating a Markov Chain that simply samples from <img alt="x \in \arg\max_{x} W(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%5Carg%5Cmax_%7Bx%7D+W%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. However, this is impractical, at least directly. It is like we have a domino that is far away from us, and we can’t knock it down. What do we do in this case? We put some dominoes in between us!</p>



<p>To this end, we now create a sequence of Markov chains supported on <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, whose stationary distribution <img alt="p_{\tau}(x) \sim W(x)^{1/\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7B%5Ctau%7D%28x%29+%5Csim+W%28x%29%5E%7B1%2F%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, as <img alt="\tau" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> gets smaller and smaller. This corresponds to cooling a system from a high-temperature to a low-temperature. Essentially, we want to sample from <img alt="p_0(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_0%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>Simulated annealing lets us begin by sampling from <img alt="p_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which is uniform on the support. Then we can slowly reduce <img alt="\tau" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from <img alt="\infty" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. When cooling a system, it will be helpful to think of two stages. First, a stage in which the object cools down. Second, a settling stage in which the system settles into a more stable state. The settling stage is simulated via MCMC on <img alt="p_{\tau}(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7B%5Ctau%7D%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so the transition probability from <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="x'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="\min(1, \text{exp}(\tau^{-1} \cdot (W(x') - W(x))))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin%281%2C+%5Ctext%7Bexp%7D%28%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+%28W%28x%27%29+-+W%28x%29%29%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>

<ol><li><em>Cooling</em> Begin <img alt="\tau" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at <img alt="\infty" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (or very large), and lower the value of <img alt="\tau" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to zero according to some schedule.<br/>1a. <em>Settling</em> Now, repeatedly move from <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="x'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with probability <img alt="\min(1, \text{exp}(\tau^{-1} \cdot (W(x') - W(x))))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin%281%2C+%5Ctext%7Bexp%7D%28%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Ccdot+%28W%28x%27%29+-+W%28x%29%29%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</li></ol>



<p>Since simulated annealing is inspired by physical intuition, it turns out that its shortcomings can be interpreted physically too. Namely, when you cool something too quickly it becomes a glassy state instead of a ground state, which often causes simulated annealing to fail, and for this algorithm to get stuck in local minima. Note how this is fundamentally a failure mode with MCMC – it can’t mix quickly enough.</p>

<p><img alt="p(\vec{w} | x_1, \ldots x_n) = \frac{p(\vec{w})}{p(\vec{x})} \cdot p(x_1 | \vec{w}) p(x_2 | \vec{w}) \ldots p(x_n | \vec{w}) \propto \exp\left(\sum X_i(\vec{w})\right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28%5Cvec%7Bw%7D+%7C+x_1%2C+%5Cldots+x_n%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bp%28%5Cvec%7Bw%7D%29%7D%7Bp%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29%7D+%5Ccdot+p%28x_1+%7C+%5Cvec%7Bw%7D%29+p%28x_2+%7C+%5Cvec%7Bw%7D%29+%5Cldots+p%28x_n+%7C+%5Cvec%7Bw%7D%29+%5Cpropto+%5Cexp%5Cleft%28%5Csum+X_i%28%5Cvec%7Bw%7D%29%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>We now have <img alt="p_{W}(x) = \exp(W(x) - A(W))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7BW%7D%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28W%28x%29+-+A%28W%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, an exponential distribution. Now suppose that <img alt="W(x) = \langle w, \hat{x} \rangle" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29+%3D+%5Clangle+w%2C+%5Chat%7Bx%7D+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="\hat{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Bx%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are the sufficient statistics of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. For example, the energy function could follow that of a tree, so <img alt="W(x) = \sum_{(i, j) \in T} w_{i, j} x_i x_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7B%28i%2C+j%29+%5Cin+T%7D+w_%7Bi%2C+j%7D+x_i+x_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If you want to find the expected value of $latex \mathbb{E}<em>{x \sim p</em>{W}}[W(x)]&amp;bg=ffffff$ its enough to know $latex \mu = \mathbb{E}<em>{x \sim p</em>{W} }[\hat{x}]&amp;bg=ffffff$. (By following a tree, we mean that the undirected graphical model of the distribution is that of a tree.)</p>



<h3>Sampling from a Tree-Structured Distribution</h3>



<p>Now how do we sample from a tree-structured distribution? The most direct way is by calculating the marginals. While marginalization is generally quite difficult, it is much more tractable on certain types of graphs. For a sense of what this entails, suppose that we have the following tree-structured statistical model:</p>



<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/mnC1vkM.png"/>,<br/>whose joint PDF is <img alt="W(x) = \exp(\sum_{i, j \in E} -w_{i, j} (x_i - x_j)^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28%5Csum_%7Bi%2C+j+%5Cin+E%7D+-w_%7Bi%2C+j%7D+%28x_i+-+x_j%29%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="x \in {0, 1}^{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%7B0%2C+1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.<br/>(The unusual notation is chosen so that the relationships between the marginals is clean. The log-density in question is a Laplacian Quadratic Form.)</p>



<p>Then one can show that if the marginal of <img alt="x_3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="\mu_3 = \mathbb{P}(x_3 = 1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu_3+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28x_3+%3D+1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then we have that</p>



<p><img alt="\mu_6 = \mu_3 \cdot \frac{e^{w_{3,6}}}{1 + e^{w_{3, 6}}} + (1 - \mu_3) \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e^{w_{3, 6}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu_6+%3D+%5Cmu_3+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7Be%5E%7Bw_%7B3%2C6%7D%7D%7D%7B1+%2B+e%5E%7Bw_%7B3%2C+6%7D%7D%7D+%2B+%281+-+%5Cmu_3%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1+%2B+e%5E%7Bw_%7B3%2C+6%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>This will give six linear equations in six unknowns, which we can solve. Once we can marginalize a variable, say, <img alt="x_6" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we can then simply sample from the marginal, then sample from the conditional distribution on <img alt="x_6" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to sample from the entire distribution. This method is known as belief propogation.</p>



<p>This algorithm (with some modifications) also works for general graphs, but what it represents on general graphs is not the exact marginal, but rather an extension of that graph to a tree.</p>



<h3>General Exponential Distributions</h3>



<p>Now let’s try to develop more theory for exponential distributions. Let the PDF of this distribution be <img alt="p_W(x) = \exp(\langle w, \hat{x} \rangle - A(w))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_W%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28%5Clangle+w%2C+%5Chat%7Bx%7D+%5Crangle+-+A%28w%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. A few useful facts about these distributions that often appear in calculations: <img alt="\nabla A(w) = \mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+A%28w%29+%3D+%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and $latex \nabla^2 (A(w)) = \text{Cov}<em>{p</em>{W}}(x) \succeq 0&amp;bg=ffffff$.</p>



<p>By the variational principle, we have that among all distributions with the same sufficient statistics as a given Boltzmann distribution, the true one maximizes the entropy, so</p>



<p><img alt="p_w = \arg\max_{\mathbb{E}_{q} \hat{x} = \mu} H(q)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_w+%3D+%5Carg%5Cmax_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bq%7D+%5Chat%7Bx%7D+%3D+%5Cmu%7D+H%28q%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>An analagous idea gives us<br/><img alt="\mu = \arg \max_{H(\mu) \ge H(p_{w})} \langle w, \mu \rangle," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmax_%7BH%28%5Cmu%29+%5Cge+H%28p_%7Bw%7D%29%7D+%5Clangle+w%2C+%5Cmu+%5Crangle%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>so <img alt="p_w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the <em>maximum entropy</em> distribution consistent with observations <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>The important consequence of these two facts is that in principle, <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> determines <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and vice versa. (Up to fine print of using <em>minimal</em> sufficient statistics, which we ignore here.) We will refer to <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as the “canonical parameter space” and <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as the “mean representation space”. Now note that the first equation gives us a way of going from <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and the second equation gives us a way to go from <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, at least information-theoretically.</p>



<p>Now, how do we do this algorithmically? Using <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, if were able to sample from <img alt="p_w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (which is generally possible if we can evaluate <img alt="A(w)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28w%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then we can estimate the mean <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> through samples. We can also obtain <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from <img alt="A(w)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28w%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by estimating <img alt="\nabla A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/qFKGiMa.png"/></figure>



<p>On the other hand, if you have <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, to obtain <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> you first consider <img alt="A^{\ast}(\mu) = \sup_{w \in \Omega} {\langle \mu, w \rangle - A(w)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5E%7B%5Cast%7D%28%5Cmu%29+%3D+%5Csup_%7Bw+%5Cin+%5COmega%7D+%7B%5Clangle+%5Cmu%2C+w+%5Crangle+-+A%28w%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and then note that the desired value is <img alt="\arg\max_{w \in \Omega}{\langle \mu, w \rangle - A(w)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carg%5Cmax_%7Bw+%5Cin+%5COmega%7D%7B%5Clangle+%5Cmu%2C+w+%5Crangle+-+A%28w%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so solving this problem boils down to estimating <img alt="\nabla A^{\ast}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+A%5E%7B%5Cast%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> efficiently, because setting it to zero will give us <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>Thus going from <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> requires estimating <img alt="\nabla A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, whereas going from <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> requires estimating <img alt="\nabla A^{\ast}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+A%5E%7B%5Cast%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>When <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a <em>posterior distribution</em>, the observed data typically gives us the weights <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and hence the inference problem becomes to use that to sample from the posterior.</p>



<h4>Examples of Exponential Distributions</h4>



<p>There are many examples of exponential distributions, which we now give.</p>



<ul><li>High-Dimensional Normals: <img alt="x\in \mathbb{R}^{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="W(x) = -(x - \mu)^{\top} \Sigma^{-1} (x-\mu)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29+%3D+-%28x+-+%5Cmu%29%5E%7B%5Ctop%7D+%5CSigma%5E%7B-1%7D+%28x-%5Cmu%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></li><li>Ising Model: <img alt="x\in {0, 1}^{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin+%7B0%2C+1%7D%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="W(x) = \sum w_i x_I + \sum_{i, j \in E} w_{i, j} x_i x_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28x%29+%3D+%5Csum+w_i+x_I+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bi%2C+j+%5Cin+E%7D+w_%7Bi%2C+j%7D+x_i+x_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. A sufficient statistic for these is <img alt="\hat{x} = (x, xx^{\top})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Bx%7D+%3D+%28x%2C+xx%5E%7B%5Ctop%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, a fact which we will invoke repeatedly.</li><li>There’s many many more, including Gaussian Markov Random Fields, Latend Dirchlet Allocation, and Mixtures of Gaussians.</li></ul>



<h4>Going from canonical parameters to mean parameters</h4>



<p>Now, we show how to go from <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in a special case, namely in the mean-field approximation. The mean field approximation is the approximation of distributions by product distributions over <img alt="x_1, \ldots, x_d \in {0, 1}^{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_d+%5Cin+%7B0%2C+1%7D%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, for which</p>



<p><img alt="\mathbb{P}(x_1, \ldots x_n) = \mathbb{P}(x_1)\mathbb{P}(x_2) \ldots \mathbb{P}(x_n)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28x_1%2C+%5Cldots+x_n%29+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28x_1%29%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28x_2%29+%5Cldots+%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28x_n%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Recall that the partition function can be computed as</p>



<p><img alt="A(w) = \max_{q \in \mathcal{Q}} \langle w, \mathbb{E}_{q} \hat{x} \rangle + H(q)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28w%29+%3D+%5Cmax_%7Bq+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D%7D+%5Clangle+w%2C+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bq%7D+%5Chat%7Bx%7D+%5Crangle+%2B+H%28q%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>where <img alt="\mathcal{Q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the set of all probability distributions. If we instead write <img alt="\mathcal{Q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as the set of product distributions (parametrized by <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, or the probability that each variable is <img alt="1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), we get</p>



<p><img alt="A(w) \ge \max_{\mu \in \mathcal{Q}} \sum w_i \mu_i + \sum w_{i,j} \mu_i \mu_j + \sum H(\mu_i)," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28w%29+%5Cge+%5Cmax_%7B%5Cmu+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D%7D+%5Csum+w_i+%5Cmu_i+%2B+%5Csum+w_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%5Cmu_i+%5Cmu_j+%2B+%5Csum+H%28%5Cmu_i%29%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>where <img alt="H(\mu_i) = -\mu_i \log \mu_i - (1 - \mu_i) \log{1 - \mu_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28%5Cmu_i%29+%3D+-%5Cmu_i+%5Clog+%5Cmu_i+-+%281+-+%5Cmu_i%29+%5Clog%7B1+-+%5Cmu_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and it now suffices to maximize the right hand function over the set <img alt="K = { \mu\in [0,1]^d | \sum \mu_i = 1 }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K+%3D+%7B+%5Cmu%5Cin+%5B0%2C1%5D%5Ed+%7C+%5Csum+%5Cmu_i+%3D+1+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>We can generally maximize concave functions over a convex set such as <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Unfortunately, this function is not concave. However, it is concave in every coordinate. This suggests the following algorithm: fix all but one variable and maximize over that variable, and repeat. This approach is known as Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI), and its pseudocode is given below.</p>



<p><strong>CAVI Algorithm</strong></p>



<ol><li>Let <img alt="\mu = 1/2 \cdot (1, 1, \ldots 1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu+%3D+1%2F2+%5Ccdot+%281%2C+1%2C+%5Cldots+1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></li><li>Repatedly choose values of <img alt="j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in <img alt="[n]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bn%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (possibly at random, or in a loop.)<br/>2a.

<h2>Part 3. Solution landscapes and the replica method</h2>



<p>This part is best explained visually. Suppose that we have a Boltzman distribution. In the infinite temperature limit the this is the uniform distribution, distributed over the entire domain. As you decrease the temperature, the support’s size decreases. (<em>Note:</em> The gifs below are just cartoons. These pretend as if the probability distribution is always uniform over a subset. Also, in most cases of interest for learning, only higher order derivatives of entropy will be discontinuous.)<br/></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/rPb67cG.gif"/></figure>



<p>Sometimes there’s a discontinuity in entropy, and the entropy “suddenly drops” in a discontinuity. Often the entropy function itself is continuous, but the derivatives are not continuous at that point – a higher order phase transition.</p>



<p>Sometimes the geometry of the solution space undergoes a phase transition as well, with it “shattering” to several distinct clusters.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/itUWxrB.gif"/></figure>



<h3>The replica method</h3>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> We will have an extended post on the replica method later on.</p>



<p>If you sampled <img alt="x_1, \ldots x_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cldots+x_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from <img alt="p_{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="p_w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a high-dimensional distribution, you’d expect the distances to all be approximately the same. The overlap matrix, or </p>



<p><img alt="\begin{bmatrix} \langle x_1, x_1 \rangle &amp; \cdots &amp; \langle x_1, x_n \rangle \ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \ \langle x_n, x_1 \rangle &amp; \cdots &amp; \langle x_n, x_n \rangle \end{bmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+%5Clangle+x_1%2C+x_1+%5Crangle+%26+%5Ccdots+%26+%5Clangle+x_1%2C+x_n+%5Crangle+%5C+%5Cvdots+%26+%5Cddots+%26+%5Cvdots+%5C+%5Clangle+x_n%2C+x_1+%5Crangle+%26+%5Ccdots+%26+%5Clangle+x_n%2C+x_n+%5Crangle+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> </p>



<p>we approximate as </p>



<p><img alt="\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; q \ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \ q&amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+%5Ccdots+%26+q+%5C+%5Cvdots+%26+%5Cddots+%26+%5Cvdots+%5C+q%26+%5Ccdots+%26+1+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> </p>



<p>where <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is some constant.</p>



<p>Suppose <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> comes from a probability distribution <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then a very common problem is computing</p>



<p><img alt="\mathbb{E}_{w}[A(w)] = \mathbb{E}_{w}\left[ \log \int \exp(\langle w, \hat{x} \rangle)\right]," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bw%7D%5BA%28w%29%5D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bw%7D%5Cleft%5B+%5Clog+%5Cint+%5Cexp%28%5Clangle+w%2C+%5Chat%7Bx%7D+%5Crangle%29%5Cright%5D%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>which is the expected free energy. However, it turns out to be much easier to find <img alt="\log (\int E_{w} \exp(\langle w, \hat{x} \rangle))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+%28%5Cint+E_%7Bw%7D+%5Cexp%28%5Clangle+w%2C+%5Chat%7Bx%7D+%5Crangle%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. So here’s what we do. We find</p>



<p><img alt="\mathbb{E}_{w} [A(w)] = \lim{n \rightarrow 0} \frac{\mathbb{E}_{w} [\text{exp}(n \cdot A(w))] - 1}{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bw%7D+%5BA%28w%29%5D+%3D+%5Clim%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+0%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bw%7D+%5B%5Ctext%7Bexp%7D%28n+%5Ccdot+A%28w%29%29%5D+-+1%7D%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>This should already smell weird, because <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is going to zero, an unusal notational choice. We can now write this as<br/><img alt="\mathbb{E}{w} A(w) = \lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \frac{\mathbb{E}_{w}\left( \int{x} \exp(\langle w, \hat{x} \rangle)\right)^{n} - 1}{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%7Bw%7D+A%28w%29+%3D+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+0%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bw%7D%5Cleft%28+%5Cint%7Bx%7D+%5Cexp%28%5Clangle+w%2C+%5Chat%7Bx%7D+%5Crangle%29%5Cright%29%5E%7Bn%7D+-+1%7D%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>which we can write as</p>



<p><img alt="\lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \frac{\int_{x_1, \ldots x_n} \mathbb{E}_{w} \exp(\langle w, \hat{x}_1 + \cdots + \hat{x}_n \rangle) - 1}{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+0%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cint_%7Bx_1%2C+%5Cldots+x_n%7D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bw%7D+%5Cexp%28%5Clangle+w%2C+%5Chat%7Bx%7D_1+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+%5Chat%7Bx%7D_n+%5Crangle%29+-+1%7D%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Now these <img alt="x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>‘s represent the replicas! Now, we’d hope <img alt="\psi(n) = \int_{x_1, \ldots x_n} \mathbb{E}_w \exp(\langle w, \hat{x}_1 + \hat{x}_2 + \ldots + \hat{x}_n \rangle)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28n%29+%3D+%5Cint_%7Bx_1%2C+%5Cldots+x_n%7D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_w+%5Cexp%28%5Clangle+w%2C+%5Chat%7Bx%7D_1+%2B+%5Chat%7Bx%7D_2+%2B+%5Cldots+%2B+%5Chat%7Bx%7D_n+%5Crangle%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an analytic function, and we can now write this as <img alt="\frac{\psi(n) - 1}{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpsi%28n%29+-+1%7D%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> goes to zero.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, <img alt="\mathbb{E}_{w} [\exp(w, \hat{x}_1 + \cdots + \hat{x}_n)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bw%7D+%5B%5Cexp%28w%2C+%5Chat%7Bx%7D_1+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+%5Chat%7Bx%7D_n%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> only depends on overlaps of <img alt="Q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so we often guess the value of <img alt="Q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and calculate this expectation.</p>



<h4>Examples:</h4>



<p>We’ll now give an example of how this is useful. Consider a spiked matrix/tensor model, where we observe <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> so that <img alt="Y = \lambda S + N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y+%3D+%5Clambda+S+%2B+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the signal and <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the noise. Thus here we have</p>



<p><img alt="p(S', N' | Y) \propto \exp(\beta \langle Y - \lambda S', N' \rangle^2) \cdot p(S')," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28S%27%2C+N%27+%7C+Y%29+%5Cpropto+%5Cexp%28%5Cbeta+%5Clangle+Y+-+%5Clambda+S%27%2C+N%27+%5Crangle%5E2%29+%5Ccdot+p%28S%27%29%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>and we want to analyze <img alt="\mathbb{E}_{S' \sim p(\cdot | Y)} \langle S, S' \rangle^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7BS%27+%5Csim+p%28%5Ccdot+%7C+Y%29%7D+%5Clangle+S%2C+S%27+%5Crangle%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as a function of <img alt="\lambda" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which can be done by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07728.pdf">replica method</a> and exhibits a phase transition.<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ec3tC8C.png"/></p>



<p>Other examples include Teacher-student models, where <img alt="X, Y = (X, f_S(X) + N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2C+Y+%3D+%28X%2C+f_S%28X%29+%2B+N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08127">a recent work</a> calculates the training losses and classification errors when training on this dataset, which closely match empirical values.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/x9bdDv7.png"/></figure>



<h3>Symmetry breaking</h3>



<p>Lastly, we’ll talk about replica symmetry breaking. Sometimes, discontinuities don’t just make the support smaller, but actually break the support into many different parts. For example, at this transition the circle becomes the three green circles.<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ufck69X.png"/></p>



<p>When this happens, we can no longer make our overlap matrix assumption, as there are now asymmetries between the points. This leads to the overlap matrix being striped, in the fashion one would anticipate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/0Zua7m9.png"/></figure>



<p>Sometimes, the support actually breaks into infinitely many parts, in a phenomenon called full replica symmetry breakng.</p>



<p>Finally, some historical notes. This “plugging in zero” trick was introduced by Parisi approximately 30 years ago, receiving a standing ovation at the ICM. Since then, some of those conjectures have been rigorously formalized, but many haven’t. It is still very impressive that Parisi was able to do it.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Today I received an interesting email from our compliance office that is working on the accreditation of our PhD program in Statistics and Computer Science.</p>



<p>One of the requisites for accreditation is to have a certain number of affiliated faculty. To count as an affiliated faculty, however, one must pass certain minimal thresholds of research productivity, the same that are necessary to be promoted to Associate Professor, as quantified according to Italy’s well intentioned but questionably run initiative to conduct research evaluations using quantifiable parameters.</p>



<p>(For context, every Italian professor maintains a list of publications in a site run by the ministry. Although the site is linked to various bibliographic databases, one has to input each publication manually into a local site at one’s own university, then the ministry site fetches the data from the local site. The data in the ministry site is used for these research evaluations. At one point, a secretary and I spent long hours entering my publications from the past ten years, to apply for an Italian grant.)</p>



<p>Be that as it may, the compliance office noted that I did not qualify to be an affiliated faculty (or, for that matter, an Associate Professor) based on my 2016-2020 publication record. That would be seven papers in SoDA and two in FOCS: surely Italian Associate Professors are held to high standards! It turns out, however, that one of the criteria counts only journal publications.</p>



<p> Well, how about the paper in J. ACM and the two papers in SIAM J. on Computing published between 2016 and 2020? That would (barely) be enough, but one SICOMP paper has the same title of a SoDA paper (being, in fact, the same paper) and so the ministry site had rejected it. Luckily, the Bocconi administration was able to remove the SoDA paper from the ministry site, I added again the SICOMP version, and now I finally, if barely, qualify to be an Associate Professor and a PhD program affiliated faculty.</p>



<p>This sounds like the beginning of a long and unproductive relationship between me and the Italian system of research evaluation.</p>



<p>P.S. some colleagues at other Italian universities to whom I told this story argued that the Bocconi administration did not correctly apply the government rules, and that one should count conference proceedings indexed by Scopus; other colleagues said that indeed<a href="https://abilitazione.miur.it/public/documenti/2018/DM_Valori_Soglia_589_08082018.pdf"> the government decree n. 589 of August 8, 2018,</a> in article 2, comma 1, part a, only refers to journals. This of course only reinforces my impression that the whole set of evaluation criteria is a dumpster fire that is way too far gone.</p></div>

<p>In this blog post, we will focus on the topic of robustness – how well (or not so well) do machine learning algorithms perform when either their training or testing/deployment data differs from our expectations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/jmDvjav.png"/></figure>



<p>We will cover the following areas:</p>

<h3>KL refresher</h3>



<p>The KL-divergence between the probability distributions is the expectation of the log of probability ratios:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/aWTh2Lc.png"/></figure>



<p>KL-divergence is always non-negative and can be decomposed as the difference between negative entropy and cross-entropy. The non-negativity property thereby implies that <img alt="\forall" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cforall&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> distributions <img alt="p,q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2Cq&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="H(p,q) \geq H(p)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28p%2Cq%29+%5Cgeq+H%28p%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<h3>Introduction to concentration</h3>



<p>Consider a Gaussian random variable <img alt="X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Csim+N%28%5Cmu%2C+%5Csigma%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Concentration is the phenomenon that if you have i.i.d random variables <img alt="X_1,X_2, \ldots,X_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1%2CX_2%2C+%5Cldots%2CX_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with expectation <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then the empirical average <img alt="\frac{\sum_i X_i}{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_i+X_i%7D%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is distributed approximately like <img alt="N(\mu, \frac{1}{n})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}N(\mu,1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%28%5Cmu%2C+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7DN%28%5Cmu%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/>Therefore the standard deviation of the empricial average is smaller than the standard deviation of each of the <img alt="Y_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>‘s. The central limit theorem ensure this asymptotically w.r.t <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, while non-asymptotic versions of this phenomenon can be seen via popular inequalities such as the Chernoff/Hoeffding/Bernstein styled inequalities. These roughly have the form <img alt="P[|\sum_i X_i - \mu.n| \geq \epsilon n] \approx \exp(-\epsilon^2 n) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%5B%7C%5Csum_i+X_i+-+%5Cmu.n%7C+%5Cgeq+%5Cepsilon+n%5D+%5Capprox+%5Cexp%28-%5Cepsilon%5E2+n%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<h3>Matrix notations</h3>



<h4>Norms</h4>

<p>If the random variables were vectors instead, we can easily generalize this to <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples of <img alt="Y_i \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_i+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

<h4>Matrix Bernstein inequality:</h4>

The norm under consideration is the spectral norm. Note that the difference in the inequality w.r.t the scalar case is the additional multiplicative factor of d or an additive factor of <img alt="\log(d)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28d%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the exponent as in the equations above. Please refer to Tropp, 2015 Chapter 6 for formally precise statements.</p>



<p>Another property that follow is the the expected norm of the difference follows<br/><img alt="\mathbb{E}\left|\sum Y_{i}-\mu\right| \leq O(\sqrt{n \log d})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%7C%5Csum+Y_%7Bi%7D-%5Cmu%5Cright%7C+%5Cleq+O%28%5Csqrt%7Bn+%5Clog+d%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>There are some long-standing conjectures and results on cases when one can get rid of this additional factor of <img alt="\log(d)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28d%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>

We then take a step based on this distribution and observe the incurred loss.</li><li>Then the distribution is updated as <img alt="p_{t+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bt%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by letting <img alt="p_{t+1}(i) \propto p_{t}(i) \exp \left(-\eta L_{i, t}\right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bt%2B1%7D%28i%29+%5Cpropto+p_%7Bt%7D%28i%29+%5Cexp+%5Cleft%28-%5Ceta+L_%7Bi%2C+t%7D%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. i.e, if an action gave a bad outcome in terms of loss, we downweight it’s probability for the next draw of action to be taken. <img alt="\eta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the penalty terms that governs the aggresiveness of the downweighting.</li></ul>



<p>The <em>hope</em> is that this approach converges to a “good aggregation or strategy”. We measure the quality of the strategy using <strong>regret</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/wkWExIB.png"/></figure>



<p>The difference between the cost we incur and the optimal action (or probability distribution over actions) in hindsight is known as the (average) <em>regret</em>.</p>



<p>Note that we compare the loss we incur with the best loss over a <em>fixed</em> (i.e., nonadaptive) probability distribution over the set of possible actions. It can be shown that the best such loss can always be achieved by a distribution that puts all the weight on a single action.</p>



<p>The following theorem bounds the regret.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/waOIq4F.png"/></figure>



<p>The ‘prior ignorance’ term captures how good the initialization is. The ‘sensitivity per step’ term captures how aggressive the exploration is (i.e this term governs the potential difference between loss incurred at <img alt="p_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> versus <img alt="p_{t-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bt-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>). As <img alt="\eta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> also occurs in the denominator of the prior ignorance term, it needs to be carefully chosen to balance the two terms properly.</p>



<p>The first inequality of this theorem is always true for any <img alt="p\ast, p_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5Cast%2C+p_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> whether <img alt="p\ast" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5Cast&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is optimal strategy or not. The second (right-most) inequality is true when optimal <img alt="p\ast" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5Cast&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the delta function (which it will be in optimal strategy), <img alt="p_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is initialized to uniform distribution, and <img alt="\eta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is set to be <img alt="\sqrt{\frac{\log(n)}{t}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog%28n%29%7D%7Bt%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Note that in this case, the divergence <img alt="\Delta_{KL}(p\ast | p_0) = \log n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta_%7BKL%7D%28p%5Cast+%7C+p_0%29+%3D+%5Clog+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>To state the ‘overall approach’, more precisely, there needs to be a normalization <img alt="Z_{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at every step as below<br/><img alt="p_{t+1}(i)=p_{t}(i) \exp \left(-\eta L_{i, t}\right) / Z_{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bt%2B1%7D%28i%29%3Dp_%7Bt%7D%28i%29+%5Cexp+%5Cleft%28-%5Ceta+L_%7Bi%2C+t%7D%5Cright%29+%2F+Z_%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/>The above can be rearranged as follows upon taking log<br/><img alt="L_{t, i}=\frac{1}{\eta} \log \frac{p_{t}(i)}{p_{t+1}(i) \cdot Z_{i}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_%7Bt%2C+i%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ceta%7D+%5Clog+%5Cfrac%7Bp_%7Bt%7D%28i%29%7D%7Bp_%7Bt%2B1%7D%28i%29+%5Ccdot+Z_%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>By substituting this in below</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/jtzs3cB.png"/></figure>



<p>we get the following expanded version of what the regret amounts to be:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/sGwn0Xq.png"/></figure>



<p>The last equation above is due to the telescoping sum where adjacent terms cancel out except the first and last terms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/kU2Mmfr.png"/></figure>



<p>The last inequality here is because the cross-entropy is always at least as large as the entropy.</p>



<p>So now we have this so far</p>



<p>PF: Regret <img alt="\leq \frac{\Delta_{K L}\left(p^{\ast} | p_{0}\right)}{\eta \cdot T}+\frac{1}{\eta \cdot T} \sum_{t} \Delta_{K L}\left(p_{t}, p_{t+1}\right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleq+%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta_%7BK+L%7D%5Cleft%28p%5E%7B%5Cast%7D+%7C+p_%7B0%7D%5Cright%29%7D%7B%5Ceta+%5Ccdot+T%7D%2B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ceta+%5Ccdot+T%7D+%5Csum_%7Bt%7D+%5CDelta_%7BK+L%7D%5Cleft%28p_%7Bt%7D%2C+p_%7Bt%2B1%7D%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Now there is this property that if <img alt="p, q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2C+q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> s.t. <img alt="p(i) \propto q(i) \rho_{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28i%29+%5Cpropto+q%28i%29+%5Crho_%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="\rho_{i} \in[1-\eta, 1+\eta]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7Bi%7D+%5Cin%5B1-%5Ceta%2C+1%2B%5Ceta%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then <img alt="\Delta_{K L}(p | q) \leq O\left(\eta^{2}\right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta_%7BK+L%7D%28p+%7C+q%29+%5Cleq+O%5Cleft%28%5Ceta%5E%7B2%7D%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/>Therefore upon substituting this, we prove the upper bound stated over the regret.</p>



<p>This subclaim that was used can be proved as follows</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/pgcdG5S.png"/></figure>



<h3>Generalization of multiplicative weights: Follow The Regularized Leader (FTRL)</h3>



<p>When the set K of actions is convex (set of probability distributions on discrete actions is convex),</p>



<p>At time <img alt="t+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, it makes a choice <img alt="x_{t+1} \in K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%5Cin+K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and learns cost function <img alt="L_{t+1}: K \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_%7Bt%2B1%7D%3A+K+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (so the setup is again like the experts model unlike the bandit model).</p>



<p>Now the new action in FTRL is based on the following optimization which is a regularized (with <img alt="R(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) loss:<br/>FTRL: <img alt="x_{t+1}=\arg \min_{x \in R}\left(R(x)+\sum_{i=1}^{t} L_{i}(x)\right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D%3D%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bx+%5Cin+R%7D%5Cleft%28R%28x%29%2B%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bt%7D+L_%7Bi%7D%28x%29%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>In this case, the regret bound is given by the following theorem.<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/lglCvZh.png"/></p>



<p><img alt="x^\ast" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E%5Cast&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> refers to the optimal choice. This indeed has a similar flavor to the theorem we saw for multiplicative weights. To be precise when<br/><img alt="K={\text { set of all distributions on action space }[n]}, \text {and} \; R(x)=-\frac{1}{\eta} H(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%3D%7B%5Ctext+%7B+set+of+all+distributions+on+action+space+%7D%5Bn%5D%7D%2C+%5Ctext+%7Band%7D+%5C%3B+R%28x%29%3D-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ceta%7D+H%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> we have that the multiplicate weights becomes FTRL. Similarly there is a view that connects multiplicative weights to mirror descent. (Nisheeth Vishnoi has <a href="https://nisheethvishnoi.wordpress.com/convex-optimization/">notes</a> on this.)</p>



<h2>Train-Time Robustness</h2>



<p>We now look at some robustness issues specific to the <em>training</em> phase in machine learning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/7DlRj3k.png"/></figure>



<p>For example, during training, there could be adversarially poisoned examples in the training dataset that damage the trained model’s performance.</p>



<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Suppose <img alt="1-\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples are generated from a genuine data distribution and <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples are maliciously chosen from an arbitrary distribution. i.e, in formal notation: <img alt="x_{1}, \ldots, x_{(1-\epsilon) n} \sim X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}, \;\; \text {and } x_{(1-\epsilon) n+1}, \ldots, x_{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7B%281-%5Cepsilon%29+n%7D+%5Csim+X+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bd%7D%2C+%5C%3B%5C%3B+%5Ctext+%7Band+%7D+x_%7B%281-%5Cepsilon%29+n%2B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are arbitrary. (While for convenience we assume here that the last <img alt="\epsilon n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> items are maliciously chosen, the learning algorithm does not get the data in order.)</p>



<p>Assume <img alt="\left|x_{i}\right|^{2} \approx 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7Cx_%7Bi%7D%5Cright%7C%5E%7B2%7D+%5Capprox+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="i&lt;(1-\epsilon) n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3C%281-%5Cepsilon%29+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Let us start with the task of estimating the mean under this setup.</p>



<p><strong>Mean estimation:</strong> Estimate <img alt="\mu = \mathbb{E}X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7DX&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p><strong>Noiseless case:</strong> In the noiseless case, the best estimate for the mean under many measures is the <em>empirical mean</em> <img alt="\hat{\mu}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i X_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Csum_i+X_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Standard concentration results show that for <img alt="d=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <img alt="|\hat{\mu}-\mu| \leq O(1 / \sqrt{n})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D-%5Cmu%7C+%5Cleq+O%281+%2F+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and for a general <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that <img alt="|\hat{\mu}-\mu| \leq O(\sqrt{d / n})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D-%5Cmu%7C+%5Cleq+O%28%5Csqrt%7Bd+%2F+n%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p><strong>Adversarial case:</strong> If there is even a single malicious sample (that can be arbitrarily large or small) then it is well known that the empirical mean can give an arbitrarily bad approximation of the true population mean. For <img alt="d=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> we can use the <em>empirical median</em> <img alt="\mu^{\ast}=\mathrm{sort}\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)_{n / 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu%5E%7B%5Cast%7D%3D%5Cmathrm%7Bsort%7D%5Cleft%28x_%7B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29_%7Bn+%2F+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This is guaranteed to lie in the <img alt="\left(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon, \frac{1}{2}+\epsilon\right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D-%5Cepsilon%2C+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%2B%5Cepsilon%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> quantile of real data. This is most optimal because of the property that <img alt="X \sim N(\mu, 1),\left|\mu-\mu^{\ast}\right| \leq O(\epsilon+1 / \sqrt{n})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Csim+N%28%5Cmu%2C+1%29%2C%5Cleft%7C%5Cmu-%5Cmu%5E%7B%5Cast%7D%5Cright%7C+%5Cleq+O%28%5Cepsilon%2B1+%2F+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>In a higher-dimension, this story instead goes as follows:</p>



<p><strong>Setup:</strong> <img alt="x_{1}, \ldots, x_{(1-\epsilon) n} \sim X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}, \quad x_{(1-\epsilon) n+1}, \ldots, x_{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7B%281-%5Cepsilon%29+n%7D+%5Csim+X+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bd%7D%2C+%5Cquad+x_%7B%281-%5Cepsilon%29+n%2B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> arbitrary.</p>



<p><strong>Median of coordinates (a starter solution):</strong> When <img alt="(d \geq 1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28d+%5Cgeq+1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we have <img alt="\mu_{i}^{\ast}=\mathrm{sort}\left(x_{1, i}, \ldots, x_{n, i}\right)_{n / 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu_%7Bi%7D%5E%7B%5Cast%7D%3D%5Cmathrm%7Bsort%7D%5Cleft%28x_%7B1%2C+i%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7Bn%2C+i%7D%5Cright%29_%7Bn+%2F+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> per coordinate as an initial naive solution.

<p><strong>The obvious next question is: Can we do better?</strong> i.e, can we avoid paying this dimension-dependent <img alt="\sqrt{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> price?</p>



<p>Yes we can! We can use the ‘Tukey Median’!.<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/pbKZ8U6.png"/></p>



<p><strong>What is a Tukey median?</strong></p>



<p>Informally via the picture below, if you have a Tukey median (red), no matter which direction you take from it and look at the half-space, it exactly partitions the data into about half the # of points.<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/NaGRWbB.png"/></p>



<p><strong>Formal definition of Tukey median</strong> is given as follows (fixing some parameters):</p>



<p>A Tukey median* of <img alt="x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7Bn%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a vector <img alt="\mu^{\ast} \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu%5E%7B%5Cast%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> s.t. for every nonzero <img alt="v \in \mathbb{R}^{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/bBy6GZE.png"/></figure>



<p>A Tukey median need not always exist for a given data. However, we will show that if the data is generated at random according to a nice distribution, and then at most <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> fraction of it is perturbed, a Tukey median will exist with high probability. In fact, the true population mean will be such a median.</p>



<p><strong>Existence of Tukey median</strong></p>



<p><strong>THM:</strong> If <img alt="x_{1}, \ldots, x_{(1-\epsilon) n} \sim N(\mu, I)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7B%281-%5Cepsilon%29+n%7D+%5Csim+N%28%5Cmu%2C+I%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="\sqrt{d / n} \ll \epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bd+%2F+n%7D+%5Cll+%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then</p>



<ol><li>Tukey median <img alt="\mu^{\ast}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu%5E%7B%5Cast%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> exists and</li><li>For <em>every</em> Tukey median <img alt="\mu^{\ast}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu%5E%7B%5Cast%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> , <img alt="\left|\mu-\mu^{\ast}\right| \leq O(\epsilon)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7C%5Cmu-%5Cmu%5E%7B%5Cast%7D%5Cright%7C+%5Cleq+O%28%5Cepsilon%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</li></ol>



<p>Together 1. and 2. mean that if we search over all vectors and output the first Tukey median that we find, then (a) this process will terminate and (b) its output will be a good approximation for the population mean. In particular, we do not have to pay the extra <img alt="\sqrt{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> cost needed in the median of coordinates!</p>



<p>** Proof of 1 (existence):**<br/>The mean itself is the Tukey median in this case because, <img alt="\forall v \neq 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cforall+v+%5Cneq+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, if we define <img alt="Y_{1}=\mathrm{sign}\left(\left\langle x_{1}-\mu, v\right\rangle\right), \ldots, Y_{k}=\mathrm{sign}\left(\left\langle x_{k}-\mu, v\right\rangle\right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_%7B1%7D%3D%5Cmathrm%7Bsign%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cleft%5Clangle+x_%7B1%7D-%5Cmu%2C+v%5Cright%5Crangle%5Cright%29%2C+%5Cldots%2C+Y_%7Bk%7D%3D%5Cmathrm%7Bsign%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cleft%5Clangle+x_%7Bk%7D-%5Cmu%2C+v%5Cright%5Crangle%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then these are i.i.d ±1 vars of mean zero, and thus:</p>

<p>Exactly computing the Tukey median is NP-hard, but efficient algorithms for robust mean estimation of normals and other distributions exist as referred to in <a href="https://jerryzli.github.io/robust-ml-fall19.html">Jerry Li’s lecture notes</a>. In particular, we can use the following approach using <em>spectral signatures</em> and <em>filtering</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Spectral Signatures</strong> can efficiently <em>certify</em> that a given vector is in fact a robust mean estimator.<br/>Let <img alt="x_{1}, \ldots, x_{(1-\epsilon) n} \sim N(\mu, I)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7B%281-%5Cepsilon%29+n%7D+%5Csim+N%28%5Cmu%2C+I%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="x_{(1-\epsilon) n+1}, \ldots, x_{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7B%281-%5Cepsilon%29+n%2B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> arbitrary<br/>Let <img alt="\hat{\mu}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+x_%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be the empirical mean and <img alt="\widehat{\Sigma}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i-1}^{n}\left(x_{i}-\hat{\mu}\right)\left(x_{i}-\hat{\mu}\right)^{\top}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidehat%7B%5CSigma%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi-1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%5Cleft%28x_%7Bi%7D-%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D%5Cright%29%5Cleft%28x_%7Bi%7D-%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B%5Ctop%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be the empirical co-variance.

<p>In other words, if the spectral norm of the empirical covariance matrix is small, then the empirical mean is a good estimator for the population mean.</p>

<p>The Proof for this claim is given below<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/1tl31kK.png"/></p>



<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Here, we assume the <img alt="\mu=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for simplicity without loss of generality. The norm can be split into additive terms on good points (green text above) and malicious points (red text above). The first term of this inequality follows from standard concentration. For the second (red) term, we can modify it by adding and subtracting <img alt="\hat{\mu}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We can then apply the Cauchy-Schwartz (cs) inequality to prove it. Upon rearranging the terms and dividing by the norm of <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we get the desired result.</p>



<p><strong>Filtering</strong> is an approach to turn the certificate into an algorithm to actually find the estimator. The idea is that the same claim holds for non-uniform reweighting of data points to estimate the empirical mean and covariance. Hence we can use a violation of the spectral norm condition (the existence of a large eigenvalue) to assign “blame” to some data points and down-weigh their contributions until we reach a probability distribution over points that on the one hand is spread on roughly <img alt="1-O(\epsilon)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-O%28%5Cepsilon%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> fraction of the points and on the other hand leads to a weighted empirical covariance matrix with small spectral norm. The above motivates the following robust mean estimation algorithm in the online case as below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/XtpiBrm.png"/></figure>



<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> We first compute the mean and covariance based on uniform weighting based, and the certificate is checked via the spectral norm of the covariance. If the quality isn’t good enough, then the blame is given to the largest eigenvector of the covariance that contributes to the most error. The weighting is now improved from the uniform initialization via the multiplicative weights styled update as given in step 3. <a href="https://jerryzli.github.io/robust-ml-fall19.html">Jerry Li</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~jsteinhardt/stat260/notes.pdf">Jacob Steinhardt</a> have wonderful lecture notes on these topics.<br/>The algorithm above is computationally efficient while the bounds are not that tight.</p>



<p><strong>SoS algorithms:</strong> Another approach is via sum of squares algorithms where the guarantees for statistical robustness are much tighter, but they are computationally not very efficient although they are polynomial time. A hybrid approach might as well give a balance of these based on the problem at hand to bridge this gap between computational efficiency vs. statistical efficiency.</p>



<p>A list of relevant references is given below.</p>

<h2>Test-time robustness</h2>



<p>We now cover robustness issues with distribution shift and adversarial data poisoning during the testing phase in machine learning.</p>



<h3>Warm-up with pictures</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/nym9PHw.png"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/WjF0kUi.png"/></figure>



<p>As shown in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03691">Steinhardt, Koh, Liang, 2017</a> the images below illustrate how poisoning samples can drastically alter the performance of a classifier from good to bad.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/8fOuCw8.png"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EjNcU3X.png"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00792">Shafahi , Huang, Najibi, Suciu, Studer, Dumitras, Goldstein, 2018</a> showed how poisoning images look perfectly fine to the human perception, while they flip the model’s performance where a fish is considered to be a dog and vice versa as shown below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/kVrVMSA.png"/></figure>



<p>Another problem with regards to test-time robustness is the issue of domain shift where the distribution of test data is different from the distribution of training data.</p>



<p><img alt="\underset{x,y \sim D}{\mathbb{E}} L(f(x),y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cunderset%7Bx%2Cy+%5Csim+D%7D%7B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%7D+L%28f%28x%29%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> vs. <img alt="\underset{x,y \sim D'}{\mathbb{E}} L(f(x),y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cunderset%7Bx%2Cy+%5Csim+D%27%7D%7B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%7D+L%28f%28x%29%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> . If L is bounded, then if Lipschitz constant is known then distances like earth mover’s distance, T.V distance can be used to bound this. But one needs to be quite careful or these bounds are too large or close to vacuous.</p>



<p>For example, images of dogs taken say in a forest vs. images of dogs taken on roads have huge distance in measures like the ones mentioned above, as many pixels (although not important pixels) across the images are very different and there could be a classifier that performs terribly across the test while it does good on train. But magically, there appears to be a linear relationship between the accuracy on <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> vs accuracy on <img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Typically one would expect that the line would be below the x=y (45 degree) line.</p>



<p>i.e say if it was trained on cifar 10 (<img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) and tested on cifar10.2 (<img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) then finding this line to be a bit lower than the <img alt="x=y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dy&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> line is not surprising but this linear correlation is quite surprising. It is even more surprising if the datasets are different-say in the case when performance on photos vs illustrations or cartoons of these photos was considered.</p>



<p>What are the potential reasons (intuitively)?</p>



<p>i) Overfitting on cifar test,</p>



<p>ii) Fewer human annotators per image <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">introduces skew</a> towards hardness of dataset,</p>



<p>iii) Running out of images by human annotators as they might end up choosing images that are easier to annotate.</p>



<p>If we achieve better accuracy on <img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> than we achieved on <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, it is a strong indicator of a drop in hardness. If the errors are in the other direction, then this reasoning isn’t as clear.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ns4uH9i.png"/></figure>



<h3>A toy theoretical model</h3>



<p>Here is a toy model can demonstrate this surprising linear relationship between accuracies under domain shift.<br/>Let us do a thought experiment where things are linear. Let us assume there was a true vector cat direction in terms of the representation(feature) as shown in the cartoon below. Let there be some correlated idiosyncratic correlations. An example, idiosyncrasy is say due to cats tending to be photographed more in indoors than in outdoors.</p>



<p>Consider <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be a point that needs to be labeled.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/TUKbBTy.png"/></figure>



<p>In some dataset <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> consider the probability that <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is labeled as a cat is proportional to the following exponential as:<br/><img alt="\mathrm{Pr}[x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BPr%7D%5Bx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> labeled cat <img alt="] \propto \exp (\beta\langle x, C A T+\alpha I\rangle)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5D+%5Cpropto+%5Cexp+%28%5Cbeta%5Clangle+x%2C+C+A+T%2B%5Calpha+I%5Crangle%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>where <img alt="\alpha" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to denote the theidiosyncratic correlation factor. This is the exponent of the dot product of the image to be labeled <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with the CAT direction and the idiosyncratic direction. The same can be done for a dataset <img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as</p>



<p>Dataset <img alt="D^{\prime}: \mathrm{Pr}[x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%3A+%5Cmathrm%7BPr%7D%5Bx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> labeled cat <img alt="] \propto \exp \left(\beta^{\prime}\left\langle x, C A T+\alpha^{\prime}I^{\prime}\right\rangle\right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5D+%5Cpropto+%5Cexp+%5Cleft%28%5Cbeta%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%5Cleft%5Clangle+x%2C+C+A+T%2B%5Calpha%5E%7B%5Cprime%7DI%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%5Cright%5Crangle%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Intuitively <img alt="\beta'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is like the signal to noise ratio. That is, if <img alt="\beta' &lt; \beta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%27+%3C+%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then <img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a harder dataset to classify than <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>So in this toy model, the best accuracy that can be reached for any linear classifier is given by the following, where the softmax of the RHS is the classification probability.</p>



<p><img alt="A c c_{D}(C)=\beta\langle C, C A T\rangle+\beta \alpha\langle C, I\rangle" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+c+c_%7BD%7D%28C%29%3D%5Cbeta%5Clangle+C%2C+C+A+T%5Crangle%2B%5Cbeta+%5Calpha%5Clangle+C%2C+I%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/><img alt="A c c_{D \prime}(C)=\beta^{\prime}\langle C, C A T\rangle+\beta^{\prime} \alpha^{\prime}\left\langle C, I^{\prime}\right\rangle" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+c+c_%7BD+%5Cprime%7D%28C%29%3D%5Cbeta%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%5Clangle+C%2C+C+A+T%5Crangle%2B%5Cbeta%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D+%5Calpha%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%5Cleft%5Clangle+C%2C+I%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%5Cright%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/>The first term of this accuracy is the universal and transferable part and the second term is the idiosyncratic part.</p>



<p>The following is an For the <img alt="A c c_{D \prime}(C)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+c+c_%7BD+%5Cprime%7D%28C%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> we assume that if <img alt="C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is trained on <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then we assume <img alt="\approx 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This is because if <img alt="C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is trained on <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then idiosyncratic directions of <img alt="D,D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%2CD%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are orthogonal to each other. So the <img alt="\approx 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and the accuracy will be just this term of <img alt="\beta^{\prime}\langle C, C A T\rangle" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%5Clangle+C%2C+C+A+T%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>If the model is learnt by gradient descent then the gradient direction will always be proportional to <img alt="CAT + \alpha I + Noise" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=CAT+%2B+%5Calpha+I+%2B+Noise&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as the gradient is of the form<br/><img alt="\nabla(\beta\langle C, C A T\rangle+\alpha \beta\langle C, I\rangle)=\beta \cdot C A T+\beta \alpha \cdot I" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla%28%5Cbeta%5Clangle+C%2C+C+A+T%5Crangle%2B%5Calpha+%5Cbeta%5Clangle+C%2C+I%5Crangle%29%3D%5Cbeta+%5Ccdot+C+A+T%2B%5Cbeta+%5Calpha+%5Ccdot+I&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/>So, if <img alt="C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is trained on <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then <img alt="C \propto C A T+\alpha \cdot I+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%5Cpropto+C+A+T%2B%5Calpha+%5Ccdot+I%2B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> Noise <img alt="=\frac{\gamma}{|C A T+\alpha \cdot I|^{2}}(C A T+\alpha \cdot I)+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cgamma%7D%7B%7CC+A+T%2B%5Calpha+%5Ccdot+I%7C%5E%7B2%7D%7D%28C+A+T%2B%5Calpha+%5Ccdot+I%29%2B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> Noise.

<p><img alt="A c c_{D}(C)=\beta\langle C, C A T+\alpha \cdot I\rangle=\beta \gamma" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+c+c_%7BD%7D%28C%29%3D%5Cbeta%5Clangle+C%2C+C+A+T%2B%5Calpha+%5Ccdot+I%5Crangle%3D%5Cbeta+%5Cgamma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/><img alt="A c c_{D^{\prime}}(C)=\beta^{\prime}\left\langle C, C A T+\alpha \cdot I^{\prime}\right\rangle=\beta^{\prime} \gamma \cdot \frac{|C A T|^{2}}{|C A T|^{2}+\alpha^{2}|I|^{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+c+c_%7BD%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%7D%28C%29%3D%5Cbeta%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%5Cleft%5Clangle+C%2C+C+A+T%2B%5Calpha+%5Ccdot+I%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%5Cright%5Crangle%3D%5Cbeta%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D+%5Cgamma+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7B%7CC+A+T%7C%5E%7B2%7D%7D%7B%7CC+A+T%7C%5E%7B2%7D%2B%5Calpha%5E%7B2%7D%7CI%7C%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Therefore, we see this form of a linear relationship:<br/><img alt="A c c_{D^{\prime}}(C)=\frac{\beta^{\prime}}{\beta\left(1+\theta^{2}\right)} \cdot \mathrm{Acc}_{D}(C)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+c+c_%7BD%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%7D%28C%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cbeta%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D%7D%7B%5Cbeta%5Cleft%281%2B%5Ctheta%5E%7B2%7D%5Cright%29%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Cmathrm%7BAcc%7D_%7BD%7D%28C%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Note that:</p>

<p>Although this is a toy theoretical model, it explains a linear relationship. However, finding a model that explains this linear relationship in real-life will be an interesting project to think of.</p>



<h3>Adversarial perturbations</h3>



<p>We now move to the last (yet another active) topic of our blog: adversarial perturbations. As an introductory example (taken from <a href="https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/">this tutorial</a>), the hog image <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> was originally classified as a hog with <img alt="\approx 99.6 \%" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+99.6+%5C%25&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> probability. A small amount of noise <img alt="\Delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> was added to get the <img alt="x+\Delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2B%5CDelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> image which to the human eye perceptually looks indistinguishable. That said the model now ends up misclassifying the noised hog to something that is not a hog.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/4jjdwwL.png"/></figure>



<p>Should we be surprised with the efficacy of such adversarial perturbations? Originally-certainly yes, but not as much now in hindsight!</p>



<p>In this example it turns out that the magnitude of each element satisfies <img alt="\left|\Delta_{i}\right| \approx \frac{1}{64}\left|x_{i}\right|" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7C%5CDelta_%7Bi%7D%5Cright%7C+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B64%7D%5Cleft%7Cx_%7Bi%7D%5Cright%7C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and the 2-norm of this vector is roughly as <img alt="|\Delta| \approx \frac{1}{64}|x|" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5CDelta%7C+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B64%7D%7Cx%7C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Note that the Resnet50 model outputs <img alt="r(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at the penultimate layer has a dimension <img alt="d=2048" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3D2048&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We scale <img alt="|x|" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Cx%7C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that <img alt="|r(x)| \approx \sqrt{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Cr%28x%29%7C+%5Capprox+%5Csqrt%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. There is a Lipschitz constant <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> w.r.t the preservation of the following norms: <img alt="|r(x+\Delta)-r(x)| \approx L|\Delta|" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Cr%28x%2B%5CDelta%29-r%28x%29%7C+%5Capprox+L%7C%5CDelta%7C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The final classification decision is made by looking at <img alt="C \cdot H O G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%5Ccdot+H+O+G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="HOG" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=HOG&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a unit vector such that <img alt="H O G:" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+O+G%3A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> unit vector s.t. <img alt="\mathrm{Pr}[x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BPr%7D%5Bx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="h o g] \propto\langle H O G, r(x)\rangle" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h+o+g%5D+%5Cpropto%5Clangle+H+O+G%2C+r%28x%29%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We assume some randomness in the decision as being <img alt="\sqrt{1-c^{2} / d} \cdot N(0, I)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B1-c%5E%7B2%7D+%2F+d%7D+%5Ccdot+N%280%2C+I%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for simplicity. So we have<br/><img alt="r(x)=C \cdot H O G+\sqrt{1-c^{2} / d} \cdot N(0, I)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28x%29%3DC+%5Ccdot+H+O+G%2B%5Csqrt%7B1-c%5E%7B2%7D+%2F+d%7D+%5Ccdot+N%280%2C+I%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="C=\langle x, HOG \rangle" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%3D%5Clangle+x%2C+HOG+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.We now have the probability that <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is not a hog as</p>



<p><img alt="\mathrm{Pr}[x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BPr%7D%5Bx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is not hog <img alt="]=\frac{\exp (-C)}{\exp (C)+\exp (-C)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5D%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cexp+%28-C%29%7D%7B%5Cexp+%28C%29%2B%5Cexp+%28-C%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>As we know that the observed probability of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> being not a hog is 0.0996, we can calculate that <img alt="C \approx 3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%5Capprox+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.<br/>Upon normalizing <img alt="|r(x)|^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Cr%28x%29%7C%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be <img alt="d=2048" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3D2048&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, We can expect the following square of this dot product w.r.t the representation <img alt="r(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as:<img alt="\langle r(x), H O G\rangle^{2} \approx 3 \approx |r(x)|^2 / 700" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+r%28x%29%2C+H+O+G%5Crangle%5E%7B2%7D+%5Capprox+3+%5Capprox+%7Cr%28x%29%7C%5E2+%2F+700&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/>Therefore the norm of the projection of <img alt="r(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to the HOG direction is given by <img alt="\left|r(x)_{H O G}\right| \approx \frac{1}{25}|r(x)|" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7Cr%28x%29_%7BH+O+G%7D%5Cright%7C+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B25%7D%7Cr%28x%29%7C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>So say if the 2048 vector had one larger element which accounts for the HOG direction, although it still accounts for a small proportion of its total norm. Therefore it wouldn’t need too much noise to flip one class to its wrong class label as shown in the cartoons below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/TzWJX5X.png"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/5j65j1P.png"/></figure>



<p>So if the Lipschitz constant is greater than around 2.5 or 3, then a fraction of 1/25 is enough to zero out the hog direction (as <img alt="L \gg \frac{64}{25} \approx 2.5" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%5Cgg+%5Cfrac%7B64%7D%7B25%7D+%5Capprox+2.5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>).</p>



<h3>Robust loss</h3>



<p>What are some strategies for training neural networks that are robust to perturbations?</p>



<ul><li>A set of transformation that do not change the true nature of the data such as for e.g:<br/><img alt="t_{\Delta}(x)=x+\Delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_%7B%5CDelta%7D%28x%29%3Dx%2B%5CDelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where the set is</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/kbq4bol.png"/></figure>



<p>i.e, they only perturb the image or data sample by atmost <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> upon applying that transformation.<br/>Now, given a loss function <img alt="\mathcal{L}: Y \times Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%3A+Y+%5Ctimes+Y+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and a classifier <img alt="f: X \rightarrow Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A+X+%5Crightarrow+Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, a <strong>robust loss</strong> function of <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at point <img alt="(x, y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is defined as</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/9cghGEA.png"/></figure>



<h3>Robust training:</h3>



<p>Given <img alt="x_{1}, y_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, y_{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7B1%7D%2C+y_%7B1%7D%2C+%5Cldots%2C+x_%7Bn%7D%2C+y_%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and arobust loss function, a robust training would involve the minimization of this loss which gives us:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/JKMY5NL.png"/></figure>



<p>Now for the subgoal of finding <img alt="\nabla_{f} \max_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \mathcal{L}\left(f\left(t(x{i})\right), y_{i}\right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_%7Bf%7D+%5Cmax_%7Bt+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D%7D+%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%5Cleft%28f%5Cleft%28t%28x%7Bi%7D%29%5Cright%29%2C+y_%7Bi%7D%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for the sake of optimization, invoking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danskin%27s_theorem">Danskin’s Theorem</a> will greatly help. The theorem basically says that if <img alt="g(f, t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28f%2C+t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is nice (diff, continuous) and if <img alt="\mathcal{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is compact then we have that:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/XXRYA2k.png"/></figure>



<p>i.e for any function <img alt="g(f,t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28f%2Ct%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, that depends on <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as long as the function space <img alt="\mathcal{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from which <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> needs to be chosen is nice (diff, continuous) and compact, then to find the gradient of the maximum of the function <img alt="g(f,t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28f%2Ct%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then by the theorem one can find maximizer <img alt="t^*" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5E%2A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for any particular <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then that can give the required gradient (after some fine print that is given in note below).<br/>Note: The paper below extends to the case when <img alt="t^{\ast}(f)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5E%7B%5Cast%7D%28f%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> non unique though there is other fine print. See Appendix A of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083">(Madry Makelov Schmidt Tsipras Vladu 2017)</a>.</p>



<p>On the empirical side, there seems to be a trade-off. If one wants to achieve adversarial robustness, it can be achieved by letting go of some model accuracy. See discussion <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/">here</a> and the papers cited below.</p>

    <title>TR21-049 |  Kolmogorov complexity and  nondeterminism versus determinism  for polynomial time computations | 

	Juraj Hromkovic</title>
    <summary>We call any consistent and sufficiently powerful formal theory that enables to algorithmically in polynomial time verify whether a text is a proof  \textbf{efficiently verifiable mathematics} (ev-mathematics). We study the question whether nondeterminism is more powerful than determinism for polynomial time computations in the framework of ev-mathematics. Our main results are as follows. \\
"$\P \subsetneq \NP$ or for any deterministic, polynomial time compression algorithm $A$ there exists a nondeterministic, polynomial time compression machine $M$ that reduces infinitely many binary strings logarithmically stronger than $A$." \\
"$\P \subsetneq \NP$ or f-time resource bounded Kolmogorov complexity of any binary string $x$ can be computed in deterministic polynomial time for each polynomial time constructible function $f$."</summary>

Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace will be reunited. Their work on designing and programming a computing device, a century before any machine was built, is being honored by their appearance on the reverse of the 5-pound note in a new series authorized by the Bank of England. Royal Statistical Society Fellow Florence Nightingale will appear on the 10, EDSAC creator Maurice Wilkes on the 20, and Alan Turing on the 50. </p>
<p>
Today, April 1, we are delighted to convey this news and show previews of the banknotes.<br/>
<span id="more-18471"/></p>
<p>
We have mentioned Babbage and Lovelace several times on this blog, the latter first <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/03/23/its-ada-lovelace-day/">here</a>. Our 2015 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/02/17/ada-the-amplifier/">post</a> on her work on his project sought to engage a scholarly consensus that tends to minimize it. We argue that it should be judged on the plane of a doctoral or masters advisory relationship. Our point is that she greatly <em>amplified</em> the technical content of his work as shown to the scientific community. </p>
<p>
The design shown above makes a leap from their Victorian world to our online age. Being “online” back then probably meant being reached by the new railroad system centered on London. The one indelible connection between our world and theirs is shown by the obverse of the banknote: both worlds have a long-serving British queen.</p>
<p/><h2> Nightingale On The 10 </h2><p/>
<p>
Besides a long life (1820–1910), Nightingale has a long entry as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founders_of_statistics">founder</a> of statistics. Her actions and influence extended for more than five decades after her iconic “Lady With the Lamp” ministry to soldiers of the Crimean War depicted on the 10-pound note:</p>

<p>
The picture at right is based on a <a href="https://www.amdigital.co.uk/about/blog/item/nightingale">photo</a> by William Kilburn, one of few series of photos she allowed to be taken. We have not found a definitive word on what she is holding—not even from this long <a href="https://theclassicphotomag.com/florence-nightingale-the-mysteries-behind-her-iconic-photographs/">article</a>—but we would like to believe it is a letter or paper regarding medical practice. Already in 1854, the <em>Oxford Chronicle and Reading Gazette</em> noted her bringing much more than a lamp:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In a knowledge of the ancient languages and of the higher branches of mathematics, in general art, science, and literature, her attainments are extraordinary. There is scarcely a modern language which she does not understand; and she speaks French, German, and Italian as fluently as her native English. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Not only did she popularize the pie chart and invent other statistical visualization techniques, she was among the first people, period, to bring statistical inference into policy. This included demonstrating with data the higher exposure of nurses to multiple diseases among those they tended. She was inducted into the Royal Statistical Society in <b>1858</b>. </p>
<p>
Her medical conduct principles have been applied expressly during the pandemic, as <a href="https://nursing.vanderbilt.edu/news/lessons-from-florence-nightingale-are-primary-tools-in-covid-19-nursing/">recognized</a> by the time of the 200th anniversary of her birth last May 12, and field hospitals in the UK for Covid-19 treatment are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_hospitals_in_the_United_Kingdom">named</a> for her. Her recognition on the currency was considered a way to honor first-line caregivers and was a unanimous vote of the Bank of England commission. It has the earliest release <a href="https://en.numista.com/catalogue/note203311.html">date</a> of all the banknotes.</p>
<p/><h2> Wilkes On The 20 </h2><p/>
<p>
Maurice Wilkes had an even longer life, 1913 to 2010. This marks a stark contrast to Turing. Wilkes was the second winner, in 1967, of the Turing Award. The Turing Award <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/wilkes_1001395.cfm">citation</a> said he was</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the first computer with an internally stored program.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
He was thus the first realizer of the full vision of Babbage and Lovelace, although many claim the stored-program distinction for the Manchester <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby">Baby</a> one year earlier, in 1948.</p>
<p>
There was controversy about the order of him and Turing. The banknotes were intended to go in chronological order. Turing’s famous paper conceiving the computer dates to 1936–37. Wilkes’s first brush with the project that became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC">EDSAC</a> came in 1945, when he spent an iconic 24 hours with a loaned copy of John von Neumann’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_the_EDVAC">First EDVAC Report</a> that he was not able to mimeograph. However, Wilkes was involved with analog computing devices before 1937 and his EDSAC reached full operation in May 1949, whereas Turing’s own main project, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Computing_Engine">ACE</a>, launched its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_ACE">pilot</a> version only in 1950. </p>
<p>
The ultimate determiner was that the 20-pound note was already recently revised to feature the artist Joseph Turner in February 2020. The Turner issue will have a five-year term, so Wilkes will appear in 2025. The banknote design has not yet been executed.</p>
<p/><h2> Turing On The 50 </h2><p/>
<p>
Of course, this is the highlight for us, and we are delighted to be able to show the Turing design in full glory. It was formally <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2021/march/the-new-50-note-unveiled">unveiled</a> last week:</p>

<p>
The Pilot ACE machine is shown overlaid with Turing machine code from his 1936 paper. Turing tapes with binary code appear in three places. The big one represents his June 23, 1912 birth date—exactly how, we leave as a puzzle.  We’ll just hint that all our friends across the Pond write dates differently from how we do. The new banknotes are being released on Turing’s birthday this coming June.</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCHQ">GCHQ</a>, which grew out of Turing’s employers at Bletchley Park, has just released its own puzzle <a href="https://www.gchq.gov.uk/information/turing-challenge">challenge</a>, which references Easter-egg features of the Turing banknote. The binary code puzzle is 11th of 12, but to our surprise, when you click it, it gives the answer to the birth date part right away.  Then it proceeds to something far more cryptic—well, it’s from GCHQ after all. </p>
<p/><h2> Other Notes </h2><p/>
<p>
The Turing release will also complete the conversion from paper to polymer of all Bank of England notes, which are also the only series issued for Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland issue their own pound-denominated banknotes with different designs. They have yet to convert to polymer, and that will delay any consideration of adopting the new series.</p>
<p>
Turing’s family on his father’s side came from Scotland, so there is some sentiment for the Royal Bank of Scotland adopting the design. There is also discussion of recognizing Robin Milner and/or Donald Michie, though both were born in England. </p>
<p>
Over in Ireland, both sides of the Northern Ireland border are considering the statistician William Gosset, who as Head Brewer of Guinness over a century ago conceived the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test">Student t-test</a> among many innovations. However, Gosset was also born in England. The Bushmills distillery in Northern Ireland has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717073525/http://boini.bankofireland.com/about-boi-group/bank-notes/note/16">appeared</a> on their 5-pound note.</p>
<p>
In fact, Gosset and Milner and Michie were all originally <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/banknotes/50-character-selection-names.pdf">nominated</a> alongside Turing for the 50-pound note. We spot Bertrand Russell and William Tutte and Karen Spärck-Jones on the list. In physics, we notice Paul Dirac and John Bell and Stephen Hawking, and also the astronomer Vera Rubin—who was only American, no? Bell was from Northern Ireland. </p>
<p>
Sir Michael Atiyah is not on the list because he was living at the time—no living person other than the monarch may appear on a banknote. This law does not apply to e-currency however, and this leads to what for us is the most exciting aspect of the Bank of England initiative.</p>
<p/><h2> Semi-Fungible Tokens </h2><p/>
<p>
The following is a GLL exclusive. It was conveyed to us by Dr. Lofa Polir, who since our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/04/01/research-at-home/">story</a> a year ago has resided in England. It comes from a confluence of several facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>National banks regularly issue limited editions of currency apart from the main series.
</li><li>Government banks have largely refrained from direct involvement with digital currencies, but <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20200813a.htm">observe</a> them closely.
</li><li>Large sections of the public have come to ascribe intrinsic value to <em>non-fungible tokens</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a>), which come with a blockchain-verifiable certificate of unique ownership.
</li><li>A non-fungible token by-definition cannot be used as money but only bought and sold as a (unique) commodity.
</li><li>Playing cards in games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: the Gathering</a> are regularly traded online to the extent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox">melding</a> with cryptocurrencies or verging on being currency themselves.
</li></ul>
<p>
The Bank of England recently voted to create an active response to this situation: the <em>semi-fungible token</em> (SFT). Like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, SFTs limit their supply, but unlike them, SFTs are maintained by a central body and backed by its assets. An SFT is fungible by dint of having a fixed redemption rate to standard currency, but its own price may go higher.  As with NFTs, each SFT is associated to a piece of digital artwork. </p>
<p>
The new issues are based on the Royal Mail’s 2015 <a href="https://www.collectgbstamps.co.uk/explore/issues/?issue=22720">Inventive Britain</a> collection, whose honorees include Sir Tim Berners-Lee for the World Wide Web. The main stamps were abstract, but associated issues are not subject to the law against likenesses of living persons:</p>

<p>
Berners-Lee will be the first honoree in the SFT series. We are not authorized to reveal the art design before its release. But Lofa sent us a list of nominees that includes Geoffrey Hinton, Tony Hoare, and Leslie Valiant on the CS side, plus David Spiegelhalter and Demis Hassabis in data science. Unlike with the banknotes, the Bank of England can “catch them all.” Imagine, then, you will soon be able to pay for groceries with cards of some of your favorite computer and data scientists—at least if they are British and you buy the groceries in Britain. </p>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
If you see a market for NFTs, do you see one for SFTs—or are they both April Fools?</p>

You can’t make the Borromean rings with geometric circles: as Tverberg observed, an inversion would make one of them a line. But then each of the other two circles would span an angle less than \(\pi\) as viewed from the line, leaving an unspanned direction along which the line could escape to infinity, contradicting the inseparability of the rings.</p>

    <p>The same proof shows that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunnian_link">Brunnian links</a> cannot be made from four geometric circles. But the original proof that Borromean rings are not circular, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.4310/jdg/1214440725">Freedman and Skora</a> using 4d hyperbolic geometry, applies more generally to any Brunnian link no matter how many components it has.</p>

Start with the two-element multiset \(\{0,1\}\), repeatedly draw two-element samples (without replacement) from the multiset and include the average into the multiset. The result tends to cluster around some value, not the same value every time but itself drawn from a bimodal distribution, with the clustering sort of looking Cauchy but not quite. Interesting new MathOverflow question.</p>

Two if you can skim the ends of the edges or include entire edges in hyperplanes but more to really slice them. The obvious answer of axis-parallel cuts can be improved to \(5n/6\), and Lance Fortnow reports that the newest lower bound is \(\Omega(n^{0.57})\), by Gal Yehuda and Amir Yehudayoff, improving <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05536">their own new preprint</a>.</p>

<p>
That is links to blogs on computer theory and related math. Links that are current, that are interesting, and that are fit to refer to. All the blogs that <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>

</p><p/><h2> The Links </h2><p/>
<p>Our rule is we include a link provided it is current. It must have a recent post—say at least this year. See <a href="http://cstheory-feed.org">all</a> for a complete list. But we decided to emphasis those that are up to date. </p>

We plan to have both technical tutorials / mini-courses and networking/social events.<br/><br/>This course is aimed at undergraduate students, and in particular students from groups that are currently under-represented in our field. If you are a faculty member in a university, we would be grateful if you can spread the announcement below to both your colleagues, and any mailing lists for undergraduate students, and in particular chapters of affinity groups such as the National Society of Black Engineers, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology, etc.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The committee for advancement of theoretical computer science (<a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/catcs/">CATCS</a>) is organizing an online  summer course that will take place on May 31 till June 4, 2021. New horizons in theoretical computer science is a week-long online summer school which will expose undergraduates to exciting research areas in the area of theoretical computer science and its applications. The school will contain several mini-courses from top researchers in the field. The course is free of charge,and we welcome applications from undergraduates majoring in computer science or related fields. We particularly encourage applications from students that are members of groups that are currently under-represented in theoretical computer science. </p>



<p>The course is intended for currently enrolled undergraduate students that are majoring in computer science or related fields. Students will be expected to be familiar with the material typically taught in introductory algorithms and discrete mathematics / mathematics for computer science courses. If you are unsure if you are prepared for the course, please write to us at <a href="mailto:summer-school-admin@boazbarak.org" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">summer-school-admin@boazbarak.org</a><br/><br/>To apply for the course, please visit <a href="https://boazbk.github.io/tcs-summerschool/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://boazbk.github.io/tcs-summerschool/</a> and fill in the application form by <strong>April 15, 2021</strong>. <br/><br/><strong>Course organizers:</strong> Boaz Barak (Harvard), Shuchi Chawla (UT Austin), Madhur Tulsiani (TTI-Chicago)</p>



<p><strong>Current list of confirmed instructors:</strong>  Antonio Blanca (Penn State University), Ashia Wilson (MIT), Jelani Nelson (UC Berkeley), Nicole Immorlica (Microsoft Research), Yael Kalai (Microsoft research).</p>
