    <summary>The randomized query complexity $R(f)$ of a boolean function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ is famously characterized (via Yao's minimax) by the least number of queries needed to distinguish a distribution $D_0$ over $0$-inputs from a distribution $D_1$ over $1$-inputs, maximized over all pairs $(D_0,D_1)$. We ask: Does this task become easier if we allow query access to infinitely many samples from either $D_0$ or $D_1$? We show the answer is no: There exists a hard pair $(D_0,D_1)$ such that distinguishing $D_0^\infty$ from $D_1^\infty$ requires $\Theta(R(f))$ many queries. As an application, we show that for any composed function $f\circ g$ we have $R(f\circ g) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{fbs}(f)R(g))$ where $\mathrm{fbs}$ denotes fractional block sensitivity.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Greetings from Milan, in Italy’s “yellow zone” of areas bordering clusters of coronavirus infections. This week, all schools, universities, museums, theaters  are closed, bars have to close by 6pm, and fairs and conferences are being postponed. The “red zone” of small towns with the clusters of infections is on lockdown.</p>
<p>Milan has been unseasonably warm and sunny in the past few days, and walking through the city, with very light car and pedestrian traffic, has been lovely. This is apparently what the city usually looks like in August, but without the heat and humidity.<br/>
<span id="more-4301"/></p>
<p>Italians have the well deserved fame of being very dramatic people, but we have been taking the inconvenience in stride and with a mix of stoicism and good humor. Maybe I am wrong, but, apart from New York City, if a large American city had a cluster of infections in the suburbs, and it were similarly shut down, we would see riots and looting on the first night.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the lockdown of the small towns was announced before any announcement of what to do about Milan, and the news showed long lines of people in those small towns waiting to buy groceries in the few open supermarkets. This induced some panic-buying on Sunday and Monday in Milan.</p>
<p>While people in Hong Kong and Singapore panic-bought toilet paper, Italians have mostly been buying pasta. Except, that is, <i>penne lisce</i>, like this Twitter user noted in a broadly shared picture. (Short cuts of pasta, like penne, are usually ribbed, to better catch sauce. Smooth short pasta like penne lisce makes no sense)</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="it">Continuo a guardare questa foto fatta prima al supermercato e penso al fatto che il grande sconfitto da questo virus sono le penne lisce che agli italiani fanno cagare pure quando sono presi dal panico e si preparano all’apocalisse. <a href="https://t.co/Lq9Y06jdho">pic.twitter.com/Lq9Y06jdho</a></p>

<p>By Sunday night, the government decided that Lombardy and Veneto would be subject to a series of measures with the goal of reducing person-to-person contact, such as the closures mentioned above of schools, universities, museums etc. The meme below is titled “Here in Milan we are going too far”.</p>

<p>Most annoyingly, every other newspaper headline or tv news chyron has been of the form “X in the time of coronavirus”. I can’t take it any more. This is the Autumn of journalism, a foretold death of creativity. Journalists are lost in the labyrinth of cliches. I wish all those headline writers one hundred years of solitude. The real news is the kidnapping of new ideas. Anyways, I think I am going to live to tell the tale.</p>
<p>The silver linings are that I have not been paying attention to the Democratic primaries and that I have plenty of free time to restart my planned series of posts on applications of online convex optimization to computational complexity. The next post will be on Impagliazzo’s hard-core lemma, a milestone in the theory of average-case complexity and pseudorandomness.</p>
<p>I am happy to answer any questions in the comments.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-026 |  Spectral Sparsification via Bounded-Independence Sampling | 

	Dean Doron, 

	Jack Murtagh, 

	Salil Vadhan, 

	David Zuckerman</title>
    <summary>We give a deterministic, nearly logarithmic-space algorithm for mild spectral sparsification of undirected graphs. Given a weighted, undirected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices described by a binary string of length $N$, an integer $k\leq \log n$ and an error parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, our algorithm runs in space $\tilde{O}(k\log (N\cdot w_{\mathrm{max}}/w_{\mathrm{min}}))$ where $w_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $w_{\mathrm{min}}$ are the maximum and minimum edge weights in $G$, and produces a weighted graph $H$ with $\tilde{O}(n^{1+2/k}/\varepsilon^2)$ expected edges that spectrally approximates $G$, in the sense of Spielmen and Teng [ST04], up to an error of $\varepsilon$.

Our algorithm is based on a new bounded-independence analysis of Spielman and Srivastava's effective resistance based edge sampling algorithm [SS08] and uses results from recent work on space-bounded Laplacian solvers [MRSV17].  In particular, we demonstrate an inherent tradeoff (via upper and lower bounds) between the amount of (bounded) independence used in the edge sampling algorithm, denoted by $k$ above, and the resulting sparsity that can be achieved.</summary>

exploration of an undirected, edge-weighted graph with a single agent that
needs to return to the starting location after visiting all vertices. We assume
that the agent has full knowledge of all edges incident to visited vertices,
and, in particular, vertices have unique identifiers. Our bound improves a
lower bound of 2.5 by Dobrev et al. [SIROCCO'12] and also holds for planar
graphs, where it complements an upper bound of 16 by Kalyanasundaram and
Pruhs[TCS'94]. The question whether a constant competitive ratio can be
achieved in general remains open.

    <title>Integer Plane Multiflow Maximisation:Flow-Cut Gap and One-Quarter-Approximation</title>

maximum plane multiflow problems and deduce bounds on the flow-cut-gap.
Planarity means here that the union of the supply and demand graph is planar.
We first prove that there exists a multiflow of value at least half of the
capacity of a minimum multicut. We then show how to convert any multiflow into
a half-integer one of value at least half of the original multiflow. Finally,
we round any half-integer multiflow into an integer multiflow, losing again at
most half of the value, in polynomial time, achieving a $1/4$-approximation
algorithm for maximum integer multiflows in the plane, and an integer-flow-cut
gap of $8$.

Arrangement}. The model is defined by a bijection from agents with preferences
to vertices in a graph. The utility of an agent depends on the neighbors
assigned in the graph. More precisely, it is the sum over all neighbors of the
preferences that the agent has towards the agent assigned to the neighbor. We
first consider the price of stability and fairness for different classes of
preferences. In particular, we show that there is an instance such that the
price of fairness ({\sf PoF}) is unbounded in general. Moreover, we show an
upper bound $\tilde{d}(G)$ and an almost tight lower bound $\tilde{d}(G)-1/4$
of {\sf PoF}, where $\tilde{d}(G)$ is the average degree of an input graph.
Then we investigate the computational complexity of problems to find certain
``good'' seat arrangements, say \textsc{Maximum Welfare Arrangement},
\textsc{Maximin Utility Arrangement}, \textsc{Stable Arrangement}, and
\textsc{Envy-free Arrangement}. We give dichotomies of computational complexity
of four \textsc{Seat Arrangement} problems from the perspective of the maximum
order of connected components in an input graph. For the parameterized
complexity, \textsc{Maximum Welfare Arrangement} can be solved in time
$n^{O(\gamma)}$, while it cannot be solved in time $f(\gamma)^{o(\gamma)}$
under ETH, where $\gamma$ is the vertex cover number of an input graph.
Moreover, we show that \textsc{Maximin Utility Arrangement} and
\textsc{Envy-free Arrangement} are weakly NP-hard even on graphs of bounded
vertex cover number. Finally, we prove that determining whether a stable
arrangement can be obtained from a given arrangement by $k$ swaps is W[1]-hard
when parameterized by $k+\gamma$, whereas it can be solved in time $n^{O(k)}$.

construction of fault-tolerant spanners that is size-optimal, at least for
vertex faults. However, the algorithm to construct this spanner is not
polynomial-time, and the best-known polynomial time algorithm is significantly
suboptimal. Designing a polynomial-time algorithm to construct (near-)optimal
fault-tolerant spanners was given as an explicit open problem in the two most
recent papers on fault-tolerant spanners ([Bodwin, Dinitz, Parter, Vassilevka
Williams SODA '18] and [Bodwin, Patel PODC '19]). We give a surprisingly simple
algorithm which runs in polynomial time and constructs fault-tolerant spanners
that are extremely close to optimal (off by only a linear factor in the
stretch) by modifying the greedy algorithm to run in polynomial time. To
complement this result, we also give simple distributed constructions in both
the LOCAL and CONGEST models.

dynamical systems, the method captures four previous lower bounds results from
the literature in algebraic complexity. Among these results lies Mulmuley's
proof that "prams without bit operations" do not compute the maxflow problem in
polylogarithmic time, which was the best known lower bounds in the quest for a
proof that NC = Ptime. Inspired from a refinement of Steele and Yao's lower
bounds, due to Ben-Or, we strengthen Mulmuley's result to a larger class of
machines, showing that prams over integer do not compute maxflow in
polylogarithmic time.

Andersson-Madigan-Perlman chain graph (AMP CG), namely, finding a set Z of
nodes that separate a given non-adjacent pair of nodes such that no proper
subset of Z separates that pair. We analyze several versions of this problem
and offer polynomial-time algorithms for each. These include finding a minimal
separator from a restricted set of nodes, finding a minimal separator for two
given disjoint sets, and testing whether a given separator is minimal. We
provide an extension of the decomposition approach for learning Bayesian
networks (BNs) proposed by (Xie et. al.) to learn AMP CGs, which include BNs as
a special case, under the faithfulness assumption and prove its correctness
using the minimal separator results. The advantages of this decomposition
approach hold in the more general setting: reduced complexity and increased
power of computational independence tests. In addition, we show that the
PC-like algorithm is order-dependent, in the sense that the output can depend
on the order in which the variables are given. We propose two modifications of
the PC-like algorithm that remove part or all of this order-dependence.
Simulations under a variety of settings demonstrate the competitive performance
of our decomposition-based method, called LCD-AMP, in comparison with the
(modified version of) PC-like algorithm. In fact, the decomposition-based
algorithm usually outperforms the PC-like algorithm. We empirically show that
the results of both algorithms are more accurate and stable when the sample
size is reasonably large and the underlying graph is sparse.

which we call well-partitioned chordal graphs. Split graphs are graphs that
admit a partition of the vertex set into cliques that can be arranged in a star
structure, the leaves of which are of size one. Well-partitioned chordal graphs
are a generalization of this concept in the following two ways. First, the
cliques in the partition can be arranged in a tree structure, and second, each
clique is of arbitrary size. We provide a characterization of well-partitioned
chordal graphs by forbidden induced subgraphs, and give a polynomial-time
algorithm that given any graph, either finds an obstruction, or outputs a
partition of its vertex set that asserts that the graph is well-partitioned
chordal. We demonstrate the algorithmic use of this graph class by showing that
two variants of the problem of finding pairwise disjoint paths between k given
pairs of vertices is in FPT parameterized by k on well-partitioned chordal
graphs, while on chordal graphs, these problems are only known to be in XP.
From the other end, we observe that there are problems that are polynomial-time
solvable on split graphs, but become NP-complete on well-partitioned chordal
graphs.

The unit disk
graph $DG(V)$ of $V$ is the graph with vertex set $V$ in which two sites $v$
and $w$ are adjacent if and only if their Euclidean distance is at most $1$. We
develop a compact routing scheme for $DG(V)$. The routing scheme preprocesses
$DG(V)$ by assigning a label $l(v)$ to every site $v$ in $V$. After that, for
any two sites $s$ and $t$, the scheme must be able to route a packet from $s$
to $t$ as follows: given the label of a current vertex $r$ (initially, $r=s$)
and the label of the target vertex $t$, the scheme determines a neighbor $r'$
of $r$. Then, the packet is forwarded to $r'$, and the process continues until
the packet reaches its desired target $t$. The resulting path between the
source $s$ and the target $t$ is called the routing path of $s$ and $t$. The
stretch of the routing scheme is the maximum ratio of the total Euclidean
length of the routing path and of the shortest path in $DG(V)$, between any two
sites $s, t \in V$. We show that for any given $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we can
construct a routing scheme for $DG(V)$ with diameter $D$ that achieves stretch
$1+\varepsilon$ and label size $O(\log D\log^3n/\log\log n)$ (the constant in
the $O$-Notation depends on $\varepsilon$). In the past, several routing
schemes for unit disk graphs have been proposed. Our scheme is the first one to
achieve poly-logarithmic label size and arbitrarily small stretch without
storing any additional information in the packet.

    <title>A Tight Composition Theorem for the Randomized Query Complexity of Partial Functions</title>

functions. First, we show that the randomized composition conjecture is false:
there are families of partial Boolean functions $f$ and $g$ such that $R(f\circ
g)\ll R(f) R(g)$. In fact, we show that the left hand side can be polynomially
smaller than the right hand side (though in our construction, both sides are
polylogarithmic in the input size of $f$).
</p>
<p>Second, we show that for all $f$ and $g$, $R(f\circ
g)=\Omega(\mathop{noisyR}(f)\cdot R(g))$, where $\mathop{noisyR}(f)$ is a
measure describing the cost of computing $f$ on noisy oracle inputs. We show
that this composition theorem is the strongest possible of its type: for any
measure $M(\cdot)$ satisfying $R(f\circ g)=\Omega(M(f)R(g))$ for all $f$ and
$g$, it must hold that $\mathop{noisyR}(f)=\Omega(M(f))$ for all $f$. We also
give a clean characterization of the measure $\mathop{noisyR}(f)$: it satisfies
$\mathop{noisyR}(f)=\Theta(R(f\circ gapmaj_n)/R(gapmaj_n))$, where $n$ is the
input size of $f$ and $gapmaj_n$ is the $\sqrt{n}$-gap majority function on $n$

    <title>A New Minimax Theorem for Randomized Algorithms</title>

Boolean-valued function $f$ with finite domain, there is a distribution $\mu$
over the domain of $f$ such that computing $f$ to error $\epsilon$ against
inputs from $\mu$ is just as hard as computing $f$ to error $\epsilon$ on
worst-case inputs. Notably, however, the distribution $\mu$ depends on the
target error level $\epsilon$: the hard distribution which is tight for bounded
error might be trivial to solve to small bias, and the hard distribution which
is tight for a small bias level might be far from tight for bounded error
levels.
</p>
<p>In this work, we introduce a new type of minimax theorem which can provide a
hard distribution $\mu$ that works for all bias levels at once. We show that
this works for randomized query complexity, randomized communication
complexity, some randomized circuit models, quantum query and communication
complexities, approximate polynomial degree, and approximate logrank. We also
prove an improved version of Impagliazzo's hardcore lemma.
</p>
<p>Our proofs rely on two innovations over the classical approach of using Von
Neumann's minimax theorem or linear programming duality. First, we use Sion's
minimax theorem to prove a minimax theorem for ratios of bilinear functions
representing the cost and score of algorithms.
</p>
<p>Second, we introduce a new way to analyze low-bias randomized algorithms by
viewing them as "forecasting algorithms" evaluated by a proper scoring rule.
The expected score of the forecasting version of a randomized algorithm appears
to be a more fine-grained way of analyzing the bias of the algorithm. We show
that such expected scores have many elegant mathematical properties: for
example, they can be amplified linearly instead of quadratically. We anticipate
forecasting algorithms will find use in future work in which a fine-grained
analysis of small-bias algorithms is required.

$\Delta$ with $2\Delta - 1$ colors is one of the key symmetry breaking problems
in the area of distributed graph algorithms. While there has been a lot of
progress towards the understanding of this problem, the dependency of the
running time on $\Delta$ has been a long-standing open question. Very recently,
Kuhn [SODA '20] showed that the problem can be solved in time
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log\Delta})}+O(\log^* n)$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we study the edge coloring problem in the distributed LOCAL
model. We show that the $(\mathit{degree}+1)$-list edge coloring problem, and
thus also the $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring problem, can be solved
deterministically in time $\log^{O(\log\log\Delta)}\Delta + O(\log^* n)$. This
is a significant improvement over the result of Kuhn [SODA '20].

a simple path $\pi$ of $n$ vertices, preprocess it so that the convex hull of
any query subpath of $\pi$ can be quickly obtained. Previously, Guibas,
Hershberger, and Snoeyink [SODA 90'] proposed a data structure of $O(n)$ space
and $O(\log n\log\log n)$ query time; reducing the query time to $O(\log n)$
increases the space to $O(n\log\log n)$. We present an improved result that
uses $O(n)$ space while achieving $O(\log n)$ query time. Like the previous
work, our query algorithm returns a compact interval tree representing the
convex hull so that standard binary-search-based queries on the hull can be
performed in $O(\log n)$ time each. Our new result leads to improvements for
several other problems.
</p>
<p>In particular, with the help of the above result, we present new algorithms
for the ray-shooting problem among segments. Given a set of $n$ (possibly
intersecting) line segments in the plane, preprocess it so that the first
segment hit by a query ray can be quickly found. We give a data structure of
$O(n\log n)$ space that can answer each query in $(\sqrt{n}\log n)$ time. If
the segments are nonintersecting or if the segments are lines, then the space
can be reduced to $O(n)$. All these are classical problems that have been
studied extensively. Previously data structures of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$
query time (the notation $\widetilde{O}$ suppresses a polylogarithmic factor)
were known in early 1990s; nearly no progress has been made for over two
decades. For all problems, our results provide improvements by reducing the
space of the data structures by at least a logarithmic factor while the
preprocessing and query times are the same as before or even better.

recourse and dynamic algorithm models. In the online with recourse model,
clients arrive one by one and our algorithm needs to maintain good solutions at
all time steps with only a few changes to the previously made decisions (called
recourse). We show that the classic local search technique can lead to a
$(1+\sqrt{2}+\epsilon)$-competitive online algorithm for facility location with
only $O\left(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon}\log\frac1\epsilon\right)$ amortized
facility and client recourse. We then turn to the dynamic algorithm model for
the problem, where the main goal is to design fast algorithms that maintain
good solutions at all time steps. We show that the result for online facility
location, combined with the randomized local search technique of Charikar and
Guha [10], leads to an $O(1+\sqrt{2}+\epsilon)$ approximation dynamic algorithm
with amortized update time of $\tilde O(n)$ in the incremental setting. Notice
that the running time is almost optimal, since in general metric space it takes
$\Omega(n)$ time to specify a new client's position. The approximation factor
of our algorithm also matches the best offline analysis of the classic local
search algorithm. Finally, we study the fully dynamic model for facility
location, where clients can both arrive and depart. Our main result is an
$O(1)$-approximation algorithm in this model with $O(|F|)$ preprocessing time
and $O(\log^3 D)$ amortized update time for the HST metric spaces. Using the
seminal results of Bartal [4] and Fakcharoenphol, Rao and Talwar [17], which
show that any arbitrary $N$-point metric space can be embedded into a
distribution over HSTs such that the expected distortion is at most $O(\log
N)$, we obtain a $O(\log |F|)$ approximation with preprocessing time of
$O(|F|^2\log |F|)$ and $O(\log^3 D)$ amortized update time.

$f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ is famously characterized (via Yao's minimax) by
the least number of queries needed to distinguish a distribution $D_0$ over
$0$-inputs from a distribution $D_1$ over $1$-inputs, maximized over all pairs
$(D_0,D_1)$. We ask: Does this task become easier if we allow query access to
infinitely many samples from either $D_0$ or $D_1$? We show the answer is no:
There exists a hard pair $(D_0,D_1)$ such that distinguishing $D_0^\infty$ from
$D_1^\infty$ requires $\Theta(R(f))$ many queries. As an application, we show
that for any composed function $f\circ g$ we have $R(f\circ g) \geq
\Omega(\mathrm{fbs}(f)R(g))$ where $\mathrm{fbs}$ denotes fractional block
sensitivity.

    <title>Upper Tail Analysis of Bucket Sort and Random Tries</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1582675200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Ioana O. Bercea, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/e/Even:Guy.html">Guy Even</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10499">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Bucket Sort is known to run in expected linear time when the input keys are
distributed independently and uniformly at random in the interval $[0,1)$. The
analysis holds even when a quadratic time algorithm is used to sort the keys in
each bucket. We show how to obtain linear time guarantees on the running time
of Bucket Sort that hold with very high probability. Specifically, we
investigate the asymptotic behavior of the exponent in the upper tail
probability of the running time of Bucket Sort. We consider large additive
deviations from the expectation, of the form $cn$ for large enough (constant)
$c$, where $n$ is the number of keys that are sorted.
</p>
<p>Our analysis shows a profound difference between variants of Bucket Sort that
use a quadratic time algorithm within each bucket and variants that use a
$\Theta(b\log b)$ time algorithm for sorting $b$ keys in a bucket. When a
quadratic time algorithm is used to sort the keys in a bucket, the probability
that Bucket Sort takes $cn$ more time than expected is exponential in
$\Theta(\sqrt{n}\log n)$. When a $\Theta(b\log b)$ algorithm is used to sort
the keys in a bucket, the exponent becomes $\Theta(n)$. We prove this latter
theorem by showing an upper bound on the tail of a random variable defined on
tries, a result which we believe is of independent interest. This result also
enables us to analyze the upper tail probability of a well-studied trie
parameter, the external path length, and show that the probability that it
deviates from its expected value by an additive factor of $cn$ is exponential
in $\Theta(n)$.

    <title>On the complexity of zero gap MIP*</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1582675200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Mousavi:Hamoon.html">Hamoon Mousavi</a>, Seyed Sajjad Nezhadi, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/y/Yuen:Henry.html">Henry Yuen</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10490">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The class $\mathsf{MIP}^*$ is the set of languages decidable by multiprover
interactive proofs with quantum entangled provers. It was recently shown by Ji,
Natarajan, Vidick, Wright and Yuen that $\mathsf{MIP}^*$ is equal to
$\mathsf{RE}$, the set of recursively enumerable languages. In particular this
shows that the complexity of approximating the quantum value of a non-local
game $G$ is equivalent to the complexity of the Halting problem.
</p>
<p>In this paper we investigate the complexity of deciding whether the quantum
value of a non-local game $G$ is exactly $1$. This problem corresponds to a
complexity class that we call zero gap $\mathsf{MIP}^*$, denoted by
$\mathsf{MIP}^*_0$, where there is no promise gap between the verifier's
acceptance probabilities in the YES and NO cases. We prove that
$\mathsf{MIP}^*_0$ extends beyond the first level of the arithmetical hierarchy
(which includes $\mathsf{RE}$ and its complement $\mathsf{coRE}$), and in fact
is equal to $\Pi_2^0$, the class of languages that can be decided by quantified
formulas of the form $\forall y \, \exists z \, R(x,y,z)$.
</p>
<p>Combined with the previously known result that $\mathsf{MIP}^{co}_0$ (the
commuting operator variant of $\mathsf{MIP}^*_0$) is equal to $\mathsf{coRE}$,
our result further highlights the fascinating connection between various models
of quantum multiprover interactive proofs and different classes in
computability theory.

preserves its pairwise distances. Spanners are commonly applied to compress
computation on metric spaces corresponding to weighted input graphs. Classic
spanner constructions can seamlessly handle edge weights, so long as error is
measured \emph{multiplicatively}. In this work, we investigate whether one can
similarly extend constructions of spanners with \emph{additive} error. These
extensions are not immediate, due to a key lemma about the size of shortest
path neighborhoods that fails for weighted graphs. Despite this, we recover a
suitable amortized version, which lets us prove direct extensions of classic
$+2$ and $+4$ unweighted spanners (both all-pairs and pairwise) to $+2W$ and
$+4W$ weighted spanners, where $W$ is the maximum edge weight. For a technical
reason, the $+6$ unweighted spanner becomes a $+8W$ weighted spanner; closing
this error gap is an interesting remaining open problem.

<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> 	Should everyone be taught coding in high school? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Today we will discuss their recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-all-children-learn-to-code-by-the-end-of-high-school-11582513441">comments</a> on this issue.</p>
<p>
Bob is a long-time friend of mine, so I want to say that that up front. He is a professor of computer science at Princeton. Cuban is an emeritus professor of education at Stanford. Note, I do not know Cuban but will call him Larry—I hope that is fine. Besides what they say in the article, Larry wrote a <a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2017/07/11/coding-the-new-vocationalism-part-1/">three</a>–<a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2017/07/14/coding-the-new-vocationalism-part-2/">part</a> <a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2017/07/17/coding-the-new-vocationalism-part-3/">series</a> in 2017 on his own education blog, while Bob was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/12/11/president-obama-talks-about-teaching-everyone-to-code-this-professor-does-it/">associated</a> with a 2013 White House-led <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/12/obama-code/">initiative</a> on coding in schools.</p>
<p>
The WSJ article consists of ten short paragraphs by Bob followed by eleven from Larry. This is sequential structure—like with statements <img alt="{S_1; S_2;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_1%3B+S_2%3B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_1; S_2;}"/>—or like having candidate town-halls for consectuive hours on CNN and such. What we’d like to see is a debate—like having parallel processes that must sync and communicate. Below we imagine one based on statements in the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Conversation </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The following is a paraphrase that tries to re-structure some of the article in debate format.</p>
<p/><p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<em>Bob:</em> <font color="#000000"> Teaching students to code will help them understand logical thinking and foster creativity.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Larry:</i> <font color="#000000"> You could say the same for teaching writing, math, history, and many other subjects. There is no research that shows that coding is better than other topics in this regard.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Bob:</i> <font color="#000000"> I am not aware of any research that shows that each topic that is taught now is better than coding.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Larry:</i> <font color="#000000"> Yes that is true, but consider how durable core education has been for our society. A century ago, industrial groups pushed the federal government to require vocational training in schools for particular industrial and agricultural skills and to establish separate vocational schools. Those undermined the broader goals of social development and civic engagement.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Bob:</i> <font color="#000000"> Technology is basic to much of society’s issues. Perhaps the Iowa caucus fiasco could have been avoided if they had a better understanding of computing.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Larry:</i> <font color="#000000"> I think the main argument for coding is being pushed by technology CEOs. They need more coders. The educational system should not just do what they need. Do you not agree Bob?</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Bob:</i> <font color="#000000">If we teach coding it seems that it may help in lessening economic and gender based gaps. In summary, in the last millennium, education was based on reading, writing, and arithmetic. Perhaps we should now switch to reading, writing, and computing. Coding includes arithmetic and a whole lot more.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Larry:</i> <font color="#000000"> I agree education should help students achieve their potential. I just do not see that coding will do this. And further, data and projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show only an 11 percent increase in IT jobs, from 4.5 to 5 million, between 2018 and 2028.

    <title>TR20-025 |  Efficient Isolation of Perfect Matching in O(log n) Genus Bipartite Graphs | 

	Chetan Gupta, 

	Vimal Raj Sharma, 

	Raghunath Tewari</title>
    <summary>We show that given an embedding of an O(log n) genus bipartite graph, one can construct an edge weight function in logarithmic space, with respect to which the minimum weight perfect matching in the graph is unique, if one exists. 

As a consequence, we obtain that deciding whether the graph has a perfect matching or not is in SPL. In 1999, Reinhardt, Allender and Zhou proved that if one can construct a polynomially bounded weight function for a graph in logspace such that it isolates a minimum weight perfect matching in the graph, then the perfect matching problem can be solved in SPL. In this paper, we give a deterministic logspace construction of such a weight function.</summary>

    <title>TR20-024 |  Randomized and Symmetric Catalytic Computation | 

	Samir Datta, 

	Chetan Gupta, 

	Rahul Jain, 

	Vimal Raj Sharma, 

	Raghunath Tewari</title>
    <summary>A catalytic Turing machine is a model of computation that is created by equipping a Turing machine with an additional auxiliary tape which is initially filled with arbitrary content; the machine can read or write on auxiliary tape during the computation but when it halts auxiliary tape’s initial content must be restored. In this paper, we study the power of catalytic Turing machines with O(log n)-sized clean tape and a polynomial-sized auxiliary tape.

We introduce the notion of randomized catalytic Turing machine and show that the resulting complexity class CBPL is contained in the class ZPP. We also introduce the notion of symmetricity in the context of catalytic computation and prove that, under a widely believed assumption, in the logspace setting the power of a randomized catalytic Turing machine and a symmetric catalytic Turing machine is equal to a deterministic catalytic Turing machine which runs in polynomial time.</summary>

    <title>TR20-023 |  Non-Malleability against Polynomial Tampering | 

	Eshan Chattopadhyay,

	Marshall Ball, 

	Tal Malkin, 

	Li-Yang Tan</title>
    <summary>We present the first explicit construction of a  non-malleable code that can handle tampering functions that are bounded-degree polynomials. 

Prior to our work, this was only known  for  degree-1 polynomials (affine tampering functions), due to  Chattopadhyay and Li (STOC 2017). As a direct corollary, we obtain an explicit non-malleable code that is secure against tampering by bounded-size arithmetic circuits.

We show applications of our non-malleable code in constructing   non-malleable secret sharing schemes that are robust against bounded-degree polynomial tampering. In fact our result is stronger: we can handle adversaries that can adaptively choose the polynomial tampering function based on initial leakage of a bounded number of shares.

Our results are derived from explicit constructions of  seedless non-malleable extractors that can handle bounded-degree polynomial tampering functions. Prior to our work, no such result was known even for degree-2 (quadratic) polynomials.</summary>

    <title>Two applications of maximum matching</title>
    <summary>This quarter I’m teaching a course on graph algorithms (an upper-division elective, so only around 200 students; our required classes are much bigger) and we’ve reached the part of the course where we discuss matching. Motivating bipartite matching, perfect matching, weighted matching, and stable matching are all easy enough but I wanted a few more examples of applications of non-bipartite maximum-cardinality matching, so I asked my colleague Vijay Vazirani who responded with two cute ones that I wasn’t already familiar with.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This quarter I’m teaching a course on graph algorithms (an upper-division elective, so only around 200 students; our required classes are much bigger) and we’ve reached the part of the course where we discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)">matching</a>. Motivating bipartite matching, perfect matching, weighted matching, and stable matching are all easy enough but I wanted a few more examples of applications of non-bipartite <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/02/22/Maximum cardinality matching">maximum-cardinality matching</a>, so I asked my colleague Vijay Vazirani who responded with two cute ones that I wasn’t already familiar with.</p>

<p>His first suggestion was two-processor scheduling. To keep things simple and concrete let’s assume that we have a collection of equal-length tasks, with a partial ordering (or DAG) describing their timing constraints. If we have one processor to perform them on (or one person to perform them), the obvious solution is to schedule them according to a linear extension of the partial order (a topological ordering of the DAG), allowing them to all be performed with no delays, in total time equal to the number of tasks. But now suppose that there are two processors or people performing the tasks, so we can process two tasks at a time and, ideally, finish twice as quickly. We would like to find a schedule with as many compatible pairs of tasks as we can, saving as many time slots as there are pairs. Two tasks are compatible if they are incomparable in the partial order (there is no path between them in the DAG), so it looks like we simply need to find a maximum matching in the incomparability graph of the partial order. This doesn’t quite work because two matched pairs can “cross”,
unable to both be used in the same schedule because each pair contains an element constrained to be earlier than an element of the other pair. But when this happens, it’s possible to uncross them and get another matching that’s at least as good, eventually reaching a matching without any crossings that can be topologically ordered to give an optimal schedule. The connection between this scheduling problem and matching appears to come from Fujii, Kasami, and Ninamiya, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0117070">Optimal sequencing of two equivalent processors</a>”, <em>SIAM J. Appl. Math.</em> 1969; for fast algorithms for this special case of matching see H. Gabow, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/322326.322335">An almost-linear algorithm for two-processor scheduling</a>”, <em>JACM</em> 1982.</p>

<p>Another application, closer to the real world, comes from a problem of matching kidney donors to kidney donor recipients. But we don’t use the obvious bipartite graph of donors and recipients. Most kidney transplant recipients enter the matching process paired up already with a friend or relative who is willing to donote one of their kidneys, because otherwise there wouldn’t be enough kidneys to go around. But usually these donor-recipient pairs are incompatible with each other, so they need to find another donor-recipient pair such that the donors from each pair are compatible with the recipients from the other pair. Then, all four people get together at the same hospital and trade kidneys. More complicated exchanges of three or more pairs are not done, because that would require simultaneous operations with six or more people and significantly greater chances that one of them will back out at the last minute. So to save as many lives as possible, we need a maximum matching on a graph whose vertices are donor-recipient pairs and whose edges represent double compatibility of pairs. There’s a big literature on kidney exchange but the source for the connection to maximum matching appears to be A. E. Roth, T. Sönmez, and M. U. Ünver, “<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w10698.pdf">Pairwise kidney exchange</a>”, <em>J. Econ. Th.</em> 2005.
If pairwise compatibility is an equivalence relation then the matching part is trivial (it’s just matching in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_graph">disjoint union of cliques</a>) but this framework is flexible enough to handle arbitrary non-transitive compatibility relations.</p>

<p>I learned of the kidney donor matching application a little too late to incorporate it into my introductory lecture on matching, so I used the other one. But next time I’ll be prepared with both!</p>

    <title>TR20-022 |  Interactive Error Resilience Beyond $\frac{2}{7}$ | 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Gillat Kol, 

	Raghuvansh Saxena</title>
    <summary>Interactive error correcting codes can protect interactive communication protocols against a constant fraction of adversarial errors, while incurring only a constant multiplicative overhead in the total communication. What is the maximum fraction of errors that such codes can protect against? 

For the non-adaptive channel, where the parties must agree in advance on the order in which they communicate, Braverman and Rao prove that the maximum error resilience is~$\frac{1}{4}$ (STOC, 2011). Ghaffari, Haeupler, and Sudan (STOC, 2014) consider the {\em adaptive} channel, where the order in which the parties communicate may not be fixed, and give a clever protocol that is resilient to a $\frac{2}{7}$ fraction of errors. This was believed to be optimal. 

We revisit this result, and show how to overcome the $\frac{2}{7}$ barrier. Specifically, we show that, over the adaptive channel, every two-party communication protocol can be converted to a protocol that is resilient to $\frac{7}{24} &gt; \frac{2}{7}$ fraction of errors with only a constant multiplicative overhead to the total communication. The protocol is obtained by a novel implementation of a feedback mechanism over the adaptive channel.</summary>

    <title>TR20-021 |  NP-Hardness of Circuit Minimization for Multi-Output Functions | 

	Rahul Ilango, 

	Bruno Loff, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira</title>
    <summary>Can we design efficient algorithms for finding fast algorithms? This question is captured by various circuit minimization problems, and algorithms for the corresponding tasks have significant practical applications. Following the work of Cook and Levin in the early 1970s, a central question is whether minimizing the circuit size of an explicitly given function is ${NP}$-complete. While this is known to hold in restricted models such as DNFs, making progress with respect to more expressive classes of circuits has been elusive.  

In this work, we establish the first ${NP}$-hardness result for circuit minimization of total functions in the setting of general (unrestricted) Boolean circuits. More precisely, we show that computing the minimum circuit size of a given multi-output Boolean function $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ is ${NP}$-hard under many-one polynomial-time randomized reductions. Our argument builds on a simpler ${NP}$-hardness proof for the circuit minimization problem for (single-output) Boolean functions under an extended set of generators.

Complementing these results, we investigate the computational hardness of minimizing communication. We establish that several variants of this problem are ${NP}$-hard under deterministic reductions. In particular, unless ${P} = {NP}$, no polynomial-time computable function can approximate the deterministic two-party communication complexity of a partial Boolean function up to a polynomial. This has consequences for the class of structural results that one might hope to show about the communication complexity of partial functions.</summary>

    <title>TR20-020 |  Improved Approximate Degree Bounds For $k$-distinctness | 

	Shuchen Zhu, 

	Justin Thaler, 

	Nikhil Mande</title>
    <summary>An open problem that is widely regarded as one of the most important in quantum query complexity is to resolve the quantum query complexity of the $k$-distinctness function on inputs of size $N$. While the case of $k=2$ (also called Element Distinctness) is well-understood, there is a polynomial gap between the known upper and lower bounds for all constants $k&gt;2$. Specifically, the best known upper bound is $O(N^{(3/4)-1/(2^{k+2}-4)})$ (Belovs, FOCS 2012), while the best known lower bound for $k &gt;= 2$ is $\Omega(N^{2/3} + N^{(3/4)-1/(2k)})$ (Aaronson and Shi, J.~ACM 2004; Bun, Kothari, and Thaler, STOC 2018).
For any constant $k &gt;= 4$, we improve the lower bound to $\Omega(N^{(3/4)-1/(4k)})$. This yields, for example, the first proof that $4$-distinctness is strictly harder than Element Distinctness. Our lower bound applies more generally to approximate degree.
As a secondary result, we give a simple construction of an approximating polynomial of degree $O(N^{3/4})$ that applies whenever $k &lt;= polylog(N)$.</summary>

<p>
<em>Dr. Strangelove</em> is the classic 1964 movie about the potential for nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union during the cold war. The film was directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Peter Sellers, George Scott, Sterling Hayden, and Slim Pickens. </p>
<p>
Today we try to explain the P=NP problem in an “analog” fashion.</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a>, US President Merkin Muffley wishes to recall a group of US bombers that are incorrectly about to drop nuclear weapons on Russia. He hopes to stop war. Here is the conversation between General Turgidson played by Scott and Muffley played by Sellers, in which Turgidson informs that the recall message will not be received…</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt><br/>
<b>Turgidson:</b> 	…unless the message is preceded by the correct three-letter prefix. </tt></p><tt>
<p><b>Muffley:</b> 	Then do you mean to tell me, General Turgidson, that you will be unable to 	recall the aircraft? </p>
<p><b>Turgidson:</b> 	That’s about the size of it. However, we are plowing through every possible 	three letter combination of the code. But since there are seventeen thousand 	permutations it’s going to take us about two and a half days to transmit them all. </p>
<p><b>Muffley:</b> 	How soon did you say the planes would penetrate Russian radar cover? </p>
</tt><p><tt><b>Turgidson:</b> 	About eighteen minutes from now, sir.<br/>
</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is the problem that P=NP addresses. How do you find a solution to a problem that has many potential solutions? In this case there are over thousands of possible combinations. Since each requires sending a message to an electronic unit that sits on a plane, thousands of miles away, and since messages cannot be sent too often, it will take much too long to find the secret message. </p>
<p>
The central P=NP question is: Can we do better than trying all possibilities? The answer is yes—at least in the case of the movie, the secret combination is indeed found. More on that in a moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Opening Mechanical Locks </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> the issue is finding the three letter code for a certain device that sits on the bombers. The protocol is: Send a three letter code to the bombers. If the code is correct, then the bombers will be recalled, and all is saved. If the code is wrong, then nothing happens. </p>
<p>
Instead of this, consider the same type of problem for finding the combination to a mechanical lock. That is a lock that is often at a gym, for example, to protect your belongings. Recall you spin the lock’s dial three times to the right, stop on the first number, then turn one time to the left, stop on the second number, and finally go to the right to stop at the third number. Then you pull the lock open.</p>
<p>
This works provided you know the combination. In general there are 64,000 such combinations. So unless you know the numbers, you are in trouble. Trying all possible combinations is not possible for mortals. But there is hope. It is possible to find the combination without knowing it. This is possible provided: <i>You have the combination lock in your hands</i>. </p>
<p>
If you only can send a possible combination to someone else to try, you are out of luck. Unfortunately in Dr. Strangelove the device on the bomber is not in your hands. So as the General says, we are trying all the possible combinations one at a time. But if the device is local you can do better.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Breaking The Locks </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
There are many <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Combination-Locks-Without-a-Code">sites</a> on the web that explain how to do much better. Here is one way to find the first number for a lock:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Pull up gently on the shackle and hold it in place. Turn the dial clockwise listening carefully until you hear the lock click. <p/>
</li><li>
Start with a good deal of pressure and gently let up as you spin it around, until you meet resistance in only one place. It should catch in only one place, making a click. <p/>
</li><li>
Add 5 to that number and write it down.
</li></ol>
<p>
This is the first number in the combination. There are similar methods to get the remaining two numbers. But already you have reduced the choices for the combination from 64,000 by a factor of 40. The rest of the how-to-do rules help you get the remaining two numbers. </p>
<p/><p/>
<table style="margin: auto;">

<p>
Note this attack relies on physical properties of the lock. A lock is made from springs and gears and rods, and is not perfect. As you turn the dial the mechanical parts rub and make noises. These noises reveal information, that is useful to you. Information that can reveal the combination of the lock.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Opening Digital Locks </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The point is that there is a way to open a lock without knowing the combination. Here the trick is that you can try and use the lock and play with it in a way that it reveals information about its secret combination. This is what the P=NP question asks: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Are there ways to manipulate a digital lock and get it to reveal information?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Put another way: <i>Do digital locks make noise?</i> </p>
<p>
Essentially P=NP is true if digital locks all are imperfect, like mechanical locks. That is, if digital locks all make noise. It is widely believed that is <b>false</b>. The belief is that P<img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neq}"/> NP which means that there are essentially perfect digital locks. That is some digital locks make no noise. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> P<img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neq}"/> NP </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Why is it believed that digital locks can be perfect? Well the answer is simple. To date certain types of digital locks have not been broken. That is no one yet knows how to make them click and reveal information. This is of course a dangerous position for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
The failure to break a lock does not mean that someone cleverer cannot break it. <p/>
</li><li>
There are reasons that if some people knew how to break certain digital locks that they would <i>not</i> tell anyone. They might prefer to keep their ability secret to make money or cause harm. <p/>
</li><li>
Finally, it seems dangerous to guess that anything can be done without noise.
</li></ol>
<p>
The latter point is that making systems work perfectly is usually impossible. Mechanical systems must have friction of some kind, and it seems possible that digital systems will also. We will see.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Smart Search </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Colonel Ripper, played by Hayden, is the one that launched the bombers against Russia. The recall code is found and the bombers are recalled. An officer named Mandrake, played by Sellers too, notices some doodles on a pad by the crazy Ripper. It is covered with an interlocking pattern of the words Peace On Earth, and Purity Of Essence. Ripper is obsessed with these ideas—do not ask why.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt><br/>
<b>Mandrake:</b> Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth: <b>P O E</b>.<br/>
Purity of essence. <b>O P E</b>. (whispers) <b>O P E</b>.<br/>
</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is the key. This information is sent to the Pentagon and soon the bombers are recalled. The search space is cut down from thousands to 6 possible orders. Success. Well if you’ve seen the movie, you know it was not exactly success, but that failure has nothing to do with our attempt to explain the P=NP question.</p>
<p>
This second idea is different from whether locks make noise. It is whether every lock has a giveaway by dint of the process by which we obtained that particular lock to begin with. Note that the lock is not the definition of the problem itself, like SAT or graph 3-coloring, but rather a particular instance of the problem. We have discussed how instances of factoring that tend to be generated by algorithms have collective giveaways in an earlier <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/do-gaps-between-primes-affect-rsa-keys/">post</a>—which quotes another part of <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I love the movie <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>, and love any excuse to talk about it. So please forgive me this story about P=NP. I hope that trying to understand the P=NP question without complex notation may help us better understand it. What do you all think?</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: MIP* denotes the class of problems that admit interactive proofs with quantum entangled provers. It has been an outstanding question to characterize the complexity of MIP*. Most notably, there was no known computable upper bound on this class.<br/>
We show that MIP* is equal to the class RE, the set of recursively enumerable languages. In particular, this shows that MIP* contains uncomputable problems. Through a series of known connections, this also yields a negative answer to Connes’ Embedding Problem from the theory of operator algebras. In this talk, I will explain the connection between Connes’ Embedding Problem, quantum information theory, and complexity theory. I will then give an overview of our approach, which involves reducing the Halting Problem to the problem of approximating the entangled value of nonlocal games.<br/>

    <title>Snowflake spanners</title>
    <summary>My previous post gave an example of a largish random point set where the greedy geometric spanner for distance ratio 2 had no crossings, while the spanner for the lower distance ratio had many (linearly many) crossings. And you might think from that example that there is some threshold for which distance ratios above the threshold always have planar greedy spanners, or even that the threshold is at or below 2. But it’s not true.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/02/17/spanners-have-sparse.html">My previous post</a> gave an example of a largish random point set where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_geometric_spanner">greedy geometric spanner</a> for distance ratio 2 had no crossings, while the spanner for the lower distance ratio had many (linearly many) crossings. And you might think from that example that there is some threshold for which distance ratios above the threshold always have planar greedy spanners, or even that the threshold is at or below 2. But it’s not true.</p>

<p>To see why not, we have to turn to an idea from an earlier paper of mine, “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/9907031">Beta-skeletons have unbounded dilation</a>” (<em>CGTA</em> 2002). In it, I used a flattened variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch snowflake fractal</a> to find bad examples for a different kind of spanner, and the same thing works here too. The intuitive idea is that these fractals form curves that, locally, look nice to a spanner algorithm (just connect consecutive pairs of points along the curve). But they pack a lot of length into a small area, forcing the spanner algorithm to eventually add some shortcuts to the curve. If we can control where it adds the shortcuts, maybe we can make pairs of shortcuts cross.</p>

<p>In fact the Koch snowflake itself almost works, but it has some closest pairs that are non-consecutive along the curve, allowing the greedy spanner algorithm to choose those pairs instead of the consecutive curve points that we want it to choose. If we flatten the snowflake just a little bit, that complication goes away. If we choose the distance ratio of the spanner large enough, we can make it so that the greedy spanner algorithm doesn’t add any shortcuts until it reaches pairs of points that are opposite each other on the curve. And if we make it just barely large enough for that to be true, it will be forced to add those shortcuts once it does reach that distance in the sorted ordering of the distances. For instance, here’s a point set and its non-planar greedy spanner generated in this way with spanning ratio 4:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Greedy spanner of snowflake-like curve with distance ratio 4" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/snowflake.svg"/></p>

<p>This pretty picture, with the three crossing shortcuts between opposite pairs of points, doesn’t quite generalize to arbitrary-order snowflake-like curves, unfortunately. It will always be possible to find a distance ratio  such that the greedy algorithm adds one of these three shortcuts, as the first shortcut it needs to add. But then once it has added it, that shortcut can make the other two opposite pairs of points closer to each other in the spanner than they were, so that the greedy algorithm doesn’t need to add them. We might only get one of these three crossing edges, instead of all three. (In fact, for the point set shown here, this is exactly what happens for spanning ratio 4.5.)</p>

<p>Instead, let’s look for a slightly lower distance ratio , for which the first shortcuts added by the greedy spanner algorithm cut off two lobes of the snowflake instead of three. For the same points as above,  works:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Greedy spanner of snowflake-like curve with distance ratio 3.5" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/snowflake2.svg"/></p>

<p>These two-lobe shortcuts are shorter than the three-lobe shortcuts, so they’re considered earlier by the greedy algorithm. There are two crossing equilateral triangles of two-lobe shortcuts (forming a Star of David pattern) and the greedy algorithm has to include two edges from each equilateral triangle. This is because, for each of these potential shortcuts, the greedy spanner won’t include a better path between its endpoints until it has either that shortcut itself or the two other shortcuts of the same triangle. No matter which two shortcuts we choose from each of the two equilateral triangles, we get either two crossings or, as here, three crossings.</p>

<p>For any order of flattened Koch snowflake, there’s a distance ratio  producing a greedy spanner that looks like this picture, with two or three crossings. And by choosing a snowflake of high-enough order, we can make  become arbitrarily large. Or, to put it another way, the greedy spanner algorithm can generate crossings for arbitrarily large distance ratios.</p>

    <title>TR20-019 |  A note on the explicit constructions of tree codes over polylogarithmic-sized alphabet | 

	Siddharth Bhandari, 

	Prahladh Harsha</title>
    <summary>Recently, Cohen, Haeupler and Schulman gave an explicit construction of binary tree codes over polylogarithmic-sized output alphabet based on Pudl\'{a}k's construction of maximum-distance-separable (MDS)  tree codes using totally-non-singular triangular matrices. In this short note, we give a unified and simpler presentation of Pudl\'{a}k and Cohen-Haeupler-Schulman's constructions.</summary>
