David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven are computational mathematicians. They have just released a <a href="https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~davidharvey/papers/nlogn/">paper</a> showing how to multiply two <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-bit integers in <img alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n\log n)}"/> time. A companion <a href="http://www.texmacs.org/joris/ffnlogn/ffnlogn-abs.html">paper</a> gives details of a simpler second algorithm that is <img alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n\log n)}"/> time pending a widely-believed conjecture about primes.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss what makes these new results possible.</p>
<p>
The first paper leads off with a nice history of algorithms that beat the <img alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n^2)}"/>-time method all of us learned in school. Far from being <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/galactic-algorithms/">galactic</a>, the longtime-champion <img alt="{O(n\log n \log\!\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n+%5Clog%5C%21%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n\log n \log\!\log n)}"/> algorithm of Arnold Schönhage and Volker Strassen is a workhorse of the GNU Multiple Precision Library (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library">GMP</a>). The <img alt="{\log\!\log n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%5C%21%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\log\!\log n}"/> factor was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furer's_algorithm">improved</a> by Martin Fürer in 2007 and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3360?context=cs">further</a> in 2014 by Harvey and van der Hoeven with Grégoire Lecerf. Now it is gone altogether.</p>
<p>
Their algorithm is currently not practical, but it is also not yet tuned. At the start of section 5, they note that their estimates take effect for <img alt="{n \geq 2^{d^{12}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+2%5E%7Bd%5E%7B12%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n \geq 2^{d^{12}}}"/> where they use <img alt="{d = 1,\!729}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd+%3D+1%2C%5C%21729%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d = 1,\!729}"/>. When they note that <img alt="{2^{d^{12}} &gt; 2^{4,\!096}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bd%5E%7B12%7D%7D+%3E+2%5E%7B4%2C%5C%21096%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{d^{12}} &gt; 2^{4,\!096}}"/> they don’t mean the numbers need at least <img alt="{4,\!096}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%2C%5C%21096%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{4,\!096}"/> bits, rather <img alt="{2^{4,\!096}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B4%2C%5C%21096%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{4,\!096}}"/> is the number of bits. Since there are only <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27259/how-many-particles-are-in-the-entire-universe/">about</a> <img alt="{2^{270}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B270%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{270}}"/> particles in the observable universe, this puts the term <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/galactic-algorithms/">galactic</a> to shame. </p>
<p>
The number <img alt="{1,\!729}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5C%21729%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1,\!729}"/> recalls a famous <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hardy-RamanujanNumber.html">story</a> about Godfrey Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan. This is not wholly a coincidence. They get a bounding multiplier of <img alt="{36}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B36%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{36}"/> from one place, another factor of <img alt="{6}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{6}"/> from another, and finally a factor of <img alt="{8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{8}"/> giving <img alt="{1,\!728}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5C%21728%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1,\!728}"/> which equals <img alt="{12^3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B12%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{12^3}"/>. Then they just make <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> be higher by <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, setting up <img alt="{1,\!729 = 12^3 + 1^3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5C%21729+%3D+12%5E3+%2B+1%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1,\!729 = 12^3 + 1^3}"/> which happens to equal <img alt="{9^3 + 10^3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B9%5E3+%2B+10%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{9^3 + 10^3}"/>. But there is much flex in the choices and they sketch how to improve the needed bound from <img alt="{1,\!728}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5C%21728%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1,\!728}"/> to just <img alt="{8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{8}"/>. They also uncover some new tricks for calculating in certain large finite rings defined via multi-variable polynomials.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Polynomials and Tricks </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
When we heard the news on Tuesday, both of us thought of the famous primality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">test</a> of Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena (AKS), which placed deciding primality into deterministic polynomial time. We stated the message as the title of an old <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/02/26/polynomials-are-easier-than-integers/">post</a> on other joint work by Kayal: “Polynomials Are Easier Than Integers.” </p>
<p>
The crux of the AKS test is to employ the theorem that for any co-prime <img alt="{(a,N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2CN%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(a,N)}"/>, the polynomial congruence relation </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (x + a)^N \equiv x^N + a \pmod{N} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x+%2B+a%29%5EN+%5Cequiv+x%5EN+%2B+a+%5Cpmod%7BN%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  (x + a)^N \equiv x^N + a \pmod{N} "/></p>
<p>holds in <img alt="{\mathbb{Z}[x]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Bx%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{Z}[x]}"/> if and only if <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> is prime. This is tested in the quotient ring <img alt="{\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^r - 1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Bx%5D%2F%28x%5Er+-+1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^r - 1)}"/>. The game becomes finding <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> small enough and minimizing the number of <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a}"/> that need to be checked in order for the body of tests in the quotient ring to be conclusive. </p>
<p>
We take time to note that the case <img alt="{a = N-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+N-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a = N-1}"/> is possibly sufficient while testing a small set of <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>. Agrawal has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrawal's_conjecture">conjectured</a> that if <img alt="{(x - 1)^N \equiv x^N - 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x+-+1%29%5EN+%5Cequiv+x%5EN+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(x - 1)^N \equiv x^N - 1}"/> modulo both <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> and <img alt="{x^r - 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Er+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x^r - 1}"/> then either <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> is prime or <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> divides <img alt="{N^2 - 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%5E2+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N^2 - 1}"/>. This conjecture is <a href="https://aimath.org/WWN/primesinp/primesinp.pdf">doubted</a> on heuristic counting grounds but it has been verified for <img alt="{N &lt; 10^{12}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3C+10%5E%7B12%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N &lt; 10^{12}}"/> and can be <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/008.pdf">modified</a> by including the case <img alt="{a = 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a = 2}"/>. It would improve the polynomial time in the number <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> of bits in <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> from <img alt="{\tilde{O}(n^6)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E6%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\tilde{O}(n^6)}"/> to <img alt="{\tilde{O}(n^3)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\tilde{O}(n^3)}"/> and also improve the constants. We mention this because Harvey and van der Hoeven have a number-theoretic conjecture that (as shown in their companion paper) improves both their constant on <img alt="{n\log n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n\log n}"/> and the simplicity of the proof.</p>
<p>
The further message of the new papers is added power from giving the polynomials more variables. They use <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> variables: <img alt="{x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bd-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}}"/> plus a nominal <img alt="{x_d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x_d}"/> that is later substituted by <img alt="{e^{\pi i/r} y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7B%5Cpi+i%2Fr%7D+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e^{\pi i/r} y}"/>. Here <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> is a certain power of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/> and combined with the <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/>-th variable <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> to build the base ring <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> of complex polynomials in <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> modulo <img alt="{y^r + 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%5Er+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y^r + 1}"/>. The other variables are used to mod out by <img alt="{(x_1^{t_1} - 1,\dots,x_{d-1}^{t_{d-1}} - 1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x_1%5E%7Bt_1%7D+-+1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bd-1%7D%5E%7Bt_%7Bd-1%7D%7D+-+1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(x_1^{t_1} - 1,\dots,x_{d-1}^{t_{d-1}} - 1)}"/> where the <img alt="{t_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t_i}"/> are powers of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/> no higher than <img alt="{2r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2r}"/>. Operations in quotient rings of this type are especially efficient. They are used to emulate operations in <img alt="{\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^s - 1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Bx%5D%2F%28x%5Es+-+1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^s - 1)}"/> where <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/> is a product of primes <img alt="{s_1\cdots s_d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_1%5Ccdots+s_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s_1\cdots s_d}"/> that are near powers of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/>. The emulation is done via the isomorphism</p>

They start with Schönhage and Strassen’s original trick of splitting the two <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-bit integers into <img alt="{\Theta(\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CTheta%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Theta(\log n)}"/>-sized pieces so that the problem reduces to multiplying polynomials of degree <img alt="{\Theta(n/\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CTheta%28n%2F%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Theta(n/\log n)}"/> in <img alt="{\mathbb{Z}[x]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Bx%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{Z}[x]}"/> with coefficients of <img alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\log n)}"/> size. They use the <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/>-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform over <img alt="{\mathbb{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{C}}"/> with complex operations that need only <img alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\log n)}"/> bits of precision individually. This setting also gives leeway for approximative methods in their final algorithm. But first we describe what was evidently their original strategy.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Recursive Strategy </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Their first task in either case is to find <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/>-many distinct primes <img alt="{s_1,\dots,s_d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cs_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s_1,\dots,s_d}"/> of order <img alt="{(n/\log n)^{1/d}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2F%5Clog+n%29%5E%7B1%2Fd%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(n/\log n)^{1/d}}"/> in magnitude. Now when <img alt="{d = 1,\!729}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd+%3D+1%2C%5C%21729%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d = 1,\!729}"/> the exponent <img alt="{1/d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Fd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1/d}"/> makes the primes quite small indeed, and the need to find distinct ones already drives <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> up quite high before their algorithm can even go into effect. Moreover, for the approximation to work, the primes need to be congruent to <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> modulo <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>. </p>
<p>
Their original strategy—detailed in the companion paper—builds on a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1448407">result</a> of Charles Rader to reduce the DFT computation to multiplications in </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_1^{s_1 - 1} - 1,\dots,x_d^{s_d - 1} - 1), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_d%5D%2F%28x_1%5E%7Bs_1+-+1%7D+-+1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_d%5E%7Bs_d+-+1%7D+-+1%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_1^{s_1 - 1} - 1,\dots,x_d^{s_d - 1} - 1), "/></p>
<p>where compared to (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#CRT">1</a>) they have reduced the exponents by one. Using <img alt="{s_i \equiv 1 \pmod{r}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_i+%5Cequiv+1+%5Cpmod%7Br%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s_i \equiv 1 \pmod{r}}"/>, they next reduce this to multiplications in </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_1^{r} - 1,\dots,x_d^{r} - 1). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_d%5D%2F%28x_1%5E%7Br%7D+-+1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_d%5E%7Br%7D+-+1%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_1^{r} - 1,\dots,x_d^{r} - 1). "/></p>
<p>Then the above-mentioned substitution of <img alt="{x_d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x_d}"/> by <img alt="{e^{\pi i/r} y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7B%5Cpi+i%2Fr%7D+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e^{\pi i/r} y}"/> makes them into products over </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  R[x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}]/(x_1^{t_1} - 1,\dots,x_{d-1}^{t_{d-1}} - 1) \qquad\text{with}\qquad R = \mathbb{C}[y]/(y^r + 1). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++R%5Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bd-1%7D%5D%2F%28x_1%5E%7Bt_1%7D+-+1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bd-1%7D%5E%7Bt_%7Bd-1%7D%7D+-+1%29+%5Cqquad%5Ctext%7Bwith%7D%5Cqquad+R+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5By%5D%2F%28y%5Er+%2B+1%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  R[x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}]/(x_1^{t_1} - 1,\dots,x_{d-1}^{t_{d-1}} - 1) \qquad\text{with}\qquad R = \mathbb{C}[y]/(y^r + 1). "/></p>
<p>These last products are at last amenable to the usual Fast Fourier Transform trick of applying FFT for each <img alt="{t_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t_i}"/> by pretending that <img alt="{y^{2r/t_i}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%5E%7B2r%2Ft_i%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y^{2r/t_i}}"/> is a primitive <img alt="{t_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t_i}"/>-th root of unity, multiplying pointwise in <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/>, and doing the inverse FFT. Finally the products in <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> can be converted into <img alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\log n)}"/>-bit integer products, and this sets up the vast recursion from multiplying the original <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-bit integers to a batch of <img alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\log n)}"/>-bit ones. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Finding Good Primes </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In order for the recursion to solve to <img alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n\log n)}"/>, they need the values <img alt="{q_i = (s_i - 1)/r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_i+%3D+%28s_i+-+1%29%2Fr%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q_i = (s_i - 1)/r}"/> to be not too large. Viewing this task from the bottom up, they want to choose a single value <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> and choose small <img alt="{q_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q_i}"/> such that <img alt="{s_i = rq_i + 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_i+%3D+rq_i+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s_i = rq_i + 1}"/> is prime. Since <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> is a power of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/>, there is some resemblance to the harder task of finding Sophie Germain primes, which are also relevant to the AKS algorithm. In this case, however, all they need is a sufficiently small <img alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0}"/> such that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For all coprime <img alt="{a,k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Ck%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a,k}"/> with <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> sufficiently large, there is a prime <img alt="{q &lt; k^{1+\epsilon}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq+%3C+k%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q &lt; k^{1+\epsilon}}"/> such that <img alt="{q \equiv a \pmod{k}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq+%5Cequiv+a+%5Cpmod%7Bk%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q \equiv a \pmod{k}}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This is, however, only known for “<img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/>” <img alt="{= 4.18}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3D+4.18%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{= 4.18}"/> and the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is only known to improve the bound to <img alt="{k^{2+\delta}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E%7B2%2B%5Cdelta%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k^{2+\delta}}"/> for any <img alt="{\delta &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta &gt; 0}"/>. The above is conjectured to hold for any <img alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0}"/> but it hasn’t been proved. They currently need it for <img alt="{\epsilon = 1/303}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3D+1%2F303%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon = 1/303}"/>.</p>
<p>
The companion paper uses the conjecture to improve multiplication in the field <img alt="{\mathbb{F}_{p^\ell}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_%7Bp%5E%5Cell%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{F}_{p^\ell}}"/> to time <img alt="{O(n\ell \log(p)(\log(n) + \log(\ell) + \log\!\log(p))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Cell+%5Clog%28p%29%28%5Clog%28n%29+%2B+%5Clog%28%5Cell%29+%2B+%5Clog%5C%21%5Clog%28p%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n\ell \log(p)(\log(n) + \log(\ell) + \log\!\log(p))}"/>. This uses a single algorithm over any prime <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> and power <img alt="{\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell}"/>; of course if they are fixed, then this time likewise becomes <img alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n\log n)}"/>. This currently needs <img alt="{\epsilon = 1/2^{1,\!162}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3D+1%2F2%5E%7B1%2C%5C%21162%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon = 1/2^{1,\!162}}"/>. </p>
<p>
The companion <a href="http://www.texmacs.org/joris/ffnlogn/ffnlogn-abs.html">paper</a> has full details of how all this works and many more numerical tricks than we’ve mentioned—a <em>tour de force</em>. Getting the result for integer multiplication unconditionally, however, requires one more major tool in their arsenal. To use it they set up the primes <img alt="{s_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s_i}"/> to be slightly below respective powers of 2 <img alt="{t_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t_i}"/> (rather than be above a single power of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/> <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> by the aforementioned factors <img alt="{q_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q_i}"/>) while retaining <img alt="{t_1\cdots t_d = O(s_1 \cdots s_d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_1%5Ccdots+t_d+%3D+O%28s_1+%5Ccdots+s_d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t_1\cdots t_d = O(s_1 \cdots s_d)}"/>. </p>
<p>
Their innovation compared to the translations in the first strategy is that one can still reduce the DFT computation in dimensions <img alt="{s_1,\dots,s_d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cs_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s_1,\dots,s_d}"/> needing <img alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\log n)}"/> precision to a complex DFT in dimensions <img alt="{t_1,\dots,t_d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ct_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t_1,\dots,t_d}"/> by employing approximation. Their algorithm is completely deterministic but it employs weights that conform to Gaussian distributions to effect the approximation. The preservation of Gaussians under Fourier transforms enables close enough approximations to be obtained by solving relatively small and easily-specified systems of linear equations. The resulting complex DFT is then massaged in a manner similar to the first strategy. The resulting recursion is not quite as steep—it goes from <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> to <img alt="{n' = n^{1/d + o(1)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%27+%3D+n%5E%7B1%2Fd+%2B+o%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n' = n^{1/d + o(1)}}"/>—but it gives </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  M(n) = \frac{Kn}{n'} M(n') + O(n\log n) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++M%28n%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BKn%7D%7Bn%27%7D+M%28n%27%29+%2B+O%28n%5Clog+n%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  M(n) = \frac{Kn}{n'} M(n') + O(n\log n) "/></p>

This gives <img alt="{M(n) = O(n\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%28n%29+%3D+O%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M(n) = O(n\log n)}"/>. The approximation technique does not work for multiplication in <img alt="{\mathbb{F}_{p^\ell}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_%7Bp%5E%5Cell%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{F}_{p^\ell}}"/>, however. As usual, here is where we say to consult the papers for further details—there is a wealth of them.</p>

graphs that change over time (i.e., are presented as a dynamic stream of edge
updates) over the past few years, starting with the work of Ahn, Guha and
McGregor (SODA'12) on graph connectivity via sketching. In this paper we
consider the problem of designing spectral approximations to graphs, or
spectral sparsifiers, using a small number of linear measurements, with the
additional constraint that the sketches admit an efficient recovery scheme.
</p>
<p>Prior to our work, sketching algorithms were known with near optimal $\tilde
O(n)$ space complexity, but $\Omega(n^2)$ time decoding (brute-force over all
potential edges of the input graph), or with subquadratic time, but rather
large $\Omega(n^{5/3})$ space complexity (due to their reliance on a rather
weak relation between connectivity and effective resistances). In this paper we
first show how a simple relation between effective resistances and edge
connectivity leads to an improved $\widetilde O(n^{3/2})$ space and time
algorithm, which we show is a natural barrier for connectivity based
approaches. Our main result then gives the first algorithm that achieves
subquadratic recovery time, i.e. avoids brute-force decoding, and at the same
time nontrivially uses the effective resistance metric, achieving
$n^{1.4+o(1)}$ space and recovery time.
</p>
<p>Our main technical contribution is a novel method for `bucketing' vertices of
the input graph into clusters that allows fast recovery of edges of high
effective resistance: the buckets are formed by performing ball-carving on the
input graph using (an approximation to) its effective resistance metric. We
feel that this technique is likely to be of independent interest.

graphs in the single pass dynamic streaming model. We provide a linear
sketching based solution that given a stream of edge insertions and deletions
to a $n$-node undirected graph, uses $\tilde O(n)$ space, processes each update
in $\tilde O(1)$ time, and with high probability recovers a spectral sparsifier
in $\tilde O(n)$ time. Prior to our work, state of the art results either used
near optimal $\tilde O(n)$ space complexity, but brute-force $\Omega(n^2)$
recovery time [Kapralov et al.'14], or with subquadratic runtime, but
polynomially suboptimal space complexity [Ahn et al.'14, Kapralov et al.'19].
</p>
<p>Our main technical contribution is a novel method for `bucketing' vertices of
the input graph into clusters that allows fast recovery of edges of
sufficiently large effective resistance. Our algorithm first buckets vertices
of the graph by performing ball-carving using (an approximation to) its
effective resistance metric, and then recovers the high effective resistance
edges from a sketched version of an electrical flow between vertices in a
bucket, taking nearly linear time in the number of vertices overall. This
process is performed at different geometric scales to recover a sample of edges
with probabilities proportional to effective resistances and obtain an actual
sparsifier of the input graph.
</p>
<p>This work provides both the first efficient $\ell_2$-sparse recovery
algorithm for graphs and new primitives for manipulating the effective
resistance embedding of a graph, both of which we hope have further
applications.

unbounded computational time but can only investigate a small part of the graph
by adaptive edge queries. We determine (up to logarithmic factors) the number
of queries necessary both for detecting the presence of a planted clique and
for finding the planted clique.
</p>
<p>Specifically, let $G \sim G(n,1/2,k)$ be a random graph on $n$ vertices with
a planted clique of size $k$. We show that no algorithm that makes at most $q =
o(n^2 / k^2 + n)$ adaptive queries to the adjacency matrix of $G$ is likely to
find the planted clique. On the other hand, when $k \geq (2+\epsilon) \log_2 n$
there exists a simple algorithm (with unbounded computational power) that finds
the planted clique with high probability by making $q = O( (n^2 / k^2) \log^2 n
+ n \log n)$ adaptive queries. For detection, the additive $n$ term is not
necessary: the number of queries needed to detect the presence of a planted
clique is $n^2 / k^2$ (up to logarithmic factors).

    <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Facility Location on Random Shortest Path Metrics</title>

Therefore,
approximation algorithms are often used to solve large instances. Such
algorithms often perform much better than worst-case analysis suggests.
Therefore, probabilistic analysis is a widely used tool to analyze such
algorithms. Most research on probabilistic analysis of NP-hard optimization
problems involving metric spaces, such as the facility location problem, has
been focused on Euclidean instances, and also instances with independent
(random) edge lengths, which are non-metric, have been researched. We would
like to extend this knowledge to other, more general, metrics.
</p>
<p>We investigate the facility location problem using random shortest path
metrics. We analyze some probabilistic properties for a simple greedy heuristic
which gives a solution to the facility location problem: opening the $\kappa$
cheapest facilities (with $\kappa$ only depending on the facility opening
costs). If the facility opening costs are such that $\kappa$ is not too large,
then we show that this heuristic is asymptotically optimal. On the other hand,
for large values of $\kappa$, the analysis becomes more difficult, and we
provide a closed-form expression as upper bound for the expected approximation
ratio. In the special case where all facility opening costs are equal this
closed-form expression reduces to $O(\sqrt[4]{\ln(n)})$ or $O(1)$ or even
$1+o(1)$ if the opening costs are sufficiently small.

    <title>TR19-045 |  On the Fine-grained Complexity of Least Weight Subsequence in Graphs | 

	Jiawei Gao</title>
    <summary>Least Weight Subsequence (LWS) is a type of highly sequential optimization problems with form $F(j) = \min_{i &lt; j} [F(i) + c_{i,j}]$. They can be solved in quadratic time using dynamic programming, but it is not known whether these problems can be solved faster than $n^{2-o(1)}$ time. Surprisingly, each such problem is subquadratic time reducible to a highly parallel, non-dynamic programming problem [KPS17]. In other words, if a "static"  problem is faster than quadratic time, so is an LWS problem. For many instances of LWS, the sequential versions are equivalent to their static versions by subquadratic time reductions. The previous result applies to LWS on linear structures, and this paper extends this result to LWS on paths in sparse graphs. When the graph is a multitree (i.e. a DAG where any pair vertices can have at most one path) or when the graph is a DAG whose underlying undirected graph has constant treewidth, we show that LWS on this graph is still subquadratically reducible to their corresponding static problems. For many instances, the graph versions are still equivalent to their static versions.

Moreover, this paper shows that on these graphs, property testing of form $\exists x \exists y (\text{TC}_E(x,y) \wedge P(x,y))$ is subquadratically reducible to property testing of form $\exists x \exists y P(x,y)$, where $P$ is a property checkable in time linear to the sizes of $x$ and $y$, and $\text{TC}_E$ is the transitive closure of relation $E$. Furthermore, when $P$ is definable by a first-order logic formula with at most one quantified variable, then the above two problems are equivalent to each other by subquadratic reductions.</summary>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Problems arising from analyzing and understanding graph structures have motivated the development of many powerful tools for storing and compressing graphs and networks. Many, if not most, of these massive graphs are accumulations of updates over time. Maintaining updates and queries on dynamically changing graphs more efficiently than recomputing from scratch is a well-studied topic, with several important open problems related to global, optimization related queries.</p>
<p>We study dynamic graph algorithms for maintaining spectral vertex sparsifiers with respect to a subset of terminal vertices. Such sparsifiers preserve key structures in spectral algorithms, including effective resistances (which can be viewed as a numerical generalization of connectivity), solutions to systems of Laplacian linear equations, and energy of electrical flows between terminal vertices. We give data structures that maintain, in sublinear time, these sparsifiers under insertions/deletions of edges, as well as terminal additions.</p>
<p>This primitive in turn leads to sublinear time data structures for key primitives in spectral graph algorithms, including ones at the core of the “Laplacian paradigm” for designing graph optimization algorithms. In particular, we obtain <img alt="O(m^{4/3}\epsilon^{-4})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%5E%7B4%2F3%7D%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-4%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(m^{4/3}\epsilon^{-4})"/> time per query/update for effective resistances on unweighted graphs, and <img alt="O(n^{11/12}\epsilon^{-5})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B11%2F12%7D%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-5%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(n^{11/12}\epsilon^{-5})"/> time per query/update for implicit access to linear system solutions, where <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\epsilon"/> is the relative approximation accuracy.</p>
<p>The majority of the talk will focus on key components of this data structure: (1) an interpretation of vertex sparsifiers as a sum of random walks, (2) a suitable choice of terminals to keep these walks local, and (3) maintenance of local walks and numerical solutions. Potential avenues in generalizing these techniques to provide new building blocks for dynamic graph algorithms will also be discussed.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>To me, one of the best things about working in theoretical computer <br/>science has always the exciting rate of progress we make as a community. <br/>On (what appears to be) a regular basis, we produce breakthroughs on <br/>problems that are absolutely fundamental to our field. Problems that <br/>often look impossible to tackle, right up until someone actually tackles <br/>them.</p>



<p>However, as inspiring as all these developments were to me, I also <br/>always felt that we, as a community, could do more to properly recognize <br/>and highlight them, both internally and to the outside world. This kind <br/>of outreach would make it easier for us to capitalize on the <br/>breakthroughs as well as to accelerate the impact of the underlying <br/>ideas on the other areas of computer science, and beyond.</p>



<p>Fortunately, this is about to change!</p>



<p>One of the first decisions of our newly (re-)elected <a href="https://www.sigact.org/">SIGACT committee</a> was to create a committee (as committees are wont to do <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> whose mission will be to help  promote top computer science theory research. This <strong>SIGACT Research Highlights Committee</strong> – consisting of <a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/">Boaz Barak</a>, <a href="https://omereingold.wordpress.com/">Omer Reingold</a>,  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marywootters/">Mary Wootters</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/">myself</a> – will, in particular, work to identify results to be recommended for consideration for the <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/">CACM </a>Research Highlights section as well  as other general-audience research outlets in computer science and other  fields.</p>



<p>Of course, to do a proper job here we require your help! To this end, <br/>the committee solicits two types of nominations:</p>



<p>1) Conference nominations. Each year, the committee will ask the PC <br/>chairs of a broad set of theoretical computer science conferences to <br/>send a selection of up to three top papers from these conferences <br/>(selected based on both their technical merit and the potential <br/>significant interest to non-theory audiences) and forwarding them to the <br/>committee for consideration.</p>



<p>2) Community nominations. The committee will accept nominations from the  members of the community. Each such nomination should summarize the  contribution of the nominated (and recently published) paper and also <br/>argue why this paper particularly merits a broader outreach. The <br/>nomination should be no more than a page in length and can be submitted <br/>at any time by emailing it to <a href="mailto:sigact.cacm.nominations@gmail.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">sigact.cacm.nominations@gmail.com</a>. <br/>Self-nominations are discouraged.</p>



<p>To be considered in the upcoming round of our deliberations, we need to <br/>receive your nomination by <strong>April 30</strong>.</p>



<p>Looking forward to learning about all the new exciting research that you <br/>all are doing!

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
 After 22 years in the United States, 19 of which spent in the San Francisco Bay Area, this Summer I will move to Milan to take a job at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocconi_University">Bocconi University</a>.</p>
<p>
Like a certain well-known Bay Area institution, Bocconi is a private university that was endowed by a rich merchant in memory of his dead son. Initially characterized by an exclusive focus on law, economics and business, it has had for a while a high domestic recognition for the quality of teaching and, more recently, a good international profile both in teaching and research. Despite its small size, compared to Italy’s giant public universities, in 2017 Bocconi was the Italian university which had received the most ERC grants during the first ten years of existence of the European Research Council (in second place was my Alma Mater, the Sapienza University of Rome, which has about nine times more professors) <a href="https://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/03/07/news/in_bocconi_i_fuoriclasse_della_ricerca-159919972/">(source)</a>.</p>
<p>
About three years ago, Bocconi started planning for a move in the space of computing, in the context of their existing efforts in <a href="http://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home">data science</a>. As a first step, they recruited <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/riccardozecchina/home">Riccardo Zecchina</a>. You may remember Riccardo from his work providing a non-rigorous calculation of the threshold of random 3-SAT, his work on the “survey propagation” algorithm for SAT and other constraint satisfaction problems, as well as other work that brought statistical physics techniques to computer science. Currently, Riccardo and his group are doing very exciting work on the theory of deep learning.</p>
<p>
Though I knew of his work, I had never met Riccardo until I attended a 2017 workshop at the Santa Fe Institute on <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/events/thermodynamics-and-computation-towards-new-synthes">“Thermodynamics and computation,”</a> an invitation that I had accepted on whim, mostly based on the fact that I had never been to New Mexico and I had really liked Breaking Bad. Riccardo had just moved to Bocconi, he told me about their future plans, and he asked me if I was interested. I initially politely declined, but one thing led to another, and now here I am putting up my San Francisco house for sale.</p>
<p>
Last August, as I was considering this move, I applied for an <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2018/07/31/erc-vs-nsf/">ERC grant</a> from the European Union, and I just learned that the <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-2018-advanced-grants-results">grant has been approved</a>. This grant is approximately the same amount as the total of all the grants that I have received from the NSF over the past twenty years, and it will support several postdoc positions, as well as visitors ranging from people coming for a week to give a talk and meet with my group to a full-year sabbatical visit.</p>
<p>
 Although it’s a bit late for that, I am looking for postdocs starting as early as this September: if you are interested please contact me. The postdoc positions will pay a highly competitive salary, which will be free of Italian income tax (<s>although American citizens will owe federal income tax to the IRS</s> correction: American citizens would not owe anything to IRS either). As a person from Rome, I am not allowed to say good things about Milan or else I will have to return my Roman card (it’s kind of a NY versus LA thing), but I think that the allure of the city speaks for itself.</p>
<p>
Likewise, if you are a senior researcher, and you have always wanted to visit me and work together on spectral methods, approximation algorithms, graph theory or graph algorithms, but you felt that Berkeley had insufficiently many Leonardo mural paintings and opera houses, and that it was too far from the Alps, then now you are in luck!</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Dagstuhl I got a few ideas for future posts but then...<br/>
<br/>
We had some discussions about STOC allowing program committee members to submit papers that I planned to post about. But then Suresh wrote a <a href="http://blog.geomblog.org/2019/03/on-pc-submissions-at-soda-2020.html">fine post</a> on the same issue for SODA. My thoughts: PC members should not submit--no matter how you try to avoid the conflict of interest, there will always be a cloud on the process. Suresh suggest blind reviews that other non-theory conferences use, but I prefer the tiered PC system. It's fine to have PC members submit papers if the top of the tier, a senior PC or the PC chairs, makes the final calls.<br/>
<br/>
I was also going to post about Yann LeCun's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10152719972317143&amp;id=722677142">Facebook rant</a> about stodgy CS departments but then Yann goes ahead and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/technology/turing-award-ai.html">wins a Turing award</a> with Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio for their work on machine learning. I knew Yann from when we worked together at NEC Research in the early 2000's and let's just congratulate him and the others and let them bask in glory for truly transforming how we think of computing today. I'll get back to his post soon enough.</div>

    <title>TR19-044 |  DEEP-FRI: Sampling Outside the Box Improves Soundness | 

	Eli Ben-Sasson, 

	Lior Goldberg, 

	Swastik Kopparty, 

	Shubhangi Saraf</title>
    <summary>Motivated by the quest for scalable and succinct zero knowledge arguments, we revisit worst-case-to-average-case reductions for linear spaces, raised by [Rothblum, Vadhan, Wigderson, STOC 2013]. The previous state of the art by [Ben-Sasson, Kopparty, Saraf, CCC 2018] showed that if some member of an affine space $U$ is $\delta$-far in relative Hamming distance from a linear code $V$ — this is the worst-case assumption — then most elements of $U$ are almost-$\delta$-far from $V$ — this is the average case. However, this result was known to hold only below the “double Johnson” function of the relative distance $\delta_V$ of the code $V$ , i.e., only when $\delta &lt; 1 ? (1 ? \delta_V)^{1/4}$.
First, we increase the soundness-bound to the “one-and-a-half Johnson” function of $\delta_V$ and show that the average distance of $U$ from $V$ is nearly $\delta$ for any worst-case distance $\delta$ smaller than $1 ? (1 ? \delta_V)^{1/3}$. This bound is tight, which is somewhat surprising because the one-and-a-half Johnson function is unfamiliar in the literature on error correcting codes.
To improve soundness further for Reed Solomon codes we sample outside the box. We suggest a new protocol in which the verifier samples a single point $z$ outside the box $D$ on which codewords are evaluated, and asks the prover for the value at $z$ of the interpolating polynomial of a random element of $U$. Intuitively, the answer provided by the prover “forces” it to choose one codeword from a list of “pretenders” that are close to $U$. We call this technique Domain Extending for Eliminating Pretenders (DEEP).
The DEEP method improves the soundness of the worst-case-to-average-case reduction for RS codes up their list decoding radius. This radius is bounded from below by the Johnson bound, implying average distance is approximately $\delta$ for all $\delta &lt; 1 ? (1 ? \delta_V)^{1/2}$. Under a plausible conjecture about the list decoding radius of Reed-Solomon codes, average distance from $V$ is approximately $\delta$ for all $\delta$. The DEEP technique can be generalized to all linear codes, giving improved reductions for capacity-achieving list-decodable codes.
Finally, we use the DEEP technique to devise two new protocols:
• An Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for RS codes, called DEEP-FRI. This soundness of the protocol improves upon that of the FRI protocol of [Ben-Sasson et al., ICALP 2018] while retaining linear arithmetic proving complexity and logarithmic verifier arithmetic complexity.
• An Interactive Oracle Proof (IOP) for the Algebraic Linking IOP (ALI) protocol used to construct zero knowledge scalable transparent arguments of knowledge (ZK-STARKs) in [Ben-Sasson et al., eprint 2018]. The new protocol, called DEEP-ALI, improves soundness of this crucial step from a small constant $&lt; 1/8$ to a constant arbitrarily close to $1$.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was delighted (and not at all surprised) to hear that this year’s Turing Award will go to <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/">LeCun, Hinton, and Bengio</a> for their work on deep learning.</p>
<p>Like public-key cryptography, deep learning was ahead of its time when first studied, but, thanks to the pioneering efforts of its founders, it was ready to be used when the technology caught up. </p>
<p>Mathematical developments take a long time to mature, so it is essential that applied mathematical research be done ahead of the time of its application, that is, at a time when it is basic research. Maybe quantum computing will be the next example to teach this lesson.</p>
<p>By the way, this summer the Simons Institute will host a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019">program on the foundations of deep learning</a>, co-organized by Samy Bengio.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is not just the practical applications of a mathematical advance that take time to develop: the same can be true even for its <i>theoretical</i> applications! Which brings me to the next announcement of this post, namely that the call for nominations for the <a href="http://focs2019.cs.jhu.edu/tota/">FOCS test of time award</a> is out. Nominations are due in about four weeks.</p></div>

Call for Papers:

Workshop on Behavioral Economics and Computation
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/behavioralec/">https://sites.google.com/view/behavioralec/</a>
June 28, 2019, Phoenix, AZ
In conjunction with the 20th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation 
(ACM EC '19)

SUBMISSIONS DUE May 1, 2019, 11:59pm PDT.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We solicit research contributions and participants for The 1st
Workshop on Behavioral Economics and Computation, to be held in
conjunction with the 20th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation 
(ACM EC '19). The workshop will bring together researchers and
practitioners from diverse subareas of EC, who are interested in the 
intersection of human economic behavior and computation, to share new 
results and to discuss future directions for behavioral research 
related to economics and computation. It will be a full-day workshop, 
and will feature invited speakers, contributed paper presentations and 
a panel discussion.

The gap between rationality-based analysis that assumes utility-maximizing 
agents and the actual human behavior in the real world has been well 
recognized in economics, psychology and other social sciences. In recent 
years, there has been a growing interest in conducting behavioral research 
across many of the sub-areas related to economics and computation to 
address this gap. In one direction, some of these studies leverage insights 
on human decision making from behavioral economics and social psychology 
literature to study economic and computational systems with human users. 
In the other direction, computational tools are used to study and gain 
insights on human behavior and a data-driven approach is sometimes used to 
learn behavior models from user-generated data.

The Behavioral EC workshop aims to bring together researchers and 
practitioners from diverse fields, including but not limited to computer 
science, economics, psychology and sociology, to exchange ideas related to 
behavioral research in economics and computation. In addition to sharing new 
results, we hope the workshop will foster a lively discussion of future 
directions and methodologies for behavioral research related to economics 
and computation as well as fruitful cross-pollination of behavioral 
economics, cognitive psychology and computer science. 

We welcome studies at the intersection of economic behavior and computation 
from a rich set of theoretical, experimental and empirical perspectives. The 
topics of interest for the workshop are behavioral research in all settings 
covered by EC, including but not limited to:

Behavioral mechanism design and applied mechanism design
Empirical studies of economic behavior
Boundedly-rational models of economic decision making
Model evaluation and selection based on behavioral data
Online prediction markets, experiments, and crowdsourcing platforms
Hybrid human-machine systems
Models and experiments about social considerations (e.g. fairness) in 
decision making 
Methods for behavioral EC: information aggregation, probability elicitation, 
quality control


Submission Instructions
=======================

Submission deadline: May 1, 2019, 11:59pm PDT.

Notification: May 20, 2019

We will give priority to new (unpublished) research papers, but will 
also consider ongoing research and recently published papers that may 
be of interest to the workshop audience. For submissions of published 
papers, authors must clearly state the venue of publication. Papers 
will be reviewed for relevance, significance, originality, research 
contribution, and likelihood to catalyze discussion. The workshop will 
not have archival proceedings but will post accepted papers on the 
workshop website. Position papers and panel discussion proposals are also 
welcome. At least one author of each accepted paper will be expected 
to attend and present their findings at the workshop.

Submissions can be in any format and can be up to 18 pages long (plus 
a title page and excluding appendices that can be arbitrarily long). We 
recommend the format of the EC submissions. The limit of 18 pages on 
the main body is an upper bound, and papers can be significantly shorter. 

Submissions should be uploaded to the submission server no later 
than May 1, 2019, 11:59pm PDT.

    <title>On PC submissions at SODA 2020</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SODA 2020 (in SLC!!) is experimenting with a new submission guideline: PC members will be allowed to submit papers. I had a conversation about this with Shuchi Chawla (the PC chair) and she was kind enough (thanks Shuchi!) to share the guidelines she's provided to PC members about how this will work.<br/><br/>  <br/><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">SODA is allowing PC members (but not the PC chair) to submit papers this year. To preserve the integrity of the review process, we will handle PC member submissions as follows.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">1. PC members are required to declare a conflict for papers that overlap in content with their own submissions (in addition to other CoI situations). These will be treated as hard conflicts. If necessary, in particular if we don't have enough confidence in our evaluation of a paper, PC members will be asked to comment on papers they have a hard conflict with. However, they will not have a say in the final outcome for such papers. </span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">2. PC submissions will receive 4 reviews instead of just 3. This is so that we have more confidence on our evaluation and ultimate decision.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">3. We will make early accept/reject decisions on PC members submissions, that is, before we start considering "borderline" papers and worrying about the total number of papers accepted. This is because the later phases of discussion are when subjectivity and bias tend to creep in the most.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">4. In order to be accepted, PC member submissions must receive no ratings below "weak accept" and must receive at least two out of four ratings of "accept" or above.</span>  </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">5. PC member submissions will not be eligible for the best paper award.</blockquote><br/>My understanding is that this was done to solve the problem of not being able to get people to agree to be on the PC - this year's PC has substantially more members than prior years.<br/><br/>And yet....<br/><br/>Given all the discussion about conflicts of interest, implicit bias, and double blind review, this appears to be a bizarrely retrograde move, and in fact one that sends a very loud message that issues of implicit bias aren't really viewed as a problem. As one of my colleagues put it sarcastically when I described the new plan:<br/><br/><blockquote class="tr_bq">"why don't they just cut out the reviews and accept all PC submissions to start with?"</blockquote>and as another colleague pointed out:<br/><br/><blockquote class="tr_bq">"It's mostly ridiculous that they seem to be tying themselves in knots trying to figure out how to resolve COIs when there's a really easy solution that they're willfully ignoring..."</blockquote><br/>Some of the arguments I've been hearing in support of this policy frankly make no sense to me.<br/><br/>First of all, the idea that a more heightened scrutiny of PC papers can alleviate the bias associated with reviewing papers of your colleagues goes against basically all of what we know about implicit bias in reviewing. The most basic tenet of human judgement is that we are very bad at filtering our own biases and this only makes it worse. The one thing that theory conferences (compared to other venues) had going for them regarding issues of bias was that PC members couldn't submit papers, but now....<br/><br/>Another claim I've heard is that the scale of SODA makes double blind review difficult. It's hard to hear this claim without bursting out into hysterical laughter (and from the reaction of the people I mentioned this to, I'm not the only one).  Conferences that manage with double blind review (and PC submissions btw) are at least an order of magnitude bigger (think of all the ML conferences). Most conference software (including easy chair) is capable of managing the conflicts of interest without too much trouble. Given that SODA (and theory conferences in general) are less familiar with this process, I’ve recommended in the past that there be a “workflow chair” whose job it is to manage the unfamiliarity associated with dealing the software. Workflow chairs are common at bigger conferences that typically deal with 1000s of reviewers and conflicts.<br/><br/>Further, as a colleague points out, what one should really be doing is "aligning nomenclature and systems with other fields: call current PC as SPC or Area Chairs, or your favorite nomenclature, and add other folks as reviewers. This way you (i) get a list of all conflicts entered into the system, and (ii) recognize the work that the reviewers are doing more officially as labeling the PC members. "<br/><br/><br/>Changes in format (and culture) take time, and I'm still hopeful that the SODA organizing team  will take a lesson from <a href="https://algo2019.ak.in.tum.de/index.php/menue-esa/esa-call">ESA 2019</a>  (and their own resolution to look at DB review more carefully that was passed a year or so ago) and consider exploring DB review. But this year's model is certainly not going to help.<br/><div><br/><b>Update: </b><a href="https://twitter.com/stevemblackburn/status/1111068299796705280?s=20">Steve Blackburn outlines how PLDI handles PC submissions</a> (in brief, double blind + external review committee)<br/><br/><b>Update: </b><a href="https://md.ekstrandom.net/blog/2019/03/anonymous-reviewing">Michael Ekstrand</a> takes on the question that Thomas Steinke asks in the comments below: "How is double blind review different from fairness-through-blindness?".<br/></div><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheGeomblog/~4/PTrXNVY99dg" width="1"/></div>

    <title>Random Thoughts on the admissions scandal</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In light of the recent academic scandal I am going to list ways I've heard to help get your kid into college and thoughts on how ethical they are (hint: bribing a coach to claim your kid is on the rowing team is not ethical).<br/>
<br/>
1) Your kid likes (1) helping the homeless and (2)  Ramsey Theory and (3)  helping the homeless learn Ramsey Theory. Or perhaps they like  rowing or Latin or fencing or Pig Latin or....  Great! encourage them, get them books and tutors,  and whatever they need. You have an eye towards how this will look on for college admissions; however, it is your kids choice as to what they like. Also note that these activities are in addition to doing well in school, SATs, etc, not instead of it.  Perfectly ethical, though I note that this avenue is not open to poor families and in some cases even middle class families.<br/>
<br/>
2) Item 1 is the extreme on a spectrum in terms of how much are the extra things the kid does there idea OR planned by you to GET INTO A GOOD COLLEGE. This item will be the other extreme, but realize there is a continuum (actually I doubt there are a continuum number of options here, but there are many in between. Maybe its omega + omega*.) You have heard that being on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_boxing">chess boxing</a> teams is good on a college application so you TELL YOUR KID that they  likes both Chess AND Boxing and should be on the team. You also hear this about being on the fencing team and knowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">pig latin</a>, so your kid can taunt their opponents like this:<br/>
<br/>
youah, aint-kay ence-fay orth-way eans-bay<br/>
<br/>
This might not be as bad as it sounds if the kid learns to like Chess-Boxing.  But it may be worse than it sounds if the kid rebels against all of this and becomes a crack whore.<br/>
<br/>
Is this ethical? It may be bad for the kid, but it may push him into things he ends up liking. One drawback: you've HEARD that being on the chess boxing team is good for college admissions, but is it true?<br/>
<br/>
And again, not open to some families.<br/>
<br/>
3) Item 2 (or even 1) but with an addition: Hire a college adviser to help you. Someone who knows (or claims to know) what colleges look for- Trombone, Latin, Chess-boxing, whatever. Still ethical but I again worry about the kids future rehab bills.<br/>
<br/>
4) Here is where it gets murky. The college adviser helps:<br/>
<br/>
a) Polish the kids essay (my parents, who are both in English, helped polish my essay to get into graduate school (I don't recall if there was one for ugrad). They told me to use lots of `ing' words so it sounds like I am actively doing things. They also helped me figure out when recursion-theoretic is hyphenated. I got into Harvard but not MIT, so make of that what you will.) Polishing, proofreading, that could be okay. But it can slip into b or c below.<br/>
<br/>
b) The adviser (or the parents) talk to the kids to find out what to write, but then writes it. Maybe the kid proofreads and polishes. Maybe not even. The adviser is  a ghostwriter. Clearly unethical but the line between helping-to-polish and adviser-wrote-it is again a continuum.<br/>
<br/>
c) Adviser writes it and it is completely fictional. I once heard a rumor that a particular sample of an essay to get into med school was used  by several  med school applicant. Gee,they can't all have gotten inspired by watching their grandfather in his pajamas die of cancer. This is awful of course, but I wonder- what if the student writes a fictional essay all by themselves! Some combination of how much the essay is true and how much help you got on it is unethical. But some might be okay. Is it bad to polish stories that are basically true to make them flow more easily?  Prob not. But there is a 2-dim continuum based on both accuracy and how much help the student got.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note- how much does the personal statement matter for admissions? I suspect that if an elite school gets LOTS of REALLY QUALIFIED applicants, the essay may be all that distinguishes them.So it can be important. I also wonder if people on admissions can tell if an essay is not written by the applicant. Or maybe if there is an interview that can help detect it.<br/>
<br/>
5) Parents give X amount of money to the college and the kid gets in. This is talked about a lot though I don't know how common it is for someone NOT qualified to GET IN based on money. College admissions has many factors so its not quite so clear cut what NOT qualified means. Even so, if seems odd that this is not in any way shape or form illegal. It IS transparent, so I guess thats a plus. The argument I've heard is that the money is used for scholarships to fund students who get in but can't afford to go. I do not know if this is true. And this one  is only available to the top Z %, not sure what Z is, but there are people who can do 1,2,3,4 who can't do 5. I would call this unethical though colleges don't seem to think so. Or they do but they do it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
6) Before I list the current scandal I want to list another issue: having a psychologist (or whoever it is who judges these things) say your kid is Learning Disabled so they get more time on the SATs. Perhaps bribing them, or perhaps its understood what you want.  Again, I do not know how common this is.  An alternative if you can't afford some of the above options, or done in conjunction with a lot of the above options.<br/>
<br/>
7) The current scandal. Obviously unethical. A few things I wonder about:<br/>
<br/>
a) One story was that they bribed someone to say their daughter was Learning Disabled and had to take the SAT (or whatever it was) in a separate room, making it easier to change the answers to the correct ones.  So twice unethical.<br/>
<br/>
b) Some of the students  were clearly NOT qualified.<br/>
<br/>
c) A parent does unethical things to get the kid into college.<br/>
<br/>
The kid later lies to the parents about their grades or their plans<br/>
<br/>
The parents are SHOCKED that their kids lie and wonder where the learned such behaviour!<br/>
<br/>
8) Actually Item 2 --Parent has kid do things to plan to get into college-- is interesting for another reason. Are you your resume?<br/>
<br/>
Imagine that Alice helps the homeless her Sophmore year in High School NOT because she cares about the homeless but because its good for college admissions.<br/>
<br/>
Alice goes on to do other things that look good for college, NOT because she likes them or cares, but just to get into a good college.<br/>
<br/>
She gets into an elite college<br/>
<br/>
Did they take her in the hope she would KEEP doing these things or because she is the KIND OF PERSON who does these things?<br/>
<br/>
And it gets weirder- she DOES keep doing these things since she's heard its good for Business School (disclaimer- I do not know if its good for B-school)<br/>
<br/>
More generally, she keeps doing things she doesn't care about to advance. So her outward self really is doing good deeds and such, but her heart is not in it. So if her college or B-school or Job hired her because she DOES these things, that is NOT a lie. If they hired her because they want this KIND OF PERSON then... its a lie but I'm not sure what to make of that.<br/>
<br/>
9) Is there ANY reason to have legacy matter for admissions? This seems like the dumbest and most easily fixed aspect of the whole process.  I have never heard a good argument for it. Ever.<br/>
<br/>
10) College Sports--- that's an entire blog post or book all by itself, so I won't go there.<br/>
<br/>
11) One can argue whether helping the homeless, or being on the rowing team, or teaching the homeless how to row, should matter for college anyway. But lets assume that its legit to want people at your college who have lead interesting lives. So charity work or sports might be a MEASURE of that. But beware Goodhart's law:<br/>
<br/>
                         <i> When a measure becomes a target is ceases to be a measure.</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
The recent scandal is Goodhart's law on steroids.<br/>
(NOTE- I had in earlier version `Goodwin's law' but a commenter corrected me and reminded me that Goodwin's law is that if an internet discussion goes on long enough someone will be compared to Hitler. I wonder if that also applies in discussions by Nazi's.)<br/>
<br/>
12) Does getting into an Elite College really increase your income or happiness (these are two very different questions) over the course of your life? I do not know-- if you do, please comment.<br/>
<br/>
13) (ADDED LATER) A commenter pointed out that one could also go to a school outside of  the USA that values proficiency in the chosen discipline over the items above. Excellent question that raises a few more:<br/>
<br/>
Do schools outside of the USA hold Americans (or for that matter any non-citizen of their country) to a higher standard for admissions? I ask non-rhetorically.<br/>
<br/>
If you get a degree from outside of the USA will that help or hurt your job prospects in the USA? Of course this depends on the school you goto, but even with that I do not know the answer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <title>TR19-043 |  Nondeterministic and Randomized Boolean Hierarchies in Communication Complexity | 

	Toniann Pitassi, 

	Morgan Shirley, 

	Thomas Watson</title>
    <summary>We study the Boolean Hierarchy in the context of two-party communication complexity, as well as the analogous hierarchy defined with one-sided error randomness instead of nondeterminism. Our results provide a complete picture of the relationships among complexity classes within and across these two hierarchies. In particular, we prove a query-to-communication lifting theorem for all levels of the Boolean Hierarchy and use it to resolve an open problem stated in the paper by Halstenberg and Reischuk (CCC 1988) which initiated this topic.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h2>Short Presburger arithmetic is hard!</h2>
<p>This is a belated report on a remarkable breakthrough from 2017. The paper is <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/hard_presburger3.pdf">Short Presburger arithmetic is hard</a>, by Nguyen and Pak.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/ngoyen.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17213" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/ngoyen.jpg?w=640"/></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Danny Nguyen</span></strong></p>
<h3>Integer programming in bounded dimension: Lenstra’s Theorem</h3>
<p>Algorithmic tasks are often intractable. But there are a few miracles where efficient algorithms exist: Solving systems of linear equations, linear programming, testing primality,  and solving integer programming problems when the number of variables is bounded. The last miracle is a historic 1983 theorem of Hendrik Lenstra (Here <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/presentations/Lenstra81.pdf">is the paper</a>) and it is the starting point of this post.</p>
<p><strong>Lensra’s theorem:</strong> Consider a system of linear inequalities</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Ax ≤ b</em></h3>
<p>where <img alt="x=(x_1,x_2,\dots x_k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%28x_1%2Cx_2%2C%5Cdots+x_k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x=(x_1,x_2,\dots x_k)"/> is a vector of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="k"/> variables, <em>A</em> is an integral <em>k</em> by <em>n</em> matrix and <em>b</em> is an integral vector of length <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>Let <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="k"/> be a fixed integer. There is a polynomial time algorithm to determine if the system has an integral solution.</p>
<p>Of course, the full Integer Programming problem when <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="k"/> is part of the input, is <strong>NP-complete</strong>. This problem came already (second in Karp’s list!) in<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs172/karp.pdf"> the Mayflower of NP-complete problems –  Karp’s paper</a>.</p>
<p>Sasha Barvinok famously showed in 1993 that even counting the number of solutions is in <strong>P</strong>. (Barvinok utilized the short generating function approach pioneered by Brion, Vergne and others.)</p>
<h3>Kannan’s theorem</h3>
<p>Next,  I want to describe an amazing 1990 theorem of Ravi Kannan,</p>
<p>Kannan’s theorem considers formulas with one quantifier alternation in the Presburger arithmetic and it asserts that when the number of variables is fixed,  there is a polynomial time algorithm to decide if the formula is satisfiable.</p>
<p>(Here is a free version of <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/kannan/Papers/forall.pdf">Kannan’s paper</a>.) Also here the counting problems were tackled with great success. Barvinok and Kevin Woods remarkably showed <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2003-16-04/S0894-0347-03-00428-4/S0894-0347-03-00428-4.pdf">how to count projections of integer points in a (single) polytope in polynomial time</a>, and subsequently Woods <a href="http://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/kwoods/research/Presburger_full.pdf">extended this approach</a> to general Presburger expressions Φ with a fixed number of inequalities!</p>
<p>An important strengthening was achieved by Friedrich Eisenbrand and  Gennady Shmonin in the 2008 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4336">Parametric integer programming in fixed dimension</a>. See also the survey chapter by Barvinok <a href="https://www.csun.edu/~ctoth/Handbook/chap7.pdf">Lattice points and lattice polytopes</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the formulation of Kannan’s theorem in full generality a little further but let me present now a special case related to the famous Frobenius coin problem. (See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/finite-state-automata-binary-decision-diagrams-and-presburger-arithmetic/">this post on GLL</a> for more on Presburger arithmetic)</p>
<h3>Frobenius coin problem</h3>
<p>Given <em>k</em> coins with integral values, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem">Frobinius coin problem</a> is to determine the largest integer that cannot be described as positive integer combinations of the values of the coins. (See also <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/04/30/congrats-ravi-kannan/">this post</a> on GLL.)</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Kannan):</strong> There is a polynomial time algorithm to solve the Frobenius coin problem for every fixed number of coins.</p>
<p>The issue of the way theory meets practice for the problems discussed in this post is very interesting but we will not discuss it. Let me remark that Herb Scarf (who along with Kannan played a role in B-L (Before Lenstra) developments) offered another approach for the solution of the Frobenius coin problem and related IP (Integer Programming)  problems based on his theory of maximal lattice-free convex bodies. See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/ann-lehmans-sculpture-based-on-herb-scarfs-maximal-lattice-free-convex-bodies/">this related post</a>.</p>
<h3>More than one quantifier</h3>
<p>Given the result of Kannan and later that of Barvinok and Woods, many people expected that also for two alternations, or even for any other fixed number of alternations, Presburger arithmetic would be in polynomial time. Nguyen and Pak proved that the problem is <strong>NP-complete</strong> already for two quantifier alternations! Here is the link to the paper <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/hard_presburger3.pdf">Short Presburger arithmetic is hard</a>. Igor Pak’s homepage has a few other <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/research.htm#ip">related papers</a>.</p>
<p>Let me bring here Sasha Barvinok’s <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/PA-Barv-rev.pdf">MathSciNet featured review</a> of Nguyen and Pak’s paper which tells the story better than I could.</p>
<h2>Barvinok’s featured review to Nguyen and Pak’s paper</h2>
<p>Presburger arithmetic allows integer variables, integer constants, Boolean operations (&amp;, ∧, ¬), quantifiers (∃, ∀), equations and inequalities (=, &lt;, &gt;, ≤, ≥), addition and subtraction (+, −) and multiplication by integer constants. It does not allow multiplication of variables (if we allow multiplication of variables, we get Peano arithmetic).</p>
<p>Geometrically, a quantifier-free formula of Presburger arithmetic describes the set of integer points in a Boolean combination of rational polyhedra (that is, in the set obtained from finitely many rational polyhedra by taking unions, intersections and complements). Similarly, a formula of Presburger arithmetic with existential quantifiers only describes the set of integer points obtained from the set of integer points in a Boolean combination of polyhedra by a projection along some coordinates.</p>
<p>Unlike Peano arithmetic, Presburger arithmetic is decidable. Here the authors zoom in on the computational complexity of Presburger arithmetic, once the combinatorial complexity of the formula is bounded in advance. If we fix the number of variables, the validity of a formula with no quantifier alternations (that is, of the type ∃<img alt="x_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_1"/> . . . ∃<img alt="x_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_k"/>Φ(<img alt="x_1, \dots , latex x_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+latex+x_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_1, \dots , latex x_k"/>) or of the type ∀<img alt="x_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_1"/> . . . ∀<img alt="x_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_k"/>Φ(<img alt="x_1, \dots , x_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_1, \dots , x_k"/>)) can be established in polynomial time by Lenstra’s integer programming algorithm [see H. W. Lenstra Jr., Math. Oper. Res. 8 (1983), no. 4, 538–548; MR0727410].</p>
<p>For a fixed number of variables, formulas with one quantifier alternation (∃<img alt="x_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_1"/> . . . ∃<img alt="x_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_k"/>∀<img alt="y_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="y_1"/> . . . ∀<img alt="y_m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="y_m"/>Φ(<img alt="x_1, \dots , x_k, y_1, \dots , y_m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_k%2C+y_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+y_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_1, \dots , x_k, y_1, \dots , y_m"/>)) can also be solved in polynomial time, as shown by R. Kannan [in Polyhedral combinatorics (Morristown, NJ, 1989), 39–47, DIMACS Ser. Discrete Math. Theoret. Comput. Sci., 1, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 1990; MR1105115]. The decision procedure can be characterized as a polynomial time algorithm for parametric integer programming.</p>
<p>Suppose now that we fix the number of variables and the number of Boolean operations in advance (and hence get what is called a short formula of Presburger arithmetic). Thus the only parameters of the formula are the numerical values of the constants in the formula. The authors show that deciding validity becomes <strong>NP-complete</strong> if one allows<br/>
two quantifier alternations. Remarkably, they present an example of a formula</p>
<p>∃z ∈ <img alt="\mathbb Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb Z"/> ∀y ∈ <img alt="\mathbb Z^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb Z^2"/> ∃x ∈ <img alt="\mathbb Z^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb Z^2"/> Φ(x, y, z)</p>
<p>with an <strong>NP-complete</strong> decision problem, even though Φ contains at most 10 inequalities.<br/>
Another remarkable example is an <strong>NP-complete</strong> decision problem for a formula of the<br/>
type</p>
<p>∃z ∈ <img alt="\mathbb Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb Z"/> ∀y ∈ <img alt="\mathbb Z^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb Z^2"/> ∃x ∈ <img alt="\mathbb Z^6" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z%5E6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb Z^6"/>: <em>Ax + By + Cz ≤ b,  </em></p>
<p>with at most 24 inequalities.</p>
<p>As the number of quantifier alternations is allowed to increase, the computational complexity in the polynomial hierarchy also moves up. The authors also describe the computational complexity of corresponding counting problems.</p>
<p>The proof is very clever; it uses the continued fraction expansion of a rational number to encode a growing family of intervals, with the help of which the authors build an <strong>NP-complete</strong> problem.</p>

<p>The deadline was approaching without mercy and there was, of course, still some polishing to be done for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482.67">our SODA paper</a>. But then we run into an issue. To make things worse, this issue turned out to be a hard one, a fundamental known open problem in computational geometry. The good thing is, I liked the problem so much that I decided to dedicate it this post. This is the story about the Sum of Square Roots problem and how we bypassed (ignored) it without solving it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} --></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything began in the haze of the 70's of the last millennium. It is nebulous who stumbled first upon this enigma. <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/small-dist.html">Some say</a> that Ron Graham has discussed the problem in public lectures, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2321488">some others</a> say that Joseph O'Rourke has posed it as an open question in the American Mathematical Monthly, while <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/P33.html">some others</a> suspect that the problem had been already hiding in older different formulations. However, it is a historical fact that one shinny/cloudy day, three computer scientists finished polishing a manuscript that became a classical paper known as "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/800113.803626">Some NP-complete geometric problems</a>". In this paper, Michael Garey, Ron Graham and David Johnson showed the NP-hardness of two important problems in geometric metrics: Steiner Tree and Traveling Salesman. For the Euclidean plane, they showed only NP-hardness as they did not manage to show that these problems are contained in NP. Moreover, they accentuated that we cannot even rule out that the decision version of Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree is outside of NP. What a seeming paradox given that we can compute such a minimum tree in polynomial time! So, whom did they blame? The short answer: The Euclidean metric. Garey and his coauthors explain that all these problems have a common hidden issue: They rely on comparing Euclidean lengths, that is, they rely on comparing irrational numbers based on square roots. Whereas this task is trivial if we just want to compare two line segments (e.g. by comparing the radicands), the problem starts when we want to compare two polygonal paths. Even assuming rational (or, after scaling, integer) coordinates, this problem translates into a question that is fundamental in computational geometry: Given two lists of integers, <em>a<sub>1</sub></em> ... and <em>b<sub>1</sub></em> ..., can we decide whether "<em>∑ √a<sub>i</sub> ≥ ∑ √b<sub>i</sub></em>" in P? Put into words: <strong>Can we efficiently compare two sums of square roots over integers?</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-1076"/></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} --></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To emphasize the significance of this question, let me cite <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/P33.html">David Eppstein</a>: "A major bottleneck in proving NP-completeness for geometric problems is a mismatch between the real-number and Turing machine models of computation: one is good for geometric algorithms but bad for reductions, and the other vice versa. Specifically, it is not known on Turing machines how to quickly compare a sum of distances (square roots of integers) with an integer or other similar sums, so even (decision versions of) easy problems such as the minimum spanning tree are not known to be in NP."</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} --></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Is this problem computable at all?" - might the curious reader ask after realizing that the approach of iteratively increasing the precision until the first difference in digits will never terminate if both numbers happen to be equal. Luckily, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0747-7171(85)80013-4">Allan Borodin et al.</a> and <a href="https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/18449">Johannes Blömer</a> showed that polynomial time is enough to decide whether two such sums have the same value. Therefore, it is astonishing that the problem of deciding the sign of their difference, a question that seems only slightly harder, has been only recently spotted by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/070697926">Eric Allender et al</a> on an island of the counting hierarchy CH (3rd level) located in the wide ocean of PSPACE. Thus, it is still far far away from the needle head of P, where <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.44.5325">Gregorio Malajovich</a> conjectured it to live. Until this will be shown, <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/4053/sum-of-square-roots-hard-problems">Jeff Erickson</a> proposes to study which problems are (<a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/4053/sum-of-square-roots-hard-problems">non-boringly</a>) Σ√-hard.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} --></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, if we could only sufficiently bound the difference of the sums from below! Then we could bound from above the precision required to determine the correct sign of the difference: Just image that <em>B</em> is such a lower bound on the difference. Now, take a precision that allows us to compute an approximate difference being only <em>B/2</em> away from the real one. Then it is easy to verify that the following procedure determines the correct sign: Output the sign of the approximate difference if it is outside of <em>[-B/2,B/2]</em>, otherwise output <em>0</em>. What is the run time of this procedure? It is proportional to the precision, which corresponds to the length of <em>B</em>, that is, to <em>-log B</em>. Hence, if <em>-log B</em> is bounded from above by a polynomial in the length of the input, then we are in P! So, is there any reasonable lower bound for the worst case? That is, <strong>what is the smallest positive difference between any two sums of <em>k</em> square roots of integers of size at most <em>n</em>?</strong> Welcome to <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/P33.html">Problem 33</a> of <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/Welcome.html">The Open Problems Project</a>! Let <em>r(n,k)</em> denote such a minimum difference as a function of <em>n</em> and <em>k</em>. For instance, consider <em>n=20</em> and <em>k=2</em>. Then <em>r(n,k)</em> is roughly <em>0.0002</em> and it is attained by <em>√{10} + √{11} - √{5} - √{18}</em>. As being an open problem, there is no tight bound known for <em>r(n,k)</em>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2006.05.002">Jianbo Qian and Cao An Wang</a> as well as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2011.06.014">Qi Cheng and Yu-Hsin Li</a> proved(*) that there are sums where <em>-log r(n,k)</em> is at least in the order of magnitude of <em>k log n</em>. However, these lower bounds constitute an exponentially gap to the best known upper bounds which are <em>O(2<sup>2k</sup> log n)</em> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s004530010005">Christoph Burnikel et al.</a>(**)] and <em>2<sup>O(n/log n)</sup></em> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2011.06.014">Qi Cheng et al.</a>]. So, maybe you, dear reader, will be the one to close the gap?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} --></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dramatic opening of this post, I mentioned <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482.67">our paper</a>, where the problem of Sum of Square Roots appeared. There, we design a PTAS for the Traveling Salesman problem (TSP) with hyperplane neighborhoods, that is, we look for a <em>(1+ε)</em>-approximation of a minimum-length tour that, instead of points, visits a given set of hyperplanes in ℝ<sup><em>d</em></sup> with <em>d</em> being fixed. The basis of our algorithm is an integer grid of constant size (depending on <em>ε</em> and <em>d</em>). Our key observation is that there is a translation and scaling of the grid such that snapping an (adequately sparsified) optimum solution to the grid results in a <em>(1+ε</em>)-approximation. Using this insight, we let our algorithm enumerate all (reasonable) TSP tours lying in our integer grid. With a simple LP, we translate and scale each tour such that it visits all the hyperplanes of the input whilst minimizing its tour length (i.e., the scaling factor). At the end, we obtain a set of feasible TSP tours and output the shortest one. And here we were confronted with the Sum of Square Roots problem. Which of the tours is the shortest one? Was all our work devastated, all our blood, sweat and tears in vain? Just because the very last line of our algorithm had unknown complexity? Our solution was simple: We just skipped the issue and our paper got accepted. Why? Well, the issue wasn't one for the following three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We could be lazy and assume the real RAM computational model with constant time for square root operations (as often done in computational geometry).</li>
<li>We could be industrious and approximate the real tour lengths with a sufficiently small error since we look anyway for an approximation in overall.</li>
<li>We could think and then realize that our candidate tours consist of only constant many vertices as our integer grid has constant size. Indeed, the best known lower bound on the difference <em>r(n,k)</em> implies the following nice take-away which shall conclude this epilogue:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We can compare two sums of square roots in polynomial time if the number of square roots is constant!</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">-------------------------</p>
<p>Proof sketches for the interested reader of the lower and upper bounds on <em>r(n,k)</em>:</p>
<p>(*) <em>Ω(k log n)</em> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2011.06.014">Cheng et al.</a>]: The interval <em>[k, k √{n}]</em> contains so many distinct sums of square roots (over square-free integers) that, by a pigeonhole argument, there are two sums with very small distance.</p>
<p>(**) <em>O(2<sup>2k</sup> log n)</em> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s004530010005">Burnikel et al.</a>]: The difference is an algebraic integer and, consequently, the root of a polynomial with integer coefficients and degree at most <em>2<sup>2k</sup></em>. A simple inequality yields the bound.</p>

Karen Uhlenbeck is a mathematician who has won a number of awards in the past and has just now been announced as winner of the 2019 Abel Prize. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to explain a tiny bit about what Uhlenbeck did.<br/>
<span id="more-15698"/></p>
<p>
The Abel Prize <a href="http://www.abelprize.no/c73996/seksjon/vis.html?tid=74013">citation</a> says that Uhlenbeck won for</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “pioneering achievements in geometric partial differential equations, gauge theory, and integrable systems, and for the fundamental impact on analysis, geometry and mathematical physics.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
A <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/karen-uhlenbeck-uniter-of-geometry-and-analysis-wins-abel-prize-20190319/">story</a> in <em>Quanta</em> and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soap-bubble-pioneer-is-first-woman-to-win-prestigious-math-prize/">another</a> in <em>Scientific American</em> are among those with readable summaries of the general nature of this work. The latter describes Uhlenbeck’s discovery with the mathematician Jonathan Sacks of a phenomenon called <em>bubbling</em> as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Sacks and Uhlenbeck were studying ‘minimal surfaces,’ the mathematical theory of how soap films arrange themselves into shapes that minimize their energy. But the theory had been marred by the appearance of points at which energy appeared to become infinitely concentrated. Uhlenbeck’s insight was to “zoom in” on those points to that this were caused by a new bubble splitting off the surface. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Some of the coolest comments are by Uhlenbeck’s doctoral graduate Mark Haskins in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00932-1">story</a> in the current issue of <em>Nature</em>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Haskins says Uhlenbeck is one of those mathematicians who have ‘an innate sense of what should be true,’ even if they cannot always explain why. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The story recounts his often being baffled by answers to his questions, thinking Uhlenbeck had misheard them. But</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “maybe weeks later, you would realize that you had not asked the correct question.” </em>
</p></blockquote>

<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(u) = \int \Phi(u,u') dx. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28u%29+%3D+%5Cint+%5CPhi%28u%2Cu%27%29+dx.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(u) = \int \Phi(u,u') dx. "/></p>
<p>You can think of <img alt="{F(u)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28u%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(u)}"/> as assigning a cost to a function <img alt="{u=u(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%3Du%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u=u(x)}"/>. The goal of the calculus of variations is to find the best <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> that minimizes <img alt="{F(u)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28u%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(u)}"/> subject to some conditions on <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/>. This is a huge generalization of simple minimization problems that arise in basic calculus. He then goes on to explain that in order to study the minimum solutions of such a function one quickly needs to examine partial differential equations. The math gets complex and beautiful very quickly. </p>
<p>
As computer scientists who like discrete structures this is not our sweet spot. We rarely use partial derivatives in our work. Well not very often. See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/fast-matrix-products-and-other-amazing-results/">these</a> two <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/projections-can-be-tricky/">posts</a> for an example. </p>
<p>
To get a taste of this area, we will consider a classic variation problem coming out of these helpful online <a href="http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336k/Newtonhtml/node86.html">notes</a>. It leads to integrals such as 	 </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \int_{0}^{a} (1+u'(x)^{2})^{1/2} dx. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7Ba%7D+%281%2Bu%27%28x%29%5E%7B2%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F2%7D+dx.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \int_{0}^{a} (1+u'(x)^{2})^{1/2} dx. "/></p>
<p>Well, we take to integrals even less than partial derivatives. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Straight-line Shortest Path </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We will change things up by starting with a discrete approach—as is our wont. Our given task is to prove in general that a straight line is the shortest path from the origin to a given point <img alt="{p = (a,b)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp+%3D+%28a%2Cb%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p = (a,b)}"/>. We first consider polygonal paths with <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> line segments. </p>
<p>
First, if <img alt="{n = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 1}"/> then the only option allowed is to go from <img alt="{(0,0)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%280%2C0%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(0,0)}"/> to <img alt="{(a,b)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2Cb%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(a,b)}"/> in one line segment. Thus the conclusion holds trivially: the Euclidean distance <img alt="{d(0,p)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%280%2Cp%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d(0,p)}"/> is the minimum length of a <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>-segment path.</p>
<p>
Now let <img alt="{n \geq 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n \geq 2}"/>. Let </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  P = (0,0) \rightarrow x_1 \rightarrow x_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow x_n = (a,b) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++P+%3D+%280%2C0%29+%5Crightarrow+x_1+%5Crightarrow+x_2+%5Crightarrow+%5Ccdots+%5Crightarrow+x_n+%3D+%28a%2Cb%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  P = (0,0) \rightarrow x_1 \rightarrow x_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow x_n = (a,b) "/></p>
<p>be a series of line segments that form the shortest path from <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> to <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/>. Now by induction, the minimum length of a path of up to <img alt="{n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n-1}"/> segments from <img alt="{x_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x_1}"/> to <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> is <img alt="{d(x_1,p)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%28x_1%2Cp%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d(x_1,p)}"/> via a straight line from <img alt="{x_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x_1}"/> to <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/>. And the length of the segment from the origin <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> to <img alt="{x_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x_1}"/> of course is <img alt="{d(0,x_1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%280%2Cx_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d(0,x_1)}"/>. Now the Euclidean triangle inequality says that the length <img alt="{d(0,x_1) + d(x_1,p)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%280%2Cx_1%29+%2B+d%28x_1%2Cp%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d(0,x_1) + d(x_1,p)}"/> which bounds the length of this path from below is not less than <img alt="{d(0,p)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%280%2Cp%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d(0,p)}"/>. Thus we have proved it for <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> and the induction goes through.</p>
<p>
What we really want to do, however, is prove that <img alt="{d(0,p)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%280%2Cp%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d(0,p)}"/> is the shortest length for any path, period. The path need not have any straight segments. It may go in circular arcs, continually changing direction. The arcs need not be circular per-se; they could be anything.</p>
<p>
The idea that occurs to us computer scientists is to let <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> go to infinity. That is, we want to consider any path as being a limit of polygonal paths. But is this really legitimate? We can certainly approximate any path by paths of segments. But real analysis is littered with examples of complicated curves—themselves defined by limits—that defeat many intuitive expectations about continuity and limits. So how can we make such an infinitistic proof go through rigorously? This is where the calculus of variations takes over.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Minimizers of Functionals </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
To set up the problem for fully general paths, we could represent them as functions <img alt="{f(t) = (x(t),y(t))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28t%29+%3D+%28x%28t%29%2Cy%28t%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(t) = (x(t),y(t))}"/> such that <img alt="{f(0) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%280%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(0) = 0}"/> and <img alt="{f(1) = p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%281%29+%3D+p%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(1) = p}"/>. The length of the path is then obtained by integrating all the horizontal and vertical displacements: <a name="length1"/></p><a name="length1">
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \ell(f)(0,p) = \int_{t=0}^{t=1} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx(t)}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy(t)}{dt}\right)^2} dt. \ \ \ \ \ (1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cell%28f%29%280%2Cp%29+%3D+%5Cint_%7Bt%3D0%7D%5E%7Bt%3D1%7D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D%5Cright%29%5E2+%2B+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bdy%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D%5Cright%29%5E2%7D+dt.+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \ell(f)(0,p) = \int_{t=0}^{t=1} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx(t)}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy(t)}{dt}\right)^2} dt. \ \ \ \ \ (1)"/></p>
</a><p><a name="length1"/> Wrangling this integral seems daunting enough, but the real action involving <img alt="{\ell(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell(f)}"/> only begins after doing so. Both the length <img alt="{\ell(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell(f)}"/> and the body of the integral are <em>functionals</em>—that is, functions of a function. We need to minimize <img alt="{\ell(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell(f)}"/> over all functions <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>.

<p>
Our source simplifies the problem by assuming without loss of generality that <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> increases from <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> to <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a}"/>, giving the function <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> as <img alt="{y(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y(x)}"/> instead.

</a><p><a name="EL"/> We won’t reproduce here how our source derives this but give some interpretation. This is a kind of regularity property that <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> must obey in order to minimize <img alt="{\mathcal{F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{F}}"/>.

</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
However you slice it, the point is that the equation (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#EL">3</a>), when applied to cases like the above, is attackable. In the minimum-length path example, our source—after doing eight more equation lines of work—deduces that <img alt="{u' = \frac{dy}{dx}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%27+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bdy%7D%7Bdx%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u' = \frac{dy}{dx}}"/> must be constant.

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some of Uhlenbeck’s Work </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The point we are emphasizing is that this simple case of paths in the plane—and its abstraction via functionals <img alt="{\mathcal{F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{F}}"/> that are ultimately founded on one variable <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>—have a ready-made minimization scheme, thanks to Euler and Lagrange. The scheme is fully general—not subject to the caveats about our simple approximation by line segments.</p>
<p>
What happens in higher-dimensional cases? We can quote from the wonderful two-page <a href="http://www.abelprize.no/c73996/binfil/download.php?tid=74177">essay</a> accompanying the Abel Prize citation. It first notes the importance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais-Smale_compactness_condition">condition</a> on functionals and their ambient spaces named for Richard Palais and Stephen Smale, which however fails for many cases of interest including harmonic maps.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> [T]he Palais-Smale compactness condition … guarantees existence of minimizers of geometric functionals and is successful in the case of 1-dimensional domains, such as closed geodesics. Uhlenbeck realized that the condition of Palais-Smale fails in the case of surfaces due to topological reasons. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The papers with Sacks explored the roots of these breakdowns and found a way to patch them. The violation of the Palais-Smale condition allows minimizing sequences of functionals to converge with dependence on points outside the space being analyzed. But those loci are governed by a finite set of singular points within the space. This enables the calculus outside the space to be treated as a re-scaling of what goes on inside the space. </p>
<p>
In general cases the view of the process from inside to outside can be described and analyzed as bubbles emerging from the singular locations. More than this picture and interpretation, the Sacks-Uhlenbeck papers produced a now-standard tool-set for higher-dimensional minimization of functionals. It is also another successful marriage of topology—determining the singularities—and analysis.</p>
<p>
This work was extensible to more-general kinds of functionals such as a central one of Yang-Mills theory in physics. Geometric properties of a Riemannian manifold <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/> are expressed via the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics)">connection</a> <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and the functional associates to <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> its <em>curvature</em> <img alt="{F(A)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28A%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(A)}"/>. This is the body for the Yang-Mills functional </p>

<p>There is a corresponding lifting of the Euler-Lagrange equation. This led to developments very much along lines of the previous work with Sacks and more besides. There was particular success analyzing cases where <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/> has dimension 4 that were soon relevant to Donaldson’s own Fields Medal-winning research on these spaces.

We’ve been happy to report that Uhlenbeck has won the prestigious Abel Prize. We have avoided referencing one aspect—despite giving numerous quotes verbatim—that can be appreciated in subsequent fullness <a href="https://www.ias.edu/news/2018/women-and-mathematics-twenty-five-years">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ias.edu/pcmi">here</a> and in <a href="https://impa.br/en_US/page-noticias/karen-uhlenbeck-the-struggle-for-a-place-in-the-sun/">this</a>. By so doing we’ve abided the desire stated in the twelfth paragraph of this <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/uhlen/vita/pers.html">essay</a>. We wonder if this is the right way to do things.

This week I'm in Germany for the Dagstuhl workshop on <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=19121">Computational Complexity of Discrete Problems</a> well timed for Georgia Tech spring break. No Bill, so no <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/09/still-typecasting-from-dagstuhl.html">typecast</a>, no <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/03/the-dagstuhl-family.html">family</a>, just a bunch of fellow theorists. New this year, beer.<br/>
<br/>
Dagstuhl always had bottled beer (and wine), after all this is Germany. However, Ronen Shaltiel is living his lifelong dream of bringing a keg to Dagstuhl. Turns out Dagstuhl had a refrigerator/tap for a beer keg, one only needs to order and pay for the beer. Ronen's daughter designed a special logo, though the keg contains Bitburger, a fine German pilsner. Prost to Ronen and thanks for the beer.<br/>

<br/>
Of course the fun is hanging with colleagues old and new. Talking about open problems old and new. Used to solve more of them back in the day, now it seems harder.<br/>
<br/>
I did learn a new old theorem, planarity testing, whether you can embed a given graph in the plane so no two edges cross, is computable in log space. In 2000 Eric Allender and Meena Mahajan <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ic.2003.09.002">showed</a> that you can test for planarity in symmetric log space, basically the complexity class whose complete problem is undirected connectivity. In 2005, Omer Reingold <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1391289.1391291">famously showed</a> that undirected connectivity is computable in log-space. Thus planarity testing is in log-space, a result you might have missed if you didn't know both papers.<br/>
<br/>
This came out in Eric's talk on his work with Archit Chauhan, Samir Datta and Anish Mukherjee <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/039/">showing</a> that checked whether there is a directed path from a given node s to a given node t in planar graphs can be computed by concurrent-read exclusive-write on parallel random-access machines in logarithmic time, and thus likely weaker than directed s-t paths on general graphs.</div>

    <title>Contrastive Unsupervised Learning of Semantic Representations&amp;#58; A Theoretical Framework</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>Semantic representations</em> (aka  <em>semantic embeddings</em>) of complicated data types (e.g. images, text, video) have become central in machine learning, and also crop up in machine translation, language models, GANs, domain transfer, etc. 
These involve learning a <em>representation function</em> $f$ such that for any data point $x$ its representation $f(x)$ is “high level” (retains semantic information while discarding low level details, such as color of individual pixels in an image) and “compact” (low dimensional). 
The test of a good representation is that it should greatly simplify solving <em>new</em> classification tasks, by allowing them to be solved via linear classifiers (or other low-complexity classifiers) using small amounts of labeled data.</p>

<p>Researchers are most interested in <em>unsupervised</em> representation learning using unlabeled data. A popular approach is to use objectives similar to the <strong>word2vec</strong> algorithm for word embeddings, which work well for diverse data types such as molecules, social networks, images, text etc. 
See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">wikipage of word2vec</a> for references. 
Why do such objectives succeed in such diverse settings? 
This post is about an explanation for these methods by using our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09229">new theoretical framework</a> with coauthor Misha Khodak. 
The framework makes minimalistic assumptions, which is a good thing, since word2vec-like algorithms apply to vastly different data types and it is unlikely that they can share a common Bayesian generative model for the data. 
(An example of generative models in this space is described in an earlier <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2016/02/14/word-embeddings-2/">blog post on the RAND-WALK model</a>.)
As a bonus this framework also yields principled ways to design new variants of the training objectives.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-representations-learning">Semantic representations learning</h2>
<p>Do good, broadly useful representations even <em>exist</em> in the first place? 
In domains such as computer vision, we know the answer is “yes” because deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), when  trained to high accuracy on large multiclass labeled datasets such as <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>, end up learning very powerful and succinct representations along the way. The penultimate layer of the net — the input into the final <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax layer</a> — serves as a good semantic embedding of the image in new unrelated visual tasks. 
(Other layers from the trained net can also serve as good embeddings.) 
In fact the availability of such embeddings from pre-trained (on large multiclass datasets) nets has led to a revolution in computer vision, allowing a host of new classification tasks to be solved with low-complexity classifiers (e.g. linear classifiers) using very little labeled data. 
Thus they are the gold standard to compare to if we try to learn embeddings via unlabeled data.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/CURLheadless1.svg" width="50%"/>
</p>

<h3 id="word2vec-like-methods-curl">word2vec-like methods: CURL</h3>

<p>Since the success of <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf">word2vec</a>, similar approaches were used to learn embeddings for <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02893.pdf">sentences and paragraphs</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00687">images</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640716/">biological sequences</a>.
All of these methods share a key idea: they leverage access to pairs of similar data points $x, x^+$, and learn an embedding function $f$ such that the inner product of $f(x)$ and $f(x^+)$ is on average higher than the inner product of $f(x)$ and $f(x^-)$, where $x^{-}$ is a random data point (and thus presumably dissimilar to $x$). 
In practice similar data points are usually found heuristically, often using co-occurrences, e.g. consecutive sentences in a large text corpus, nearby frames in a video clip, different patches in the same image, etc.</p>

<p>A good example of such methods is <strong>Quick Thoughts</strong> (QT) from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02893.pdf">Logeswaran and Lee</a>, which is the state-of-the-art unsupervised text embedding on many tasks. To learn a representation function $f$, QT minimizes the following loss function on a large text corpus</p>



<p>where $(x, x^+)$ are consecutive sentences and presumably “semantically similar” and $x^-$ is a random negative sample.
For images $x$ and $x^+$ could be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00687">nearby frames</a> from a video.
For text, two successive sentences serve as good candidates for a similar pair: for example, the following are two successive sentences in the Wikipedia page on word2vec: <em>“High frequency words often provide little information.”</em> and <em>“Words with frequency above a certain threshold may be subsampled to increase training speed.”</em>
Clearly they are much more similar than a random pair of sentences, and the learner exploits this. 
From now on we use <em>Contrastive Unsupervised Representation Learning (CURL)</em> to refer to  methods that leverage similar pairs of data points and our goal is to analyze these methods.</p>

<h3 id="need-for-a-new-framework">Need for a new framework</h3>

<p>The standard framework for machine learning involves minimizing some loss function, and learning is said to succeed (or <em>generalize</em>) if the loss is roughly the same on the average training data point and the average test data point.
In contrastive learning, however, the objective used at test time is very different from the training objective: generalization error is not the right way to think about this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Main Hurdle for Theory:</strong> We have to show that doing well on task A (minimizing the word2vec-like objective) allows the representation to do well on task B (i.e., classification tasks revealed later).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier methods along such lines include <em>kernel learning</em> and <em>semi-supervised learning</em>, but there training typically requires at least a few labeled examples from the classification tasks of future interest. Bayesian approaches using generative models are also well-established in simpler settings, but have proved difficult for complicated data such as images and text. 
Furthermore, the simple word2vec-like learners described above do not appear to operate like Bayesian optimizers in any obvious way, and also work for very different data types.</p>

<p>We tackle this problem by proposing a framework that formalizes the notion of semantic similarity that is implicitly used by these algorithms and use the framework to show why contrastive learning gives good representations, while defining what <em>good representations</em> mean in this context.</p>

<h2 id="our-framework">Our framework</h2>

<p>Clearly, the implicit/heuristic notion of similarity used in contrastive learning is connected to the downstream tasks in some way — e.g., similarity carries a strong <em>hint</em> that on average the “similar pairs” tend to be assigned the same labels in many downstream tasks (though there is no hard guarantee per se). We present a simple and minimalistic framework to formalize such a notion of similarity. 
For purposes of exposition we’ll refer to data points as “images”.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-similarity">Semantic similarity</h3>

<p>We assume nature has many <em>classes</em> of images, and has a measure $\rho$ on a set of classes $\mathcal{C}$, so that if asked to pick a class it selects $c$  with probability $\rho(c)$. 
Each class $c$ also has an associated distribution $D_c$ on images i.e. if nature is asked to furnish examples of class $c$ (e.g., the class “dogs”) then it picks image $x$ with probability $D_c(x)$. 
Note that classes can have arbitrary overlap, including no overlap. 
To formalize a notion of <em>semantic similarity</em> we assume that when asked to provide “similar” images, nature picks a class $c^+$ from $\mathcal{C}$ using measure $\rho$ and then picks two i.i.d. samples $x, x^{+}$ from the distribution $D_{c^+}$. 
The dissimilar example $x^{-}$ is picked by selecting another class $c^-$ from measure $\rho$ and picking a random sample $x^{-}$ from $D_{c^-}$.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/CURLframework.svg" width="80%"/>
</p>

<p>The training objective for learning the representation is exactly the QT objective from earlier, but now inherits the following interpretation from the framework
</p>

<p>Note that the function class $\mathcal{F}$ is an arbitrary deep net architecture mapping images to embeddings (neural net sans the final layer), and one would learn $f$ via gradient descent/back-propagation as usual. 
Of course, no theory currently exists for explaining when optimization succeeds for complicated deep nets, so our framework will simply assume that gradient descent has already resulted in some representation $f$ that achieves low loss, and studies how well this does in downstream classification tasks.</p>

<h3 id="testing-representations">Testing representations</h3>

<p>What defines a good representation? 
We assume that the quality of the representation is tested by using it to solve a binary (i.e., two-way) classification task using a linear classifier. 
(The paper also studies extensions to $k$-way classification in the downstream task.) 
How is this binary classification task selected? 
Nature picks two classes $c_1, c_2$ randomly according to measure $\rho$ and picks data points for each class according to the associated probability distributions $D_{c_1}$ and $D_{c_2}$. 
The representation is then used to solve this binary task via logistic regression: namely, find two vectors $w_1, w_2$ so as to minimize the following loss
</p>

<p>The quality of the representation is estimated as the <em>average</em> loss over nature’s choices of binary classification tasks.
</p>

<p>It is important to note that the latent classes present in the unlabeled data are the <em>same</em> classes present in the classification tasks. 
This allows us to formalize a sense of ‘semantic similarity’ as alluded to above: the classes from which data points appear together more frequently are the classes that make up <em>relevant</em> classification tasks. 
Note that if the number of classes is large, then typically the data used in unsupervised training may involve <em>no samples</em> from the classes used at test time. 
Indeed, we are hoping to show that the learned representations are useful for classification on potentially unseen classes.</p>

<h2 id="provable-guarantees-for-unsupervised-learning">Provable guarantees for unsupervised learning</h2>

<p>What would be a dream result for theory? Suppose we fix a class of representation functions ${\mathcal F}$, say those computable by a ResNet 50 architecture with some choices of layer sizes etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dream Theorem:</strong> Minimizing the unsupervised loss (using modest amount of unlabeled data) yields a representation function $f \in {\mathcal F}$ that is competitive with the <strong>best</strong> representation from ${\mathcal F}$ on downstream classification tasks, even with very few labeled examples per task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the number of unlabeled data pairs needed to learn an approximate minimizer can be controlled using Rademacher complexity arguments (see paper), we show that the dream theorem is impossible as phrased: we can exhibit a simple class ${\mathcal F}$ where the contrastive objective does not yield representations even remotely competitive with the best in the class.
This should not be surprising and only suggests that further progress towards such a dream result would require making more assumptions than the above minimalistic ones.</p>

<p>Instead, our paper makes progress by showing that under the above framework, if the unsupervised loss happens to be small at the end of contrastive learning then the resulting representations perform well on downstream classification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Simple Lemma:</strong> The average classification loss on downstream binary tasks is upper bounded by the unsupervised loss.

where $\alpha$ depends on $\rho$. ($\alpha\rightarrow 1$ when $|\mathcal{C}|\rightarrow\infty$, for uniform $\rho$)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This says that the unsupervised loss function can be treated as a <strong>surrogate</strong> for the performance on downstream supervised tasks solved using linear classification, so minimizing it makes sense.
Furthermore, just a few labeled examples are needed to learn the linear classifiers in future downstream tasks.
Thus our minimalistic framework lets us show guarantees for contrastive learning and also highlights the labeled sample complexity benefits provided by it. For details as well as more finegrained analysis see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09229">the paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="extensions-of-the-theoretical-analysis">Extensions of the theoretical analysis</h2>

<p>This conceptual framework not only allows us to reason about empirically successful variants of (1), but also leads to the design of new, theoretically grounded unsupervised objective functions. 
Here we give a high level view; details are in  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09229">our paper</a>.</p>

<p><em>A priori,</em> one might imagine that the log and exponentials in (1) have some information-theoretic interpretation; here we relate the functional form to the fact that logistic regression is going to be used in the downstream classification tasks. 
Analogously, if the classification is done via hinge loss, then (2) is true for a different unsupervised loss that uses a hinge-like loss instead. 
This objective, for instance, was used to learn image representations from videos by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00687">Wang and Gupta</a>. 
Also, usually in practice $k&gt;1$ negative samples are contrasted with each positive sample $(x,x^+)$ and the unsupervised objective looks like the $k$-class cross-entropy loss. 
We prove a statement similar to (2) for this setting, where the supervised loss now is the average $(k+1)$-way classification loss.</p>

<p>Finally, the framework provides guidelines for designing new unsupervised objectives when <em>blocks</em> of similar data are available (e.g., sentences in a paragraph). 
Replacing $f(x^+)$ and $f(x^-)$ in (1) with the average of the representations from the positive and the negative block respectively, we get a new objective which comes with stronger guarantees and better performance in practice. 
We experimentally verify the effectiveness of this variant in our paper.</p>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>We report some controlled experiments to verify the theory. Lacking a canonical multiclass problem for text, we constructed a new 3029-class labeled dataset where a class is one of 3029 articles from Wikipedia,  and datapoints are one of $200$ sentences in these articles. Representations will be tested on a random binary classification task that involves two articles, where the labels of the data point is which of the two articles it belongs to. (A 10-way classification task is similarly defined.)  Datapoints for the test tasks will be held out while training representations. The class of sentence representation ${\mathcal F}$ is a simple multilayer architecture one based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).</p>

<p>The supervised method for learning representations trains a multiclass classifier on the 3029-way task and the representation is taken from the layer before the final softmax output. This was the gold standard in above discussions.</p>

<p>The unsupervised method is fed pairs of similar data points generated according to our theory: similar data points are just pairs of sentences sampled from the same article. Representations are learnt by minimizing the above unsupervised loss objectives.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/CURLexperiment.svg" width="60%"/>
</p>
<p>The highlighted parts in the table show that the unsupervised representations compete well with the supervised representations on the average $k$-way classification task ($k=2, 10$).</p>

<p>Additionally, even though not covered by our theory, the representation also performs respectably on the full  multiclass problem.
We find some support for a suggestion of our theory that the mean (centroid) of the unsupervised representations in each class should be good classifiers for average $k$-way supervised tasks. We find this to be true for unsupervised representations, and surprisingly for supervised representations as well.</p>

<p>The paper also has other experiments studying the effect of number of negative samples and larger blocks of similar data points, including experiments on the CIFAR-100 image dataset.</p>

<p>While contrastive learning is a well-known <em>intuitive</em> algorithm, its practical success has been a mystery for theory. 
Our conceptual framework lets us formally show guarantees for representations learnt using such algorithms. 
While shedding light on such algorithms, the framework also lets us come up with and analyze variants of it. 
It also provides insights into what guarantees are provable and shapes the search for new assumptions that would allow stronger guarantees. 
While this is a first cut, possible extensions include imposing a metric structure among the latent classes.
Connections to meta-learning and transfer learning may also arise.
We hope that this framework influences and guides practical implementations in the future.</p></div>

    <title>TR19-042 |  Determinant equivalence test over finite fields and over $\mathbf{Q}$ | 

	Ankit Garg, 

	Nikhil Gupta, 

	Neeraj Kayal, 

	Chandan Saha</title>
    <summary>The determinant polynomial $Det_n(\mathbf{x})$ of degree $n$ is the determinant of a $n \times n$ matrix of formal variables. A polynomial $f$ is equivalent to $Det_n$ over a field $\mathbf{F}$ if there exists a $A \in GL(n^2,\mathbf{F})$ such that $f = Det_n(A \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Determinant equivalence test over $\mathbf{F}$ is the following algorithmic task: Given black-box access to a $f \in \mathbf{F}[\mathbf{x}]$, check if $f$ is equivalent to $Det_n$ over $\mathbf{F}$, and if so then output a transformation matrix $A \in GL(n^2,\mathbf{F})$. In Kayal (2012), a randomized polynomial time determinant equivalence test was given over $\mathbf{C}$. But, to our knowledge, the complexity of the problem over finite fields and over rationals was not well understood. 

In this work, we give a randomized $poly(n,\log |\mathbf{F}|)$ time determinant equivalence test over finite fields $\mathbf{F}$ (under mild restrictions on the characteristic and size of $\mathbf{F}$). Over rationals, we give an efficient randomized reduction from factoring square-free integers to determinant equivalence test for quadratic forms (i.e. the $n=2$ case), assuming GRH. This shows that designing a polynomial-time determinant equivalence test over rationals is a challenging task. Nevertheless, we show that determinant equivalence test over rationals is decidable: For bounded $n$, there is a randomized polynomial-time determinant equivalence test over rationals with access to an oracle for integer factoring. Moreover, for any $n$, there is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that takes input black-box access to a rational polynomial $f$ and if $f$ is equivalent to $Det_n$ over rationals then it returns a $A \in GL(n^2,\mathbf{L})$ such that $f = Det_n(A \cdot \mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{L}$ is an extension field of $\mathbf{Q}$ of degree at most $n$. 

The above algorithms over finite fields and over rationals are obtained by giving a polynomial-time randomized reduction from determinant equivalence test to another problem, namely the full matrix algebra isomorphism problem. We also show a reduction in the converse direction which is efficient if $n$ is bounded. These reductions, which hold over any $\mathbf{F}$ (under mild restrictions on the characteristic and size of $\mathbf{F}$), establish a close connection between the complexity of the two problems. This then lead to our results via applications of known results on the full algebra isomorphism problem over finite fields and over $\mathbf{Q}$.</summary>

    <title>Third Poll on P vs NP and related Questions is out now! And the winner is Harambe!</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
I took a poll of the theory community (and others) about P vs NP and related issues in 2002, 2012, and 2019 (sorry its not an arithmetic  sequence --- read the third poll article to see why).  The 2002 and 2012 polls are on the web (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper1.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper2.pdf">here</a> ), and now the third poll is out and its <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper3.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3319627.3319636">here</a> . All three appear in Lane's Complexity Column in SIGACT News.<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper1.pdf"/><br/>
<br/>
I'll give some highlights and thought about the third poll, but for more read the article. Or read all three and see how opinions have changed over time.<br/>
<br/>
0) How many respondents: 100 the first time, and 152 the second time, 124 the third time.<br/>
<br/>
1) P≠NP is at about 80%. When restricted to people who have thought about the problem a lot (my judgement) then it goes to 99%. The strongest P≠NP is by Lance who says<br/>
<br/>
                                People who think P=NP are like people who believe Elvis is alive.<br/>
<br/>
I disagree. I think Elvis is alive and is trying to prove P=NP.<br/>
<br/>
2) When will it be solved? 66% thought it would be solved before 2100, a bit more than in prior years. But also more thought it would never be solved. Some commented that a computer might solve it.  I doubt that, but I do think this poll will be done by a computer in 10 years.<br/>
<br/>
3) Because I used Survey monkey (1) each question got more answers, and (2) most  questions got a forced YES or NO  so less funny comments or room for creative answers. People could still leave comments, and some did.<br/>
<br/>
4) Related to point (3): The last time I did the poll P=BPP was thought by everyone <i>who answered</i> <i>the question</i>. This year far more people answered it and quite a few thought P≠BPP. This may be because Survey monkey had a psychological affect of making people vote even if they didn't really know (people who have thought a lot about P vs NP  all thought P=BPP). Has  there been evidence that P≠BPP that I am unaware of? Or since there has not been that much progress on it maybe they are unequal.  10  years ago I would have thought we would have L=RL by now.<br/>
<br/>
5) The last time I did the poll 10 people thought factoring IS in P and the NSA or the KGB knows that. This time around nobody thought that. Why? Those 10 people have vanished mysteriously.<br/>
<br/>
6) Five people thought P vs NP will be resolved by Harambe. That is more than any person got.<br/>
<br/>
7)  Is this poll worth doing? I would say yes (gee, I have to having done his poll three times) because it is good to have an objective record of subjective opinion. <br/>
<br/>
8) I'll give some of my answers: P≠NP, Elvis is dead, and both will be proven in the year 2525. For more about the future see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yesyhQkYrQM">this</a>.<br/>

    <title>TR19-041 |  Quantum hardness of learning shallow classical circuits | 

	Srinivasan Arunachalam, 

	Alex Bredariol Grilo, 

	Aarthi Sundaram</title>
    <summary>In this paper we study the quantum learnability of constant-depth classical circuits under the uniform distribution and in the distribution-independent framework of PAC learning.  In order to attain our results, we  establish connections between quantum learning and quantum-secure  cryptosystems. We then achieve the following results. 

1) Hardness of learning $AC^0$ and $TC^0$ under the uniform distribution. Our first result concerns the concept class $TC^0$ (resp. $AC^0$), the class of constant depth and polynomial-sized circuits with unbounded fan-in majority gates (resp. AND, OR, NOT gates). We show that if there exists no quantum polynomial time (resp. sub-exponential time) algorithm to solve the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, then there exists no polynomial time quantum learning algorithm for $TC^0$ (resp. $AC^0$) under the uniform distribution (even with access to quantum membership queries). The main technique in this result uses explicit pseudo-random generators that are believed to be quantum-secure to construct concept classes that are hard to learn quantumly under the uniform distribution. 


2) Hardness of learning $TC^0_2$ in the PAC setting. Our second result shows that if there exists no quantum polynomial time algorithm for the LWE problem, then there exists no polynomial time quantum PAC learning algorithm for the class $TC^0_2$, i.e., depth-$2$ $TC^0$ circuits. The main technique in this result is to establish a connection between the quantum security of public-key cryptosystems and the learnability of a concept class that consists of decryption functions of the cryptosystem. 


This gives a strong conditional negative answer to one of the "Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory" raised by Aaronson, who asked if $AC^0$ and $TC^0$ can be PAC-learned in quantum polynomial time.</summary>

Neil L. is a Leprechaun.

<p>
Today, the day before St. Patrick’s Day, we ponder universal riddles of existence. Ken, who will visit me this coming week, insisted on reporting what happened this morning.<br/>
<span id="more-15684"/></p>
<p>
I woke up early, walked alone into our living room, and was amazed to see Neil already here. He was looking out the window at dawn sunlight flooding over St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the many other landmarks we can see from our apartment in midtown Manhattan. </p>
<p>
Spring has at last given an earnest of coming. The scene was transfixing, exhilirating, all the glory of nature except for the green-clad little man puffing his pipe with his back to me.</p>
<p>
“Neil—?”</p>
<p>
He turned and tipped his hat to me but then turned back to the window. I wondered if I had caught him in meditation. I stood back until he turned a second time. He had always visited me late on the evening before St. Patrick’s Day, or the morning of it.</p>
<p>
“You’re here early.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Aye. Top o’ the morning to ye.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Why?”</p>
<p>
He gave me a long stare but warmly, not hostile. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“By the living daylights in ye…”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Then I understood. The Romans have their Ides, the Irish have the 17th, but I got the day in between—when last year I was not here but in an operating room for long hours.</p>
<p>
“Thanks” was all I could say. I had actually come out to look up a mathematical idea for a “part 2” post I’ve been struggling with ever since posting the “part 1” years ago. This pulled me back to math, then to how Neil has always tricked me and I’ve never been able to pin him down. I realized this might be my best opportunity.</p>
<p>
“Neil, may I ask you a Big Question? Not directly personal.”</p>
<p>
He simply said, “Aye.” No tricks yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Question </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I had my chance—something I’ve wanted to ask him for years but not had an opening for.</p>
<p>
“Neil, what can you tell me about <em>female</em> Leprechauns?” </p>
<p>
Neil had mentioned family, cousins, even siblings—I figured they had to come from somewhere. But nothing I’d read mentioned female leprechauns. I braced for silence again, but Neil’s reply was immediate and forthright:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“They comprise the most heralded subset of our people. They are included in everything we do.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“How so?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Our society agreed early on that every female leprechaun should have the highest station. All female leprechauns are sent to the best schools, with personal tutoring reserved in advanced subjects. They are our superpartners in every way.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“How do you treat them?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“If a lady leprechaun applies for a position, she is given full consideration. Whenever a lady leprechaun gives advice, it is harkened to. None of us has ever ‘malesplained’ or demeaned a lady leprechaun in any way.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Are they as short—uh, tall—as you?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Every adult female leprechaun is between one cubit and one-and-a-half in stature, like us menfolk. We don’t have quite the variation of your human species.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“I would surely like to meet one.”</p>
<p>
Neil heaved a sigh. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Ye know the trepidation with us and your womenfolk.” Indeed, I recalled Neil’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/leprechauns-will-find-you/">story</a> of what was evidently his own harrowing encounter with the wife of William Hamilton. “It is symmetrical, I’m afraid. No female leprechaun has ventured into your world.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I had figured that. </p>
<p>
“But can you give me an <em>example</em> of a female leprechaun? Someone who has done something notable.”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Reality </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Neil puffed on his pipe. I knew I had him cornered and moved in.</p>
<p>
“Neil, is everything you just said about female leprechauns <em>true</em>?”</p>
<p>
To my surprise, he answered quickly.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“<em>Aye.</em> As in mathematics, each of my statements was perfectly true.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Oh. Then I realized how empty domains are treated in mathematical logic. I looked at him sharply. </p>
<p>
“Neil, there <a href="https://thefw.com/things-you-didnt-know-about-leprechauns/">are</a> <a href="https://www.circa.com/story/2019/03/15/art-culture/where-are-all-the-female-leprechauns-we-asked-an-expert">no</a> female leprechauns. All of your statements have been vacuous, bull-.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“That’s not right or fair. That which I told ye have been important values of our society from the beginning. Many studies of female leprechauns have established their natures precisely. We have devoted vast resources to the quest for female leprechauns. Readiness—how we would integrate them—this is enshrined in all of our laws. Even your late Senator, <a>Birch</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=O-sOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT275&amp;lpg=PT275&amp;dq=Bayh+Irish+name&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bECfTQqWkJ&amp;sig=ACfU3U2yp53w6HQk_aXp2uT6okbmEG7Y3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtzKG6iIfhAhVuQt8KHdB5DmgQ6AEwDnoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bayh Irish name&amp;f=false">Bayh</a>, was <a href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol48/iss1/4/">informed</a> by us at Notre Dame.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Neil’s sincerity was evident. I still felt bamboozled. He carried on.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Ye have whole brilliant careers studying physical objects that may not exist. The analysis of them is still important in mathematics and other scientific applications. And in mathematics itself—”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I was actually relieved to turn the subject back toward mathematics, as Neil and I usually talked about.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“—your most storied advance of the past quarter century was achieved by ten years’ concerted study of the Frey-Hellegouarch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frey_curve">curve</a>. Which by Fermat’s Last Theorem does not exist.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Existence </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I could not argue with that. This set me pondering. Whether mathematical objects <em>exist</em> in reality defines the debate over Platonism. But what, then, is the reality of <em>nonexistent</em> mathematical objects? </p>
<p>
Nonexistent objects still follow rules and aid deductions about objects that do exist. So, they too exist? Moreover, we often cannot prove that those objects do not exist—for all we know they may be just as real. Polynomial-time algorithms for satisfiability and many other problems—those are bread and butter in theory. I wanted Neil to tell me more about some of them.</p>
<p>
“Neil, have your folk worked on the projective plane of order 10?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“<em>Aye</em>. Not only did we long ago have all the results of this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316573900642">paper</a> on them, our engineers recommended it as the thoroughfare pattern for new towns.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“You have built them?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Indeed—in two new districts around Carlingford back home.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“But they don’t exist.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“By our laws and treaties they exist until your people prove they don’t. Then they have a 50-year sunset. Which <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.39.8684&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">means</a> the towns have 20 years left.<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“That’s sad.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“It’s actually a much better system than the Scots have. Their villages of this type such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadoon">Brigadoon</a> come <a href="https://www.glenlaurel.com/about-us/blog/the-legend-of-brigadoon">back</a> every 100 years just for one day. But Brexit may put paid to our two towns sooner. We are <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/travel/leprechauns-protected-european-law">protected</a> under E.U. law, but those towns are just over the Northern Ireland border.<br/>

“How about odd perfect numbers?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“<em>Nay</em>. Ye know the rules. We can nay tell that which your folk do not know, unless there is nothing else ye learn that ye could not learn without us.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I pondered: what could I ask about computational complexity that Neil could respond to in this kind of zero-knowledge way? But Neil cut in.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“It will be much more fruitful to discuss objects that ye <em>know</em> do not exist—and yet ye <em>use</em> them anyway.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Mathematical Leprechauns </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I thought, which could he mean? I recalled the story we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/01/23/definitions-definitions-do-we-need-them/">told</a> about a student getting his degree for a thesis with many new results on a strong kind of Lipschitz/Hölder function even though an examiner observed that non-constant ones do not exist. Ken heard the same story as an undergraduate, with the detail that it was an undergraduate senior thesis, not PhD. The Dirac delta function? Well, that definitely exists as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function#As_a_measure">measure</a>. I forgot an obvious example until Neil said it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“There is the field with one element: <img alt="{\mathbb{F}_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{F}_1}"/>.”
</font></p></blockquote><font color="green">
<p>
Of course. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/do-we-need-mysticism-in-theory/">posted</a> about it. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“It is an active research subject, especially in the past dozen years. Your Fields medalist Alain Connes has co-written a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.2401v1.pdf">whole</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2926">series</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2024">papers</a> on it. Yuri Manin <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1564">also</a>. Your blog friend Henry Cohn got a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407093">paper</a> on it into the <em>Monthly</em>—think of the youngsters… Edifices are even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0069">being</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00209-009-0638-0.pdf">built</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05831">upon</a> it.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Can you give some less-obvious ones for our readers?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“There is the uniform distribution on the natural numbers. This <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/tr/tr814/tr814.pdf">paper</a> gives variations that do exist, but it makes the need and use of the original concept clear.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken had in fact once finished a lecture on Kolmogorov complexity when short on time by appealing to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“There are fields <i>F</i> whose algebraic closures have degrees 3 and 5 over <i>F</i>. Those are highly useful.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I knew by a <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/galoistheory/artinschreier.pdf">theorem</a> of Emil Artin and Otto Schreier that they cannot exist. But it struck me as natural that they <em>should</em> exist. I wondered how much one would need to tweak the rules of group theory to make them possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Then there is the free complete lattice on 3 generators.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Wait—I thought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice#Free_complete_lattices">that</a> could exist if one loosened up set theory. So I asked:</p>
<p>
“Neil, do some of these objects exist in alternative worlds known to leprechauns in which the rules of mathematics are crazy, not like the real world?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“What makes you think ye don’t live in one of those other worlds?”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Before I could react, Neil picked up a solid glass sphere art object that belonged to Kathryn. He pulled out a diamond-encrusted knife and slashed it as green light flashed in every direction until he stopped. Then from his hands he gave me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_paradox">two</a> glass spheres of the same size. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“For the happy couple—<em>la le Padraig suna ye-uv!</em>”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And he was gone.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The purpose of this post is mostly just to signal-boost Konstantin Kakaes’s article in MIT <em>Technology Review</em>, entitled <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613123/no-ibm-didnt-just-reverse-time-with-a-quantum-computer/">“No, scientists didn’t just ‘reverse time’ with a quantum computer.”</a>  The title pretty much says it all—but if you want more, you should read the piece, which includes the following droll quote from some guy calling himself “Director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you’re simulating a time-reversible process on your computer, then you can ‘reverse the direction of time’ by simply reversing the direction of your simulation. From a quick look at the paper, I confess that I didn’t understand how this becomes more profound if the simulation is being done on IBM’s quantum computer.</p></blockquote>



<p>Incredibly, the time-reversal claim has now gotten uncritical attention in <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>Discover</em>, <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, my Facebook feed, and elsewhere—hence this blog post, which has basically no content except “the claim to have ‘reversed time,’ by running a simulation backwards, is exactly as true and as earth-shattering as a layperson might think it is.”</p>



<p>If there’s anything interesting here, I suppose it’s just that “scientists use a quantum computer to reverse time” is one of the purest examples I’ve ever seen of a scientific claim that basically amounts to a mind-virus or meme optimized for sharing on social media—discarding all nontrivial “science payload” as irrelevant to its propagation. </p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My 1983 Ph D thesis was on Helly-type theorems which is an exciting part of discrete geometry and, in the last two decades, I have had an ongoing research project with Roy Meshulam on topological Helly-type theorems. The subject found new connections with structural graph theory and <span class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="1903.00245v1-abstract-full">Gyárfás-type problems, and also with high-dimensional expanders. </span> We already devoted quite a few posts directly and indirectly to Helly-type theorems.</p>
<p>In this post I would like to report on two recent related breakthroughs, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01068">one by Andreas Holmsen and Dong-Gyu Lee</a>, and the other <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00245">by Andreas Holmsen</a>. These developments are related to problems that are described in <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/imre.pdf">Problems for Imre Bárány’s birthday,</a> and to my earlier 2004 Oberwolfach report “<a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/ow04.pdf">Expectations from commutative algebra</a>“. While at it I will mention some earlier important papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3413">by Pauline <span class="content"><span class="text surname">Sarrabezolles</span></span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05381">by Shay Moran and Amir Yehudayoff</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2384">by Boris Bukh</a>.</p>
<h3>Helly theorem, colorful Helly, and the Fractional Helly Theorem.</h3>
<p>You can find the statements of Helly theorem, Radon theorem, and the colorful Caratheodory theorem in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/sarkarias-proof-of-tverbergs-theorem-1/">this post</a>.  The colorful Helly theorem was first observed by Lovasz. The fractional Helly theorem was first proved by Katchalski and Liu.</p>
<p><strong>The colorful Helly theorem:</strong> Let <img alt="{\cal K}_1, {\cal K}_2, \dots, {\cal K}_{d+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_1%2C+%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_%7Bd%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="{\cal K}_1, {\cal K}_2, \dots, {\cal K}_{d+1}"/> be <img alt="d+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d+1"/> nonempty families of convex sets in <img alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb R^d"/>. If for every choice of a <em>transversal</em> – one set from every family – there is a point in common to all the chosen sets then for one of the families, there is a point in common to all sets in the family.</p>

<p>I should mention that these theorems do not follow combinatorially from Helly’s theorem itself. They manifest deep properties of hypergraphs coming from geometry, and it is an important question to give general abstract properties, combinatorial or topological leading to such properties.</p>
<p>The result of Holmsen and Lee asserts roughly that the fractional Helly property follows combinatorially from Radon’s theorem! Holmsen’s result asserts that  the fractional Helly property follows combinatorially from the colorful Helly theorem!</p>
<h2>Andreas Holmsen Dong-Gyu Lee: Fractional Helly from Radon</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01068">Radon numbers and the fractional Helly theorem</a></p>
<p>Authors: Andreas Holmsen Dong-Gyu Lee</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A basic measure of the combinatorial complexity of a convexity space is its Radon number. In this paper we show a fractional Helly theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number, answering a question of Kalai. As a consequence we also get a weak epsilon-net theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number. This answers a question of Bukh and extends a recent result of Moran and Yehudayoff.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>A result due to Gyárfás, Hubenko, and Solymosi (answering a question of Erdös) states that if a graph G on n vertices does not contain <img alt="K_{2,2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7B2%2C2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="K_{2,2}"/> as an induced subgraph yet has at least <img alt="c{{n} \choose {2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%7B%7Bn%7D+%5Cchoose+%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c{{n} \choose {2}}"/> edges, then G has a complete subgraph on at least <img alt="c^2/10n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2%2F10n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c^2/10n"/> vertices. In this paper we suggest a “higher-dimensional” analogue of the notion of an induced <img alt="K_{2,2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7B2%2C2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="K_{2,2}"/> which allows us to generalize their result to k-uniform hypergraphs. Our result also has an interesting consequence in discrete geometry. In particular, it implies that the fractional Helly theorem can be derived as a purely combinatorial consequence of the colorful Helly theorem.</p>

The construction of weak nets when the Radon number is finite is based on Helly’s property and on metric properties of VC classes.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here's an old trick that we found useful for proving some tight complexity lower bounds. You are given <em>m</em> coins, each of weight either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em>, and a modern scale that can tell you the total weight of any chosen subset of coins. How many weighings do you need to identify which coin is which? Checking each coin individually uses <em>m</em> weighings, but can you do less?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In any weighing, we try some unknown number of weight-<em>a</em> coins between 0 and <em>m</em>, so this results in one of <em>m</em> + 1 possible values, giving us at most log(<em>m</em> + 1) bits of information. In total we need m bits of information to identify each coin, so clearly we will need at least Ω(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) weighings.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It turns out that this many is in fact enough, and this generalizes to various other settings with less restricted weights. This is the basis for two of our recent results: a tight complexity lower bound for Integer Linear Programming with few constraints and for multicoloring (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_coloring#Definitions">b-fold coloring</a>), assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. The trick allows us to use constraints that check the value of some number between 0 and <em>m</em> to indeed extract about log(<em>m</em>) bits of new information from each, in a way that is general enough to check <em>m</em> clauses of a 3-CNF-SAT instance using only <em>O</em>(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) constraints.</p>
<p><span id="more-1071"/></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Detecting matrices</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One way to rephrase this coin-weighing problem is as follows: the unknown coin weights are described by a (column) vector <em>x</em> in {<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>}<sup><em>m</em></sup>. A subset of coins is described by a characteristic (row) vector <em>v</em> in {0,1}<sup><em>m</em></sup> and the resulting value of the weighing is the dot product <em>v</em> <strong>·</strong> <em>x</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For a number of weighings <em>k</em>, the row vectors form a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with <em>k</em> rows and <em>m</em> columns, while the obtained values are simply the <em>k</em>-element vector <em>M x</em>. The condition that these values are enough to identify each entry of <em>x</em> is formalized as follows:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For all <em>m</em>, there is a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with k=<em>O</em>(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows and <em>m</em> columns<br/>
such that for any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in {<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>}<sup><em>m</em></sup>, x ≠ y implies <em>M x</em> ≠ <em>M y</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is called a <em>detecting matrix</em>. In other words, instead of checking x = y entry by entry, it suffices to compare the k entries of M x and M y. (An equivalent definition is to require that the kernel of <em>M</em> is trivial on {-1,0,1}<sup><em>m</em></sup>, since we could instead compare (<em>x</em> - <em>y</em>)/(<em>a</em> - <em>b</em>) with zero). A generalization for <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in {0, 1, …, <em>d</em> - 1}<sup><em>m</em></sup> was first proved by <a href="https://doi.org/10.4153/CMB-1965-034-2">(Lindström 1965)</a> (in fact he proves the constant hidden behind <em>O</em> is 2 log<sub>2</sub>(<em>d</em>) and cannot be improved, for any <em>d</em>), giving a deterministic, poly-time construction. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.162.2327">(Bshouty 2009)</a> gives a more direct and general construction using Fourier analysis. However, a random matrix can be shown to be detecting with fairly elementary methods.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Integer Linear Programming</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In ILP we are given a matrix <em>A</em> with <em>n</em> columns and <em>m</em> rows, a vector <em>b</em> with <em>m</em> entries, and we ask for a vector <em>x</em> with <em>n</em> non-negative integer entries such that <em>A x</em> = <em>b</em>. So each of the <em>m</em> rows is a linear equality to be satisfied. What is the complexity for small <em>m</em>?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We start with an instance <em>A x</em> = <em>b</em> encoding a suitable 3-CNF-SAT instance of size <em>O</em>(<em>m</em>) in a straightforward way, using only {0,1,2,3} entries in <em>A</em> and <em>b</em>. Instead of checking each row individually, we use detecting matrices to check them in bunches, reducing our problem to an equivalent instance <em>M A x</em> = <em>M b</em>. The matrix <em>M A </em>of the new instance has only O(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows (at the cost of having larger entries in <em>M b</em>). With some tinkering, this simple reduction shows that, assuming ETH, ILP with <em>m</em> constraints cannot be solved in time 2<sup><em>o</em>(<em>m</em> log <em>m</em>)</sup>, even when the matrix has only 0-1 entries and <em>b</em> has poly(<em>m</em>) entries. This matches a recent (surprisingly simple and clever!) 2<sup><em>O</em>(<em>m</em> log <em>m</em>)</sup> algorithm by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3175322">Eisenbrand and Weismantel (SODA 2018)</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One caveat when applying detecting matrices is that we do not know any bound on one side, <em>A x</em>, except that it is a non-negative integer vector. Fortunately, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s004530010033">(Grebinsky &amp; Kucherov 2000)</a> showed that a random 0-1 matrix satisfies the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For all <em>d</em>,<em>m</em>, there is a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with k=<em>O</em>(<em>m</em> <em>log</em> <em>d</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows and <em>m</em> columns<br/>
such that for any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in ℕ<sup><em>m</em></sup> with ‖<em>y</em>‖<sub>1</sub> ≤ <em>d</em> <em>m</em>, x ≠ y implies <em>M x</em> ≠ <em>M y</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here no upper bound on <em>x</em> is needed, because a single row in <em>M</em> full of ones is enough to guarantee that the sum of entries is the same: ‖<em>x</em>‖<sub>1</sub> = ‖<em>y</em>‖<sub>1</sub>. However, it remains an open problem to find a deterministic construction (we work around this by giving a somewhat weaker construction). See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01296.pdf">the full paper (STACS 2019)</a> for details (with Dušan Knop and Michał Pilipczuk). The reduction for <em>multicoloring</em> is quite different and more problem-specific, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03432">the full paper (ESA 2017)</a> for definitions (with Marthe Bonamy, Łukasz Kowalik, Michał Pilipczuk and Arkadiusz Socała).</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Semidefinite programming is a powerful tool in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the random hyperplane rounding method of Goemans and Williamson has been extensively studied for more than two decades, resulting in various extensions to the original technique and beautiful algorithms for a wide range of applications. Despite the fact that this approach yields tight approximation guarantees for some problems, like Max Cut, for many others, like Max Sat, Max DiCut, and constraint satisfaction problems with global constraints, the tight approximation ratio is still unknown. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that very few techniques for rounding semi-definite relaxations are known.</p>
<p>In this work, we present a new general and simple method for rounding semi-definite programs, based on Brownian motion. Our approach is inspired by recent results in algorithmic discrepancy theory. We develop and present tools for analyzing our new rounding algorithms, utilizing mathematical machinery from the theory of Brownian motion, complex analysis, and partial differential equations. Focusing on constraint satisfaction problems, we apply our method to several classical problems, including Max Cut, Max 2-Sat, and Max DiCut, and derive new algorithms that are competitive with the best known results. We further show that our algorithms can be used, together with the Sum of Squares hierarchy, to approximate constraint satisfaction problems subject to multiple global cardinality constraints.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the president of the United States uses "complexity" in a tweet, I can't leave it alone.<br/>

Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are....</div>

I got my MIT degree in Applied Mathematics so I don't count, but I know plenty of MIT computer scientists and the one undeniable truth is that I don't want any of them flying my plane.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with the Donald that a complex environment can often lead to confusion, especially in an emergency. HCI matters.<br/>
<br/>
But that's where it stops. Better technology in the plane and on the ground, combined with better procedures have all but eliminated deadly major commercial airplane crashes in the US and quite rare in the world at large. I'll call that more than a "little gain". I remember the "old and simpler" days where we had deadly airline crashes every few months. No thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I've had great discussions with some of the aerospace engineering professors at Georgia Tech. The amount of effort to get the "front-of-the-plane" software right via formal methods and rigorous testings has become harder to engineer than the plane itself. The "back-of-the-plane" software that controls the video screens and WiFi gets less attention. I can live with safety over movies.<br/>
<br/>
When technology makes things much safer, whether it be planes or self-driving cars, the rare accidents become far more noticeable. while we should use these opportunities to learn and make things safer, the rare accidents help us realize just how much more safer technology can make us.<br/></div>
