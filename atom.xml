    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This Erev Yom Kippur, I wish to repent for not putting enough quantum computing content on this blog.  Of course, repentance is meaningless unless accompanied by genuine reform.  That being the case, please enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLmGfNKCLU">YouTube video of my ACM TechTalk from last week about quantum supremacy</a>—although, as you’ll see if you watch the thing, I oscillate between quantum supremacy and other terms like “quantum advantage” and even “quantum supremadvantage.”  This represents the first time ever that I got pushback about a talk before I’d delivered it for political reasons—the social-justice people, it turns out, are <em>actually serious</em> about wanting to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">ban the term “quantum supremacy”</a>—but my desire to point out all the difficulties with their proposal competed with my desire not to let that issue overshadow my talk.</p>



<p>And there’s plenty to talk about!  While regular <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers will have already heard (or read) most of what I say, I make some new comments, including about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03494">new paper from last week</a>, the night before my talk (!), by the USTC group in China, where they report a quantum supremacy experiment based on random circuit sampling with a superconducting chip, this time with a record-setting 60 qubits and 24 layers of gates.  On the other hand, I also stress how increasing the circuit fidelity has become a <em>much</em> more urgent issue than further increasing the number of qubits (or in the case of BosonSampling, the number of photons), if our goal is for these experiments to remain a couple steps ahead of classical spoofing algorithms.</p>



<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy my lovingly handcrafted visuals.  Over the course of this pandemic, I’ve become a full convert to writing out my talks with a stylus pen rather than PowerPointing them—not only is it faster for me, not only does it allow for continuous scrolling rather than arbitrary divisions into slides, but it enforces simplicity and concision in ways they <em>should</em> be enforced.</p>



<p>While there was only time for me to field a few questions at the end of the talk, I later supplied <a href="https://on.acm.org/t/quantum-computational-supremacy/2106/2?u=acm-learning">written answers to 52 questions (!!) that I hadn’t gotten to</a>.  If <em>you</em> have a question, please check to see if it’s already there, and otherwise ask away in the comments!</p>



<p>Thanks so much to Yan Timanovsky for inviting and organizing this talk, and to whurley for hosting it.</p></div>

But did you know they’re actually a lattice, almost the same as the positive integer divisibility lattice (an infinite-dimensional grid with a dimension per prime), but missing one element at the index \(2\) (because \(F_2=F_1=1\))? Unfortunately, because of the missing grid element, \(F\) is not a lattice homomorphism.</p>

Meanwhile for those of us using it as a static site generator and github-pages blog springboard, Jekyll still largely just works as it always has without much need for development.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Way back in 2005, I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/qchallenge.html">Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory</a>, on at least half of which I’d say there’s been dramatic progress in the 16 years since (most of the challenges were open-ended, so that it’s unclear when to count them as “solved”).  I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=471">more open quantum complexity problems</a> in 2010, and some <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=663">classical complexity problems</a> in 2011.  In the latter cases, I’d say there’s been dramatic progress on about a third of the problems.  I won’t go through the problems one by one, but feel free to ask in the comments about any that interest you.</p>



<p>Shall I push my luck as a problem-poser?  Shall or shall not, I have.</p>



<p>My impetus, this time around, was a kind invitation by Travis Humble, the editor-in-chief of the new <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tqc">ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing</a></em>, to contribute a perspective piece to that journal on the occasion of my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5448">ACM Prize</a>.  I agreed—but only on the condition that, rather than ponderously pontificate about the direction of the field, I could simply discuss a bunch of open problems that I wanted to see solved.  The result is below.  It’s coming soon to an arXiv near you, but <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers get it first.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/open.pdf">Open Problems Related to Quantum Query Complexity</a></strong>  (11 pages, PDF)</p><p>by Scott Aaronson</p><p><em>Abstract:</em> I offer a case that quantum query complexity still has loads of enticing and fundamental open problems—from relativized QMA versus QCMA and BQP versus IP, to time/space tradeoffs for collision and element distinctness, to polynomial degree versus quantum query complexity for partial functions, to the Unitary Synthesis Problem and more.</p></blockquote>



<p>Some of the problems on my new hit-list are ones that I and others have flogged for years or even decades, but others, as far as I know, appear here for the first time.  If your favorite quantum query complexity open problem, or a problem I’ve discussed in the past, is missing, that doesn’t mean that it’s been solved or is no longer interesting—it might mean I simply ran out of time or energy before I got to it.</p>



<p>Enjoy!  And tell me what I missed or got wrong or has a trivial solution that I overlooked.</p></div>

In
international kidney exchange programmes (IKEPs), countries merge their

adjusted by a credit function yielding a target allocation. The goal is to find
a solution in the patient-donor compatibility graph that approaches the target
allocation as closely as possible, to ensure long-term stability of the
international pool. As solutions, we use maximum matchings that
lexicographically minimize the country deviations from the target allocation.
We first give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing such matchings. We then
perform, for the first time, a computational study for a large number of
countries. For the initial allocations we use, besides two easy-to-compute
solution concepts, two classical concepts: the Shapley value and nucleolus.
These are hard to compute, but by using state-of-the-art software we show that
they are now within reach for IKEPs of up to fifteen countries. Our experiments
show that using lexicographically minimal maximum matchings instead of ones
that only minimize the largest deviation from the target allocation (as
previously done) may make an IKEP up to 52% more balanced.

    <title>Construction of $k$-matchings and $k$-regular subgraphs in graph products</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1631664000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Anna Lindeberg, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Hellmuth:Marc.html">Marc Hellmuth</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06755">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A $k$-matching $M$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $M\subseteq E$ such that
each connected component in the subgraph $F = (V,M)$ of $G$ is either a
single-vertex graph or $k$-regular, i.e., each vertex has degree $k$. In this
contribution, we are interested in $k$-matchings within the four standard graph
products: the Cartesian, strong, direct and lexicographic product.
</p>
<p>As we shall see, the problem of finding non-empty $k$-matchings ($k\geq 3$)
in graph products is NP-complete. Due to the general intractability of this
problem, we focus on distinct polynomial-time constructions of $k$-matchings in
a graph product $G\star H$ that are based on $k_G$-matchings $M_G$ and
$k_H$-matchings $M_H$ of its factors $G$ and $H$, respectively. In particular,
we are interested in properties of the factors that have to be satisfied such
that these constructions yield a maximum $k$-matching in the respective
products. Such constructions are also called "well-behaved" and we provide
several characterizations for this type of $k$-matchings.
</p>
<p>Our specific constructions of $k$-matchings in graph products satisfy the
property of being weak-homomorphism preserving, i.e., constructed matched edges
in the product are never "projected" to unmatched edges in the factors. This
leads to the concept of weak-homomorphism preserving $k$-matchings. Although
the specific $k$-matchings constructed here are not always maximum
$k$-matchings of the products, they have always maximum size among all
weak-homomorphism preserving $k$-matchings. Not all weak-homomorphism
preserving $k$-matchings, however, can be constructed in our manner. We will,
therefore, determine the size of maximum-sized elements among all
weak-homomorphims preserving $k$-matching within the respective graph products,
provided that the matchings in the factors satisfy some general assumptions.

share with your friend. For this you are allowed to cut the pizza using several
straight cuts, and then give every second piece to your friend. You want to do
this fairly, that is, your friend and you should each get exactly half of each
ingredient. How many cuts do you need?
</p>
<p>It was recently shown using topological methods that $n$ cuts always suffice.
In this work, we study the computational complexity of finding such $n$ cuts.
Our main result is that this problem is PPA-complete when the ingredients are
represented as point sets. For this, we give a new proof that for point sets
$n$ cuts suffice, which does not use any topological methods.
</p>
<p>We further prove several hardness results as well as a higher-dimensional
variant for the case where the ingredients are well-separated.

$k$-MPMD problem. This problem considers a metric space with $n$ nodes.
Requests arrive at these nodes in an online fashion. The task is to match these
requests into sets of exactly $k$, such that the space and time cost of all
matched requests are minimized. The notion of the space cost requires a
definition of an underlying metric space that gives distances of subsets of $k$
elements. For $k&gt;2$, the task of finding a suitable metric space is at the core
of our problem: We show that for some known generalizations to $k=3$ points,
such as the $2$-metric and the $D$-metric, there exists no competitive
randomized algorithm for the $3$-MPMD problem. The $G$-metrics are defined for
3 points and allows for a competitive algorithm for the $3$-MPMD problem. For
$k&gt;3$ points, there exist two generalizations of the $G$-metrics known as $n$-
and $K$-metrics. We show that neither the $n$-metrics nor the $K$-metrics can
be used for the $k$-MPMD problem. On the positive side, we introduce the
$H$-metrics, the first metrics to allow for a solution of the $k$-MPMD problem
for all $k$. In order to devise an online algorithm for the $k$-MPMD problem on
the $H$-metrics, we embed the $H$-metric into trees with an $O(\log n)$
distortion. Based on this embedding result, we extend the algorithm proposed by
Azar et al. (2017) and achieve a competitive ratio of $O(\log n)$ for the
$k$-MPMD problem.

connectivity of a landscape under a budget constraint by improving habitat
areas and ecological corridors between them. We consider a formulation of this
problem in terms of graphs in which vertices represent the habitat areas and
arcs represent a probability of connection between two areas that depend on the
quality of the respective corridor. We propose a new generalized flow model
that improves existing models for this problem and an efficient preprocessing
algorithm that reduces the size of the graphs on which generalized flows is
computed. Reported numerical experiments highlight the benefice of these two
contributions on computation times and show that larger problems can be solved
using them. Our experiments also show that several variants of greedy
algorithms perform relatively well on practical instances while they return
arbitrary bad solutions in the worst case.

    <title>Strong Approximations and Irrationality in Financial Networks with Financial Derivatives</title>

Ioannidis, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Keijzer:Bart_de.html">Bart de Keijzer</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/v/Ventre:Carmine.html">Carmine Ventre</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06608">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Financial networks model a set of financial institutions (firms)
interconnected by obligations. Recent work has introduced to this model a class
of obligations called credit default swaps, a certain kind of financial
derivatives. The main computational challenge for such systems is known as the
clearing problem, which is to determine which firms are in default and to
compute their exposure to systemic risk, technically known as their recovery
rates. It is known that the recovery rates form the set of fixed points of a
simple function, and that these fixed points can be irrational. Furthermore,
Schuldenzucker et al. (2016) have shown that finding a weakly (or "almost")
approximate (rational) fixed point is PPAD-complete.
</p>
<p>In light of the above, we further study the clearing problem from the point
of view of irrationality and approximation strength. Firstly, as weakly
approximate solutions are hard to justify for financial institutions, we study
the complexity of finding a strongly (or "near") approximate solution, and show
FIXP-completeness. Secondly, we study the structural properties required for
irrationality, and we give necessary conditions for irrational solutions to
emerge: The presence of certain types of cycles in a financial network forces
the recovery rates to take the form of roots of second- or higher-degree
polynomials. In the absence of a large subclass of such cycles, we study the
complexity of finding an exact fixed point, which we show to be a problem close
to, albeit outside of, PPAD.

We
prove that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$ and
$x_1,\ldots,x_n\in L_p(\mu)$ with $\big\| \max_{i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}} |x_i|

$$\forall \ i,j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}, \qquad \|x_i-x_j\|^p_{L_p(\mu)}- \varepsilon
\leq \|y_i-y_j\|_{\ell_p^d}^p \leq \|x_i-x_j\|^p_{L_p(\mu)}+\varepsilon.$$
Moreover, the argument implies the existence of a greedy algorithm which
outputs $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ after receiving $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ as input. The proof
relies on a derandomized version of Maurey's empirical method (1981) combined
with a combinatorial idea of Ball (1990) and classical factorization theory of
$L_p(\mu)$ spaces. Motivated by the above embedding, we introduce the notion of
$\varepsilon$-isometric dimension reduction of the unit ball ${\bf B}_E$ of a

solution of a problem to another while always maintaining feasibility, have
been extensively studied. Most research has dealt with the decision problem of
whether a reconfiguration schedule exists, and the complexity of finding one. A
prime example is the reconfiguration of vertex covers. We initiate the study of
batched vertex cover reconfiguration, which allows to reconfigure multiple
vertices concurrently while requiring that any adversarial reconfiguration
order within a batch maintains feasibility. The latter provides robustness,
e.g., if the simultaneous reconfiguration of a batch cannot be guaranteed. The
quality of a schedule is measured by the number of batches until all nodes are
reconfigured, and its cost, i.e., the maximum size of an intermediate vertex
cover.
</p>
<p>To set a baseline for batch reconfiguration, we show that for graphs
belonging to one of the classes $\{\mathsf{cycles, trees, forests, chordal,
cactus, even\text{-}hole\text{-}free, claw\text{-}free}\}$, there are schedules
that use $O(\varepsilon^{-1})$ batches and incur only a $1+\varepsilon$
multiplicative increase in cost over the best sequential schedules. Our main
contribution is to compute such batch schedules in $O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log^*
n)$ distributed time, which we also show to be tight. Further, we show that
once we step out of these graph classes we face a very different situation.
There are graph classes on which no efficient distributed algorithm can obtain
the best (or almost best) existing schedule. Moreover, there are classes of
bounded degree graphs which do not admit any reconfiguration schedules without
incurring a large multiplicative increase in the cost at all.

    <title>Beyond Distributed Subgraph Detection: Induced Subgraphs, Multicolored Problems and Graph Parameters</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1631664000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Korhonen:Janne_H=.html">Janne H. Korhonen</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nikabadi:Amir.html">Amir Nikabadi</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06561">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Subgraph detection has recently been one of the most studied problems in the
CONGEST model of distributed computing. In this work, we study the distributed
complexity of problems closely related to subgraph detection, mainly focusing
on induced subgraph detection. The main line of this work presents lower bounds
and parameterized algorithms w.r.t structural parameters of the input graph:
</p>
<p>-- On general graphs, we give unconditional lower bounds for induced
detection of cycles and patterns of treewidth 2 in CONGEST. Moreover, by
adapting reductions from centralized parameterized complexity, we prove lower
bounds in CONGEST for detecting patterns with a 4-clique, and for induced path
detection conditional on the hardness of triangle detection in the congested
clique.
</p>
<p>-- On graphs of bounded degeneracy, we show that induced paths can be
detected fast in CONGEST using techniques from parameterized algorithms, while
detecting cycles and patterns of treewidth 2 is hard.
</p>
<p>-- On graphs of bounded vertex cover number, we show that induced subgraph
detection is easy in CONGEST for any pattern graph. More specifically, we adapt
a centralized parameterized algorithm for a more general maximum common induced
subgraph detection problem to the distributed setting.
</p>
<p>In addition to these induced subgraph detection results, we study various
related problems in the CONGEST and congested clique models, including for
multicolored versions of subgraph-detection-like problems.

    <title>Domain Sparsification of Discrete Distributions using Entropic Independence</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1631664000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Anari:Nima.html">Nima Anari</a>, Michał Dereziński <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06442">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present a framework for speeding up the time it takes to sample from
discrete distributions $\mu$ defined over subsets of size $k$ of a ground set
of $n$ elements, in the regime $k\ll n$. We show that having estimates of
marginals $\mathbb{P}_{S\sim \mu}[i\in S]$, the task of sampling from $\mu$ can
be reduced to sampling from distributions $\nu$ supported on size $k$ subsets
of a ground set of only $n^{1-\alpha}\cdot \operatorname{poly}(k)$ elements.
Here, $1/\alpha\in [1, k]$ is the parameter of entropic independence for $\mu$.
Further, the sparsified distributions $\nu$ are obtained by applying a sparse
(mostly $0$) external field to $\mu$, an operation that often retains
algorithmic tractability of sampling from $\nu$. This phenomenon, which we dub
domain sparsification, allows us to pay a one-time cost of estimating the
marginals of $\mu$, and in return reduce the amortized cost needed to produce
many samples from the distribution $\mu$, as is often needed in upstream tasks
such as counting and inference.
</p>
<p>For a wide range of distributions where $\alpha=\Omega(1)$, our result
reduces the domain size, and as a corollary, the cost-per-sample, by a
$\operatorname{poly}(n)$ factor. Examples include monomers in a monomer-dimer
system, non-symmetric determinantal point processes, and partition-constrained
Strongly Rayleigh measures. Our work significantly extends the reach of prior
work of Anari and Derezi\'nski who obtained domain sparsification for
distributions with a log-concave generating polynomial (corresponding to
$\alpha=1$). As a corollary of our new analysis techniques, we also obtain a
less stringent requirement on the accuracy of marginal estimates even for the
case of log-concave polynomials; roughly speaking, we show that constant-factor
approximation is enough for domain sparsification, improving over $O(1/k)$
relative error established in prior work.

    <title>Symbolic determinant identity testing and non-commutative ranks of matrix Lie algebras</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/i/Ivanyos:G=aacute=bor.html">Gábor Ivanyos</a>, Tushant Mittal, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/q/Qiao:Youming.html">Youming Qiao</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06403">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>One approach to make progress on the symbolic determinant identity testing
(SDIT) problem is to study the structure of singular matrix spaces. After
settling the non-commutative rank problem (Garg-Gurvits-Oliveira-Wigderson,
Found. Comput. Math. 2020; Ivanyos-Qiao-Subrahmanyam, Comput. Complex. 2018), a
natural next step is to understand singular matrix spaces whose non-commutative
rank is full. At present, examples of such matrix spaces are mostly sporadic,
so it is desirable to discover them in a more systematic way.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we make a step towards this direction, by studying the family
of matrix spaces that are closed under the commutator operation, that is matrix
Lie algebras. On the one hand, we demonstrate that matrix Lie algebras over the
complex number field give rise to singular matrix spaces with full
non-commutative ranks. On the other hand, we show that SDIT of such spaces can
be decided in deterministic polynomial time. Moreover, we give a
characterization for the matrix Lie algebras to yield a matrix space possessing
singularity certificates as studied by Lov'asz (B. Braz. Math. Soc., 1989) and
Raz and Wigderson (Building Bridges II, 2019).

fundamental algorithmic problem that has applications to three important
database applications, namely, data stream processing, space-efficient
histogram maintenance (SEHM), and approximate nearest neighbor searches (ANNS).
In this work, we propose a novel dyadic simulation framework and develop three
novel ERS solutions, namely Gaussian-dyadic simulation tree (DST), Cauchy-DST
and Random Walk-DST, using it. We also propose novel rejection sampling
techniques to make these solutions computationally efficient. Furthermore, we
develop a novel k-wise independence theory that allows our ERS solutions to
have both high computational efficiencies and strong provable independence
guarantees.

    <summary>We study a simple and general template for constructing affine extractors by composing a linear transformation with resilient functions. Using this we show that good affine extractors can be computed by non-explicit circuits of various types, including AC0-Xor circuits: AC0 circuits with a layer of parity gates at the input. We also show that one-sided extractor can be computed by small DNF-Xor circuits, and separate these circuits from other well-studied classes. As a further motivation for studying DNF-Xor circuits we show that if they can approximate inner product then small AC0-Xor circuits can compute it exactly – a long-standing open problem.</summary>

<p>
Scott Aaronson is one of the top researchers in complexity theory and especially in quantum computing. He is famous for more than his research, he is famous also for his blog <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?m=202109">Shtetl-Optimized</a>. Its scope includes just about everything that touches on complexity theory, but includes many topics that span just about anything that is interesting these days.</p>
<p>
For a whole week, he has had the topic: <i>Exciting opportunities at Kabul University!</i> </p>
<p>
Scott is kidding about Kabul of course. Rather, his topic is the recent Texas law against abortion. Here are his initial comments: </p>
<blockquote><p>
Now, of course, Texas has effectively outlawed abortion—well, after the 6th week, which is before many women even realize they’re pregnant, and when the fetus is still the size of a grain of rice…</p>
<p>
There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and—this is the “novel” part—there’s a bounty system, with $10,000 fines for anyone who helps in any way with an abortion, payable to anyone who snitches on them. Texas has openly defied Roe v. Wade and, for the first time in half a century, has gotten five Supreme Court justices (three appointed by Donald Trump) to go along with it. Roe v. Wade is de facto no longer the law of the United States.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We will not talk about abortion, but rather the novel aspect of the Texas law. This will not lead to quantum computing, not even along lines of a famous SMBC <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3">cartoon</a> that Scott created with Zach Weinersmith, from which we give the second panel:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/the-talk/" rel="attachment wp-att-19098"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19098" height="270" src="https://i2.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/the-talk.jpg?resize=480%2C270&amp;ssl=1" width="480"/></a></p>
<p>
We promise it will lead to some math, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What can we do to stop the Texas law? Many are worried that the fact that the US Supreme Court has refused to even temporarily block the Texas law is unheard of. Does this mean that the new Texas law somehow is valid? Does this mean that abortions will be made illegal? Not clear.</p>
<p>
One part of the Texas law is clever—we can disagree with it and still note that the new law is clever. The law does not give the usual suspects to the local law enforcement, who are usually the ones responsible to enforce the law. Rather the law insists that anyone can raise the issue that X has violated the law against an abortion. Say S raises that X helped make an abortion happen. Then S gets $10,000 payment provided the case is upheld in court. Scott calls S the <i>snitches</i>. </p>
<p>
As recognized by the Emergency Medical Network (Emnet), this step in moving the enforcement from the usual police to the general public is one of the reasons the Texas law is so hard to fight. The usual way to challenge a new law is to immediately file some counter suit stopping those charged with enforcement. This seems to be impossible with this trick. Who can be S?—by construction that could be just about anyone. There is no single body to force to defend the law in court. Clever.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law—The Trick </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are experts in theory of computation. Can we use that ability to find a way to attack the new <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961">law</a>? Can we see any weakness that is inherent in the law? Some trick? Or is the Texas idea somehow a breakthrough in ways to state a law against abortion?</p>
<p>
Ken and I have an insight. A standard trick in theory is given a new idea can we generalize it. If we can use the new idea to solve other problems then we should shed some light on the new idea. If the idea is too powerful, then we essentially prove that it cannot work in general. If it does work elsewhere, then we can use it to solve previous unsolved problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law for Speeding </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Cars speeding is a serious problem just about everywhere. I live in a rural area and it is 35 mph here. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/attachment/35/" rel="attachment wp-att-19100"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19100" height="114" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/35.png?resize=196%2C114&amp;ssl=1" width="196"/></a></p>
<p>
Yet when I am driving I am often passed by cars that cross a yellow line going 50 or faster. The issue is that the laws insist that some officer witness a violation. But since that rarely happens, the speeders almost always get no ticket.</p>
<p>
Let’s use the same trick that is used in the new Texas law. If a car races by me then I will send a digital message to the police that says: “Today I was driving my car number <b>1236335356</b> at time <b>11:19.42am</b> and witnessed a car with plate number <b>ERRW5365</b> speeding at <b>55.11mph</b> while passing me. I was at location …</p>
<p>
This would be sent to the police and they would then have the task of checking it out. Provided it checks out, I would be awarded a bounty of $500, say. And the speeder would get a fine and …</p>
<p>
How could I prove the speed? I wouldn’t have time to take a video in the moment. But Ken’s smartphone—and those of many of his colleagues—have an app that is solving problems of this type 24/7. His is a University at Buffalo product but there are many similar ones. Quoting the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/pocketcares.html">website</a> makes everything quickly clear:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> PocketCare S is a bluetooth low energy (BLE) solution which enables smartphones to send and receive anonymous beacon signals. It checks the distance between a smartphone and another beacon (or smartphone running PocketCare S) … [and] … records the duration a close encounter with another beacon. PocketCare S is designed to report social distance information without collecting or revealing any personally identifiable information about any specific individual. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The car would only need to have a detectable beacon, not the same app—and the info giving proof of speed over said duration might already be in the authorities’ data banks even before the complaint is filed.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Bipartite Epidemiology? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Of course, what we are trying to say is that this kind of lawsuit would become a new kind of virus. It might extend to many other transgressions besides speeding. What strikes us further is that this would assume a binary structure that we do not know to exist in medical pandemics.</p>
<p>
The first point is that the people who voted for the Texas law believe they are not the ones who would be violating it. Call them Team A. The remaining people—Team 2—would want to get back at them. Maybe speeding is an equal vice for those two teams, so that wouldn’t work. We’ve seen suggestions like Team B suing for open-carry of firearms. Let us just suppose Team B finds something.</p>
<p>
The second point is that a “snitch” lawsuit is like one person infecting another. But unlike our present pandemic, it’s one where people in A can only infect those in B, and vice versa. We have a bipartite graph <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. How does this change the math?</p>

One issue noted by Scott in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5807#comment-1908708">comment</a> is whether the law allows someone to be sued multiple times. If not, then being sued once would be like acquiring immunity. The US recognizes principles of “no double jeopardy” but the Texas law appears to avoid them. </p>
<p>
We’ve tried to look for related analysis of the popular college “Humans Versus Zombies” (<a href="https://humansvszombies.org/">HvZ</a>) game. But in that game, the zombies only increase. <em>Scientific American</em> once published an <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/modelling-a-werewolf-epidemic-2/">analysis</a> titled, “Modelling a werewolf epidemic” that also mentioned zombies. But it did not say the werewolves could only infect zombies and vice-versa. </p>
<p>
Binary infection situations do of course exist when two groups of people suddenly mix, each having already acquired resistance to a disease that infects the other. There have been great tragedies when the mixing was a relatively small number of A colonizing into B. But we still do not know of models that would apply when the kinds of “infections” involve spontaneously arise <em>en masse</em> in the manner of a pandemic with high <img alt="{R_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> factor—as might happen if the courts really legitimize this kind of “snitch suit” law.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is this type of snitching a viable adjunct to law enforcement for speeding? Could it save lives? What about the associated dimension of propagating personal information into massive repositories?</p>

    <title>TR21-136 |  LCC and LDC: Tailor-made distance amplification and a refined separation | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Tal Yankovitz</title>
    <summary>The Alon-Edmonds-Luby distance amplification procedure (FOCS 1995) is an algorithm that transforms a code with vanishing distance to a code with constant distance. AEL was invoked by Kopparty, Meir, Ron-Zewi, and Saraf (J. ACM 2017) for obtaining their state-of-the-art LDC, LCC and LTC. Cohen and Yankovitz (CCC 2021) devised a  procedure that can amplify inverse-polynomial distances, exponentially extending the regime of distances that can be amplified by AEL. However, the improved procedure only works for LDC and assuming rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log n}$.

In this work we devise a distance amplification procedure for LCC with inverse-polynomial distances even for vanishing rate $\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. For LDC, we obtain a more modest improvement and require rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. Thus, the tables have turned and it is now LCC that can be better amplified. Our key idea for accomplishing this, deviating from prior work, is to tailor the distance amplification procedure to the code at hand.

Our second result concerns the relation between linear LDC and LCC. We prove the existence of linear LDC that are not LCC, qualitatively extending a separation by Kaufman and Viderman (RANDOM 2010).</summary>

    <title>TR21-135 |  Strong (D)QBF Dependency Schemes via Implication-free Resolution Paths | 

	Tomáš Peitl, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff, 

	Joshua Blinkhorn</title>
    <summary>We suggest a general framework to study dependency schemes for dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBF). As our main contribution, we exhibit a new infinite collection of implication-free DQBF dependency schemes that generalise the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme. We establish soundness of all these schemes, implying that they can be used in any DQBF proof system. We further explore the power of QBF and DQBF resolution systems parameterised by implication-free dependency schemes and show that the hierarchical structure naturally present among the dependency schemes translates isomorphically to a hierarchical structure of parameterised proof systems with respect to p-simulation. As a special case, we demonstrate that our new schemes are exponentially stronger than the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in Q-resolution, thus resulting in the strongest QBF dependency schemes known to date.</summary>

    <link href="http://benjamin-recht.github.io/2021/09/13/effect-size/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Effect size is significantly more important than statistical significance.</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Mask_RCT____Symptomatic_Seropositivity_083121.pdf">A massive cluster-randomized controlled trial run in Bangladesh to test the efficacy of mask wearing on reducing coronavirus transmission</a> released its initial results and the covid pundits have been buzzing with excitement. There have already been too many hot takes on the report, but, after wrangling with the 94 pages, I came to a different conclusion than most who have used this study as evidence for their mask predilections. I worry that because of statistical ambiguity, there’s not much that can be deduced at all.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh mask study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Rather than randomizing patients, this study randomized villages. Though the sample size looked enormous (340,000 individuals), the effective number of samples was only 600 because the treatment was applied to individual villages. Villages were paired using demographic attributes and one of each pair was randomly assigned to an intervention and the other to no intervention. The 300 intervention villages received free masks, information on the importance of masking, role modeling by community leaders, and in-person reminders for 8 weeks. The 300 villages in the control group did not receive any interventions.</p>

<p>The goal was to determine how much these interventions contributed to patients who both reported symptoms, subsequently consented to antibody testing, and tested positive. The study reports the precise number of people who report symptoms down to the single person (13,273 in treatment, 13,893 in control). The study reports the precise number of symptomatic people who consented to blood draws (5,414 in treatment, 5,538 in control). And the study reports the precise number of blood draws that were tested for covid antibodies (5,006  in treatment, 4,971 in control). But here’s where the picture gets murky: The number of actual positive tests appears nowhere in the preprint.</p>

<p>The study reports that 0.76% of the people in the control villages were symptomatic and seropositive whereas 0.69% of the people in the treatment villages were symptomatic and seropositive. This corresponds to about a 1.1 fold reduction in risk, and this result was deemed by the authors to be statistically significant.</p>

<p>Where do these seropositivity percentages come from? The paper does not make clear what is being counted. Do the authors compute the number of cases in treatment divided by the number of individuals treated? Or do they compute the prevalence in each cluster and average these up? These two different estimates of prevalence can give different answers. For instance, we can imagine a simplified scenario with two clusters. Let’s say one treatment-control pair consists of two villages with 10,000 people each and pair two consists of villages with 6,000 people. In the larger treatment village, there is an outbreak with 136 cases, but in the smaller treatment village there are no cases. In the control villages, the larger village observes 75 cases and the smaller 46 cases. If we count over the number of individuals, then the prevalence ratio is 1.1 in favor of the control arm. However, if we first compute prevalence at the village level and then average these estimates, we find a prevalence ratio of 1.1 in favor of the treatment arm. But which is better? Reducing prevalence at the village level or the population level? This question is especially difficult when the actual magnitude of the outcome is so small. In either case we are talking about a difference of 15 cases between the treatment and control villages in a population of 32,000 individuals.</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="illustration of how different summary statistics can yield different effect sizes." src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/mask_cluster.png" width="75%"/></p>

<p>When effect sizes are small and sensitive to measurement, convention compels us to find refuge in an argument over statistical significance. So let’s then examine how significance is derived in the working paper. The authors say that they model the count of symptomatic seropositive individuals as a “a generalized linear model (GLM) with a normal family and identity link.” This is a fancy way of saying that they modeled the count as if it were sampled from a normal distribution and ran ordinary least-squares regression. Based on the captions on the tables, it appears that they modeled the rate of symptomatic seroprevalence in each village as a normal distribution whose mean is a function of the village cluster and some other covariates. They then apparently computed estimates of village level seroprevalence under the model and averaged these estimates to yield a final estimate of seroprevalence in treatment and control.</p>

<p>While the Gaussian model made the authors’ coding simple and allowed them to report results in standard econometric formatting, the model is also certainly wrong. Counts cannot be normally distributed as normal random variables as they cannot take negative values. Indeed, 36 out of the 300 villages had zero infections, and such an event is exceedingly unlikely when the distribution is well-approximated by a Gaussian. Rather than adjust their modeling assumptions, the authors just removed these villages from the regression, leading to an overestimate of the average seroprevalence.</p>

<p>The report computes p-values and confidence intervals from these regressions. What exactly do these quantities mean? P-values and confidence intervals associated with a regression are valid <em>only if the model is true</em>. What if the model is not true? If the model is wrong, the error bars are meaningless. And if the confidence intervals and p-values are meaningless, then I’m not sure what we can conclude.</p>

<p>The authors provided several robustness checks to fend off claims like mine. They also estimated the effect using a non-preregistered model which modeled the count as being Poisson distributed and found the effects were similar. Again, however, modeling infectious diseases with Poisson distributions is not realistic. A Poisson distribution models independent events that occur with some fixed rate. Such models are reasonable for modeling noninfectious diseases such as heart attacks, but we know that infections do not occur as random independent events: interactions with other sick individuals creates complex dynamic spread and the epidemic curves we see far too often thrown around online. Mathematically, it is not surprising that two models yield the same estimated effect sizes: they are both generalized linear models and their estimates are computed with similar algorithms.  But since both models are wrong, it’s not clear why including both provides much in the way of reassurance.</p>

<p>Rather than providing all of this statistical analysis, why not report the unadjusted counts of positive individuals for the reader to interpret? Especially considering that symptoms were reported precisely down to the person.</p>

<p>It’s useful to compare this mask study to the RCTs for vaccines. Vaccine studies are fortunate to be the purest of randomized controlled trials. If RCTs are a “gold standard” for causal inference, then vaccine studies are the “gold standard” of RCTs. Vaccines trials are easy to blind, almost always have clinical equipoise, only measure direct effects on individuals that can be nearly uniformly sampled from the world’s population, and are trivial to verify statistically. Looking at the example of the Pfizer vaccine, the effect size was enormous (20x risk reduction) and the confidence intervals were just based on exact calculations for independent, binary random variables. And the CIs didn’t matter much because the effect size was so large. You could just stare at the Kaplan-Meier curve and bask in the amazing effectiveness of MRNA vaccines.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, of course, most effect sizes are not factor of 20. Indeed, they are usually less than a factor of 2. As we saw in the mask study, the effect size was less than a factor of 1.1. I’m picking on the mask study only because it has been so attention grabbing.  It’s a convenient example to illustrate how statistical modeling can muddy the waters in randomized control trials. But it is only one of many examples I’ve come across in the past few months. If you pick a random paper out of the New England Journal of Medicine or the American Economic Review, you will likely find similar statistical muddiness.</p>

<p>We lose sight of the forest for the trees when we fight over p-values rather than considering effect sizes. Ernest Rutherford is famously quoted proclaiming “If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.” Rutherford, who discovered the structure of the atom, and is famous for pioneering innovations in experiment design and measurement for amplifying small effects. He was not opposed to probing the minuscule, but was interested in how to best produce empirical evidence.</p>

<p>I think a milder version of Rutherford’s aphorism should guide scientific investigation: If the effect size is so small that we need sophisticated statistics, maybe that means the effect isn’t real. Using sophisticated statistical scaffolding clouds our judgement. We end up using statistical methods as a crutch, not to dig signals out of noise, but to convince ourselves of signals when there are none. And this matters for recommendations on policy. If the effects of an intervention are modest at best, and only manifest themselves after statistical correction, how can we use such a study to guide policy?</p>

<p>Misapplication of statistics can lead to bad policy decisions. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121867148093738861">Medical devices can be approved even when the statistics are done in error</a>.  And statistical errors can even <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/23/astrazeneca-may-have-used-outdated-information-in-announcing-covid19-vaccine-results/">dampen confidence in effective vaccines</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, there is an existential problem arguing for large effect sizes. If most effect sizes are small or zero, then most interventions are useless. And this forces us scientists to confront our cosmic impotence, which remains a humbling and frustrating experience.</p>

<p>I’ve probably been thinking too much about statistics and models. I’m not the first mid-career professor to realize that statistical modeling is widely misapplied (For example <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/308/6924/283">Doug Altman</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/statistical-models-and-causal-inference/7CE8D4957FF6E9615AAAC4128FA8246E">David Freedman</a>, or <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~amshaikh/webfiles/multiplereview.pdf">Joseph Romano</a>, among many others). But I’m hoping to write more about this with a bit of an algorithmic lens, discussing some of the earlier worries about modeling in the process. Can we revisit suggestions for improving our evidentiary framework with contemporary computational statistics tools? Where might this lead us in both the experimental sciences and in machine learning?</p></div>

    <title>TR21-134 |  A refinement of the Meyer-McCreight Union Theorem | 

	Siddharth Bhaskar</title>
    <summary>For a function $t : 2^\star \to 1^\star$, let $C_t$ be the set of problems decidable on input $x$ in time at most $t(x)$ almost everywhere.  The Union Theorem of Meyer and McCreight asserts that any union $\bigcup_{i &lt; \omega} C_{t_i}$ for a uniformly recursive sequence of bounds $t_i$ is equal to $C_L$ for some single recursive function $L$. In particular the class PTIME of polynomial-time relations can be expressed as $C_L$ for some total recursive function $L : 2^\star \to 1^\star$. By controlling the complexity of the construction, we show that in fact PTIME equals $C_L$ for some $L$ computable in quasi-polynomial time.</summary>

    <title>TR21-133 |  Testing Distributions of Huge Objects | 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Dana Ron</title>
    <summary>We initiate a study of a new model of property testing that is a hybrid of testing properties of distributions and testing properties of strings. 
Specifically, the new model refers to testing properties of distributions, but these are distributions over huge objects (i.e., very long strings). 
Accordingly, the model accounts for the total number of local probes into these objects (resp., queries to the strings)as well as for the distance between objects (resp., strings).
Specifically, the distance between distributions is defined as the earth mover's distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance between strings.

We study the query complexity of testing in this new model, focusing on three directions.
First, we try to relate the query complexity of testing properties in the new model to the sample complexity of testing these properties in the standard distribution testing model.
Second, we consider the complexity of testing properties that arise naturally in the new model (e.g., distributions that capture random variations of fixed strings).
Third, we consider the complexity of testing properties that were extensively studied in the standard distribution testing model: Two such cases are uniform distributions
and pairs of identical distributions, where we obtain the following results.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Testing whether a distribution over $n$-bit long strings is uniform on some set of size $m$ can be tested with query complexity ${\widetilde O}(m/\epsilon^3)$, where $\epsilon&gt;(\log_2m)/n$ is the proximity parameter.
\item
Testing whether two distribution over $n$-bit long strings that have support size at most $m$ are identical can be tested  with query complexity ${\widetilde O}(m^{2/3}/\epsilon^3)$.
\end{itemize}
Both upper bounds are pretty tight; that is, for $\epsilon=\Omega(1)$, the first task requires $\Omega(m^c)$ queries for any $c&lt;1$ and $n=\omega(\log m)$, whereas the second task requires $\Omega(m^{2/3})$ queries.
Note that the query complexity of the first task is higher than the sample complexity of the corresponding task in the standard distribution testing model, whereas in the case of the second task the bounds almost match.</summary>

    <title>TR21-132 |  Pseudo-random functions and uniform learnability | 

	Eric Binnendyk</title>
    <summary>Boolean circuits are a model of computation. A class of Boolean circuits is called a polynomial class if the number of nodes is bounded by a polynomial function of the number of input variables. A class $C_n[s(n)]$ of Boolean functions is called learnable if there are algorithms that can approximate functions in $C_n[s(n)]$ when given oracle access to the function. A distribution $D$ of functions is called pseudorandom against a circuit class $C[t(n)]$ if any oracle circuit $C^f$ from $C[t(n)]$ outputs 1 with the same probability if the oracle $f$ is chosen from $D$ as it would if the oracle were random. It is known that a polynomial class of circuits is learnable if and only if it contains no pseudorandom distributions of functions. However, there is no known algorithm to produce the learner given the number of inputs the circuits have (the learner is non-uniform). I investigate a uniform version of the min-max theorem as a possible tool to find an algorithm for such learners.</summary>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: How do molecules, cells and synapses effect reasoning, intelligence, planning, language? Despite dazzling progress in experimental neuroscience, as well as in cognitive science at the other extreme of scale, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarching question: the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to be required. As Richard Axel recently put it: “We don’t have a logic for the transformation of neural activity into thought […].”</p>



<p>What kind of formal system would qualify as this “logic”?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I will introduce the Assembly Calculus (AC), a computational system which appears to be a promising bridge between neurons and cognition. Through this programming framework, a Parser was recently implemented which (a) can handle reasonably complex sentences of English and other languages, and (b) works exclusively through the spiking of neurons.</p>

    <title>TR21-131 |  QCDCL with Cube Learning or Pure Literal Elimination - What is best? | 

	Benjamin Böhm, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff</title>
    <summary>Quantified conflict-driven clause learning (QCDCL) is one of the main approaches for solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). We formalise and investigate several versions of QCDCL that include cube learning and/or pure-literal elimination, and formally compare the resulting solving models via proof complexity techniques. Our results show that almost all of the QCDCL models are exponentially incomparable with respect to proof size (and hence solver running time), pointing towards different orthogonal ways how to practically implement QCDCL.</summary>

    <title>TR21-130 |  Matrix hypercontractivity, streaming algorithms and LDCs: the large alphabet case | 

	Srinivasan Arunachalam, 

	João F. Doriguello</title>
    <summary>Hypercontractive inequalities for real-valued functions over the Boolean cube play an important role in theoretical computer science. In this work, we prove a hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions defined over large alphabets, generalizing the result of Ben-Aroya, Regev, de Wolf (FOCS'08) for the Boolean alphabet. To obtain our result we prove a generalization of the powerful $2$-uniform convexity inequality for trace norms of Ball, Carlen, Lieb (Inventiones Mathematicae'94). We give two applications of this hypercontractive inequality.
    
Locally decodable codes: we present a lower bound for locally decodable codes (LDC) over large alphabets. An LDC $C:\mathbb{Z}_r^n\to \mathbb{Z}_r^N$ is an encoding of $x\in \mathbb{Z}_r^n$ into a codeword $C(x)$ in such a way that one can recover an arbitrary $x_i\in \mathbb{Z}_r$ (with probability at least $1/r+\varepsilon$) by making only a few queries to a corrupted codeword. The main question in LDCs is the trade-off between $N$ and $n$. By using hypercontractivity, we give an exponential lower bound $N= 2^{\Omega(\varepsilon^4 n/r^4)}$ for $2$-query (possibly non-linear) LDCs over $\mathbb{Z}_r$. Previously exponential lower bounds were known for $r=2$ (Kerenidis and de Wolf (JCSS'04)) and for \emph{linear} codes (Dvir and Shpilka (SICOMP'07)).
    
Streaming algorithms: we present upper and lower bounds for the communication complexity of the Hidden Hypermatching problem when defined over large alphabets, which generalizes the well-known Boolean Hidden Matching problem. We then consider streaming algorithms for approximating the value of Unique Games on a $t$-hyperedge hypergraph: in this direction a simple edge-counting argument gives an $r$-approximation with $O(\log n)$ space. On the other hand, we use our communication lower bound to show that every streaming algorithm in the adversarial model achieving a $(r-\varepsilon)$-approximation of this value requires $\Omega(n^{1-1/t})$ classical space or $\Omega(n^{1-2/t})$ quantum space. In this setting, these results simplify and generalize the seminal work of Kapralov, Khanna and Sudan (SODA'15) and Kapravol and Krachun (STOC'19) for the case $r=2$.</summary>

    <title>The Death of Expertise</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Four years ago I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/01/learning-about-learning.html">tried to catch up with deep learning</a> and this summer I aimed to try to catch up again. Who would've thought 2017 is ancient history.</p><p>I watched the lectures in the <a href="http://introtodeeplearning.com/">latest MIT course</a>, played with GPT-3 and Codex, read the new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258">Stanford manifesto</a> on what they call foundation models, models trained that can preform on a wide range of tasks instead of a single goal. We've seen machine learning solve protein folding, detect cancer from x-rays better than radiologists, not to mention effectively solving many of the traditional AI problems (language translation, voice and face recognition, game playing, etc.) Watching Codex generate computer code from plain English is a game changer. Far from perfect but this technology is in its infancy.</p><p>From what I can tell, the main technological advances focus on learning when we don't have labelled data such as new techniques to transfer knowledge to new domains and using generative models to provide more data to train ML algorithms.</p><p>The trend to worry us all is that deep learning algorithms in the long run seem to do better if we limit or eliminate previous human knowledge from the equation. The game playing algorithms now train from just the rules alone (or even just the outcomes). We do use some knowledge: words come in some linear order, faces have hierarchical features, but not much more than that. Human expertise can help as we start solving a problem, even just to know that good solutions look like, but then it often gets in the way.</p><p>When we longer use a skill we tend to lose it, like my ability to navigate from a good map. If we eliminate expertise we may find it very difficult to get it back.</p><p>There's a more personal issue--people spend their entire careers creating their expertise in some area, and that expertise is often a source of pride and a source of income. If someone comes along and tells you that expertise is no longer needed, or even worse irrelevant or that it gets in the way, you might feel protective, and under guise of our expertise tear down the learning algorithm. That attitude will just make us more irrelevant--better to use our expertise to guide the machine learning models to overcome their limitations. </p><p>You can't stop progress, but you can shape it.</p></div>

<p>First, the macabre.  Not that there is any shortage in the news, but the book also contains macabreness of a kind I did not expect.</p>



<p>Second, the drive for scientific research.  It always makes for a compelling read when the reader is a scientist.  And here it is also tinted with adventure.</p>



<p>Third, (recent) history.  As I hinted in some previous posts, I started reading history in my late 20’s, as an unbelievably blank slate, and I haven’t stopped.  It is not clear it is very consequential for the present, but sometimes it’s good to know how things “evolve.”</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the second week of July, 2022, there will be a <a href="http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/summer-schools/graduate-summer-school-on-algorithmic-fairness-workshop-on-sex-and-gender-bias-in-data/">summer school on algorithmic fairness</a> at IPAM, on the UCLA campus, with Cynthia Dwork and Guy Rothblum among the lecturers. Applications (see the above link) are due by March 11, 2022.</p>
<p>We will soon put up a call for nominations for the test of time award to be given at FOCS 2021 (which will take place in Boulder, Colorado, in early 2022). There are three award categories, recognizing, respectively, papers from FOCS 2011, FOCS 2001, and FOCS 1991. In each category, it is also possible to nominate older papers, up to four years before the target conference. For example, for the thirty-year category, it is possible to nominate papers from FOCS 1987, FOCS 1988, FOCS 1989, FOCS 1990, in addition to the target conference FOCS 1991.</p>
<p>Nominations should be sent by October 31, 2021 to focs.tot.2021@gmail.com with a subject line of “FOCS Test of Time Award”. Nominations should contain an explanation of the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. Self-nominations are discouraged.</p>
<p>In the second week of November, 2021, the Simons Institute will host a workshop on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/si2021-3">using cryptographic assumptions to prove average-case hardness of problems in high-dimensional statistics</a>. This is such a new topic that the goal of the workshop will be more to explore new directions than to review known results, and we (think that we have) already invited all the authors of recent published work of this type. If you have proved results of this type, and you have not been invited (perhaps because your results are still unpublished?) and you would like to participate in the workshop, there is still space in the schedule so feel free to contact me or one of the other organizers. For both speakers and attendees, physical participation is preferred, but remote participation will be possible.</p></div>

One on group testing, another on distribution testing, yet another which makes progress on testing problems on decision trees and the last one on graph property testing. Without further ado, let’s dive in.  </p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Group Testing with Non-identical Infection Probabilities</strong> by Mustafa Doger, Sennur Ulukus (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12418">arXiv</a>) Consider the classic group testing problem. Here the setup is the following. You are given a bunch of individuals from a population \(\mathcal{P}\). You have an infection vector which records the infection status of each individual in the population where the \(i\)-th individual is infected with probability \(p_i\). You want to recover all the infected individuals. You are allowed to group individuals together and you can test the entire group in a single shot. If the group tests negative, you are happy all the tested individuals are off the hook. Otherwise, if the group tests positive, you need more tests for further classification. This paper proposes a greedy way to build pools of individuals you would test. The pools are built adaptively: as in future pools are built using the knowledge of how the preceding tests fared. The key result in the paper upperbounds the number of tests performed in terms of the entropy of the infection vector.</p>

<p><strong>Uniformity Testing in the Shuffle Model: Simpler, Better, Faster</strong> by Clément L. Canonne, Hongyi Lyu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08987">arXiv</a>) Differentially private distribution testing as a research area has been gathering momentum steadily over the last few years. If you read our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/08/new-for-july-2021/">last month’s post</a>, you might recall there are a wide variety of models of DP each corresponding to a different “threat model”. The most stringent among the most explored models is the “local model”, the least stringent being the “central model” and there is an intermediate threat model, the so called “<a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2020/05/news-for-april-2020/">shuffle model</a>“. This paper simplifies the analysis of uniformity testing algorithm under the shuffle model and presents an algorithm with sample complexity \(O(k^{3/4})\) for testing uniformity over a support of size \([k]\). </p>

<p><strong>On Learning and Testing Decision Tree</strong> by Nader H. Bshouty, Catherine A. Haddad-Zaknoon (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04587">arXiv</a>) In our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/01/news-for-december-2020/">December 2020</a> post, we covered a result of Blanc et al., which proves the following: Suppose you are given a boolean function \(f\) and the property \(\mathcal{P}\) of size-\(s\) decision trees. The result of Blanc et al gives you a function \(g \in \mathcal{P}\) with \(dist(f,g) = O(dist (f, \mathcal{P}))\) where \(g \in \) is guaranteed to have decision tree complexity \(s^{O(\log^2 s)}\). This result implies a bi-criteria tester for the following property: is \(f \in \mathcal{P}\) or is \(f\) \(\varepsilon\)-far from having decision tree complexity \(\phi(s) = s^{O(\log^3 s)}\). The current paper improves this result by presenting a property tester with \(\phi(s) = s^{O(\log^2 s)}\).   </p>

<p><strong>The complexity of testing all properties of planar graphs, and the role of isomorphism</strong> by Sabyasachi Basu, Akash Kumar, C. Seshadhri (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10547">arXiv</a>) <em>(Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of this paper)</em>. This paper presents a result that I, in my biased opinion, find interesting. So, here is the setup. You are given a bounded degree planar graph. And I cook up some God-forsaken property and ask you to test it. Turns out, no matter how devilishly I cooked up the property, you can test in with \(\exp(O(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) queries. The nice happenstance is that you also have a matching lower bound of \(\exp(\Omega(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) queries! And interestingly, this lower bound is witnessed by the very natural property of testing isomorphism to a fixed graph which means that isomorphism is the hardest property of  planar graphs.</p></div>

    <summary>A distribution is called $m$-grained if each element appears with probability that is an integer multiple of $1/m$.
We prove that, for any constant $c&lt;1$, testing whether a distribution over $[\Theta(m)]$ is $m$-grained requires $\Omega(m^c)$ samples.</summary>
