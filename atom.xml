The first part provides an introduction to the foundations of property testing. The second part studies the testing of specific properties on strings, graphs, functions, and constraint satisfaction problems. Vectors and matrices over real numbers are also covered. The third part is more advanced and explains general conditions, including full characterizations, under which properties are constant-query testable.</p><p>The first and second parts of the book are intended for first-year graduate students in computer science.

problem. Solving finite-horizon MDPs, on the other hand, is highly tractable
with well known polynomial-time algorithms. What drives this extreme disparity,
and do problems exist that lie between these diametrically opposed
complexities? In this paper we identify and analyse a sub-class of stochastic
shortest path problems (SSPs) for general state-action spaces whose dynamics
satisfy a particular drift condition. This construction generalises the
traditional, temporal notion of a horizon via decreasing reachability: a
property called reductivity. It is shown that optimal policies can be recovered
in polynomial-time for reductive SSPs -- via an extension of backwards
induction -- with an efficient analogue in reductive MDPs. The practical
considerations of the proposed approach are discussed, and numerical
verification provided on a canonical optimal liquidation problem.

systems operating with constant-depth algebraic circuits over fields of zero
characteristic. Specifically, we show that the subset-sum variant
$\sum_{i,j,k,\ell\in[n]} z_{ijk\ell}x_ix_j x_k x_\ell - \beta=0$, for Boolean
variables, does not have polynomial-size IPS refutations where the refutations
are multilinear and written as constant-depth circuits.
</p>
<p>Andrews and Forbes (STOC'22) established recently a constant-depth IPS lower
bound, but their hard instance does not have itself small constant-depth
circuits, while our instance is computable already with small depth-2 circuits.
</p>
<p>Our argument relies on extending the recent breakthrough lower bounds against
constant-depth algebraic circuits by Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas (FOCS'21)
to the functional lower bound framework of Forbes, Shpilka, Tzameret and
Wigderson (ToC'21), and may be of independent interest. Specifically, we
construct a polynomial $f$ computable with small-size constant-depth circuits,
such that the multilinear polynomial computing $1/f$ over Boolean values and
its appropriate set-multilinear projection are hard for constant-depth
circuits.

    <title>Gerrymandering Trees: Parameterized Hardness</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1652745600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Fraser:Andrew.html">Andrew Fraser</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Lavallee:Brian.html">Brian Lavallee</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sullivan:Blair_D=.html">Blair D. Sullivan</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06857">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In a representative democracy, elections involve partitioning geographical
space into districts which each elect a single representative. Legislation is
then determined by votes from these representatives, and thus political parties
are incentivized to win as many districts as possible (ideally a plurality).
Gerrymandering is the process by which these districts' boundaries are
manipulated to give favor to a certain candidate or party. Cohen-Zemach et al.
(AAMAS 2018) proposed Gerrymandering as a formalization of this problem on
graphs (as opposed to Euclidean space) where districts partition vertices into
connected subgraphs. More recently, Gupta et al. (SAGT 2021) studied its
parameterized complexity and gave an FPT algorithm for paths with respect to
the number of districts $k$. We prove that Gerrymandering is W[2]-hard on trees
(even when the depth is two) with respect to $k$, answering an open question of
Gupta et al. Moreover, we prove that Gerrymandering remains W[2]-hard in trees
with $\ell$ leaves with respect to the combined parameter $k+\ell$. To
complement this result, we provide an algorithm to solve Gerrymandering that is
FPT in $k$ when $\ell$ is a fixed constant.

Jeannette Wing is a Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University. She was recently <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/news/jeannette-wing-appointed-executive-vice-president-research">appointed</a> Executive VP for Research across all of Columbia’s campuses. She is also an adjunct Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. She stays busy. See <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~wing/">this</a> for her CV. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/16/take-wing/jw/" rel="attachment wp-att-20028"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20028" height="225" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jw.png?resize=225%2C225&amp;ssl=1" width="225"/></a></p>
<p>
Sixteen years ago she wrote a short <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/publications/Wing06.pdf">position</a> paper for <em>Communications of the ACM</em> titled “Computational Thinking.” It begins:</p>
<p>
<em><br/>
 Computational thinking builds on the power and limits of computing processes, whether they are executed by a human or by a machine.<br/>
</em></p>
<p>
This is the first of sixteen sentences of the form “Computational thinking [verb]…,” plus one that follows a semicolon. The thirteenth prefaces six bulleted paragraphs giving characteristics of computational thinking. They fill page 3 of 3—the paper is shorter to read than this post. </p>
<p>
Her 2007 <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/Computational_Thinking.pdf">talk</a> on “Computational Thinking” has oodles of things that aren’t in the paper: <em>pictures</em>. It also concludes by posing five questions that she put into another famous CACM paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Five Questions </b></p>
<p/><p>
This second <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2008/1/5481-five-deep-questions-in-computing/fulltext">paper</a> appeared in 2008 with the title “Five Deep Questions in Computing.” They are: </p>
<ol>
<li> P = NP?
</li><li> What is computable?
</li><li> What is intelligence?
</li><li> What is information?
</li><li> (How) can we build complex systems simply?
</li></ol>
<p>
The first is one of the basic questions of theory, of course. </p>
<p>
The next is about what are computations? This question complicates when one includes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_computing">DNA</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">quantum</a> computers? Also what about man-machine joint computations? Given that humans and machines have different computing capability, now ask: What is computable? Pretty complex.</p>
<p>
Let’s skip what is intelligence for now.</p>
<p>
What is information? This is a perfect question: Information is not just <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>‘s and <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>‘s. DNA encodes information in a different way and with quantum computing, it’s not bits but qubits. Amazing. </p>
<p>
Finally we will also skip the last question. </p>
<p>
She ends with:<br/>
<em><br/>
I pose these questions to stimulate deep thinking and further discussion. What deep questions about computing would you want answered? In 50 years, how different will they and their answers be from what we ask and are able to answer today?<br/>
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Data Science </b></p>
<p/><p>
Wing is a leading expert of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">data science</a>. This field is traceable back to 1962 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey">John Tukey</a> described an area he called “data analysis”. That is Tukey of Fast Fourier transform fame, who I knew when I was at Princeton. </p>
<p>
Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data.</p>
<p>
Her current research interests are in trustworthy AI. Her areas of research expertise include security and privacy, formal methods, programming languages, and distributed and concurrent systems. She is widely recognized for her intellectual leadership in computer science, and more recently in data science. Wing’s seminal essay, titled “Computational Thinking,” was published more than a fifteen years ago and is credited with helping to establish the centrality of computer science to problem-solving in all other disciplines.</p>
<p>
Data can be precious for one of three reasons: the data set is expensive to collect; the data set contains a rare event (low signal-to-noise ratio); or the data set is artisanal—small, task-specific, and/or targets a limited audience. </p>
<ul>
<li> A good example of expensive data comes from large, one-off, expensive scientific instruments, for example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Large Hadron Collider, and the IceCube Neutrino Detector at the South Pole.
</li><li> A good example of rare event data is data from sensors on physical infrastructure, such as bridges and tunnels; sensors produce a lot of raw data, but the disastrous event they are used to predict is (thankfully) rare. Rare data can also be expensive to collect.
</li><li> A good example of artisanal data is the tens of millions of court judgments that China has released online to the public since 2014.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Let’s take a cue from Wing: What other major aspects and objectives of computer science shall we put into crisp bullet points?</p>

    <title>Is Kamala Harris our first female PREZ? No. Do I have a theorem named after me. No. But in both cases...</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On Nov 19, 2021 Joe Biden got a colonoscopy and hence the 25th amendment was used to make Kamala Harris the president temporarily (this source: <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/19/biden-returns-to-white-house-after-physical-colonoscopy/">here</a> says 85 minutes, though I thought I heard a few hours from other sources). </p><p>Does this make Kamala Harris our first female president?</p><p>I would say NO and I suspect you agree. A friend of mine suggested the phrasing <i>Kamala Harris is the</i> <i>first women to assume the powers of the president under the 25th amendment.  </i>True.  I don't think it means much. She tacked on the <i>under the 25th amendment </i>since Edith Wilson was essentially president when Woodrow Wilson had a stroke (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Wilson#Increased_role_after_husband's_stroke">here</a>).</p><p><br/></p><p>A student asked me <i>Is there a theorem that is referred to as Gasarch's Theorem or something like that?</i></p><p>I will answer YES and NO, but really the answer is NO.</p><p>YES: In 1999 Gasarch and Kruskal had a paper in Mathematics Magazine: </p><p><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/dice.pdf">When can one load of Dice so that the sum is uniformly distributed</a>?<br/></p><p>In that paper we have a theorem that gives an exact condition on</p><p>(n_1,...,n_k) for when there is a loaded n_1-sided dice, n_2-sided dice,...,n_k-sided dice so that </p><p>the sums are all equally likely.</p><p>In 2018 Ian Morrison published a paper in the American Math Monthly:</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2272">Sacks of dice with fair totals</a><br/></p><p>which used our work and referred to our main theorem as <b>The Gasarch-Kruskal Theorem.</b></p><p>Hence there is a theorem with my name on it!</p><p>NO: The Gasarch-Kruskal paper has only 8 citations (according to Google Scholar). This is more than I would have thought, but its not a lot. The fact that ONE person calls the main theorem THE GASARCH-KRUSKAL THEOREM hardly makes it a named theorem. </p><p>QUESTION: So what criteria can one use?</p><p>We could say that X has a theorem with their name on it if there is a Wikipedia entry about the theorem, using that name. That works to a point, but might fun afoul of Goodhart's law (if a measure becomes a target it stops being a measure) in that, for example, I could write a Wikipedia entry on The Gasarch-Kruskal Theorem. </p><p>We could say that 10 people need to refer to the theorem by the name of its authors. Why 10? Any number seems arbitrary. </p><p>CAVEAT: If someone asked Clyde Kruskal <i>is there a theorem that bears your name</i> that is trickier, since <i>The Kruskal Tree Theorem</i> bears his name.... but its not his theorem. Reminds me of the (fictional) scenario where a Alice steals  a Field's medal and tells Bob<i> I have a Field's Medal! </i>and Bob  thinks Alice is a world-class mathematician since she has a fields medal, rather than thinking Alice is a world class thief. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/08/how-valuable-is-fields-medal.html">here</a> for my post on that. </p><p>(I originally had Kruskal Three Theorem instead of Tree Theorem. I have corrected this but I hope it inspires Clyde to prove a theorem about the number Three so he can have a named theorem. And if he is lucky, over time, people will confuse it with the Kruskal Tree Theorem!) </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><i><br/></i></p></div>

    <title>TR22-072 |  Probabilistic Kolmogorov Complexity with Applications to Average-Case Complexity |

    <summary>Understanding the relationship between the worst-case and average-case complexities of $\mathrm{NP}$ and of other subclasses of $\mathrm{PH}$ is a long-standing problem in complexity theory. Over the last few years, much progress has been achieved in this front through the investigation of meta-complexity: the complexity of problems that refer to the complexity of the input string $x$ (e.g., given a string $x$, estimate its time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity). In particular, [Hir21] employed techniques from meta-complexity to show that if $\mathrm{DistNP} \subseteq \mathrm{AvgP}$ then $\mathrm{UP} \subseteq \mathrm{DTIME}[2^{O(n/\log n)}]$. While this and related results [HN21, CHV22] offer exciting progress after a long gap, they do not survive in the setting of ramdonmized computations: roughly speaking, "randomness" is the opposite of "structure", and upper bounding the amount of structure (time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity) of different objects is crucial in recent applications of meta-complexity. This limitation is significant, since randomized computations are ubiquitous in algorithm design and give rise to a more robust theory of average-case complexity [IL90].

In this work, we develop a probabilistic theory of meta-complexity, by incorporating randomness into the notion of complexity of a string $x$. This is achieved through a new probabilistic variant of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity that we call $\mathrm{pK}^t$ complexity. Informally, $\mathrm{pK}^t(x)$ measures the complexity of $x$ when shared randomness is available to all parties involved in a computation. By porting key results from meta-complexity to the probabilistic domain of $\mathrm{pK}^t$ complexity and its variants, we are able to establish new connections between worst-case and average-case complexity in the important setting of probabilistic computations:

-  If $\mathrm{DistNP} \subseteq \mathrm{AvgBPP}$, then $\mathrm{UP}\subseteq\mathrm{RTIME}\!\left[2^{O(n/\log n)}\right]$. 

-  If $\mathrm{Dist\Sigma}^{\mathrm{P}}_{2} \subseteq \mathrm{AvgBPP}$, then $\mathrm{AM} \subseteq \mathrm{BPTIME}\!\left[2^{O(n/\log n)}\right]$. 

- In the fine-grained setting [CHV22], we get $\mathrm{UTIME}[2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}]\subseteq \mathrm{RTIME}[2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}]$ and $\mathrm{AMTIME}[2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}] \subseteq \mathrm{BPTIME}[2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}]$ from stronger average-case assumptions. 

- If $\mathrm{DistPH}\subseteq\mathrm{AvgBPP}$, then $\mathrm{PH}\subseteq\mathrm{BPTIME}\!\left[2^{O(n/\log n)}\right]$. Specifically, for any $\ell \geq 0$, if $\mathrm{Dist\Sigma}_{\ell+2}^{\mathrm{P}}\subseteq\mathrm{AvgBPP}$ then $\mathrm{\Sigma}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{P}}\subseteq\mathrm{BPTIME}\!\left[2^{O(n/\log n)}\right]$.

- Strengthening a result from [HN21], we show that if $\mathrm{DistNP}\subseteq\mathrm{AvgBPP}$ then polynomial size Boolean circuits can be agnostically PAC learned under any unknown $\mathrm{P}/\mathrm{poly}$-samplable distribution in polynomial time.

In some cases, our framework allows us to significantly simplify existing proofs, or to extend results to the more challenging probabilistic setting with little to no extra effort.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Some time ago, I received a message to the effect that I was being considered for membership in the “Academy of the XL”, to which my reaction was, hey, we have all gone out of shape during the pandemic, and body-shaming is never… then it was explained to me that, in this context, “XL” means “forty” and that the Academy of the Forty is Italy’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_nazionale_delle_scienze">National Academy of Science</a>.</p>
<p>Italy has a wonderfully named, and well-known within the country, National Academy of Arts and Science, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_dei_Lincei">Accademia dei Lincei</a>, which means something like academy of the “eagle-eyed” (literally, lynx-eyed), that is, people that can see far. The Accademia dei XL is much less well known, although it has a distinguished 240-year history, during which people like Guglielmo Marconi and Enrico Fermi were members. More recently, the much beloved Rita Levi-Montalcini, Holocaust survivor, Nobel Laureate, and Senator-for-life, was a member. Current members include Nobel Laureates Carlo Rubbia and Giorgio Parisi. Noted algebraist Corrado De Concini is the current president.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the academicians did vote to make me a member, their first computer scientist ever. Next week, at the inauguration of their 240th academic year, I will speak to the other members about randomness and pseudorandomness in computation.</p></div>

<i>Never say anything in an electronic message that you wouldn’t want appearing, and attributed to you, in tomorrow morning’s front-page headline in the New York Times—Colonel David Russell.</i></p>
<p>
Rafail Ostrovsky is a professor of computer science at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering. Ken and I have been friends with him for many years, long before he moved to UCLA. He is one of the world experts in security theory and practice. And he is especially strong at seeing new attacks and then finding defenses for them. See his web <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/">home</a> site for some details. </p>
<p>
Rafail was just awarded the 2022 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Wallace_McDowell_Award">McDowell award</a>.  For visionary contributions to computer security theory and practice, including foreseeing new cloud vulnerabilities and then pioneering corresponding novel solutions. </p>
<p>
Again first seeing attacks, then inventing defenses. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/14/rafail-is-no-secret/ro/" rel="attachment wp-att-20016"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-20016" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ro.jpg?resize=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="208"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> A Key Result </b></p>
<p/><p>
One of Rafail’s neat results is how to create strong keys from biological data. This is joint work with Yevgeniy Dodis, Leonid Reyzin, and Adam Smith and is <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/PUBLIC/89.pdf">Fuzzy Extractors:</a> How to Generate Strong Keys from Biometrics and Other Noisy Data. </p>
<p>
Rather than try and generate keys from silly to generate patterns such as: 	 	my name + 3.14159 	 the idea is to use your own biological data. This paper unlike traditional cryptographic keys, is (1) not reproducible precisely and (2) not distributed uniformly. Yet it allows strong keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> A Non-Typical Result </b></p>
<p/><p>
Rafail has a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/997.pdf">paper</a> that is titled Alibi: A Flaw in Cuckoo-Hashing based Hierarchical ORAM Schemes and a Solution and is joint with Brett Hemenway Falk and Daniel Noble both of University of Pennsylvania. Their paper solves a nice problem, but we believe is unique for its abstract:  </p>
<p>
There once was a table of hashes <br/>
 That held extra items in stashes <br/>
 It all seemed like bliss <br/>
 But things went amiss <br/>
 When the stashes were stored in the caches </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> More Results </b></p>
<p/><p>
Here is another of Rafail’s results that demonstrates his many abilities. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-24676-3_30.pdf">paper</a> is titled Public Key Encryption with Keyword Search and is joint with Dan Boneh, Giovanni Di Crescenzo, and Giuseppe Persiano.  Consider a mail server that stores various messages publicly encrypted for Alice by others. Using our mechanism Alice can send the mail server a key that will enable the server to identify all messages containing some specific keyword, but learn nothing else. We define the concept of public key encryption with keyword search and give several constructions. </p>
<p>
This result is interesting in that Rafail creates a problem that allows security to be partial. The full text is safe but it is still possible to search the text for certain keywords. This allows the security to be weaken, but not to be weaken all the way. </p>
<p>
It is surprising that security can be weaken partially, but not all the way. It might seem likely that this weaken notation of security could be too dangerous. One of the advantages of precise security models is that such results can be safely defined and shown to be safe. This is the fundamental advantage of modern formal definitions for security. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Rafail is one of the top researchers in security in the broadest sense. He is one of the best at defining new types of security and then showing that such notions are actually safe.</p>
<p>
Congrats to him for the McDowell award.</p>

    <title>TR22-071 |  Robustly Separating the Arithmetic Monotone Hierarchy Via Graph Inner-Product | 

	Utsab Ghosal, 

	Arkadev Chattopadhyay, 

	Partha Mukhopadhyay</title>
    <summary>We establish an $\epsilon$-sensitive hierarchy separation for monotone arithmetic computations. The notion of $\epsilon$-sensitive monotone lower bounds was recently introduced by Hrubes [Computational Complexity'20]. We show the following:
   
(1) There exists a monotone polynomial over $n$ variables in VNP that cannot be computed by $2^{o(n)}$ size monotone circuits in an $\epsilon$-sensitive way as long as $\epsilon \ge 2^{-\Omega(n)}$.

(2) There exists a polynomial over $n$ variables that can be computed by polynomial size monotone circuits but cannot be computed by any monotone arithmetic branching program (ABP) of $n^{o(\log n)}$ size, even in an $\epsilon$-sensitive fashion as long as $\epsilon \ge n^{-\Omega(\log n)}$.

(3) There exists a polynomial over $n$ variables that can be computed by polynomial size monotone ABP but cannot be computed in $n^{o(\log n)}$ size by monotone formulas even in an $\epsilon$-sensitive way, when $\epsilon \ge n^{-\Omega(\log n)}$.

(4) There exists a polynomial over $n$ variables that can be computed by width-$4$  polynomial size monotone arithmetic branching programs (ABPs) but cannot be computed in $2^{o(n^{1/d})}$ size by monotone, unbounded fan-in formulas of product depth $d$ even in an $\epsilon$-sensitive way, when $\epsilon \ge 2^{-\Omega(n^{1/d})}$. This yields an $\epsilon$-sensitive separation of constant-depth monotone formulas and constant-width monotone ABPs. It seems that even an ordinary separation of the two classes was not known.   

An interesting feature of our separations is that in each case the polynomial exhibited is obtained from a graph inner-product polynomial by choosing an appropriate graph topology. The closely related graph inner-product Boolean function for expander graphs was invented by Hayes [DM &amp; TCS'11], also independently by Pitassi [2009], in the context of best-partition multiparty communication complexity.</summary>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We recently showed an algorithm for computing all-pairs minimum cuts (or, more precisely, the Gomory-Hu tree) in ~O(n^2) time in weighted graphs and even almost-linear time in unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, this is the first improvement over the 60-year-old algorithm by Gomory and Hu. Thus, surprisingly, computing all-pairs minimum cuts seems to be strictly easier than computing all-pairs shortest paths, which is conjectured to require n^{3-o(1)} time.</p>
<p>I will give a tutorial on the techniques behind our new result, one of which is called “isolating cuts”. Then, I will survey recent progress in fast minimum cut algorithms and discuss open problems.</p>

<i>I’m low-key. I like my privacy—Kemba Walker.</i></p>
<p>
Avrim Blum, Irit Dinur, Cynthia Dwork, Frank McSherry, Kobbi Nissim, and Adam Smith, received the ACM 2021 Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice <a href="https://awards.acm.org/kanellakis">Award</a>. They worked on and studied the notion of <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/differential-privacy">differential privacy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/11/differential-privacy/all-12/" rel="attachment wp-att-20004"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20004" height="338" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/all.png?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1" width="600"/></a></p>
<p><b> Privacy </b></p>
<p/><p>
One of the key advances of modern cryptography is its ability to define new types of security. One can be pretty naive in defining simple notions of security. For example, it is not too hard to get correct the notion: Given the encrypted message <img alt="{E_K(M)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_K%28M%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> one cannot easily determine <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> without knowing the key <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. However, things are much more complex when we wish to define more complex notions. </p>
<p>
This happens with notions of privacy. Differential privacy is a framework for reasoning about statistical databases. Imagine you have two otherwise identical databases, one with your personal information in it, and one without it. Differential Privacy ensures that the probability that a statistical query will produce a given result is (nearly) the same whether it’s conducted on the first or second database. </p>
<p>
Perhaps a concrete question will help: <i>How can we use data to learn about a population, without learning about specific individuals within the population?</i> Consider these two questions: </p>
<ol>
<li> “How many people live in Vermont?”
</li><li> “How many people named Joe Smith live in Vermont?”
</li></ol>
<p>
The first reveals a property of the whole population, while the second reveals information about one person. We need to be able to learn about trends in the population while preventing the ability to learn anything new about a particular individual. This is the goal of many statistical analyses of data, such as the statistics published by the U.S. Census Bureau. This is what differential privacy is all about. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> The Award </b></p>
<p/><p>
From the award citation:</p>
<p>
<em><br/>
Differential privacy is a definition and framework for reasoning about privacy in statistical databases. While the privacy of individuals contributing to a dataset has been a long-standing concern, prior to the Kanellakis recipients’ work, computer scientists only knew how to mitigate several specific privacy attacks via a disparate set of techniques. The foundation for differential privacy emerged in the early 2000’s from several key papers. At the ACM Symposium on the Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2003) Dinur and Nissim presented a paper which showed that any technique that allows reasonably accurate answers to a large number of queries is inherently non-private.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Later, a sequence of papers by Dwork and Nissim at the International Conference on Cryptology (Crypto 2004); as well as Blum, Dwork, McSherry, and Nissim at the ACM Symposium on the Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2005); and Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith at the Theory of Cryptology Conference (TCC 2006) further defined and studied the notion of differential privacy.</em> </p>
<p>

    <title>Queen Elizabeth is the 3rd longest reigning monarch; The problem with definitions</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> A few days ago Queen Elizabeth passed Johann II of Liechtenstein to be the third longest reigning monarch (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-reigning_monarchs">here</a>). </p><p>A summary of the top 4:</p><p><br/></p><p>4) Johann II, Liechtenstein ruled from Nov 12 1858 until his death on Feb 11, 1929. When he became King he was 18. He was king for 70 years, 91 days. </p><p>3) Queen Elizabeth II (thats a two, not an eleven) ruled from Feb 2, 1952 until now. When she became Queen she was  25. I am writing this on May 10 at which time she ruled 70 years, 94 days. </p><p>2) Bhumibol Adulyadej (Thailand) ruled from June 9, 1946 until Oct 13, 2016. When he became King he was 19. He was king for 70 years, 126 days. </p><p>1) Louis XIV ruled from May 14, 1643 until Sept 1, 1715. When he became King he was 4 years and 8 months. He was king for 72 years, 110 days. </p><p><br/></p><p>Johann, Elizabeth, and Bhumibol started their reigns a bit young (they would have to to have ruled so long) but their first day of their reign they knew what the job was, what they are supposed to do etc. </p><p>Here is my complaint: Louis XIV being king at the age of 4 years 8 months should not count (someone who proofread this post wondered if 4 years 9 months would count. No.) Shouldn't we define the reign of a king as the point at which he can make real decisions as king? Or something like that. </p><p>For the record of the longest marriage there is a similar problem. The three longest marriages are legit in that the people got married at a reasonable age (I think all were married after they were 17). The fourth longest marriage of all time involved two people that were married when they were 5. That should not count (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_long_marriages">here</a>).</p><p>Is there a way to define monarch's reigns and also marriage length so that it corresponds to our intuitions? </p><p>In Math we can use rigorous definitions but in English its harder. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

<p>In this blog post we use datamodels to identify and study a new form of model <em>brittleness.</em></p>

<h2 id="recap-datamodels">Recap: Datamodels</h2>

<p>In our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">last post</a>, we introduced datamodels: a framework for studying how models use training data to make predictions. While we summarize datamodels in short below, if you haven’t yet read about datamodels we recommend reading our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">last post</a> for the full picture.</p>

<p>Consider a training set $S$ (e.g., a set of images and labels from a computer vision dataset), a learning algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ (e.g., training a deep neural network from scratch with SGD), and a target example $x$ (e.g., a test image and label from the same dataset). A <em>datamodel</em> for the target example $x$ is a parameterized function that takes as input a subset $S’$ of the original training set $S$, and predicts the outcome of training a model on $S’$ (using $\mathcal{A}$) and evaluating on $x$. In other words, a datamodel predicts how the choice of a specific training subset changes the final model prediction.</p>

<p><img alt="A graphic showing a test image and a training set. Some of the training images are greyed out to indicate a subset S-prime of the training set. There is an arrow from the training set to a question asking, &quot;if i train a model on examples # 1, 3, 5, etc., how will the model behave on the given target example?&quot; This question is fed to the datamodel, which returns an estimate of what the output (e.g. loss) of a model trained on S-prime and evaluated on x would be." src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/datamodel_blogpost_figures.001.png"/></p>

<p>Our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">last post</a> focused on constructing <em>linear</em> datamodels (one for each CIFAR-10 test image) that accurately predict the outcome of training a deep neural network from scratch on subsets of the CIFAR-10 training set.</p>

<p>Today, we’ll use datamodels to investigate deep neural networks’ predictions. Specifically, we’ll introduce and measure <em>data-level brittleness</em>: how sensitive are model predictions to removing a small number of training set points?</p>

<h2 id="data-level-brittleness-a-motivating-example">Data-level brittleness: a motivating example</h2>

<p>Consider this image of a boat from the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a> test set:</p>

<p><img alt="An image of a boat from the CIFAR-10 test set" src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/Untitled.png" width="120px"/></p>

<p>A deep neural network (ResNet-9) trained on CIFAR-10 correctly classifies this example as a boat with <strong>71%</strong> (softmax) confidence. The classification is also “robust” in the sense that over different training runs (each with a different random initialization of the network, batch ordering, data augmentation, etc.), the trained model classifies this example correctly <strong>84%</strong> of the time.</p>

<p>It turns out, however, that if we remove just the following nine images from the CIFAR-10 training set…</p>

<p><img alt="Nine images from the CIFAR-10 training set that, when removed, induce misclassification of the boat example above." src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/datamodel_blogpost_figures.001%201.png"/></p>

<p>…models trained with the exact same training procedure (applied to the remaining 49,991 images in the training set) correctly classify the boat only <strong>35%</strong> of the time! Furthermore, when we remove only 11 additional training images, the probability of correct classification decreases to merely <strong>10%</strong> (the accuracy of a <em>random</em> classifier!).</p>

<p>Model behavior on this boat image exemplifies <em>data-level brittleness.</em> Models confidently and consistently output correct predictions, but these predictions hinge on a very small set of training examples. (One might hypothesize that in this case, brittleness stems from the fact that there are very few training examples of boats on land or grass.)</p>

<h2 id="quantifying-brittleness-with-datamodels">Quantifying brittleness with datamodels</h2>

<p>How do we actually measure data-level brittleness? In the example above, models misclassified the boat after we removed nine images. These were nine <em>specifically chosen</em> images, however: removing nine <em>randomly chosen</em> training images of boats does not at all degrade models’ probability of correctly classifying the boat image. Even removing the nine most <em>similar</em> training examples to the boat image (e.g., in terms of representation space distance) degrades this probability by only 4%.</p>

<p>So, how do we find the “right” images to remove? Specifically, what we’re looking for is the smallest subset of the training set whose removal induces misclassification on average, i.e.,</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\tag{1}
\label{eq:origobj}
\min_{R \subset S} |R’|, \text{ such that }\mathbb{E}[\text{margin of a model
trained on } S \setminus R \text{ on } x] \leq 0.
\end{align}</p>

<p>Unfortunately, problems like this (optimizing a black-box function over the space of all possible subsets of a large set) are computationally challenging to solve. In the worst case, to find the smallest set satisfying the above condition we would have to train several models for each possible training subset.</p>

<p>This is where datamodels come in. Recall that for a target example $x$ (e.g., our  boat example from before), we can construct (read our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">previous post</a> to see how) a <em>datamodel</em> $g$ that, for any subset of the training set $S’$, returns an estimate:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
g(S’) \approx \mathbb{E}[\text{margin of a classifier trained on $S’$ when
evaluated on $x$}].
\end{align}</p>

<p>(Here, the expectation is taken over training non-determinism.) Datamodel estimates can be highly accurate. For example, see the following graph of predicted average margin $g(S’)$ against true average margin (the RHS above) from our last post:</p>

<p><img alt="A graph comparing true and datamodel-predicted outcomes of model training." src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/Untitled%201.png"/></p>

<p>Datamodel predictiveness means we can (approximately) solve our earlier optimization problem (\eqref{eq:origobj}) by optimizing instead the <em>surrogate objective</em>:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\tag{2}
\label{eq:surrogate1}
\min_{R \subset S} \vert R \vert \text{ such that } g(S \backslash R) \leq 0
\end{align}</p>

<p>Since $g(\cdot)$ is a simple (linear) function (see the drop-down below for more details), this new optimization problem is computationally easy to solve (and doesn’t involve training additional models).</p>

<div class="checkboxdiv">

<label for="ac-1"><span class="fas fa-chevron-right" id="titlespan"/><strong> Why is it easy to solve?</strong> (Click to expand)</label>
<article class="small">
In our last post, we showed that for deep neural networks, datamodels that are linear with respect to the <em>presence</em> of each training image can suffice to accurately predict model behavior. In the linear datamodel regime, we parameterize our datamodel $g(\cdot)$ for a target example $x$ with a weight vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^{50,000}$ (where $50,000$ is the size of the training set), and the datamodel prediction $g(S’)$ is precisely:
    
\begin{align}
    g(S’) = \mathbf{1}_{S’}^\top w,
\end{align}

where $\mathbf{1}_{S'}$ is a 50,000-dimensional indicator vector of $S'$ (i.e., taking on a value of one at index $i$ if the $i$-th training image is in $S'$, and zero otherwise).

Here, solving the optimization problem \(\eqref{eq:surrogate1}\) corresponds to choosing $R$ as the training images that correspond to the largest indices of $w_i$.
</article>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<p><br/></p>

<p>After finding a subset $R$ that minimizes the surrogate objective above, we can verify that $R$ is an upper bound on the objective above by training a collection of models on the remaining training images $S \setminus R$, and checking to see that the target example is misclassified on average. We can <em>ensure</em> we actually get an upper bound on the size of the minimum $R$ by solving</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\min_{R \subset S} \vert R \vert \text{ such that } g(S \setminus R) \leq C,
\end{align}</p>

<p>where $C&lt;0$ is a threshold that we (very coarsely) search for using the verification procedure—if the image isn’t misclassified on average, we can decrease $C$.</p>

<h2 id="looking-at-brittleness-in-aggregate">Looking at brittleness in aggregate</h2>

<p>So far in this post, we’ve seen an example of data-level brittleness, and provided a datamodel-based method for estimating the brittleness of any given prediction. How brittle are model predictions as a whole?</p>

<p>We use our datamodel-based approach to estimate the data-level brittleness of each image in (a random sample of) the CIFAR-10 test set. Specifically, for each test image, we estimate (and bound) the number of training images one would need to remove in order to flip models’ predictions on the test image. We plot the <em>cumulative distribution</em> of these estimates below: a point $(x, y)$ on the blue line below indicates that a $y$ fraction of test set predictions are brittle to the removal of at most $x$ training images.</p>

<p><img alt="CDF of data-level brittleness" src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/cifar_brittleness_combined_withflips_False.svg"/></p>

<p>It turns out that our motivating boat example is not so unusual. In fact, for around 20% of the CIFAR-10 test images it suffices to remove fewer than 60 training images to induce misclassification! Also, for around half of the test examples, it suffices to remove fewer than 250 training images (still only 0.5% of the training set).</p>

<p>The other lines in the graph above illustrate just how hard it is to identify prediction brittleness via other means. Each one represents a different heuristic: a point $(x, y)$ on the line indicates that for a $y$-fraction of the test set, removing the $x$ most similar images to the target example (according to the corresponding heuristic) is necessary to flip models’ predictions. (See Appendix F.2 in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00622">paper</a> for more details on these baselines!)</p>

<h2 id="bonus-label-flipping-attacks">Bonus: Label-flipping attacks</h2>

<p>One immediate consequence of the techniques we discovered in this blog post is the existence of strong <em>label-flipping</em> attacks. So far, we’ve looked exclusively at the result of removing training images—if we use the exact same technique but instead just flip the labels of the images we would have removed, we find more severe brittleness:</p>

<p><img alt="flipping.png" src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/cifar_brittleness_combined_withflips_True_True.svg"/></p>

<p>The dashed line above is the same as the blue line from earlier—the new solid blue line shows that for over half of the CIFAR-10 test images, we are able to induce misclassification by relabeling just 35 (target-specific) images!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, we introduced a new notion of model brittleness, examined how to quantify it with datamodels, and demonstrated that a large fraction of predictions on the CIFAR-10 test set are quite brittle.</p>

<p>Our results demonstrate one of many ways in which datamodels can be a useful proxy for end-to-end training. More broadly (and as we’ll see in our upcoming posts!), datamodels open the door to many other fine-grained analyses of model predictions.</p></div>

<i>Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations, or algorithms: it is about understanding—Bill Thurston.</i></p>
<p>
Peter Weinberger is a computer scientist who is famous for many things—including his <a href="http://spinroot.com/pico/pjw.html">face</a>. His name “Peter” alone stands for “rock or stone”. He did great work at Bell Labs, where he was part of the team that created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a> Programming Language: the others were Alfred Aho and Brian Kernighan. </p>
<p>
I just saw him, after a few years, at Bob <a href="https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/115529253/posts/3992043808">Sedgewick’s</a> retirement event in Princeton. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><b> His Face </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter’s face comes up in Bell Lab’s lure:  For some reason, the <a href="http://spinroot.com/pico/pjw.html">portrait</a> of Peter Weinberger has always been our most popular target for picture editing experiments. It started a few years ago when Peter was raised to the rank of department head and was careless enough to leave a portrait of himself floating around. On a goofy Saturday evening at the lab, Rob Pike and I started making photocopies and, to emphasize Peter’s rise in the managerial hierarchy, prepared a chart of the Bell Labs Cabinet with his picture stuck in every available slot. Peter must have realized that the best he could do was not to react at all, if at least he wanted to avoid seeing his face 10 feet high on a watertower. Nevertheless, Peter’s picture appeared and reappeared in the most unlikely places in the lab. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Experiments </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter’s research over the years has been, I believe, an interesting mixture of theory and practice. Early on he did experimental work in deep number theory. For example his paper with Daniel Shanks <a href="http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa21/aa21139.pdf">refuted</a> an open conjecture. This work is an interesting blend of computations and theory. One of the surprises of deep number theory is that shocks abound in the fine structure of number fields. This structure is not always straightforward and often depends on examples and counterexamples. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Crypto </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter also worked with the US government in classified ways. He is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASON_(advisory_group)">Jason’s</a> group. For example you can see some of his work on the evaluation of research directions: </p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/jason/dna.pdf">DNA</a>: one of my favorite.
</li><li> <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/jason/qc.pdf">Quantum</a>.
</li><li> <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/jason/medimag.pdf">Medical Imaging</a>.
</li></ol>
<p>
Other parts of it are classified and <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Renaissance and Google </b></p>
<p/><p>
Renaissance Technologies is an American hedge fund based on Long Island. The firm is regarded as the most successful hedge fund in the world. Weinberger was the chief technology officer at Renaissance until he left for Google in 2003. This exit made sense since Peter seems to love problems in infrastructure and security. Working to solve infrastructure problems at the global scale at Google was clearly a compelling opportunity for him. </p>
<p>
Below is an excerpt from a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514393">talk</a> with Peter and Laurianne Mclaughlin:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19992" style="width: 250px;"><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/10/peters-face/peter-weinberger/" rel="attachment wp-att-19992"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-19992" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pw2.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="240"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-19992">Peter Weinberger, New York City, 2015</p></div>
<p>
<b>Weinberger</b>: I’m a software engineer. I write programs, infrastructure stuff mostly. I’m working on tools for processing various kinds of logs created by internal software. I’m not working on security directly, but a lot of what we do is affected by security and privacy concerns. As a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, most companies now create a lot of logs to verify what code they’re running, and [show] how people work with internal data.</p>
<p>
Also, I spend a lot of time reading code. At Google, you can’t check in code without it being reviewed and approved by a peer, so if you work with productive people, there’s a lot of code to review.</p>
<p>
<b>LM</b>: What are the biggest technology challenges for Google today?</p>
<p>
<b>Weinberger</b>: Scale is the problem. Our business grows rapidly. That means every year, a lot of the technology decisions made a year ago don’t look so good any more. Exponential growth is a very pleasant problem but requires a lot of work.</p>
<p>
<b>LM</b>: What are your technology pet peeves?</p>
<p>
<b>Weinberger</b>: I’m sure I’ve got dozens. Password management. Sometimes people, like auditors, think users should regularly change passwords. I think this just encourages people to use crummy passwords—because either they have to write the passwords down, or they need a sequence of passwords that are very similar.</p>
<p>
One of my other pet peeves here is curious error messages. A lot of them are still awful. They start with the word “abort” but the program continues. We have a lot of legacy software, and you end up with these situations where an error message pops up, but the computer keeps on going. Deep in the software something went wrong, and reports it, but you’re seven levels of abstraction away, and it’s just useless noise.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter is still working on his problems. We wish him well on solving them and on all he is doing.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-070 |  On Solving Sparse Polynomial Factorization Related Problems | 

	Ilya Volkovich, 

	Pranav Bisht</title>
    <summary>In a recent result of Bhargava, Saraf and Volkovich [FOCS’18; JACM’20], the first sparsity bound for constant individual degree polynomials was shown. In particular, it was shown that any factor of a polynomial with at most $s$ terms and individual degree bounded by $d$ can itself have at most $s^{O(d^2\log n)}$ terms. It is conjectured, though, that the "true" sparsity bound should be polynomial (i.e. $s^{poly(d)}$). In this paper we provide supporting evidence for this conjecture by presenting polynomial-time algorithms for several problems that would be implied by a polynomial-size sparsity bound. In particular, we give an efficient (deterministic) identity testing algorithms for $\Sigma^{[2]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\deg_{x_i} \leq d]}$ circuits and testing if a sparse polynomial is an exact power. Hence, our algorithms rely on different techniques.</summary>

Sublinear algorithms for edit distance, planar graphs, distributions, bipartite graphs, groups, error correcting codes, Bayesian nets, polynomials…</p>



<p>Let’s proceed with the spread.</p>



<p><strong>Improved Sublinear-Time Edit Distance for Preprocessed Strings</strong> by Karl Bringmann, Alejandro Cassis, Nick Fischer, and Vasileios Nakos (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14137">arXiv</a>). The edit distance between strings is a classic and important problem in algorithms. You might recall that classic \(O(n^2)\) algorithm to compute the edit distance between strings of length \(n\). It has been show that getting a \(O(n^{2-\delta})\) time algorithm is SETH-hard. But what can be done in sublinear time? This paper considers the preprocessed version: suppose we can perform near-linear preprocessing on the strings. We now want to distinguish between edit distance between \(\leq k\) and \(\geq k\cdot n^{o(1)}\). This paper shows that with near-linear preprocessing on strings, one can solve this problem in \(k \cdot n^{o(1)}\) time. </p>



<p><strong>Optimal Closeness Testing of Discrete Distributions Made <s>Complex</s> Simple</strong> by (our own) Clément L. Canonne and Yucheng Sun (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12640">arXiv</a>). Given two distributions \(p, q\) over support \([k]\), the aim is to distinguish between (i) the distributions being equal, and (ii) the total variation distance between \(p, q\) being at least \(\epsilon\). The tester should has a failure probability of at most \(\delta\). A recent work nails down the sample complexity with respect to all parameters. This paper gives a simpler proof of the main result. Earlier proofs used Poissonization tricks and fairly clever arguments about Poisson random variables. This proof is much more transparent, and uses an identity that relates the expectation of a random variable to its characteristic function. A nice feature of this proof is that it works directly with the multinomial distribution, which means a fixed number of samples (rather than choosing the number of samples from a distribution).</p>



<p><strong>Tolerant Bipartiteness Testing in Dense Graphs</strong> by Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, Rahul Raychaudhury, and Sayantan Sen (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12397">arXiv</a>). Testing bipartiteness of dense graphs is about as a classic as it gets. We wish to distinguish a bipartite graph from one that requires \(\varepsilon n^2\) edge removals to make it bipartite. Readers of this blog should know that there is a \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})\)-query property tester for this problem. (Ok, so now you know.) This paper studies the tolerant version of bipartiteness testing. Note that this is equivalent to approximating the maxcut, up to additive error \(\varepsilon n^2\). Classic approximation algorithms show that the latter can be done in \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-6})\) queries and \(\exp(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) time. This paper considers the easier problem of distinguishing whether the distance to bipartiteness is at most \(\varepsilon\) or at least \(2 \varepsilon\). This problem is solved in \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})\) queries and \(\exp(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}))\). </p>



<p><strong>Properly learning monotone functions via local reconstruction</strong> by Jane Lange, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11894">arXiv</a>). Ah yes, monotone functions. An ongoing love (obsession? interest?) for property testing people. This paper studies the problem of proper learning of Boolean valued monotone functions over the Boolean hypercube. Given access to uniform random evaluations of a monotone function \(f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\), we wish to compute a monotone function \(g\) that approximates the original function. Classic results from Fourier analysis show that an approximation  can be learned using \(\exp(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)\) queries. But this approximation function might not be monotone, and only yields improper learning. This paper gives a proper learner that outputs a monotone approximation, in roughly the same query complexity. This result directly gives a constant tolerance monotonicity tester for Boolean functions. The paper uses recent results from distributed algorithms and local computation. It also leads to tolerant testers for monotonicity over posets with small diameter.</p>



<p><strong>Massively Parallel Computation and Sublinear-Time Algorithms for Embedded Planar Graphs</strong> by Jacob Holm and Jakub Tětek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09035">arXiv</a>). Sublinear algorithms for planar graphs is another ongoing love (at least for me). This paper considers a new take of this problem: suppose we have access to a geometric embedding of a planar graph \(G\). Can we get sublinear algorithms for a variety of problems? This paper first shows how to construct a convenient decomposition, called an \(r\)-division, in sublinear time. This division can be used to approximate Lipschitz graph parameters, such as maximum matching sizes, maximum independent set, etc. The paper also shows how to compute an \(r\)-division in the MPC model, which solves many classic graph  problems (connected components, matchings, etc.) in \(O(1)\) rounds. There is a (conditional) lower bound showing that, without an embedding, it is not possible to solve such problems in \(O(1)\) rounds (and sublinear space per processor).</p>



<p><strong>Independence Testing for Bounded Degree Bayesian Network</strong> by Arnab Bhattacharyya, Clément L. Canonne (again, our own), and Joy Qiping Yang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08690">arXiv</a>). Given a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) on the Boolean hypercube \(\{0,1\}^n\), the problem is to determine whether \(\mathcal{P}\) is a product distribution. In general, this problem requires \(\Omega(2^n)\) samples. Suppose \(\mathcal{P}\) has a sparse, “efficient” description. Can we do better? This paper shows that when \(\mathcal{P}\) is generated by a Bayesian network (with bounded indegree), then the independence testing problem can be solved with a \(\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)\) samples. Think of a Bayesian network as a DAG, where each vertex generates a Bernoulli random variable. The variable at a vertex depends only the outcomes at its neighborhood.</p>



<p><strong>Low Degree Testing over the Reals </strong>by Vipul Arora, Arnab Bhattacharyya, Noah Fleming, Esty Kelman, and Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08404">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/051/">ECCC</a>). The problem testing low degree polynomials goes back to the birth of property testing. This paper studies real valued polynomials, in the distribution free setting. Formally, we have query access to a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\). The distance is measured with respect to an unknown distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over the domain. This paper shows that the real low degree testing problem can be solved in \(poly(d\varepsilon^{-1})\) queries (under some reasonableness conditions on the distribution). The approach is go to via the “self-correct and test” approach: try to compute a low degree polynomial that fits some sampled data, and then check how far the self-corrected version is from another sample.</p>



<p><strong>Testing distributional assumptions of learning algorithms</strong> by Ronitt Rubinfeld and Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07196.pdf">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of learning a halfspace over \(\mathbb{R}^n\). If the underlying distribution is Gaussian, then this class can be learned in \(n^{poly(\varepsilon^{-1})}\) samples. If the distribution is arbitrary, no \(2^{o(n)}\) algorithm is known despite much research. This paper introduces the notion of having a <em>tester-learner</em> pair. The tester first checks if the input distribution is “well-behaved” (Gaussian-like). If the tester passes, then we run the learner. Indeed, this perspective goes back to some of the original motivations for property testing (when is testing faster than learning). The intriguing aspect of this problem is that we do not have efficient testers for determining if an input distribution is Gaussian. This paper circumvents that problem by estimating certain moments of the distribution. If these moments agree with the moments of a Gaussian, then the learner is guaranteed to succeed. We get the best of both worlds: if the input distribution is Gaussian, the learning is done correctly. If the learner succeeds, then then output (hypothesis) is guaranteed to be correct, regardless of the input distribution.</p>



<p><strong>Testability in group theory</strong> by Oren Becker, Alexander Lubotzky, and Jonathan Mosheiff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04539">arXiv</a>). This paper is the journal version of a result of the authors, and it gives a group theoretic presentation of a property testing result. Consider the following problem. The input is a pair permutations \((\sigma_1, \sigma_2)\) over \([n]\). The aim is to test whether they commute: \(\sigma_1 \sigma_2 = \sigma_2 \sigma_1\). Another result of the authors gives a tester that makes \(O(\varepsilon^{-1})\) queries. They refer to this problem as “testing the relation” \(XY = YX\). This paper gives a grand generalization of that result, best explained by another example. Consider another relation/property denoted \(\{XZ = ZX, YZ = ZY\}\). This property consists of all triples of permutations \((\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3)\), where \(\sigma_3\) commutes with the other two. A consequence of the main theorem is that this property is not testable with query complexity independent of \(n\). The main result of this paper is a characterization of testable relations, which goes via studying the expansion of an infinite graph associated with the relation.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Positive Semidefiniteness Using Linear Measurements</strong> by Deanna Needell, William Swartworth, and David P. Woodruff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03782">arXiv</a>). The input is a \(d \times d\) real, symmetric matrix \(M\) and we wish to determine if it is positive semidefinite (all eigenvalues are positive). For the testing problem, we reject when the minimum eigenvalue is at most \(-\varepsilon \|M\|_2\). (The paper also considers general Schatten \(p\)-norms.) This paper gives a list of results for non-adaptive vs adaptive, and one-sided vs two-sided testers. There are two access models considered: a single query consists of either a (i) matrix-vector product \(Mx\) or (ii) vector-matrix-vector product \(y^TMx\). Typical models that query entries of the matrix require strong bounds on the entries, which is less reasonable in practical situations. An interesting discovery is that the non-adaptive, one-sided complexity is \(\Theta(\sqrt{d}\varepsilon^{-1})\) while the two-sided bound is independent of \(d\).</p>



<p><strong>Relaxed Locally Decodable and Correctable Codes: Beyond Tensoring</strong> by Gil Cohen and Tal Yankovitz (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/045/">ECCC</a>). Locally decodable and correctable codes are a fundamental object of study in property testing (and TCS in general). Consider a locally correctable code (LCC). Given a string \(x\), the decoder/corrector makes \(q\) queries to \(x\), and outputs a symbol. We can think of the output collectively as a string \(y\). If \(x\) is a codeword, then \(y = x\). Otherwise, \(dist(y,z) \leq \varepsilon\), where \(z\) is some codeword close to \(x\). In the relaxed version, the corrector is allowed to output \(\bot\), denoting that it has discovered corruption. The distance is only measured in the coordinates where the corrector does not output \(\bot\). Thus, the corrector gets a “free pass” if it outputs \(\bot\). But note that when \(x\) is a codeword, the output must be exactly \(x\). This paper gives a Relaxed LCC with query complexity \((\log n)^{O(\log\log\log n)}\), a significant improvement over the previous best \((\log n)^{O(\log\log n)}\). It is know from previous work that the query complexity must be \(\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})\).</p>



<p><strong>Verifying The Unseen: Interactive Proofs for Label-Invariant Distribution Properties</strong> by Tal Herman and Guy Rothblum (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/052/">arXiv</a>). This paper considers the distribution testing problem in the context of interactive proofs. The verifier, who wishes to test a property of a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\), interacts with a prover who knows the distribution. The guarantee required is the standard one for interactive proof systems: in the YES case, an honest prover should be able to convince the verifier. In the NO case, no prover can convince the verifier with high probability. There are two important parameters of interest: the sample complexity of the verifier, and the communication complexity of the messages. It is useful to consider the two extremes. In one extreme, the verifier can simply solve the problem herself, ignoring the prover. This could require \(\Theta(n/\log n)\) queries (for the hardest properties like entropy and support size). Another extreme is for the honest prover to simply send an approximate description of the distribution, which takes \(O(n)\) bits. The prover can just test equality to the prover message, which only takes \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\) queries. This paper shows a 2-round protocol for any (label-invariant) property where both the communication and the sample complexity can be made \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\). This result shows the power of interaction for distribution testing problems.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Since the late 19th century, mathematicians have realized the importance and generality of selection problems: given a collection of sets, select an element in each set, possibly in a “nice” way. Of particular importance in computer science is the scenario where the ground set is a metric space, in which case it is natural to ask for <strong>Lipschitz</strong> selection. In this talk I will describe a far-reaching extension of this classical Lipschitz selection problem to an *online* setting, where sets are streaming to the selector. I will show how Riemannian gradient descent (aka mirror descent) can be used to approach this type of problems. I will illustrate the power of the framework by solving a long-standing problem in online shortest path known as layered graph traversal (introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in 1989).</p>

    <title>TR22-069 |  List-Decoding Random Walk XOR Codes Near the Johnson Bound | 

	Silas Richelson, 

	Sourya Roy</title>
    <summary>In a breakthrough result, Ta-Shma described an explicit construction of an almost optimal binary code (STOC 2017).  Ta-Shma's code has distance $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$ and rate $\Omega\bigl(\varepsilon^{2+o(1)}\bigr)$ and thus it almost achieves the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, except for the $o(1)$ term in the exponent.  The prior best list-decoding algorithm for (a variant of) Ta-Shma's code achieves is due to Alev et al (STOC 2021).  This algorithm makes use of SDP hierarchies, and is able to recover from a $\frac{1-\rho}{2}-$fraction of errors as long as $\rho\geq2^{\log(1/\varepsilon)^{1/6}}$.  In this work we give an improved analysis of a similar list-decoding algorithm.  Our algorithm works for Ta-Shma's original code, and it is able to list-decode almost all the way to the Johnson bound: it can recover from a $\frac{1-\rho}{2}-$fraction of errors as long as $\rho\geq2\sqrt{\varepsilon}$.</summary>

    <title>TR22-068 |  Sketching Approximability of (Weak) Monarchy Predicates | 

	Santhoshini Velusamy, 

	Chi-Ning  Chou, 

	Madhu Sudan, 

	Alexander Golovnev, 

	Amirbehshad Shahrasbi</title>
    <summary>We analyze the sketching approximability of constraint satisfaction problems on Boolean domains, where the constraints are balanced linear threshold functions applied to literals. In particular, we explore the approximability of monarchy-like functions where the value of the function is determined by a weighted combination of the vote of the first variable (the president) and the sum of the votes of all remaining variables. The pure version of this function is when the president can only be overruled by when all remaining variables agree. For every $k \geq 5$, we show that CSPs where the underlying predicate is a pure monarchy function on $k$ variables have no non-trivial sketching approximation algorithm in $o(\sqrt{n})$ space. We also show infinitely many weaker monarchy functions for which CSPs using such constraints are non-trivially approximable by $O(\log(n))$ space sketching algorithms. Moreover, we give the first example of sketching approximable asymmetric Boolean CSPs. Our results work within the framework of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy (FOCS 2021) that characterizes the sketching approximability of all CSPs. Their framework can be applied naturally to get a computer-aided analysis of the approximability of any specific constraint satisfaction problem. The novelty of our work is in using their work to get an analysis that applies to infinitely many problems simultaneously.</summary>

    <title>TR22-067 |  Black-box Identity Testing of Noncommutative Rational Formulas of Inversion Height Two in Deterministic Quasipolynomial-time | 

	Vikraman Arvind, 

	Abhranil Chatterjee, 

	Partha Mukhopadhyay</title>
    <summary>Hrube\v{s} and Wigderson (2015) initiated the complexity-theoretic study of noncommutative formulas with inverse gates. They introduced the Rational Identity Testing (RIT) problem which is to decide whether a noncommutative rational formula computes zero in the free skew field. In the white-box setting, deterministic polynomial-time algorithms are known for this problem following the works of Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Wigderson (2016) and Ivanyos, Qiao, and Subrahmanyam (2018).

A central open problem in this area is to design an efficient deterministic black-box identity testing algorithm for rational formulas. In this paper, we solve this problem for the first nested inverse case. More precisely, we obtain a deterministic quasipolynomial-time black-box RIT algorithm for noncommutative rational formulas of inversion height two via a hitting set construction. Several new technical ideas are involved in the hitting set construction, including key concepts from matrix coefficient realization theory (Vol?i?, 2018) and properties of cyclic division algebra (Lam, 2001). En route to the proof, an important step is to embed the hitting set of Forbes and Shpilka for noncommutative formulas (2013) inside a cyclic division algebra of small index.</summary>

    <title>TR22-066 |  On sketching approximations for symmetric Boolean CSPs | 

	Joanna Boyland, 

	Michael Hwang, 

	Tarun Prasad, 

	Noah Singer, 

	Santhoshini Velusamy</title>
    <summary>A Boolean maximum constraint satisfaction problem, Max-CSP\((f)\), is specified by a predicate \(f:\{-1,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}\). An \(n\)-variable instance of Max-CSP\((f)\) consists of a list of constraints, each of which applies \(f\) to \(k\) distinct literals drawn from the \(n\) variables. For \(k=2\), Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy [CGV20, FOCS 2020] obtained explicit ratios characterizing the \(\sqrt n\)-space streaming approximability of every predicate. For \(k \geq 3\), Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy [CGSV21, arXiv:2102.12351] proved a general dichotomy theorem for \(\sqrt n\)-space sketching algorithms: For every \(f\), there exists \(\alpha(f)\in (0,1]\) such that for every \(\epsilon&gt;0\), Max-CSP\((f)\) is \((\alpha(f)-\epsilon)\)-approximable by an \(O(\log n)\)-space linear sketching algorithm, but \((\alpha(f)+\epsilon)\)-approximation sketching algorithms require \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) space.
     
In this work, we give closed-form expressions for the sketching approximation ratios of multiple families of symmetric Boolean functions. Letting \(\alpha'_k = 2^{-(k-1)} (1-k^{-2})^{(k-1)/2}\), we show that for odd \(k \geq 3\), \(\alpha(k\)AND\()\, = \alpha'_k\), and for even \(k \geq 2\), \(\alpha(k\)AND\()\, = 2\alpha'_{k+1}\). Thus, for every \(k\), \(k\)AND can be \((2-o(1))2^{-k}\)-approximated by \(O(\log n)\)-space sketching algorithms; we contrast this with a lower bound of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, Velingker, and Velusamy [STOC 2022] implying that streaming \((2+\epsilon)\cdot2^{-k}\)-approximations require \(\Omega(n)\) space! We also resolve the ratio for the "at-least-\((k-1)\)-\(1\)'s" function for all even \(k\); the "exactly-\(\frac{k+1}2\)-\(1\)'s" function for odd \(k \in \{3,\ldots,51\}\); and fifteen other functions. We stress here that for general \(f\), the dichotomy theorem in [CGSV21] only implies that \(\alpha(f)\) can be computed to arbitrary precision in \(\textbf{PSPACE}\), and thus closed-form expressions need not have existed a priori. Our analyses involve identifying and exploiting structural "saddle-point" properties of this dichotomy.
    
Separately, for all threshold functions, we give optimal "bias-based" approximation algorithms generalizing [CGV20] while simplifying [CGSV21]. Finally, we investigate the \(\sqrt n\)-space streaming lower bounds in [CGSV21], and show that they are incomplete for \(3\)AND, i.e., they fail to rule out \((\alpha(3\)AND\()-\epsilon)\)-approximations in \(o(\sqrt n)\) space.</summary>

<i>Retire from your job, but never retire your mind.</i></p>
<p>
Bob Sedgewick is becoming an <a href="https://dof.princeton.edu/book/export/html/5486">emeritus</a> professor: </p>
<p>
When Faculty transfer to emeritus status and retain a professional connection with Princeton, they are expected to conduct their future research and University-related activities with the same ethical standards currently expected from all Princeton Faculty. </p>
<p>
Emeritus faculty members may receive such University publications as the Princeton University Bulletin and the Princeton Alumni Weekly, as well as agendas and minutes of University Faculty Meetings. They may attend meetings of the University and departmental faculty upon invitation, but do not have votes at these meetings. Emeritus faculty members continue to receive University identification cards and to have use of the library, the athletic facilities and dining facilities on the same basis as active faculty members. </p>
<p>
A not so recent picture: <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/rs/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19971" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rs.jpg?resize=218%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="218"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Some History </b></p>
<p/><p>
Sedgewick got his PhD at Stanford and returned to Brown to start his academic career as an assistant professor in 1975. He was promoted to associate professor in 1980 and full professor in 1983. At Brown, he <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/events/25th-anniversary/hist_text.html">participated</a> in the <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2014/05/cs35#:~:text=This year marks the 35th,Digital VAX-11/80.">founding</a> of the computer science department, in 1979. </p>
<p>
Later in 1985 he joined the faculty at Princeton as <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/05/03/sedgewick-recognized-contribution-computer-science-education">founding</a> chair of the Department of Computer Science. Two founding positions—pretty neat. His first-year courses in computer science are among the most popular ever offered at Princeton. He also pioneered the practice of replacing large live lectures with on-demand online videos—pretty clever. </p>
<p>
Bob has worked at research institutions outside of Princeton during summers and leaves. Three come to mind: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://idaccr.org/about-us">IDA</a>, the Institute for Defense Analyses, gave him an opportunity to work with the CRAY-1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">supercomputer</a>.
</li><li> <a href="https://www.parc.com">PARC</a>, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, gave him an opportunity to see the personal computer come into existence.
</li><li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Institute_for_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Automation">INRIA</a>, The Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, gave him a chance to work closely with Philippe Flajolet
</li></ul>
<p>
I joined him at IDA a few years later. I had to get a security clearance which is another whole story—see this <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/09/03/open-problems-that-might-be-easy/">post</a> for some fun thoughts.</p>

Bob and I wrote some papers together: Two were on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration">VLSI</a>. The first on <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1981Lower.pdf">lower</a> bounds on the size of chips that computed something and the second on a language <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1982ALI.pdf">ALI</a> for designing VLSI circuits. </p>
<p>
Another paper was included also Jin-yi Cai and Andy Yao on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/336546">Towards Uncheatable benchmarks</a>. Or see a follow-on <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-35568-9_18.pdf">paper</a>. </p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>So, I’d been planning a fun post for today about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E">DALL-E</a> image-generating AI model, and in particular, a brief new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13807">preprint</a> about DALL-E’s capabilities by <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~davise/">Ernest Davis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Marcus">Gary Marcus</a>, and myself.  We wrote this preprint as a sort of “adversarial collaboration”: Ernie and Gary started out deeply skeptical of DALL-E, while I was impressed bordering on awestruck.  I was pleasantly surprised that we nevertheless managed to produce a text that we all agreed on.</p>



<p>Not for the first time, though, world events have derailed my plans.  The most important part of today’s post is this:</p>



<p><strong>For the next week, I, Scott Aaronson, will personally match all reader donations to <a href="https://fundtexaschoice.org/">Fund Texas Choice</a>—a group that helps women in Texas travel to out-of-state health clinics, for reasons that are neither your business nor mine—up to a total of $5,000.</strong></p>



<p>To show my seriousness, I’ve already donated $1,000.  Just let me know how much you’ve donated in the comments section!</p>



<p>The first reason for this donation drive is that, perhaps like many of you, I stayed up hours last night reading Alito’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21835435-scotus-initial-draft">leaked decision</a> in a state of abject terror.  I saw how the logic of the decision, consistent and impeccable on its own terms, is one by which the Supreme Court’s five theocrats could now proceed to unravel the whole of modernity.  I saw how this court, unchecked by our broken democratic system, can now permanently enshrine the will of a radical minority, perhaps unless and until the United States is plunged into a second Civil War.</p>



<p>Anyway, that’s the first reason for the donation drive.  The second reason is to thank <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>‘s commenters for their … err, consistently generous and thought-provoking contributions.  Let’s take, for example, <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405#comment-1938839">this</a> comment on last week’s admittedly <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405">rather silly post</a>, from an anonymous individual who calls herself “Feminist Bitch,” and who was enraged that it took me <em>a</em> <em>full day</em> to process one of the great political cataclysms of our lifetimes and publicly react to it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>OF COURSE. Not a word about Roe v. Wade being overturned, but we get a pseudo-intellectual rationalist-tier rant about whatever’s bumping around Scott’s mind right now. Women’s most basic reproductive rights are being curtailed AS WE SPEAK and not a peep from Scott, eh? Even though in our state (Texas) there are already laws ON THE BOOKS that will criminalize abortion as soon as the alt-right fascists in our Supreme Court give the go-ahead. If you cared one lick about your female students and colleagues, Scott, you’d be posting about the Supreme Court and helping feminist causes, not posting your “memes.” But we all know Scott doesn’t give a shit about women. He’d rather stand up for creepy nerdbros and their right to harass women than women’s right to control their own fucking bodies. Typical Scott.</p></blockquote>



<p>If you want, you can <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405#comment-1938839">read</a> all of Feminist Bitch’s further thoughts about my failings, with my every attempt to explain and justify myself met with further contempt.  No doubt my well-meaning friends of both sexes would counsel me to ignore her.  Alas, from my <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/the-blog-comment-that-achieved-an-internet-miracle/384539/">infamous ordeal</a> of late 2014, I know that with her every word, Feminist Bitch speaks for thousands, and the knowledge eats at me day and night.</p>



<p>It’s often said that “the right looks for converts, while the left looks only for heretics.”  Has Feminist Bitch ever stopped to think about <em>how</em> our civilization reached its current terrifying predicament—how Trump won in 2016, how the Supreme Court got packed with extremists who represent a mere 25% of the country, how Putin and Erdogan and Orban and Bolsonaro and all the rest consolidated their power?  Does she think it happened because wokeists like herself reached out too much, made too many inroads among fellow citizens who share <em>some</em> but not <em>all</em> of their values?  Would Feminist Bitch say that, if the Democrats want to capitalize on the coming tsunami of outrage about the death of <em>Roe</em> and the shameless lies that enabled it, if they want to sweep to victory in the midterms and enshrine abortion rights into federal law … then their best strategy would be to double down on their condemnations of gross, creepy, smelly, white male nerdbros who all the girls, like, <em>totally hate</em>?</p>



<p>(until, thank God, some of them don’t)</p>



<p>I continue to think that the majority of my readers, of all races and sexes and backgrounds, are reasonable and sane.  I continue to think the majority of you recoil against hatred and dehumanization of <em>anyone</em>—whether that means women seeking abortions, gays, trans folks, or (gasp!) even white male techbros.  In this sad twilight for the United States and for liberal democracy around the world, we the reasonable and sane, we the fans of the Enlightenment, we the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3922">Party of Psychological Complexity</a>, have decades of work cut out for us.  For now I’ll simply say: I don’t hear from you nearly enough in the comments.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-065 |  Streaming and Sketching Complexity of CSPs: A survey | 

	Madhu Sudan</title>
    <summary>In this survey we describe progress over the last decade or so in understanding the complexity of solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) approximately in the streaming and sketching models of computation. After surveying some of the results we give some sketches of the proofs and in particular try to explain why there is a tight dichotomy result for sketching algorithms working in subpolynomial space regime.</summary>

    <title>TR22-064 |  Improved Low-Depth Set-Multilinear Circuit Lower Bounds | 

	Deepanshu Kush, 

	Shubhangi Saraf</title>
    <summary>In this paper, we prove strengthened lower bounds for constant-depth set-multilinear formulas. More precisely, we show that over any field, there is an explicit polynomial $f$ in VNP defined over $n^2$ variables, and of degree $n$, such that any product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formula computing $f$ has size at least $n^{\Omega \left( n^{1/\Delta}/\Delta\right)}$. The hard polynomial $f$ comes from the class of Nisan-Wigderson (NW) design-based polynomials. 

Our lower bounds improve upon the recent work of Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas (STOC 2022), where a lower bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega (\Delta n^{1/\Delta})}$ was shown for the size of product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formulas computing the iterated matrix multiplication (IMM) polynomial of the same degree and over the same number of variables as $f$. Moreover, our lower bounds are novel for any $\Delta\geq 2$.

The precise quantitative expression in our lower bound is interesting also because the lower bounds we obtain are "sharp" in the sense that any asymptotic improvement would imply general set-multilinear circuit lower bounds via depth reduction results. 

In the setting of general set-multilinear formulas, a lower bound of the form $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ was already obtained by Raz (J. ACM 2009) for the more general model of multilinear formulas. The techniques of LST (which extend the techniques of the same authors in (FOCS 2021)) give a different route to set-multilinear formula lower bounds, and allow them to obtain a lower bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega(\log n)}$ for the size of general set-multilinear formulas computing the IMM polynomial. Our proof techniques are another variation on those of LST, and enable us to show an improved lower bound (matching that of Raz) of the form $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$, albeit for the same polynomial $f$ in VNP (the NW polynomial). As observed by LST, if the same $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ size lower bounds for unbounded-depth set-multilinear formulas could be obtained for the IMM polynomial, then using the self-reducibility of IMM and using hardness escalation results, this would imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general algebraic formulas.</summary>

    <title>TR22-063 |  Fast Multivariate Multipoint Evaluation Over All Finite Fields | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	Sumanta Ghosh, 

	Zeyu Guo, 

	Chris Umans, 

	Vishwas Bhargava</title>
    <summary>Multivariate multipoint evaluation is the problem of evaluating a multivariate polynomial, given as a coefficient vector, simultaneously at multiple evaluation points. In this work, we show that there exists a deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over any finite field $\mathbb{F}$ that outputs the evaluations of an $m$-variate polynomial of degree less than $d$ in each variable at $N$ points in time 
\[
(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\cdot poly(m,d,\log|\F|)
\]
for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and all sufficiently large $d\in \mathbb{N}$.

A previous work of Kedlaya and Umans (FOCS 2008, SICOMP 2011) achieved the same time complexity when the number of variables $m$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ and had left the problem of removing this condition as an open problem. A recent work of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra (STOC 2022) answered this question when the underlying field is not too large  and has characteristic less than $d^{o(1)}$. In this work, we remove this constraint on the number of variables over all finite fields, thereby answering the question of Kedlaya and Umans over all finite fields. 

Our algorithm relies on a non-trivial combination of ideas from three seemingly different previously known algorithms for multivariate multipoint evaluation, namely the algorithms of Kedlaya and Umans, that of  Bj\"orklund, Kaski and Williams (IPEC 2017, Algorithmica 2019), and that of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra, together with a result of Bombieri and Vinogradov from analytic number theory about the distribution of primes in an arithmetic progression. 

We also present a second algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation that is completely elementary and in particular, avoids the use of the Bombieri--Vinogradov Theorem. However, it requires a mild assumption that the field size is bounded by an exponential-tower in $d$ of bounded height. More specifically, our second algorithm solves the multivariate multipoint evaluation problem over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ in time 
\[
(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\cdot poly(m,d,\log |\mathbb{F}|)\]
for all $m\in \mathbb{N}$ and all sufficiently large $d\in \mathbb{N}$, provided that the size of the finite field $\mathbb{F}$ is at most $(\exp(\exp(\exp(\cdots (\exp(d)))))$, where the height of this tower of exponentials is fixed.</summary>
