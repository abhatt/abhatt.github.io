    <summary>The Stabbing Planes proof system was introduced to model the reasoning carried out in practical mixed integer programming solvers. As a proof system, it is powerful enough to simulate Cutting Planes and to refute the Tseitin formulas -- certain unsatisfiable systems of linear equations mod 2 -- which are canonical hard examples for many algebraic proof systems. In a recent (and surprising) result, Dadush and Tiwari showed that these short refutations of the Tseitin formulas could be translated into quasi-polynomial size and depth Cutting Planes proofs, refuting a long-standing conjecture. This translation raises several interesting questions. First, whether all Stabbing Planes proofs can be efficiently simulated by Cutting Planes. This would allow for the substantial analysis done on the Cutting Planes system to be lifted to practical mixed integer programming solvers. Second, whether the quasi-polynomial depth of these proofs is inherent to Cutting Planes. 

In this paper we make progress towards answering both of these questions. First, we show that any Stabbing Planes proof with bounded coefficients SP* can be translated into Cutting Planes. As a consequence of the known lower bounds for Cutting Planes, this establishes the first exponential lower bounds on SP*. Using this translation, we extend the result of Dadush and Tiwari to show that Cutting Planes has short refutations of any unsatisfiable system of linear equations over a finite field. Like the Cutting Planes proofs of Dadush and Tiwari, our refutations also incur a quasi-polynomial blow-up in depth, and we conjecture that this is inherent. As a step towards this conjecture, we develop a new geometric technique for proving lower bounds on the depth of Cutting Planes proofs. This allows us to establish the first lower bounds on the depth of Semantic Cutting Planes proofs of the Tseitin formulas.</summary>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">Back in June, New York Times technology reporter Cade Metz, who I’d previously known from his reporting on quantum computing, told me that he was writing a story about Scott Alexander, Slate Star Codex, and the rationalist community.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Back in June, <em>New York Times</em> technology reporter Cade Metz, who I’d previously known from his reporting on quantum computing, told me that he was writing a story about Scott Alexander, Slate Star Codex, and the rationalist community.  Given my position as someone who <em>knew</em> the rationalist community without ever really being <em>part</em> of it, Cade wondered whether I’d talk with him.  I said I’d be delighted to.</p>



<p>I spent many hours with Cade, taking his calls and emails morning or night, at the playground with my kids or wherever else I was, answering his questions, giving context for his other interviews, suggesting people in the rationalist community for him to talk to, in exactly the same way I might suggest colleagues for a quantum computing story.  And then I spent just as much time urging those people to talk to Cade.  (“How could you possibly not want to talk?  It’s the <em>New York Times</em>!”)  Some of the people I suggested agreed to talk; others refused; a few were livid at me for giving a <em>New York Times</em> reporter their email addresses without asking them.  (I apologized; lesson learned.)</p>



<p>What happened next is already the stuff of Internet history: the NYT’s threat to publish Scott’s real surname; Scott deleting his blog as a way to preempt that ‘doxing’; 8,000 people, including me, signing a <a href="https://www.dontdoxscottalexander.com/">petition</a> urging the NYT to respect Scott’s wish to keep his professional and blog identities separate; Scott resigning from his psychiatry clinic and starting his own low-cost practice, <a href="https://lorienpsych.com/">Lorien Psychiatry</a>; his moving his blog, like so many other writers this year, to <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>; then, a few weeks ago, his <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/">triumphant return</a> to blogging under his real name of Scott Siskind.  All this against the backdrop of an 8-month period that was world-changingly historic in so many other ways: the failed violent insurrection against the United States and the ouster, by democratic means, of the president who incited it; the tragedy of covid and the long-delayed start of the vaccination campaign; the BLM protests; the well-publicized upheavals at the NYT itself, including firings for ideological lapses that would’ve made little sense to our remote ancestors of ~2010.</p>



<p>And now, as an awkward coda, the <em>New York Times</em> article itself is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/technology/slate-star-codex-rationalists.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">finally out</a> (<a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/business/technology/why-slate-star-codex-is-silicon-valley-s-safe-space-950727.html">non-paywalled version here</a>).  It could’ve been worse.  I doubt it will do lasting harm.  Of the many choices I disagreed with, I don’t know which were Cade’s and which his editors’.  But no, I wasn’t happy with it.  If you want a feature-length, pop condensation of the rationalist community and its ideas, I preferred <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/slate-star-codex-and-silicon-valleys-war-against-the-media">this summer’s <em>New Yorker</em> article</a>.</p>



<p>The trouble with the NYT piece is not that it makes any false statements, but just that it constantly <em>insinuates</em> nefarious beliefs and motives, via strategic word choices and omission of relevant facts that change the emotional coloration of the facts that it <em>does</em> present.  I repeatedly muttered to myself, as I read: “dude, you could make <em>anything</em> sound shady with this exact same rhetorical toolkit!” </p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s a partial list of my issues:</p>



<ol><li>The piece includes the following ominous sentence: “But in late June of last year, when I approached Siskind to discuss the blog, it vanished.”  This framing, it seems to me, would be appropriate for some conman trying to evade accountability without ever explaining himself.  It doesn’t make much sense for a practicing psychiatrist who took the dramatic step of deleting his blog <em>in order to preserve his relationship with his patients</em>—thereby complying with an ethical code that’s universal among psychiatrists, even if slightly strange to the rest of us—and who immediately explained his reasoning to the entire world.  In the latter framing, of course, Scott comes across less like a fugitive on the run and more like an innocent victim of a newspaper’s editorial obstinacy.</li><li>As expected, the piece devotes enormous space to the idea of rationalism as an on-ramp to alt-right extremism.  The trouble is, it never presents the idea that rationalism also can be an <em>off-ramp</em> from extremism—i.e., that it can provide a model for how even after you realize that mainstream sources are confidently wrong on some issue, you don’t respond by embracing conspiracy theories and hatreds, you respond by simply thinking carefully about each individual question rather than buying a worldview wholesale from anyone.  Nor does the NYT piece mention how Scott, precisely <em>because</em> he gives right-wing views more charity than some of us might feel they deserve, actually succeeded in dissuading some of his readers from voting for Trump—which is more success than I can probably claim in that department!  I had many conversations with Cade about these angles that are nowhere reflected in the piece.</li><li>The piece gets off to a weird foot, by describing the rationalists as “a group that aimed to re-examine the world through cold and careful thought.”  Why “cold”?  Like, let’s back up a few steps: what is even the <em>connection</em> in the popular imagination between rationality and “coldness”?  To me, as to many others, the humor, humanity, and <em>warmth</em> of Scott’s writing were always among its most notable features.</li><li>The piece makes liberal use of scare quotes.  Most amusingly, it puts scare quotes around the phrase “Bayesian reasoning”!</li><li>The piece never mentions that many rationalists (Zvi Mowshowitz, Jacob Falkovich, Kelsey Piper…) were right about the risk of covid-19 in early 2020, and then <em>again</em> right about masks, aerosol transmission, faster-spreading variants, the need to get vaccines into arms faster, and many other subsidiary issues, even while public health authorities and the mainstream press struggled for months longer to reach the same obvious-in-retrospect conclusions.  This omission is significant because Cade told me, in June, that the rationality community’s early rightness about covid was a factor that <em>led him to want to write the piece in the first place</em>.  If readers knew this clear success story, would it put a different spin on the rationalists’ weird, cultlike obsession with “Bayesian reasoning” and “consequentialist ethics” (whatever those are), or their nerdy, idiosyncratic worries about the more remote future?</li><li>The piece contains the following striking sentence: “On the internet, many in Silicon Valley believe, everyone has the right not only to say what they want but to say it anonymously.”  Well, yes, except this framing makes it sound like this is a fringe belief of some radical Silicon Valley tribe, rather than just the standard expectation of most of the billions of people who’ve used the Internet for most of its half-century of existence.</li><li>Despite thousands of words about the content of SSC, the piece never gives Scott a few uninterrupted sentences in his own voice, to convey his style.  This is something the <em>New Yorker</em> piece did do, and which would help readers better understand the wit, humor, charity, and self-doubt that made SSC so popular.  To see what I mean, read the NYT’s quotation of Scott’s now-classic riff on the Red, Blue, and Gray Tribes and decide for yourself whether it captures the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">spirit of the original</a> (alright, I’ll quote it myself at the bottom of this post).  Scott has the property, shared by many of my favorite writers, that if you just properly <em>quote</em> him, his words leap off the page, wriggling free from the grasp of any bracketing explanations and making a direct run for the reader’s brain.  All the more reason to <a href="https://howthehell.substack.com/p/nyt-ssc-quoting">quote him</a> then!</li><li>The piece describes SSC as “astoundingly verbose.”  A more neutral way to put it would be that Scott has <em>produced a vast quantity of intellectual output</em>.  When I finish a Scott Alexander piece, only in a minority of cases do I feel like he spent more words examining a problem than its complexities really warranted.  Just as often, I’m left wanting more.</li><li>The piece says that Scott once “aligned himself” with Charles Murray, then goes on to note Murray’s explosive views about race and IQ.  That might be fair enough, were it <em>also</em> mentioned that positions ascribed to Murray that Scott endorses in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200615030810/https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/23/three-great-articles-on-poverty-and-why-i-disagree-with-all-of-them/">relevant post</a> —namely, “hereditarian leftism” and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income">universal basic income</a>—are not only unrelated to race but are actually <em>progressive</em> positions.</li><li>The piece says that Scott once had neoreactionary thinker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Land">Nick Land</a> on his blogroll.  Again, important context is missing: this was back when Land was mainly known for his strange writings on AI and philosophy, <em>before</em> his neoreactionary turn.</li><li>The piece says that Scott compared “some feminists” to Voldemort.  It didn’t explain what it took for certain specific feminists (like Amanda Marcotte) to prompt that comparison, which might have changed the coloration.  (Another thing that would’ve complicated the picture: the rationalist community’s legendary openness to alternative gender identities and sexualities, before such openness became mainstream.)</li><li>Speaking of feminists—yeah, I’m a minor part of the article.  One of the few things mentioned about me is that I’ve stayed in a rationalist group house.  (If you must know: for like two nights, when I was in Bay Area, with my wife and kids.  We appreciated the hospitality!)  The piece also says that I was “turned off by the more rigid and contrarian beliefs of the Rationalists.”  It’s true that I’ve <em>disagreed</em> with many beliefs espoused by Rationalists, but not <em>because</em> they were contrarian, or because I found them noticeably more “rigid” than most beliefs—only because I thought the beliefs were mistaken!</li><li>The piece describes Eliezer Yudkowsky as a “polemicist and self-described AI researcher.”  It’s true that Eliezer opines about AI despite a lack of conventional credentials in that field, and it’s also true that the typical NYT reader might find him to be comically self-aggrandizing.  But had the piece mentioned the universally recognized AI experts, like Stuart Russell, who credit Yudkowsky for a central role in the AI safety movement, wouldn’t that have changed what readers perceived as the take-home message?</li><li>The piece says the following about Shane Legg and Demis Hassabis, the founders of DeepMind: “Like the Rationalists, they believed that AI could end up turning against humanity, and because they held this belief, they felt they were among the only ones who were prepared to build it in a safe way.”  This strikes me as a brilliant way to reframe a concern around AI safety as something vaguely sinister.  Imagine if the following framing had been chosen instead: “Amid Silicon Valley’s mad rush to invest in AI, here are the voices urging that it be done safely and in accord with human welfare…”</li></ol>



<p>Reading this article, some will say that they told me so, or even that I was played for a fool.  And yet I confess that, even with hindsight, I have no idea what I should have done differently, how it would’ve improved the outcome, or what I <em>will</em> do differently the next time.  Was there some better, savvier way for me to help out?  For each of the 14 points listed above, were I ever tempted to bang my head and say, “dammit, I wish I’d told Cade X, so his story could’ve reflected that perspective”—well, the truth of the matter is that I <em>did</em> tell him X!  It’s just that I don’t get to decide which X’s make the final cut, or which ideological filter they’re passed through first.</p>



<p>On reflection, then, I’ll continue to talk to journalists, whenever I have time, whenever I think I might know something that might improve their story.  I’ll continue to rank bend-over-backwards openness and honesty among my fundamental values.  Hell, I’ll even talk to Cade for a future story, assuming he’ll talk to me after all the disagreements I’ve aired here!</p>



<p>For one thing that became apparent from this saga is that I <em>do</em> have a deep difference with the rationalists, one that will likely prevent me from ever truly joining them.  Yes, there might be true and important things that one can’t say without risking one’s livelihood.  At least, there were in every <em>other</em> time and culture, so it would be shocking if Western culture circa 2021 were the lone exception.  But unlike the rationalists, I don’t feel the urge to form walled gardens in which to say those things anyway.  I simply accept that, in the age of instantaneous communication, <em>there are no walled gardens</em>: anything you say to a dozen or more people, you might as well broadcast to the planet.  Sure, we all have things we say only in the privacy of our homes or to a few friends—a privilege that I expect even the most orthodox would like to preserve, at any rate for themselves.  Beyond that, though, my impulse has always been to look for non-obvious truths that <em>can</em> be shared openly, and that might light little candles of understanding in one or two minds—and then to shout those truths from the rooftops under my own name, and learn what I can from whatever sounds come in reply.</p>



<p>So I’m thrilled that Scott Alexander Siskind has now rearranged his life to have the same privilege.  Whatever its intentions, I hope today’s <em>New York Times</em> article draws tens of thousands of curious new readers to Scott’s new-yet-old blog, <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/">Astral Codex Ten</a>, so they can see for themselves what I and so many others saw in it.  I hope Scott continues blogging for decades.  And whatever obscene amount of money Substack is now paying Scott, I hope they’ll soon be paying him even more.</p>

<p>Alright, now for the promised quote, from <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">I Can Tolerate Anything Except the Outgroup</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs, strong evangelical religious beliefs, creationism, opposing gay marriage, owning guns, eating steak, drinking Coca-Cola, driving SUVs, watching lots of TV, enjoying American football, getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies, marrying early, divorcing early, shouting “USA IS NUMBER ONE!!!”, and listening to country music.</p><p>The Blue Tribe is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs, vague agnosticism, supporting gay rights, thinking guns are barbaric, eating arugula, drinking fancy bottled water, driving Priuses, reading lots of books, being highly educated, mocking American football, feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it, getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots, marrying later, constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America, and listening to “everything except country”.</p><p>(There is a partly-formed attempt to spin off a Grey Tribe typified by libertarian political beliefs, Dawkins-style atheism, vague annoyance that the question of gay rights even comes up, eating paleo, drinking Soylent, calling in rides on Uber, reading lots of blogs, calling American football “sportsball”, getting conspicuously upset about the War on Drugs and the NSA, and listening to filk – but for our current purposes this is a distraction and they can safely be considered part of the Blue Tribe most of the time)</p><p>… Even in something as seemingly politically uncharged as going to California Pizza Kitchen or Sushi House for dinner, I’m restricting myself to the set of people who like cute artisanal pizzas or sophsticated foreign foods, which are classically Blue Tribe characteristics.</p></blockquote></div>

    <title>TR21-011 |  Classification of the streaming approximability of Boolean CSPs | 

	Santhoshini Velusamy, 

	Chi-Ning  Chou, 

	Madhu Sudan, 

	Alexander Golovnev</title>
    <summary>A Boolean constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), Max-CSP$(f)$, is a maximization problem specified by a constraint $f:\{-1,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}$. An instance of the problem consists of $m$ constraint applications on $n$ Boolean variables, where each constraint application applies the constraint to $k$ literals chosen from the $n$ variables and their negations. The goal is to compute the maximum number of constraints that can be satisfied by a Boolean assignment to the $n$ variables. In the $(\gamma,\beta)$-approximation version of the problem for parameters $\gamma \geq \beta \in [0,1]$, the goal is to distinguish instances where at least $\gamma$ fraction of the constraints can be satisfied from instances where at most $\beta$ fraction of the constraints can be satisfied. 

In this work we completely characterize the approximability of all Boolean CSPs in the streaming model. Specifically, given $f$, $\gamma$ and $\beta$ we show that either (1) the $(\gamma,\beta)$-approximation version of Max-CSP$(f)$ has a probabilistic streaming algorithm using $O(\log n)$ space, or (2) for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ the $(\gamma-\epsilon,\beta+\epsilon)$-approximation version of Max-CSP$(f)$ requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space for probabilistic streaming algorithms. Previously such a separation was known only for $k=2$. We stress that for $k=2$, there are only finitely many distinct problems to consider.

Our positive results show wider applicability of bias-based algorithms used previously by [Guruswami-Velingker-Velusamy APPROX'17], [Chou-Golovnev-Velusamy FOCS'20] by giving a systematic way to explore biases. Our negative results combine the Fourier analytic methods of [Kapralov-Khanna-Sudan SODA'15], which we extend to a wider class of CSPs, with a rich collection of reductions among communication complexity problems that lie at the heart of the negative results.</summary>

    <title>Algorithms, Reductions and Equivalences for Small Weight Variants of All-Pairs Shortest Paths</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Chan:Timothy_M=.html">Timothy M.

Margalit'97] has an $\tilde{O}(n^\omega)$ time algorithm, where $\omega&lt;2.373$
is the matrix multiplication exponent. APSP in directed graphs with small
weights however, has a much slower running time that would be $\Omega(n^{2.5})$
even if $\omega=2$ [Zwick'02]. To understand this $n^{2.5}$ bottleneck, we
build a web of reductions around directed unweighted APSP. We show that it is
fine-grained equivalent to computing a rectangular Min-Plus product for
matrices with integer entries; the dimensions and entry size of the matrices
depend on the value of $\omega$. As a consequence, we establish an equivalence
between APSP in directed unweighted graphs, APSP in directed graphs with small
$(\tilde{O}(1))$ integer weights, All-Pairs Longest Paths in DAGs with small
weights, approximate APSP with additive error $c$ in directed graphs with small
weights, for $c\le \tilde{O}(1)$ and several other graph problems. We also
provide fine-grained reductions from directed unweighted APSP to All-Pairs
Shortest Lightest Paths (APSLP) in undirected graphs with $\{0,1\}$ weights and
$\#_{\text{mod}\ c}$APSP in directed unweighted graphs (computing counts mod
$c$).
</p>
<p>We complement our hardness results with new algorithms. We improve the known
algorithms for APSLP in directed graphs with small integer weights and for
approximate APSP with sublinear additive error in directed unweighted graphs.
Our algorithm for approximate APSP with sublinear additive error is optimal,
when viewed as a reduction to Min-Plus product. We also give new algorithms for
variants of #APSP in unweighted graphs, as well as a near-optimal
$\tilde{O}(n^3)$-time algorithm for the original #APSP problem in unweighted
graphs. Our techniques also lead to a simpler alternative for the original APSP
problem in undirected graphs with small integer weights.

about tractable generative and discriminative models. In this paper, we show
how complex inference scenarios for these models that commonly arise in machine
learning -- from computing the expectations of decision tree ensembles to
information-theoretic divergences of deep mixture models -- can be represented
in terms of tractable modular operations over circuits. Specifically, we
characterize the tractability of a vocabulary of simple transformations --
sums, products, quotients, powers, logarithms, and exponentials -- in terms of
sufficient structural constraints of the circuits they operate on, and present
novel hardness results for the cases in which these properties are not
satisfied. Building on these operations, we derive a unified framework for
reasoning about tractable models that generalizes several results in the
literature and opens up novel tractable inference scenarios.

    <title>Sweeps, polytopes, oriented matroids, and allowable graphs of permutations</title>

functional. Posets of sweeps of planar point configurations were formalized and
abstracted by Goodman and Pollack under the theory of allowable sequences of
permutations. We introduce two generalizations that model posets of sweeps of
higher dimensional configurations.
</p>
<p>Mimicking the fact that sweep polytopes of point configurations (the monotone
path polytopes of the associated zonotopes) are projections of permutahedra, we
define sweep oriented matroids as strong maps of the braid oriented matroid.
Allowable sequences are then the sweep oriented matroids of rank 2, and many of
their properties extend to higher rank. We show strong ties between sweep
oriented matroids and both modular hyperplanes and Dilworth truncations from
(unoriented) matroid theory. We also explore their connection with the
generalized Baues problem for cellular strings, where sweep oriented matroids
can play the role of monotone path polytopes, even for non-realizable oriented
matroids. In particular, we show that for oriented matroids that admit a sweep
oriented matroid, their poset of pseudo-sweeps deformation retracts to a sphere
of the appropriate dimension.
</p>
<p>A second generalization are allowable graphs of permutations: symmetric sets
of permutations pairwise connected by allowable sequences. They have the
structure of acycloids and include sweep oriented matroids.

Procaccia</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06115">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Participatory budgeting is a method used by city governments to select public
projects to fund based on residents' votes. Many cities use participatory
budgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts
proportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over
local projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by
its voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor
social welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across
multiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global
social welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A
social-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred
by a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.
Thus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory
budgeting setting with a single city-wide election. We propose a notion of
fairness that guarantees each district at least as much welfare as it would
have received in a district-level election. We show that, although optimizing
social welfare subject to this notion of fairness is NP-hard, we can
efficiently construct a lottery over welfare-optimal outcomes that is fair in
expectation. Moreover, we show that, when we are allowed to slightly relax
fairness, we can efficiently compute a fair solution that is
welfare-maximizing, but which may overspend the budget.

$\mathcal{F}$-Free Edge Deletion, where the goal is to remove minimum number of
edges such that the resulting graph does not contain any $F\in \mathcal{F}$ as
a subgraph. For the parameter treewidth, the question of whether the problem is
FPT has remained open. Here we give a negative answer by showing that the
problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treewidth, which rules out FPT
algorithms under common assumption. Thus we give a solution to the conjecture
posted by Jessica Enright and Kitty Meeks in [Algorithmica 80 (2018)
1857-1889]. We also prove that the $\mathcal{F}$-Free Edge Deletion problem is
W[2]-hard when parameterized by the solution size $k$, feedback vertex set
number or pathwidth of the input graph. A special case of particular interest
is the situation in which $\mathcal{F}$ is the set $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$ of all
trees on $h+1$ vertices, so that we delete edges in order to obtain a graph in
which every component contains at most $h$ vertices. This is desirable from the
point of view of restricting the spread of disease in transmission network. We
prove that the $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Edge Deletion problem is
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the vertex cover number.
We also prove that it admits a kernel with $O(hk)$ vertices and $O(h^2k)$
edges, when parameterized by combined parameters $h$ and the solution size $k$.

sensitive personal information. Training large-scale deep models that are
guaranteed not to leak sensitive information while not compromising their
accuracy has been a significant challenge. In this work, we study the
multi-class classification setting where the labels are considered sensitive
and ought to be protected. We propose a new algorithm for training deep neural
networks with label differential privacy, and run evaluations on several
datasets. For Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10, we demonstrate that our algorithm
achieves significantly higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art, and in some
regimes comes close to the non-private baselines. We also provide non-trivial
training results for the the challenging CIFAR-100 dataset. We complement our
algorithm with theoretical findings showing that in the setting of convex
empirical risk minimization, the sample complexity of training with label
differential privacy is dimension-independent, which is in contrast to vanilla
differential privacy.

constrained version of the classical scheduling problem, in which some jobs are
conflict in the sense that they cannot be proceeded simultaneously on different
machines. This conflict constraint naturally arises in several practical
applications and has recently received considerable attentions in the research
community. In fact, the problem is typically NP-hard (even for approximation)
and most of algorithmic results achieved so far have heavily relied on special
structures of the underlying graph used to model the conflict-job relation. Our
focus is on three objective functions: minimizing the makespan, minimizing the
weighted summation of the jobs' completion time, and maximizing the total
weights of completed jobs; the first two of which have been intensively studied
in the literature. For each objective function considered, we present several
mixed integer linear programming models and a constraint programming model,
from which we can solve the problems to optimality using dedicated solvers.
Binary search-based algorithms are also proposed to solve the makespan problem.
The results of numerical experiments performed on randomly generated data sets
with up to 32 jobs and 6 machines are reported and analysed to verify the
performance of the proposed methods.

the algorithms and carry out analyses on two settings: uniform profit value and
the setting in which every group shares an arbitrary profit profile. We provide
insight into the structure of these problems and show how the weight
correlations and the different types of profit profiles influence the runtime
behavior of both algorithms in the chance-constrained setting.

    <title>A better lower bound for Lower-Left Anchored Rectangle Packing</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1613174400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Hoeksma:Ruben.html">Ruben Hoeksma</a>, Matthew Maat <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05747">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given any set of points $S$ in the unit square that contains the origin, does
a set of axis aligned rectangles, one for each point in $S$, exist, such that
each of them has a point in $S$ as its lower-left corner, they are pairwise
interior disjoint, and the total area that they cover is at least 1/2? This
question is also known as Freedman's conjecture (conjecturing that such a set
of rectangles does exist) and has been open since Allen Freedman posed it in
1969. In this paper, we improve the best known lower bound on the total area
that can be covered from 0.09121 to 0.1039. Although this step is small, we
introduce new insights that push the limits of this analysis.
</p>
<p>Our lower bound uses a greedy algorithm with a particular order of the points
in $S$. Therefore, it also implies that this greedy algorithm achieves an
approximation ratio of 0.1039. We complement the result with an upper bound of
3/4 on the approximation ratio for a natural class of greedy algorithms that
includes the one that achieves the lower bound.

(OASP), a variant of the orienteering problem for a robot moving in a so-called
single-access aisle-graph, i.e., a graph consisting of a set of rows that can
be accessed from one side only. Aisle-graphs model, among others, vineyards or
warehouses. Each aisle-graph vertex is associated with a reward that a robot
obtains when visits the vertex itself. As the robot's energy is limited, only a
subset of vertices can be visited with a fully charged battery. The objective
is to maximize the total reward collected by the robot with a battery charge.
We first propose an optimal algorithm that solves OASP in O(m^2 n^2) time for
aisle-graphs with a single access consisting of m rows, each with n vertices.
With the goal of designing faster solutions, we propose four greedy sub-optimal
algorithms that run in at most O(mn (m+n)) time. For two of them, we guarantee
an approximation ratio of 1/2(1-1/e), where e is the base of the natural
logarithm, on the total reward by exploiting the well-known submodularity
property. Experimentally, we show that these algorithms collect more than 80%
of the optimal reward.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I am taking advantage of the pandemic to participate in conferences where it’s usually hard for me to participate because they require intercontinental travel.  I have a paper in CSR 2021, and now am submitting a paper to ICALP 2021 (I count submission as participation, even in case the paper gets rejected).  The latter requires submissions to be formatted in a specific way, <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia-tcs/">a topic discussed at length on this blog</a>.</p>



<p>Begin 12:48</p>



<p>Download the LIPICs package.</p>



<p>Try to compile their sample paper.</p>



<p>Get error message:  ! LaTeX Error: File `l3backend-dvips.def’ not found.</p>



<p>Google solution.  Says to install packages.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I am using windows but I only have LyX, and the solution expects MixTeX.</p>



<p>Google how to install packages in LyX.</p>



<p>Can’t find anything simple.</p>



<p>Create a new document on overleaf.</p>



<p>Copy all the LIPIcs files there.</p>



<p>Try to compile their sample.</p>



<p>It works!</p>



<p>Paste my latex.</p>



<p>Usual avalanche of problems to be fixed at the speed of light.</p>



<p>Add dummy section “Introduction” which wasn’t in my paper, otherwise theorem numbers look weird.</p>



<p>Numbers still look weird.  Something’s wrong with theorem statements.</p>



<p>Replace {thm} with {theorem}</p>



<p>Looks better.  Still some wrong stuff all around, however.</p>



<p>No it wasn’t that.  Remove the dummy section.  It seems their “paragraph” environment puts strange numbers like 0.0.0.1</p>



<p>Replace \paragaph with \paragaph* everywhere</p>



<p>Actually, looks weird the way they put the ack– put back the dummy Introduction section.</p>



<p>Check page limit: <strong>no more than 12 pages, excluding references</strong></p>



<p>I’m a little over.  Does this really matter?  Apparently, <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/eliminate-all-formatting-requirements-survival-tip/">it does!</a>  Move last proof to the appendix.  Actually, last proof is kind of short, I should move the penultimate proof. Update paper organization (next time I shouldn’t put it).</p>



<p>Final look.  Fix a few indentations.</p>



<p>OK, time to actually submit.  Go to the easychair website.  They want me to re-enter all the information!?  Why, after forcing me to enter title, keywords, etc. in <em>their </em>format, are they asking me to do this again?  Can’t we just send the .tex file and extract it from there?</p>



<p>Oh come one, it’s just a few seconds of copy-paste.</p>



<p>OK, done, paper submitted.</p>



<p>End: 3:05</p>



<p>Well, next time it will be easier.  Perhaps <em>easier</em>, but not <em>easy</em> because as the reader knows there will be another missing package, another incompatible system, etc.  And of course, if the paper is rejected, then I won’t even save the time to convert it into camera-ready format.  On the other hand, the benefit is non-existent.  It would be better for everyone if in order to submit a paper you have to complete a random 1-hour task on Amazon mechanical Turk and donate the profit to charity.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-010 |  Cryptographic Hardness under Projections for Time-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity | 

	Eric Allender, 

	John Gouwar, 

	Shuichi Hirahara, 

	Caleb Robelle</title>
    <summary>A version of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, denoted KT, has received attention in the past several years, due to its close connection to circuit complexity and to the Minimum Circuit Size Problem MCSP. Essentially all results about the complexity of MCSP hold also for MKTP (the problem of computing the KT complexity of a string). Both MKTP and MCSP are hard for SZK (Statistical Zero Knowledge) under BPP-Turing reductions; neither is known to be NP-complete. Recently, some hardness results for MKTP were proved that are not (yet) known to hold for MCSP. In particular, MKTP is hard for DET (a subclass of P) under nonuniform NC^0 m-reductions.

In this paper, we improve this, to show that MKTP is hard for the (apparently larger) class NISZK_L under not only NC^0 m-reductions but even under projections. Also MKTP is hard for NISZK under P/poly m-reductions. Here, NISZK is the class of problems with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and NISZK_L is the non-interactive version of the class SZK_L that was studied by Dvir et al.

As an application, we provide several improved worst-case to average-case reductions to problems in NP.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Packing up the household for a recent move, I was delving into shoeboxes, photo albums, and file folders that had not been opened in decades. One of my discoveries, found in an envelope at the back of a file drawer, was the paper sleeve from a drinking straw, imprinted with a saccharine message:</p>
<p><img alt="Drinking-straw wrapper inscribed &#x201C;It&#x2019;s A Pleasure To Serve You&#x201D;" border="0" class="centered" height="82" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Its-a-Pleasure-to-Serve-You-recto.jpg" width="640"/></p>
<p>This flimsy slip of paper seems like an odd scrap to preserve for the ages, but when I pulled it out of the envelope, I knew instantly where it came from and why I had saved it.</p>
<p>The year was 1967. I was 17 then; I’m 71 now. Transposing those two digits takes just a flick of the fingertips. I can blithely skip back and forth from one prime number to the other. But the span of lived time between 1967 and 2021 is a chasm I cannot so easily leap across. At 17 I was in a great hurry to grow up, but I couldn’t see as far as 71; I didn’t even try. Going the other way—revisiting the mental and emotional life of an adolescent boy—is also a journey deep into alien territory. But the straw wrapper helps—it’s a Proustian <em>aide memoire</em>.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1967 I had a girlfriend, Lynn. After school we would meet at the Maple Diner, where the booths had red leatherette upholstery and formica tabletops with a boomerang motif. We’d order two Cokes and a plate of french fries to share. The waitress liked us; she’d make sure we had a full bottle of ketchup. I mention the ketchup because it was a token of our progress toward intimacy. On our first dates Lynn had put only a dainty dab on her fries, but by April we were comfortable enough to reveal our true appetites.</p>
<p>One afternoon I noticed she was fiddling intently with the wrapper from her straw, folding and refolding. I had no idea what she was up to. A teeny paper airplane she would sail over my head? When she finished, she pushed her creation across the table:</p>
<p><img alt="&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a Pleasure to Serve You&#x201D; folded to read &#x201C;I love You&#x201D;" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Its-a-Pleasure-to-Serve-You-folded.jpg" width="250"/></p>
<p>What a wallop there was in that little wad of paper. At that point in our romance, the words had not yet been spoken aloud. </p>
<p>How did I respond to Lynn’s folded declaration? I can’t remember; the words are lost. But evidently I got through that awkward moment without doing any permanent damage. A year later Lynn and I were married.</p>
<p>Today, at 71, with the preserved artifact in front of me, my chief regret is that I failed to take up the challenge implicit in the word game Lynn had invented. Why didn’t I craft a reply by folding my own straw wrapper? There are quite a few messages I could have extracted by strategic deletions from “It’s a pleasure to serve you.”</p>

<p class="indent">Not all of those statements would have been suited to the occasion of our rendezvous at the Maple Diner, but over the course of our years together—17 years, as it turned out—there came a moment for each of them.</p>
<hr/>
<p>How many words can we form by making folds in the straw-paper slogan? I could not have answered that question in 1967. I couldn’t have even asked it. But times change. Enumerating all the foldable messages now strikes me as an obvious thing to do when presented with the straw wrapper. Furthermore, I have the computational means to do it—although the project was not quite as easy as I expected.</p>
<p>A first step is to be explicit about the rules of the game. We are given a source text, in this case “It’s a pleasure to serve you.” Let us ignore the spaces between words as well as all punctuation and capitalization; in this way we arrive at the normalized text “itsapleasuretoserveyou”. A word is <em>foldable</em> if all of its letters appear in the normalized text in the correct order (though not necessarily consecutively). The folding operation amounts to an editing process in which our only permitted act is deletion of letters; we are not allowed to insert, substitute, or permute. If two or more foldable words are to be combined to make a phrase or sentence, they must follow one another in the correct order without overlaps.</p>
<p>So much for foldability. Next comes the fraught question: What is a word? Linguists and lexicographers offer many subtly divergent opinions on this point, but for present purposes a very simple definition will suffice: A finite sequence of characters drawn from the 26-letter English alphabet is a word if it can legally be played in a game of Scrabble. I have been working with a word list from the 2015 edition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Scrabble_Words">Collins Scrabble Words</a>, which has about 270,000 entries. (There are a number of alternative lists, which I discuss in an appendix at the end of this article.)</p>
<p>Scrabble words range in length from 2 to 15 letters. The upper limit—determined by the size of the game board—is not much of a concern. You’re unlikely to meet a straw-paper text that folds to yield words longer than <em>sesquipedalian</em>. The absence of 1-letter words is more troubling, but the remedy is easy: I simply added the words <em>a</em>, <em>I</em>, and <em>O</em> to my copy of the Scrabble list.</p>
<p>My first computational experiments with foldable words searched for examples at random. Writing a program for random sampling is often easier than taking an exact census of a population, and the sample offers a quick glimpse of typical results. The following Python procedure generates random foldable sequences of letters drawn from a given source text, then returns those sequences that are found in the Scrabble word list. (The parameter <em>k</em> is the length of the words to be generated, and <em>reps</em> specifies the number of random trials.)</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>def randomFoldableWords(text, lexicon, k, reps):
    normtext = normalize(text)
    n = len(normtext)
    findings = []
    for i in range(reps):
        indices = random.sample(range(n), k)
        indices.sort()
        letters = ""
        for idx in indices:
            letters += normtext[idx]
        if letters in lexicon:
            findings.append(letters)
    return findings</code></pre>
<p>Here are the six-letter foldable words found by invoking the program as follows: <code class="language-python">randomFoldableWords(scrabblewords, 6, 10000)</code>. </p>
<blockquote><p>please, plater, searer, saeter, parter, sleety, sleeve, parser, purvey, laster, islets, taster, tester, slarts, paseos, tapers, saeter, eatery, salute, tsetse, setose, salues, sparer</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the word saeter (you could look it up—I had to) appears twice in this list. The frequency of such repetitions can yield an estimate of the total population size. A variant of the <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~yuc2/cr/history.htm">mark-and-recapture</a> method, well-known in wildlife ecology, led me to an estimate of 92 six-letter foldable Scrabble words in the straw-wrapper slogan. The actual number turns out to be 106.</p>
<p>Samples and estimates are helpful, but they leave me wondering, What am I missing? What strange and beautiful word has failed to turn up in any of the samples, like the big fish that never takes the bait? I had to have an exhaustive list.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In many word games, the tool of choice for computer-aided playing (or cheating) is the regular expression, or regex. A regex is a pattern defining a set of strings, or character sequences; from a collection of strings, a regex search will pick out those that match the pattern. For example, the regular expression <code>^.*love.*$</code> selects from the Scrabble word list all words that have the letter sequence <em>love</em> somewhere within them. There are 137 such words, including some that I would not have thought of, such as <em>rollover</em> and <em>slovenly</em>. The regex <code>^.*l.*o.*v.*e.*$</code> finds all words in which <em>l, o, v,</em> and <em>e</em> appear in sequence, whether of not they are adjacent. The set has 267 members, including such secret-lover gems as <em>bloviate</em>, <em>electropositive</em>, and <em>leftovers</em>.</p>
<p>A solution to the foldable words problem could surely be crafted with regular expressions, but I am not a regex wizard. In search of a more muggles-friendly strategy, my first thought was to extend the idea behind the random-sampling procedure. Instead of selecting foldable sequences at random, I’d generate all of them, and check each one against the word list.</p>
<p>The procedure below generates all three-letter strings that can be folded from the given text, and returns the subset of those strings that appear in the Scrabble word list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foldableStrings3(lexicon, text):
    normtext = normalize(text)
    n = len(normtext)
    words = []
    for i in range(0, n-2):
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            for k in range(j+1, n):
                s = normtext[i] + normtext[j] + normtext[k]
                if s in lexicon:
                    words.append(s)
    return(words)</code></pre>
<p>At the heart of the procedure are three nested loops that methodically step through all the foldable combinations: For any initial letter <code>text[i]</code> we can choose any following letter <code>text[j]</code> with<code> j &gt; i</code>; likewise <code>text[j]</code> can be followed by any <code>text[k]</code> with <code>k &gt; j</code>. This scheme works perfectly well, finding 348 instances of three-letter words. I speak of “instances” because some words appear in the list more than once; for example, <em>pee</em> can be formed in three ways. If we count only unique words, there are 137.</p>
<p>Following this model, we could write a separate routine for each word length from 1 to 15 letters, but that looks like a dreary and repetitious task. Nobody wants to write a procedure with loops nested 15 deep. An alternative is to write a meta-procedure, which would generate the appropriate procedure for each word length. I made a start on that exercise in advanced loopology, but before I got very far I realized there’s an easier way. I was wondering: In a text of <em>n</em> letters, how many foldable substrings exist—whether or not they are recognizable words? There are several ways of answering this question, but to me the most illuminating argument comes from an inclusion/​exclusion principle. Consider the first letter of the text, which in our case is the letter <em>I</em>. In the set of all foldable strings, half include this letter and half exclude it. The same is true of the second letter, and the third, and so on. Thus each letter added to the text doubles the number of foldable strings, which means the total number of strings is simply \(2^n\). (Included in this count is the empty string, made up of no letters.)</p>
<p>This observation suggests a simple algorithm for generating all the foldable strings in any <em>n</em>-letter text. Just count from \(0\) to \(2^{n} - 1\), and for each value along the way line up the binary representation of the number with the letters of the text. Then select those letters that correspond to a <code>1</code> bit, like so:</p>
<div style="padding: 1em;">
<pre style="padding: 0.5em;">                    <span style="color: #ccc;">itsa</span><strong>p</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">leasu</span><strong>re</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">to</span><strong>serve</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">you</span>
                    0000100000110011111000</pre>
</div>
<p>And so we see that the word <code>preserve</code> corresponds to the binary representation of the number <code>134392</code>.</p>
<p>Counting is something that computers are good at, so a word-search procedure based on this principle is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foldablesByCounting(lexicon, text):
    normtext = normalize(text)
    n = len(normtext)
    words = []
    for i in range(2**n - 1):
        charSeq = ''
        positions = positionsOf1Bits(i, n)
        for p in positions:
            charSeq += normtext[p]
        if charSeq in lexicon:
            words.append(charSeq)
    return(words)</code></pre>
<p>The outer loop (variable <code>i</code>) counts from \(0\) to \(2^{n} - 1\); for each of these numbers the inner loop (variable <code>p</code>) picks out the letters corresponding to 1 bits. The program produces the output expected. Unfortunately, it does so very slowly. For every character added to the text, running time roughly doubles. I haven’t the patience to plod through the \(2^22\) patterns in “itsapleasuretoserveyou”; estimates based on shorter phrases suggest the running time would be more than three hours.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In the middle of the night I realized my approach to this problem was totally backwards. Instead of blindly generating all possible character strings and filtering out the few genuine words, I could march through the list of Scrabble words and test each of them to see if it’s foldable. At worst I would have to try some 270,000 words. I could speed things up even more by making a preliminary pass through the Scrabble list, discarding all words that include characters not present in the normalized text. For the text “It’s a pleasure to serve you,” the character set has just 12 members: <code>aeiloprstuvy</code>. Allowing only words formed from these letters slashes the Scrabble list down to a length of 12,816.</p>
<p>To make this algorithm work, we need a procedure to report whether or not a word can be formed by folding the given text. The simplest approach is to slide the candidate word along the text, looking for a match for each character in turn:</p>
<div style="padding: 0.5em;">
<pre>                    taste
                    <span style="color: #ccc;">itsapleasuretoserveyou</span>

                     <strong>t</strong>aste
                    <span style="color: #ccc;">i</span><strong>t</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">sapleasuretoserveyou</span>

                     <strong>t a    s</strong>te
                    <span style="color: #ccc;">i</span><strong>t</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">s</span><strong>a</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">plea</span><strong>s</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">uretoserveyou</span>

                     <strong>t a    s   t</strong>e
                    <span style="color: #ccc;">i</span><strong>t</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">s</span><strong>a</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">plea</span><strong>s</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">ure</span><strong>t</strong><span style="color: #ccc;">oserveyou</span>

                     <strong>t a    s   t  e</strong>

</pre>
</div>
<p>If every letter of the word finds a mate in the text, the word is foldable, as in the case of <code>taste</code>, shown above. But an attempt to match <code>tastes</code> would fall off the end of the text looking for a second <code>s</code>, which does not exist.</p>
<p>The following code implements this idea:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def wordIsFoldable(word, text):
    normtext = normalize(text)
    t = 0                      # pointer to positions in normtext
    w = 0                      # pointer to positions in word
    while t &lt; len(normtext):
        if word[w] == normtext[t]:  # matching chars in word and text
            w += 1                  # move to next char in word
        if w == len(word):          # matched all chars in word
            return(True)            # so: thumbs up
        t += 1                 # move to next char in text
    return(False)              # fell off the end: thumbs down</code></pre>
<p>All we need to do now is embed this procedure in a loop that steps through all the candidate Scrabble words, collecting those for which <code>wordIsFoldable</code> returns <code>True</code>. </p>
<p>There’s still some waste motion here, since we are searching letter-by-letter through the same text, and repeating the same searches thousands of times. The source code (available on GitHub as a <a href="https://github.com/bit-player/foldable-words">Jupyter notebook</a>) explains some further speedups. But even the simple version shown here runs in less than two tenths of a second, so there’s not much point in optimizing.</p>
<p>I can now report that there are 778 unique foldable Scrabble words in “It’s a pleasure to serve you” (including the three one-letter words I added to the list). Words that can be formed in multiple ways bring the total count to 899.</p>
<p>And so we come to the tah-dah! moment—the unveiling of the complete list. I have organized the words into groups based on each word’s starting position within the text. (By Python convention, the positions are numbered from 0 through \(n-1\).) Within each group, the words are sorted according to the position of their last character; that position is given in the subscript following the word. For example, <em>tapestry</em> is in Group 1 because it begins at position 1 in the text (the <em>t</em> in <em>It’s</em>), and it carries the subscript 19 because it ends at position 19 (the <em>y</em> in <em>you</em>). </p>
<p>This arrangement of the words is meant to aid in contructing multiword phrases. If a word ends at position \(m\), the next word in the phrase must come from a group numbered \(m+1\) or greater. </p>

<p>Naturally, I’ve tried out the code on a few other well-known phrases. </p>
<p>If Lynn and I had met at a different dining establishment, she might have found a straw with the statement, “It takes two hands to handle a Whopper.” There’s quite a diverse assortment of possible messages lurking in this text, with 1,154 unique foldable words and almost 2,000 word instances. Perhaps she would have chosen the upbeat “Inhale hope.” Or, in a darker mood, “I taste woe.”</p>
<p>If we had been folding dollar bills instead of straw wrappers, “In God We Trust” might have become the forward-looking proclamation, “I go west!” Horace Greeley’s marching order on the same theme, “Go west, young man,” gives us the enigmatic “O, wet yoga!” or, perhaps more aptly, “Gunman.”</p>
<p>Jumping forward from 1967 to 2021—from the Summer of Love to the Winter of COVID—I can turn “Wear a mask. Wash your hands.” into the plaintive, “We ask: Why us?” With “Maintain social distance,” the best I can do is “A nasal dance” or “A sad stance.”</p>
<p>And then there’s “Make America Great Again.” It yields “Meme rage.” Also “Make me ragtag.”</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Appendix: The Word-List Problem.</h4>
<p>In a project like this one, you might think that getting a suitable list of English words would be the easy part. In fact it seems to be the main trouble spot.</p>
<p>The Scrabble lexicon I’ve been relying on derives from a word list known as SOWPODS, compiled by two associations of Scrabble players starting in the 1980s. Current editions of the list are distributed  by a commercial publisher, Collins Dictionaries. If I understand correctly, all versions of the list are subject to copyright (see <a href="https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/38366/latest-collins-scrabble-words-list-in-text-file">discussion on Stack Exchange</a>) and cannot legally be distributed without permission. But no one seems to be much bothered by that fact. Copies of the lists in plain-text format, with one word per line, are easy to find on the internet—and not just on dodgy sites that specialize in pirated material.</p>
<p>There are alternative lists without legal encumbrances. Indeed, there’s a good chance you already have one such list pre-installed on your computer. A file called <code>words</code> is included in most distributions of the Unix operating system, including MacOS; my copy of the file lives in <code>usr/share/dict/words</code>. If you don’t have or can’t find the Unix <code>words</code> file, I suggest downloading the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/">Natural Language Toolkit</a>, a suite of data files and Python programs that includes a lexicon almost identical to Unix words, as well as many other linguistic resources.</p>
<p>The Scrabble list has one big advantage over <code>words</code>: It includes plurals and inflected forms of verbs—not just <em>test</em> but also <em>tests</em>, <em>tested</em>, and <em>testing</em>. [Bad example; see comments below.] The <code>words</code> file is more like a list of dictionary head words, with only the stem form explicitly included. On the other hand, <code>words</code> has an abundance of names and other proper nouns, as well as abbreviations, which are excluded from the Scrabble list since they are not legal plays in the board game.</p>
<p>How about combining the two word lists? Their union has just under 400,000 entries—quite a large lexicon. Using this augmented list for the analysis of “It’s a pleasure to serve you,” my program finds an additional 219 foldable words, beyond the 778 found with the Scrabble list alone. Here they are:</p>
<blockquote><p>aaru aer aerose aes alares alaster alea alerse aleut alo alose alur aly ao apa apar aperu apus aro arry aru ase asor asse ast astor atry aueto aurore aus ausu aute e eastre eer erse esere estre eu ey iao ie ila islay ist isuret itala itea iter ito iyo l laet lao larry larve lastre lasty latro laur leo ler lester lete leto loro lu lue luo lut luteo lutose ly oer ory ovey p parsee parto passo pastose pato pau paut pavo pavy peasy perty peru pess peste pete peto petr plass platery pluto poe poy presee pretry pu purre purry puru r reve ro roer roey roy s sa saa salar salat salay saltee saltery salvy sao sapa saple sapo sare sart saur sauty sauve se seary seave seavy seesee sero sert sesuto sla slare slav slete sloo sluer soe sory soso spary spass spave spleet splet splurt spor spret sprose sput ssu stero steve stre strey stu sueve suto sutu suu t taa taar tal talao talose taluto tapeats tapete taplet tapuyo tarr tarse tartro tarve tasser tasu taur tave tavy teaer teaey teart teasy teaty teave teet teety tereu tess testor toru torve tosy tou treey tsere tst tu tue tur turr turse tute tutory u uro urs uru usee v vu y</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of the proper nouns in this list are present in the vocabulary of most English speakers: <em>Aleut, Peru, Pluto, Slav</em>; the same is true of personal names such as <em>Larry, Leo, Stu, Tess</em>. But the rest of the words are very unlikely to turn up in the smalltalk of teenage sweethearts. Indeed, the list is full of letter sequences I simply don’t recognize as English words. Please define <em>isuret, ovey, spleet,</em> or <em>sput</em>.</p>
<p>There are even bigger word lists out there. In 2006 Google extracted <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html">13.5 million unique English words</a> from public web pages. (The sheer number implies a very liberal definition of <em>English</em> and <em>word</em>.) A good place to start exploring this archive is <a href="https://norvig.com/ngrams/">Peter Norvig’s website</a>, which offers a file with the 333,333 most frequent words from the corpus. The list begins as you might expect: <em>the, of, and, to, a, in, for</em>…; but the weirdness creeps in early. The single letters <em>c, e, s,</em> and <em>x</em> are all listed among the 100 most common “words,” and the rest of the alphabet turns up soon after. By the time we get to the end of the file, it’s mostly typos <em>(mepquest, halloweeb, scholarhips)</em>, run-together words <em>(dietsdontwork, weightlossdrugs)</em>, and hundreds of letter strings that have some phonetic or orthographic resemblance to <em>Google</em> or <em>Yahoo!</em> or both <em>(hoogol, googgl, yahhol, gofool, yogol)</em>. (I suspect that much of this rubbish was scraped not from the visible text of web pages but from metadata stuffed into headers for purposes of search-engine optimization.)</p>
<p>Applying the Google list to the search for foldable words more than doubles the volume of results, but it contributes almost nothing to the stock of words that might form interesting messages. I found 1,543 new words, beyond those that are also present in the union of the Scrabble and Unix lists. In alphabetical order, the additions begin: <em>aae, aao, aaos, aar, aare, aaro, aars, aart, aarts, aase, aass, aast, aasu, aat, aats, aatsr, aau, aaus, aav, aave, aay, aea, aeae….</em> I’m not going to be folding up any straw wrappers with those words for my sweetheart.</p>
<p>What we really need, I begin to think, is not a longer word list but a shorter and more discriminating one.</p></div>

<p>The et al. citation style favors scholars whose last name comes early in the dictionary. For example, other things equal, a last name like Aaron would circulate a lot more than Zuck. This problem is compounded by the existence of highly-cited papers which deviate from alphabetical ordering of authors. They carry the message: order matters, and some of you can’t use this trick, vae victis!</p>



<p>My suggestion is to avoid et al. and instead spell out every name (as in Aaron and Zuck) or every initial (as in AZ). It isn’t perfect, but improvements like randomly permuting the order still aren’t easy to implement. The suggestion actually cannot be implemented in journals like computational complexity which punish the authors into using an idiosyncratic style which has et al. But it doesn’t matter too much; nobody reads papers in those formats anyway, as we discussed <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia/">several times</a>.</p>

<p><strong>From the <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2021/stoc-cfp.html">STOC 2021 call for papers</a></strong>:</p>



<p/>



<p>Authors are asked to avoid “et al.” in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors’ surnames (unless the number of authors is very large, and if it is large, consider just using \cite{} with no “et al.”). When not listing authors’ names, citations should preferably include the first letters of the authors’ surnames (or at least the first three followed by a +, and possibly the year of publication). If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \bibliographystyle{alpha}.</p></div>

    <title>Whence do research collaborations (in TCS) arise?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>About ten days ago, I gave a <a href="http://icetcs.ru.is/slides/intro2icetcs2021.pdf" target="_blank">talk</a> to my colleagues at the <a href="https://en.ru.is/st/dcs/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science at Reykjavik University</a>, introducing my personal (and admittedly very biased) view of the past, present and future of <a href="http://icetcs.ru.is/" target="_blank">ICE-TCS</a>. </p><p>After my presenta­tion, a colleague asked me how she could engage mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists in joint research. I gave her an answer off the top of my head, but it was clear that she was unconvinc­ed and felt that I was avoid­ing answering her question. (For the record, I basically told her that she should knock on our door, discuss with us the problems she was interested in solving and hope that they are of interest to us. I feel that many research collaborations arise from serendipity and that there is no recipe that is guaranteed to work.) </p><p>The thought that she felt that I might have dodged her question prompted me to look back at my own research collabo­rations and how they came about. The rest of this post is the result of that quick-and-dirty reflection. Let me state right away that my list isn't meant to be exhausti­ve and that I won't mention many of the collaborations in which I have been lucky to be involved and that I have played a crucial role in shaping my academic development.  </p><p><b>Reading papers.</b> One of my long-term research collaborations arose from reading a paper written by a colleague. His paper prompted my companion and me to ask ourselves whether we could prove a similar result to the one our colleague had shown in a different setting. We succeeded and sent him our paper. Subsequently, we invited him to visit us in Aalborg. That visit marked the start of a collaboration and friendship that has lasted for over 20 years. <br/><br/><b>Approaching a colleague via email for help in solving a problem.</b> At some point, my companion and I were thinking about a research problem that had frustrated us for a while. I remembered reading a number of papers by a colleague on related topics, so I wrote to him, describing the problem, our attempts at solving it and where we had hit a brick wall. I asked him whether he would be interested in working with us on solving it. He did and that was one of the lucky breaks I have had in my research career. Once more, that collaboration offer via email led to mutual visits, other joint papers and, IMHO even more importantly, a long-term friendship that extended beyond work. <br/> </p><p><b>Available funding and building on one's mistakes.</b> One day in 2009, an email in my mailbox alerted me to the availability of substantial funding for research collabo­ration between universities in country X and those locat­ed in Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. This opportunity was enticing, as I had never visited country X, so I asked myself: "Is there anyone there we might conceivably work with?'' Mulling over that question, I recalled that a colleague from country X had spotted an imprecision in a paper I had coauthored. </p><p>I wrote to him, we applied for that funding jointly and got it. That successful grant application provided the funds for many research visits involving several people in our research groups. Those visits resulted in joint papers, another successful grant application and a number of friendships. </p><p><b>Coffee breaks at conferences.</b> I have at least two exhibits under this heading. The first belongs to a previous geologic­al era (1991). I was attend­ing a conference at CMU and asked a colleague what he was working on. He told me<br/>about a problem he was tackling, which I knew was also on the radar of a fellow researcher and on which I had started working independently. Eventually, after some email exchanges, that chat over coffee turned into a three-way collaboration that, thanks to my coauthors, produced one of my best papers. <br/><br/>Fast forward to 2017 and I'm in Rome to deliver an invited talk at a small conference. During the coffee break follow­ing my presentation, I was approached by a young research­er, with whom I had a number of pleasant conversations during the conference. Some time later, she sent me a draft paper dealing with a topic related to the content of my invited talk. I invited her to visit our research group in Reykjavik and to join the team working on a research project for which we had funding at the time. Those coffee-break conversations led to a collaboration and friendship that I hope will last for a long time. Meeting that colleague has been another of my lucky breaks. <br/> </p><p><b>Reading groups.</b> Last, but by no means least, let me mention that my first research collaboration that did not involve my thesis supervisors arose when I read Gordon Plotkin's famous "<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/publications/Domains_a4.ps">Pisa Notes (On Domain Theory)</a>" with a fellow PhD student. Reading that work led to our first joint paper in 1991 and a companionship that has lasted to this day. I heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfmXpLCiy4&amp;list=PLEyo0HIOhDCSR8os82H_2p5M0dE70K6KL&amp;index=2" target="_blank">Orna Kupferman</a> give the following, tongue-in-cheek advice to young researchers: "Write papers with your twin-sister!" Mine might be: "Write papers with your companion in life!" </p><p>Let me conclude by saying that serendipity and an actual friendship that extends beyond the confines of scientific work were the key aspects in my most pleasant and enduring collaborations. I apologise to the colleagues from whom I have learnt much over the years (former students and postdocs, as well as others) who were the prime movers in research collaborations I did not mention in this post. </p><p> I guess that this note provides much more information than my colleague was intending to receive, but I thought I should put it out for the benefit of the young researchers at Reykjavik University and at the Gran Sasso Science Institute, and of any reader I might have. </p><p>How did your research collaborations arise? If you have anything to add to what I wrote above, and I am sure you do, add your contributions as comments to this post. <br/><br/><br/></p></div>

<h2 class="title mathjax"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01543">New lower bounds for van der Waerden numbers</a> by Ben Green</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We show that there is a red-blue colouring of <em>[N]</em> with no blue 3-term arithmetic progression and no red arithmetic progression of length <img alt="e^{C(\log N)^{3/4}(\log \log N)^{1/4}}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E%7BC%28%5Clog+N%29%5E%7B3%2F4%7D%28%5Clog+%5Clog+N%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="e^{C(\log N)^{3/4}(\log \log N)^{1/4}}."/> Consequently, the two-colour van der Waerden number w(3,k) is bounded below by <img alt="k^{b(k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5E%7Bb%28k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k^{b(k)}"/>, where <img alt="b(k)=c(\frac{\log k}{\log \log k})^{1/3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%28k%29%3Dc%28%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog+k%7D%7B%5Clog+%5Clog+k%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b(k)=c(\frac{\log k}{\log \log k})^{1/3}"/>. Previously it had been speculated, supported by data, that <img alt="w(3,k)=O(k^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%283%2Ck%29%3DO%28k%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(3,k)=O(k^2)"/>.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The left side of the picture shows the world record holders for W(3,k). On the left Ben Green (LB) and in the centre Tomasz Schoen (UB).

<p>The two-colour van der Waerden number <img alt="w(m,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%28m%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(m,k)"/> is the smallest  N such that however [N] = {1, . . . , N} is coloured blue and red, there is either a blue m-term arithmetic progression or a red k-term arithmetic progression. The celebrated theorem of van der Waerden implies that <img alt="w(m, k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%28m%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(m, k)"/> is finite.</p>
<p>The van der Waerden number <img alt="w(m,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%28m%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(m,k)"/> is analogous to the Ramsey number <img alt="R(m,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28m%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="R(m,k)"/>. Finding the behaviors of <img alt="R(m,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28m%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="R(m,k)"/> is an important problem in Ramsey theory and much attention is given to <img alt="R(k,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28k%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="R(k,k)"/> and of <img alt="R(3,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%283%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="R(3,k)"/>. Similarly, understanding the values of <img alt="W(m,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28m%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="W(m,k)"/>, and especially of <img alt="W(k,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28k%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="W(k,k)"/> and <img alt="W(3,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%283%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="W(3,k)"/>  are also  central problems in Ramsey theory. A big difference between van der Waerden number and Ramsey numbers is that there are density theorems for the existence of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-terms arithmetic progressions. (Roth’s theorem for <img alt="k=3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k=3"/> and Szemeredi’s theorem for general <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>.) There are several important methods to derive those density theorems (including Fourier methods, ergodic methods, and Szemeredi-type regularity) and these methods, as far as I know, do not apply for ordinary Ramsey numbers. (But correct me if I am wrong here, and if I am right and you have some insights as to why ergodic methods or Fourier methods do not apply to “ordinary” Ramsey, please share.)</p>
<p>Green’s paper  studies the values of <img alt="w(3,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%283%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(3,k)"/>. The best known upper bound is of Tomasz Schoen, <img alt="w(3, k)&lt;e^{k^{1-c}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%283%2C+k%29%3Ce%5E%7Bk%5E%7B1-c%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(3, k)&lt;e^{k^{1-c}}"/> for some constant <img alt="c &gt; 0." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3E+0.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="c &gt; 0."/> The best known lower bound until the new paper, was by Li and Shu: <img alt="w(3, k) \gg (k/ log k)^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%283%2C+k%29+%5Cgg+%28k%2F+log+k%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(3, k) \gg (k/ log k)^2"/>. (This result, as the earlier bound by Robertson, used a probabilistic argument and relied on Lovasz’s local lemma.)</p>
<p>Several people conjectured, also based on empirical data, that <img alt="w(3,k) = O(k^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%283%2Ck%29+%3D+O%28k%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(3,k) = O(k^2)"/> but now Green proved a super-polynomial lower bound! This is amazing! Congratulations, Ben!</p>
<p>It is largely conjectured that the Behrend-type bounds give the correct quantitative behaviour for Roth’s theorem (and Szemeredi theorem). In rough terms what we see from Green’s example is that this might be true also for van der Waerden numbers.</p>
<p>The proof is rather involved and long, so, naturally, there is  little I can say about it, which only slightly exceeds the little I actually know about it. The overview and other fragments of the paper I looked at are very illuminating. Here are a few things that caught my eyes.</p>
<p>1) A word about Tomasz Schoen’s upper bound and important paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02877">A subexponential upper bound for van der Waerden numbers W(3,k).</a>  Among other things Schoen’s proof relies on a lemma developed by Schoen for improved Roth bound. This relies on a structure theory of Bateman and Katz.  The paper gives a nice description of the state of the art regarding the diagonal values <img alt="w(k,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%28k%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(k,k)"/>. (Schoen’s upper bound on <img alt="w(3,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%283%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(3,k)"/> follows also from the <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/07/08/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-7-bloom-and-sisask-just-broke-the-logarithm-barrier-for-roths-theorem/">more recent bound for Roth’s theorem</a> by Bloom and Sisask.)</p>
<p>2) Among the people that speculated that <img alt="w(3,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%283%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(3,k)"/> behaves like <img alt="k^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k^2"/> is Ben Green himself. This is recorded in reference [9] of the paper. However, Green’s first reaction to this possibility was that it must be false. But he realized that some ideas for showing that it is false are themselves false.</p>
<p>3) Reference [9] in the paper is: <strong>B. J. Green, 100 open problems, manuscript, available on request</strong>. If you are curious about the list, request it!</p>
<p>4) New lower bounds in Ramsey theory are nor frequent. Thirteen years ago I described <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/07/10/pushing-behrend-around/">Elkin’s improvement</a> to Behrend’s bound and a few days ago I mentioned <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/02/03/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-19-nati-linial-and-adi-shraibman-construct-larger-corner-free-sets-from-better-numbers-on-the-forehead-protocols/">Linial and Shraibman’s new lower bounds</a> for the corner problem.  Green’s study started by looking at complements of 3-AP free sets. An example by Green and Julia Wolf (that followed Elkin’s result) turned out to be important for reaching some parts of Green’s strategy.</p>
<p>5) In some sense, something about the <img alt="k^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k^2"/> prediction is not entirely lost. The construction gives a sort of a multi-scale behaviour where in the <img alt="r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="r"/>th scale the example’s cardinality is <img alt="k^r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5Er&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k^r"/>.  (So all the empirical data comes from the <img alt="r=2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="r=2"/> regime.) Ben Green boldly suggests that the true values of <img alt="w(3,k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%283%2Ck%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(3,k)"/> might exhibit such multi-scale behaviour. He conjectures that the true value of <img alt="w(3, k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%283%2C+k%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(3, k)"/> is quasi-polynomial, namely it lies somewhere in between the bound given by his construction and  something like <img alt="k^{c\log k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5E%7Bc%5Clog+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k^{c\log k}"/> (which is Behrend-bound behaviour on the nose) .</p>
<p>6) Until Ben’s list of 100 problems becomes available to you, you may find interest in Francis Su’s <a href="https://www.francissu.com/post/100-questions-about-mathematics">100 questions about mathematics for discussion and reflection</a>.</p>
<p>7) In connection with Linial and Shraibman’s new lower bounds for the corner problem, let me mention that the best upper bound is by I.D. Shkredov. The paper is:  On a two-dimensional analog of Szemeredi’s Theorem in Abelian groups, Izvestiya of Russian Academy of Sciences, 73 (2009), 455–505.</p></div>

    <title>The Victoria Delfino Problems: an example of math problems named after a non-mathematician</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> If you Google <b>Victoria Delfino </b>you will find that she is a real estate agent in LA (well, one of the Victoria Delfino's you find is such).  After this blog is posted you may well get this post on the first Google page. </p><p>If you Google <b>Victoria Delfino Problems</b> you will find a paper:</p><p><a href="https://andrescaicedo.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/vdp-finalversion-withreferences.pdf">The fourteen Victoria Delfino Problems and their Status in the year 2015</a></p><p>(ADDED LATER: a comment pointed me to an updated version, so  you can see that- I got to a pay wall.) </p><p>How did a real estate agent get honored by having 14 problems in descriptive set theory named after her?</p><p>Possibilities before I tell you which one.</p><p>1) Real estate is her day job. Her hobby is Descriptive Set Theory. Recall that Fermat was a lawyer (or something like that- see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat">his Wikipedia page</a>) so perhaps she is similar. Doubtful- I think math is too hard for that now.  Or at least descriptive  set theory is too hard for that now. </p><p>2) She just happened to remark one day,<i> Gee, I wonder if</i></p><p><i> ZFC + SEP(Sigma_3^1) + #   implies DET(Delta_2^1).</i> </p><p>Its just the kind of thing someone might just say. That was problem 4 of the 14. </p><p>3) There are two Victoria Delfino's- one is a realtor, one is a mathematician. While plausible, that would not be worth blogging about. </p><p>4) And now the truth: Victoria was the realtor who helped Moschovakis (a descriptive set theorist who I will henceforth describe as M) buy his house. When Tony Martin (another Desc. Set Theorist) moved to UCLA, M referred him to Victoria and she did indeed help Tony find a house. Victoria gave M a large commission which he tried to turn down. She did not want it returned, so M used the money to fund five problems. Later problems were added, but for no money. The article <i>The Fourteen... </i>linked to above has the full story. It also has the curious line: </p><p><i>Contrary to popular belief, no monetary prize is attached to further problems. </i></p><p>I didn't think any of this was so well known as to have popular believes. </p><p>ANYWAY, this is an example of a math problem named after a non-math person. Are there others? Will the name stick? Probably not- already 12 of the 14 are solved. I have noted in a prior blog (<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/08/how-much-credit-should-conjecturer-get_14.html">here</a>) once a conjecture gets proven, the one who made the conjecture gets forgotten. Or in this case the person who the conjectures is named after. </p><p>So are there other open problems in math named after non-math people? How about Theorems?</p><p>Near Misses: </p><p>Pythagoras: Not clear what he had to do with the theorem that bears his name. </p><p>L'hopital's Rule: the story could be a blog in itself, and in fact it is! Not mind, but someone else: <a href="https://andrescaicedo.wordpress.com/2013/11/05/credit/">here</a>. However L'hopital was a mathematician. </p><p>Sheldon's conjecture (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/10/the-sheldon-conjecture-too-late-for.html">here</a>) was named after a FICTIONAL physicist. Note that Sheldon inspired the conjecture but did not make it. It has been solved. </p><p>The Governor's  Theorem (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2013/08/how-much-trig-does-your-governor-know.html">here</a>) was named because Jeb Bush was asked for the angles of a 3-4-5 right triangle (not a fair question). </p><p>The Monty Hall Paradox.</p><p>SO- are there Open Problems, Theorems, Lemmas, any math concepts, named after non-math people? I really mean non-STEM people. If a Physicist or an Engineer or a Chemist or Biologist or...  has their name on something, that would not really be what I want.</p><p>(ADDED LATER - someone emailed me two oddly-named math things:</p><p>Belphegor's prime, <span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">see </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belphegor%27s_prime">here</a></p><p>Morrie's law- odd since Morrie is the FIRST name of who the name is honoring, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrie%27s_law">here</a> </p><p>)</p><p><br/></p><p>Are there any other open problems in descriptive set theory  named after realtors?</p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The first month of 2021 has brought with it 5 papers, covering graph testing, Boolean function testing, and distribution testing — as well as database theory. Let’s dive into it.</p>



<p><strong>Random walks and forbidden minors III: \(\mathrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)\)-time partition oracles for minor-free graph classes</strong>, by Akash Kumar, C. Seshadhri, and Andrew Stolman (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00556">arXiv</a>). Minor-closed bounded-degree graphs have a very nice property: denoting by \(d\) the degree bound and \(n\) the number of edges, it is always possible to partition any such graph into components of <em>constant</em> size, \(O_\varepsilon(1)\), just by removing a linear number of edges, merely \(\varepsilon dn\) (\(\varepsilon\) being a small parameter). This is a crucial result in many graph property testing algorithms, those which rely on something called a “partition oracle”: loosely speaking, a routine which makes “few” queries to the graph, and is able to indicate which component of an underlying partition any given vertex belongs to. But what is “few” here? The first partition oracles made \(d^{\mathrm{poly}(d,1/\varepsilon)}\) queries to the graph to answer any such request. This later got significantly improved to \(d^{\mathrm{log}(d/\varepsilon)}\). Using spectral graph theory techniques previously developed by the authors (hence the “III” in the title), this work settles the question, achieving partition oracles which as good as it gets: making only \(\mathrm{poly}(d,1/\varepsilon)\) queries to the graph! This in turns has immediate consequences for graph property testing, which the paper details.</p>



<p>And since we are on the topic of oracles… more exciting news on that front:</p>



<p><strong>Spectral Clustering Oracles in Sublinear Time</strong>, by Grzegorz Gluch, Michael Kapralov, Silvio Lattanzi, Aida Mousavifar, Christian Sohler (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05549">arXiv</a>). Given a graph \(G\) and an integer \(k\), one often want to partition the graph into components \(C_1,C_2,\dots,C_k\), such that each \(C_i\) is well-connected and has few edges to the other \(C_j\)’s. But can we get <em>ultra</em> efficient algorithms for such spectral clusterings? Specifically, can we design oracles for them: sublinear-time algorithms which provide implicit access to an underlying “good” spectral clustering \(\hat{C}_1,\hat{C}_2,\dots,\hat{C}_k\), by returning on any query vertex \(v\) the index of the cluster \(\hat{C}_i\) to which \(v\) belongs? This paper introduces the question, and answers it in the affirmative: in more detail, it provides a spectral clustering oracle which, for any \(\varepsilon&gt;0\), has preprocessing time \(2^{\mathrm{poly}(k/\varepsilon)}n^{1/2+O(\varepsilon)}\), query time \(n^{1/2+O(\varepsilon)}\), and space \(n^{1/2+O(\varepsilon)}\); and provides access to a clustering with relative error \(O(\varepsilon\log k)\) per cluster. The paper also allows tradeoffs between query time and space, and discusses applications to the Local Computation Algorithms (LCA) model.</p>



<p>Next stop, distribution testing…</p>



<p><strong>The Sample Complexity of Robust Covariance Testing</strong>, by Ilias Diakonikolas and Daniel M. Kane (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15802">arXiv</a>). Suppose you have i.i.d. samples from some high-dimensional Gaussian \(\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\) in \(d\) dimensions, and want to test whether the unknown covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) is the identity, versus \(\varepsilon\)-far from it (in Frobenius norm). Good news: we know how to do that, and \(\Theta(d/\varepsilon^2)\) samples are necessary and sufficient. (To <em>learn</em> \(\Sigma\), that’d be \(\Theta(d^2/\varepsilon^2)\).) Bad news: you don’t have i.i.d. samples from some high-dimensional Gaussian \(\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\); what you have is i.i.d. samples from a noisy version of it, \((1-\alpha)\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma) + \alpha B\), where \(B\) is an arbitrary “bad” distribution (not necessarily Gaussian itself). You still want to test whether the covariance \(\Sigma\) is the identity, but now you have that extra \(\alpha\) fraction of noisy samples, and you need to do that testing robustly… The good news is, you can still do that by learning the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\), robustly, with \(O(d^2/\varepsilon^2)\) samples. The bad news is the main result of this paper: that’s also the best you can do. That is, \(\Omega(d^2)\) samples are necessary: if you have to be robust to noise, testing is no longer easier than learning….</p>



<p>Onto Boolean functions!</p>



<p><strong>Junta Distance Approximation with Sub-Exponential Queries</strong>, by Vishnu Iyer, Avishay Tal, and Michael Whitmeyer (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/004/">ECCC</a>). If you follow this blog, you may have seen over the past couple years a flurry of results about <em>tolerant junta testing</em>: “given query access to some Boolean function \(f\colon\{-1,1\}^n\to\{-1,1\}\), how close is \(f\) to only depending on \(k \ll n\) of its variables?”<br/>This paper contains several results on this problem, including an improved bicriteria tolerant testing algorithm: an efficient algorithm to distinguish between \(\varepsilon\)-close to \(k\)-junta and \(1.1\varepsilon\)-far from \(k’\)-junta making \(\mathrm{poly}(k,1/\varepsilon)\) queries (and \(k’ = O(k/\varepsilon^2)\)). But the main result of the paper, and the one giving it its name, is for the non-relaxed version where \(k’=k\): while all previous works had a query complexity \(2^{O(k)}\), here the authors show how to break that exponential barrier, giving a fully tolerant testing algorithm with query complexity \(2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k})}\)!</p>



<p>And finally, a foray into database theory:</p>



<p><strong>Towards Approximate Query Enumeration with Sublinear Preprocessing Time</strong>, by  Isolde Adler and Polly Fahey (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06240">arXiv</a>). In this paper, the authors are concerned with the task of (approximate) query enumeration on databases, aiming for ultra efficient (i.e., sublinear-time) algorithms. Leveraging techniques from property testing (specifically, in the bounded-degree graph model), they show the following:<br/><em>On input databases of bounded degree and bounded tree-width, every (fixed) first-order definable query can be enumerated approximately in time linear in the output size, after only a sublinear-time preprocessing phase</em>.</p>



<p>That’s all for this month! If you noticed a paper we missed, please let us know in the comments.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Welcome to the Spring 2021 edition of Foundations of Data Science Virtual Talks. </p>



<p>Our first talk for the season will take place on <strong>Thursday, Feb 18</strong>th at <strong>11:00 AM Pacific Time</strong> (14:00 Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC).  <strong>Costis Daskalakis</strong> from <strong>MIT</strong> will speak about “<strong>Equilibrium Computation and the Foundations of Deep Learning</strong>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Deep Learning has recently yielded important advances in single-agent learning challenges, much of that progress being fueled by the empirical success of gradient descent and its variants in computing local optima of non-convex optimization problems. In multi-agent learning applications, the role of single-objective optimization is played by equilibrium computation, yet our understanding of its complexity in settings that are relevant for Deep Learning remains sparse. In this talk we focus on min-max optimization of nonconvex-nonconcave objectives, which has found applications in GANs, and other adversarial learning problems. Here, not only are there no known gradient-descent based methods converging to even local and approximate min-max equilibria, but the computational complexity of identifying them remains poorly understood. We show that finding approximate local min-max equilibria of Lipschitz and smooth objectives requires a number of queries to the function and its gradient that is exponential in the relevant parameters, in sharp contrast to the polynomial number of queries required to find approximate local minima of non convex objectives. Our oracle lower bound is a byproduct of a complexity-theoretic result showing that finding approximate local min-max equilibria is computationally equivalent to finding Brouwer fixed points, and Nash equilibria in non zero-sum games, and thus PPAD-complete.</p>



<p>Minimal complexity theory knowledge will be assumed in the talk. Joint work with Stratis Skoulakis and Manolis Zampetakis.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In an ideal world, university administrators would support the work of the top-class academics employed by their institution, especially if they attract students, have a high research standing within their communities and bring in substantial funding from competitive research funds. After all, to quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidor_Isaac_Rabi" target="_blank">Isidor Isaac Rabi</a>, "<a href="https://academicanchor.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/dwight-eisenhower-and-university-faculty/" target="_blank">the faculty are the university</a>" and the most valuable currency for an academic institution is reputation. </p><p>Unfortunately, university administrations the world over repeatedly surprise me by making structural changes that affect some of their very best academics and actually <i>reduce</i> the reputation of their institutions in the eyes of the community at large. </p><p>The latest example comes from the University of Leicester, where, as stated <a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/foco-is-not-redundant" target="_blank">here</a>, </p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">[the] University VC proposes to merge Informatics and Mathematics into a  combined school focussed exclusively on AI, data science, computational  modelling and "digitalisation". This includes the proposal to cease  research in Foundations of Computer Science (FoCo) where research is  "highly theoretical and not directly linked with applications",  retaining staff only if the research they have published in the past (!)  aligns well with the new desired focus on foundations of AI,  computational modelling, data science and digitalisation. Staff have  been given no opportunity to alter their research to fit with the  proposed new direction. The plan is <u>to make redundant (in the middle of a pandemic) all (up to 10) staff in foundations of computer science</u> whose past research is deemed not to be a good enough fit with the new strategic priorities. </p><p>See also <a href="https://www.uculeicester.org.uk/ucu/first-statement-on-threatened-compulsory-redundancies/" target="_blank">this statement</a> by the University and College Union of the University of Leicester. </p><p>I might be biased, but I find it inconceivable that one can think of building a world-class research programme in AI, data science and computational modelling without building on existing strengths in the Foundations of Computer Science and Mathematics. What my crystal ball tells me is that the strong Leicester academics who might be affected by the planned restructuring will find positions elsewhere and that the University of Leicester is shooting itself in the foot. Which high-profile academic would be enticed to join a university that has shown so little consideration for its existing areas of strength and where one's job might be in danger when the buzzwords du jour change, as they undoubtedly will? </p><p>I encourage you to sign the <a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/foco-is-not-redundant" target="_blank">petition</a> in support of our Leicester colleagues.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We present the first non-trivial pseudorandom generator (PRG) for linear threshold (LTF) circuits of arbitrary constant depth and super-linear size. This PRG fools circuits with depth <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/> and <img alt="n^{1 + \delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1+%2B+%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n^{1 + \delta}"/> wires, where <img alt="\delta = \exp(-O(d))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%3D+%5Cexp%28-O%28d%29%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\delta = \exp(-O(d))"/>, using seed length <img alt="O(n^{1 - \delta})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B1+-+%5Cdelta%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="O(n^{1 - \delta})"/> and with error <img alt="\exp(-n^{\delta})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28-n%5E%7B%5Cdelta%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\exp(-n^{\delta})"/>. This tightly matches the best known lower bounds for this circuit class. As a consequence of our result, all the known hardness for LTF circuits has now effectively been translated into pseudorandomness. This brings the extensive effort in the last decade to construct PRGs and deterministic circuit-analysis algorithms for this class to the point where any subsequent improvement would yield breakthrough lower bounds.</p>
<p>A key ingredient in our construction is a pseudorandom restriction procedure that has tiny failure probability, but simplifies the function to a non-natural “hybrid computational model” that combines decision trees and LTFs. As part of our proof we also construct an “extremely low-error” PRG for the class of functions computable by an arbitrary function of s linear threshold functions that can handle even the extreme setting of parameters <img alt="s = n/\mathrm{polylog}(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+n%2F%5Cmathrm%7Bpolylog%7D%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="s = n/\mathrm{polylog}(n)"/> and <img alt="\epsilon = \exp(-n/\mathrm{polylog}(n))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon+%3D+%5Cexp%28-n%2F%5Cmathrm%7Bpolylog%7D%28n%29%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\epsilon = \exp(-n/\mathrm{polylog}(n))"/>.</p>

<em>The power of definitions and notations</em><br/>
<font color="#000000"/></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2021/02/04/graph-products/ikronec001p1/" rel="attachment wp-att-18075"><img alt="" class="alignright  wp-image-18075" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kro.jpg?w=120" width="120"/></a></p>
<p>
Leopold Kronecker was one of the great mathematicians of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kronecker">19th century</a>. He thought about foundational issues deeply. We highlighted him <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/high-school-trig-is-powerful/">before</a>—well not deeply.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we would talk about some core math ideas arising out of Kronecker’s work.</p>
<p>
Kronecker’s angle as an early leader in the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics">foundations</a> of mathematics was on which aspects are helpful in concrete analysis. He no doubt would be comfortable with complexity theory, with our interest in not just existence proofs, but in concrete algorithms for the construction of objects. He famously said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>God made the integers, all else is the work of man.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
His was a philosophy that would agree with our view of complexity theory. Maybe he would say now:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>God made the binary strings, all else is the work of people.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Operations </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In any part of mathematics we are often interested in operations that take objects and make new objects. These operations are important as they allow us to build new interesting objects. </p>
<ul>
<li>
In strings we can take two and concatenate them to make a new one. <p/>
</li><li>
In matrices we can add or multiply them. <p/>
</li><li>
More relevant to today’s topic we can take two matrices and make the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product">Kronecker </a> product: <p/>
<p align="center"> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2021/02/04/graph-products/prod/" rel="attachment wp-att-18079"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18079" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/prod.png?w=600"/></a> </p>
</li><li>
In graph theory we can take two graphs <img alt="{G_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G_1}"/> and <img alt="{G_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G_2}"/> and make a new one <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{H}"/>.
</li></ul>
<p>
There are a wealth of such operations on graphs. One is called Cartesian product, one the strong product, one the direct product. A trouble, in my opinion, is that the names and the notation for these operations is not uniform. There are alternative names for almost all the major operations: For example,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The Cartesian product of graphs is sometimes called the box product of graphs—see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product_of_graphs">here</a>. The notation that <img alt="{G \times H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Ctimes+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G \times H}"/> has often been used for Cartesian products of graphs, but is now more commonly used for another construction known as the tensor product of graphs. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Confusing, no? </p>
<p>
Ken notes that it gets even more confusing when one teaches the Cartesian product construction of finite automata. Each automaton has a state graph. In general the state graph is directed and the edges are labeled by characters, but one can make cases where the graph is undirected and there is only one character. The state graph of the product machine is in general <em>not</em> the Cartesian product of the graphs of the individual machines. What product is it? Let’s look at graph operations.</p>
<p>

<p>
The answer to Ken’s question is that you get the tensor product, which is Kronecker’s product on the adjacency matrices of the graphs. This is because each step of the product requires an action by each constituent machine.</p>
<p>
Of course then we get other types of products for other values of <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{d}"/>. Are any of these interesting? We get intermediate notions up to Kronecker’s product. Can the be put to any natural use?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Coloring Products—Conjecture </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
An application of graph products is that they yield some quite compelling conjectures. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedetniemi%27s_conjecture">conjecture</a> due to Stephen Hedetniemi in 1966 is one example. This states that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \chi (G \times H) = min( \chi (G), \chi (H)). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cchi+%28G+%5Ctimes+H%29+%3D+min%28+%5Cchi+%28G%29%2C+%5Cchi+%28H%29%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  \chi (G \times H) = min( \chi (G), \chi (H)). "/></p>
<p>Here <img alt="{\chi(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\chi(G)}"/> is the number of colors needed to color <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>. The conjecture is false–see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02167">Counterexamples to Hedetniemi’s conjecture</a> by Yaroslav Shitov. Also see Gil Kalai’s <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/05/10/sansation-in-the-morning-news-yaroslav-shitov-counterexamples-to-hedetniemis-conjecture/">post</a> about this news.</p>

A potential application of graph products is to the famous Four Color Theorem (4CT)—see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">here</a>. In a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.368.4392&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a> of mine with Atish Das Sarma, Amita Gajewar, and Danupon Nanongkai we show:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1 (An Approximate Restatement of the Four-Color Theorem)</b> <em> Suppose every two-edge connected, cubic, planar graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> can be edge 3-colored with <img alt="{o(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{o(n)}"/> errors. Then the Four Color Theorem is true. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The proof is simple. We assume that some graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> is a counterexample to the 4CT. Then form a kind of product <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{H}"/> of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>. To be honest we did not see the proof exactly as this, but is essentially what we did. The <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{H}"/> is a huge product of many of the copies of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>, with some small modifications. Then we show if we could almost four color <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{H}"/> then we would be able to exactly color <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>. </p>

<p/><p>
Meanwhile, the paper showing that Hedetniemi’s conjecture is false contains an important lesson for mathematicians, Noga Alon says, </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Sometimes, the reason that a conjecture is very hard to prove is simply that it is false.</i> </em>

    <title>A Blood Donation Puzzle</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the US you can donate whole blood every eight weeks. Suppose Elvira does exactly that. Will she hit every date of the year? For example, if Elvira gave blood today, will she in some future year give blood on the 4th of July? Can we figure it out without having to rely on a computer simulation or even a calculator?</p><p>Let's make the assumptions that the blood center is open every day and that Elvira gives blood exactly every 56 days for eternity. </p><p>A year has 365 days which is relatively prime to 56=2<sup>3</sup>*7 since 365 mod 2 =1 and 365 mod 7 = 1. By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a> her next 365 blood donations will be on 365 distinct dates. If Elvira started giving blood at age 17, she will have hit every date at age 73.</p><p>That was easy but wrong. We have to account for those pesky leap years.</p><p>In a four year span, there will be one leap day. The total days in four years (using modular arithmetic) will still be odd and 5 mod 7, so still relatively prime to 56. So Elvira will donate on every day on the calendar exactly four times, except February 29th which she will hit once, over a period 56*4=224 years. </p><p>Alas not quite. Years ending 00 are not leap years, unless the year is divisible by 400. 2000 was a leap year but 2100 won't be. Any stretch of 224 years will hit at least one of those 00 non-leap years.</p><p>In 400 years, there will be 97 leap years. Since a regular year is 1 mod 7 days and a leap year is 2 mod 7 days, 400 years will be 497 mod 7 days. Since 497=71*7, 400 years has a multiple of 7 days. Every 400 years we have exactly the same calendar. February 3, 2421 is also a Wednesday.</p><p>The cycle of blood donations will repeat every 3200 years, the number of years in the least common multiple of 56 and the odd multiple of seven number of days in 400 years. But we can no longer directly apply the Chinese remainder theorem and argue that every day of the year will be hit. In those 3200 years Elvira will have over 20,000 blood donations. If the dates were chosen randomly the expected number to hit all dates would be 2372 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem">coupon collector</a>. So one would expect Elvira would hit every day, but that's not a proof.</p><p>So I had to dust off my Python skills and do the computer simulation after all. No matter what day Elvira starts donating she will eventually hit every date of the year. If Elvira starts donating today, she would give blood on the 4th of July for the first time in 2035 and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10aTFv5UUWfsrkKmVeud_r2VObfS1_J1tJflMeWld2w4/edit?usp=sharing">hit all dates</a> on January 8, 2087 after 431 donations. The longest sequence is 3235 donations starting April 25, 2140 and hitting all dates on February 29, 2636.</p></div>

It is known that such a set has a vanishingly small density, but how large this density can be remains unknown. The best previous construction was based on Behrend’s large subset of <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-4-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-36"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-37"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-38">[</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-39">N</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-40">]</span></span></span></span></em> with no <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-5-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-41"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-42"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-43">3</span></span></span></span>-term arithmetic progression.

This is the first problem considered in the multiplayer Number On the Forehead (NOF) model. Despite the basic nature of this problem, no progress has been made on it throughout the years. Only recently have explicit protocols been found for the first time, yet no improvement in complexity has been achieved to date. The present paper offers the first improved protocol for the exactly-<em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-11-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-69"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-70"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-71">N</span></span></span></span></em> problem. This is also the first significant example where algorithmic ideas in communication complexity bear fruit in additive combinatorics.</span></p>
<p>This is remarkable for various reasons. On the additive combinatorics side, improved constructions are rare. For example, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/07/10/pushing-behrend-around/">we reported</a> here in 2008 Elkin’s (small) improvements of Behrend’s bound. For the corner-free problem the paper of Nati and Adi goes beyond the Behrend’s (and Elkin’s) constructions. On the communication complexity side this is significant progress on a classical 1983 problem of Chandra, Furst and Lipton. The connection that goes from improved result on communication complexity to additive combinatorics is exciting — certainly a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/natifest-is-coming/">new frontier for Nati and Adi</a>. On the blogging side, I cannot compete with the beautifully written introduction. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00421">Click here to read the paper</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Remark 1:</strong> The number of the forehead problem is  related to Levine’s hat problem that we discussed in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/12/open-problem-session-of-huji-combsem-problem-3-ehud-friedgut-independent-sets-and-lionel-levins-infamous-hat-problem/">this post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Remark 2: </strong>Ryan Alweiss just told me about Ben Green’s new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01543">New lower bounds for van der Waerden numbers.</a> It gives a construction of a red blue colouring of {1,2,…,N} with no 3 term blue or a k-term red arithmetic progression, where N is super-polynomial! Stay tune for a fuller report.</p></div>

    <title>FORC 2021 Call for Papers</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> Reminder to anyone who has forgotten about FORC 2021 --- its a very nice venue --- and also a nice place to highlight recent work that is published or submitted elsewhere, via the non-archival track.</p><p><br/></p><p><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Symposium on Foundations of Responsible Computing (FORC) 2021 Call for Papers - Deadline February 15, 2021 AOE (anywhere on Earth)</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">The second annual Symposium on Foundations of Responsible Computing (FORC) is planned to be held on June 9-11, 2021, *online*. FORC is a forum for mathematically rigorous research in computation and society writ large.  The Symposium aims to catalyze the formation of a community supportive of the application of theoretical computer science, statistics, economics, and other relevant analytical fields to problems of pressing and anticipated societal concern.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Topics that fall in scope include, but are not restricted to, formal approaches to privacy, including differential privacy; theoretical approaches to fairness in machine learning, including the investigation of definitions, algorithms and lower bounds, tradeoffs, and economic incentives; computational and mathematical social choice (including apportionment and redistricting); theoretical foundations of sustainability; mechanism design for social good; mathematical approaches to bridging computer science, law and ethics; and theory related to modeling and mitigating the spread of epidemics. The Program Committee also warmly welcomes mathematically rigorous work on societal problems that have not traditionally received attention in the theoretical computer science literature. Whatever the topic, submitted papers should communicate their contributions towards responsible computing, broadly construed.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">The symposium itself will feature a mixture of talks by authors of accepted papers and invited talks. At least one author of each accepted paper should be present at the symposium to present the work (with an option for virtual attendance, as needed).</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Dual Submission Policy. Authors must indicate at the time of submission whether they are submitting to the archival-option track or the non-archival track.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">* For submissions to the non-archival track, it is permitted to submit papers that have appeared in a peer-reviewed conference or journal since the last FORC. It is also permitted to simultaneously or subsequently submit substantially similar work to another conference or to a journal. Accepted papers in the non-archival track will receive talks at the symposium and will appear as one-page abstracts on the symposium website. They will not appear in the proceedings.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">* For submissions to the archival-option track, papers that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted. Also, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that are already published in a journal at the time of submission may not be submitted to the archival-option track. Accepted papers in the archival-option track will receive talks at the symposium. Authors of papers accepted to the archival-option track will be given the option to choose whether to convert to a one-page abstract (which will not appear in the proceedings) or publish a 10-page version of their paper in the proceedings. The proceedings of FORC 2021 will be published by LIPIcs.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Authors are also responsible for ensuring that submitting to FORC would not be in violation of other journals’ or conferences’ submission policies.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">PC members and reviewers will be aware during the review process of whether papers have been submitted as archival-option or non-archival. The PC reserves the right to hold non-archival papers to a different standard than archival-option papers.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Submission Instructions.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">* Authors should upload a PDF of the paper here: </span><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=forc2021" style="background-color: white; color: #1155cc; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=forc2021</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">* A footnote on the title of the paper should indicate whether the paper is a submission to the archival-option track or the non-archival track. Submissions to the non-archival track should also indicate in this footnote any archival venues (conferences or journals) at which the paper has appeared, a link to the publication, and the date on which it was published.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">* The font size should be at least 11 point and the format should be single-column.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">* Author names and affiliations should appear at the top of the paper (reviewing for FORC is single, not double blind).</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"/><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">* Beyond these, there are no formatting or length requirements, but reviewers will only be asked to read the first 10 pages of the submission. It is the authors’ responsibility that the main results of the paper and their significance be clearly stated within the first 10 pages. For both the archival-option track and the non-archival track, submissions should include proofs of all central claims, and the committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly and in the simplest possible way what the paper is accomplishing.</span><br style="background-color: white;

    <summary>One-way functions (OWFs) are central objects of study in cryptography and computational complexity theory. In a seminal work, Liu and Pass (FOCS 2020) proved that the average-case hardness of computing time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity is equivalent to the existence of OWFs. It remained an open problem to establish such an equivalence for the average-case hardness of some NP-complete problem. In this paper, we make progress on this question by studying a polynomially-sparse variant of Partial Minimum Circuit Size Problem (Partial MCSP), which we call Sparse Partial MCSP, as follows.

1. First, we prove that if Sparse Partial MCSP is zero-error average-case hard on a polynomial fraction of its instances, then there exist OWFs.
2. Then, we observe that Sparse Partial MCSP is NP-complete under polynomial-time deterministic reductions. That is, there are NP-complete problems whose average-case hardness implies the existence of OWFs.
3. Finally, we prove that the existence of OWFs implies the nontrivial zero-error average-case hardness of Sparse Partial MCSP.

Thus the existence of OWFs is inextricably linked to the average-case hardness of this NP-complete problem.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Least-squares is a workhorse of optimization, machine learning, statistics, signal processing, and many other scientific fields. I find it particularly appealing (too much, according to some of my students and colleagues…), because all algorithms, such as stochastic gradient [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/7fe1f8abaad094e0b5cb1b01d712f708-Paper.pdf">1</a>], and analyses, such as for kernel ridge regression [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-006-0196-8">2</a>], are much simpler and rely on reasonably simple linear algebra.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Despite the unique appeal of least-squares, most interesting optimization or machine problems go beyond quadratic functions. While there are many algorithms and analyses dedicated to more general situations, it is tempting to use least-squares for analysis or algorithms by considering the functions at hand to be approximately quadratic.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Using bounds on the third-order derivatives and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor expansions</a> are the usual ways to go, but they are not ideal for sharp non-asymptotic results where the deviation from quadratic functions has to be precisely quantified. In many situations, more finer structures can be used. In a series of posts, I will describe <em>self-concordance</em> properties, that relate the third order derivatives to second order ones.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are many great books that cover this topic where the material below is taken from [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611970791">3</a>, <a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/LecIPM.pdf">4</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-91578-4.pdf">5</a>, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf">6</a>].</p>



<h2>Self-concordance</h2>



<p class="justify-text">A function \(f: C \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) is said self-concordant on the open interval \(C\) if and only if it is convex, three-times differentiable on \(C\), and $$\tag{1}\forall x \in C, \  |f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)| \leqslant 2 f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{3/2}.$$ You may wonder why the power \(3/2\) or why the constant \(2\). The constant is just a convention (multiplying the function \(f\) by \(c\) would replace \(2\) by \(2/\sqrt{c}\)), while the power \(3/2\) is fundamental, as it makes the definition “affine-invariant”, that is, if \(f\) is self-concordant, so is \(y \mapsto f(ay)\) for any \(a \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For a convex function defined on a convex subset \(C\) of \(\mathbb{R}\), this has to be true along all rays, or equivalently, if \(f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)[h,h,h]= \sum_{i,j,k=1}^d h_i h_j h_k \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j \partial x_k}(x)\) is the symmetric third-order tensor and \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)[h,h] = \sum_{i,j=1}^d h_i h_j  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(x)\) the second-order one, then $$\tag{2} \forall x \in C, \ \forall h \in \mathbb{R}^d , \ |f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)[h,h,h]| \leqslant 2 f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{3/2}[h,h].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Examples. </strong>One can check that if \(f\) and \(g\) are self-concordant, then so is \(f+g\) (but not their average). Moreover, if \(f\) is self-concordant, so is \(y\mapsto f(Ay)\) for any matrix \(A\). The property is also preserved by Fenchel conjugation. Classical examples are all linear and quadratic functions, the negative logarithm, the negative log-determinant, or the negative logarithm of quadratic functions. The three previous examples are particularly important because they are “barrier functions”, with non-full domains, and are instrumental to interior-point methods (see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Properties in one dimension.</strong>  A nice reformulation of Eq. (1) (which is one-dimensional) is $$ \big| \frac{d}{dx} \big( f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{-1/2} \big) \big| = \big| \frac{1}{2} f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)  f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-3/2} \big| \leqslant 1,$$ which allows to define upper and lower bounds on \(f^{\prime \prime}(x)\) by integration, as, for \(x &gt; 0\), $$ – x \leqslant f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{-1/2} \, – f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{-1/2} \leqslant x,$$ which can be transformed into (by isolating \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\)): $$ \tag{3} \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)}{\big(1 + x f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}\big)^2} \leqslant f^{\prime\prime}(x) \leqslant \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)}{\big(1 – x f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}\big)^2}.$$ We thus obtain global upper and lower bounds on \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then integrate Eq. (3) twice between \(0\) and \(x\) to obtain lower and upper bounds on \(f^\prime\) and then \(f\): $$-f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}}{1+x f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}} \leqslant f^\prime(x)-f^\prime(0) \leqslant -f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}}{1-x f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}},$$ and  $$ \tag{4} \rho \big( – f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} x \big) \leqslant f(x) \ – f(0) \ – f^\prime(0) x \leqslant   \rho \big( f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} x \big),$$ with \(\displaystyle \rho(u) =\  – \log(1-u) \ – u \sim \frac{u^2}{2} \) when \(u\to 0\), that is, the second-order expansion is tight at \(x =0\), but leads to global lower and upper bounds. This upper-bound is valid as long as \(\delta = f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} x \in [0,1]\), while the lower-bound on \(f\) is always true. The function \(\rho\) is plotted below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5631" height="233" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rho.png" width="303"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Properties in multiple dimensions.</strong> The properties above in Eq. (3) and (4) directly extend to multiple dimensions. For any \(x \in C\), then for any \(h \in \mathbb{R}^d\) such that \(\delta^2 = \Delta^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) \Delta &lt; 1\), we have upper and lower bounds for the Hessian, the gradient and the functions value at \(x + \Delta\), that is, denoting by \(\| \cdot \|\) the standard Euclidean norm (see detailed proofs at the end of the post) $$\tag{5}(1-\delta)^2 f^{\prime \prime}(x) \preccurlyeq  f^{\prime \prime}(x+\Delta) \preccurlyeq  \frac{1}{(1-\delta)^2}  f^{\prime \prime}(x),$$ $$ \tag{6}\big\| f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{-1/2} \big(f^\prime(x+\Delta)-f^\prime(x) -f^{\prime \prime}(x)\Delta \big) \big\|  \leqslant \frac{\delta^2}{1-\delta},$$ and $$\tag{7} \rho(-\delta) \leqslant f(x+\Delta)\ -f(x) \ – f^\prime(x)^\top \Delta \leqslant \rho(\delta).$$ A nice consequence is that if \(\delta &lt; 1\), then \(x+\Delta \in C\), that is, we get “for free” a feasible point. Moreover, these approximations are “second-order tight” at \(\Delta=0\), that is, the term in \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\) in Taylor expansion around \(x\) is exact.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Dikin ellipsoid.</strong> The condition that \(\delta^2 = \Delta^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) \Delta &lt; 1\) defines an ellipsoid around \(x\) which is always strictly inside the domain of \(f\) (see example in the plot below). The results above essentially state that when inside the Dikin ellipsoid, the locally quadratic approximation can be used. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5642" height="307" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dykin.gif" width="388"/>Dikin ellipsoids for the function \(f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^k \log (b_i – a_i^\top x)\), which is self-concordant with a domain which is a polytope.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will focus primarily on the use self-concordant functions in optimization through the analysis of Newton method.</p>



<h2>Why should you care about Newton method?</h2>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>For fun: Newton method is one of the classics of optimization!</li><li>For high precisions: as we will see, it is quadratically convergent and attains machine precision after solving a few linear systems.</li><li>Even in high dimensions where the linear system can be expensive, Newton method may still be the method of choice for severely ill-conditioned problems where even accelerated first-order methods are too slow to obtain low precision solutions.</li><li>It sometimes comes for free in situations where gradients are expensive to evaluate compared to \(d\).</li></ol>



<h2>Classical analysis of Newton method</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), Newton method is an iterative optimization algorithm consisting in locally approximating the function \(f\) around the iterate \(x_{t}\) by a second-order Taylor expansion $$f(x_t) + f^\prime(x_t)^\top(x-x_t) + \frac{1}{2} (x-x_t)^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x_t) ( x – x_t),$$ whose minimum can be found in closed form as $$\tag{8} x_{t+1} = x_t \ – f^{\prime \prime}(x_t)^{-1} f^{\prime}(x_t).$$</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5705" height="275" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/approx_taylor.gif" width="323"/>Quadratic approximation and Newton step (in green) for varying starting points (in red). When the starting point is far from the global minimizer (in 0), the Newton step totally overshoots the global minimizer.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Newton method is classically analyzed for three times differentiable convex functions with bounded Hessians and third-order derivatives. The method is only locally convergent, that is, far away from the global minimizer \(x_\ast\) (even for very regular convex function), the method may diverge. In the non-convex setting, this leads to nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal">fractal plots</a>, but even for convex functions, the method can be unstable (see plot above).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Locally, it is quadratically convergent, that is, there exists \(c&gt;0\), such that if \(\| x_t \ – x_\ast\| \leqslant c\), then \(\| x_{t+1} \ – x_\ast \| /c  \leqslant \big( \|x_t\  – x_\ast\| / c \big)^2\). Roughly, the number of significant digits doubles at every iteration.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to $$ \| x_{t} \ – x_\ast \| \leqslant c \big( \|x_{t_0} \ – x_\ast\| / c \big)^{2^{t-t_0}} ,$$ for \(t \geqslant t_0\) and \(t_0\) an index for which \(\| x_{t_0} \ – x_\ast\| \leqslant c\). It is less than \(\varepsilon\), as soon as \(2^{t-t_0} \log ( c / \| x_{t_0} – x_\ast \| ) \geqslant \log ( c / \varepsilon)\), that is, $$ t \geqslant t_0 + \frac{ \log \log ( c / \varepsilon)}{ \log 2} \  –  \frac{\log \log ( c / \| x_{t_0} – x_\ast \| )}{\log 2}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">That is, once we enter the quadratic phase, we obtain a number of iterations in \( \log \log ( 1/ \varepsilon)\), that is, only very few iterations. For example, for \(\varepsilon = 10^{-16}\), \(\log \log ( 1/ \varepsilon) \leqslant 4\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Two major issues may be solved elegantly using self-concordant analysis: </p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>Dealing with the two phases of Newton method, the quadratically convergent final phase, as well as the initial phase.</li><li>Obtaining convergence rates which are affine-invariant, that is, minimizing \(f(x)\) of \(f(Ax+b)\) for \(A\) an invertible matrix should lead to exactly the same convergence rate (this is not the case for the classical analysis, where for example the constant \(c\) depends on non affine-invariant quantities).</li></ol>



<h2>Self-concordant analysis of Newton method</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Consider \(f: \mathcal{C} \to \mathbb{R}\) which is self-concordant. Since Newton method in Eq. (8) is not globally convergent, we need to study a version where the Newton step is performed partially. There are several possible strategies. Here I present the so-called “damped Newton” iteration and thus study the iteration $$ x^+ = x\  – \frac{1}{1+\lambda(x)} f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1} f^\prime(x),$$ where we define the “Newton decrement” \(\lambda(x)\) at \(x \in C\), as $$ \lambda^2 = \lambda(x)^2 =f^\prime(x)^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1} f^\prime(x) = \|f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1/2} f^\prime(x) \|^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The Newton decrement is a key quantity in the analysis of Newton method, as \(\frac{1}{2} \lambda(x)^2\) is exactly the decrease in the quadratic approximation obtained by a full Newton step. Moreover, </p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>If \(\lambda(x) &lt; 1\), then \(x^+\) is in the Dikin ellipsoid where we can expect the local quadratic approximation to be relevant.</li><li>If \(\lambda(x) &lt; 1\), then one can show that \(f(x) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \rho( \lambda(x)) \sim \frac{1}{2} \lambda(x)^2\) when \(\lambda(x)\) is close to zero, that is, the Newton decrement provides an upper bound on the distance to optimum.</li></ol>



<p class="justify-text">The update corresponds to \(\Delta = \ – \frac{1}{1+\lambda(x)} f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1} f^\prime(x)\), and \(\delta  = \frac{\lambda(x)}{1+\lambda(x)}  \in [0,1]\), thus \(x^+\) is automatically feasible (which is important for constrained case, see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, using Eq. (7), we get $$f(x^+)-f(x) \leqslant \ – \frac{f^\prime(x)^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1} f^\prime(x)}{1+\lambda(x)} + \rho \Big( \frac{\lambda(x)}{1+\lambda(x)} \Big) = \log (1+ \lambda(x)) \ – \lambda(x).$$ This immediately leads to a fixed decrease of \(\frac{1}{4} \, – \log \frac{5}{4} \geqslant 0.0268\) if \(\lambda(x) \geqslant \frac{1}{4}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">We can now compute the Newton decrement at \(x^+\), to see how it decreases, by first bounding $$\lambda(x^+) =\|f^{\prime \prime}(x^+)^{-1/2} f^\prime(x^+) \| \leqslant \frac{1}{1-\delta} \|f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1/2} f^\prime(x^+) \|,$$ using Eq. (5). We then have, using Eq. (6): $$ \|f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1/2} f^\prime(x^+) \| \leqslant \big\| f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1/2} \big( f^\prime(x) + f^{\prime\prime}(x) \Delta  \big) \big\| + \frac{\delta^2}{ 1-\delta } \leqslant \frac{\lambda(x)^2}{1+\lambda(x)} + \frac{\delta^2}{ 1-\delta  }.$$ This exactly leads to $$\lambda(x^+) \leqslant 2  \lambda(x)^2, $$ which leads to quadratic convergence if \(\lambda(x)\) is small enough.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then divide the analysis in two phases: before \(\lambda(x) \leqslant 1/4\) and after. The first integer \(t_0\) such that \(\lambda(x) \leqslant 1/4\) is less than \(\frac{ f(x_0) – f(x_\ast)}{0.0268} \leqslant 38 [ f(x_0) – f(x_\ast) ]\). Then, for the second phase, \(2\lambda(x_t) \leqslant (1/2)^{2^{t-t_0}}\). Given that for \(\lambda \leqslant 1/4\), \(\rho(\lambda) \leqslant 2\lambda\), we reach precision \(\varepsilon\) as soon as \(2^{t-t_0} \log 2 \geqslant \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\), that is, \(t \geqslant t_0 + \frac{1}{\log 2} \log \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon} -1\). This leads to number of iterations to reach a precision \(\varepsilon\)  which is less than $$38[ f(x_0) \ – f(x_\ast)]  +2 \log \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}.$$</p>



<h2>Interior point methods</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Self-concordant functions are also key in the analysis of interior point methods. Consider a function \(f\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\) and the constrained optimization problem $$\min_{ x \in C} f(x),$$ where \(C\) is a convex set. Barrier methods are appending a so-called “barrier function” \(g(x)\) to the objective function. A function \(g\) is a barrier function if \(g\) is convex and with domain containing the relative interior of \(C\), with gradients that explode when reaching the boundary of \(C\). We then solve instead $$\tag{9} \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d}  \varepsilon^{-1} f(x) +  g(x), $$ where \(\varepsilon &gt; 0\). Typically, the minimizer \(x_\varepsilon\) is in the relative interior of \(C\) (hence the name interior point method), and, when \(\varepsilon\) tends to zero, \(x_\varepsilon\) tends to the minimizer of \(f\) on \(C\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When both the original function \(f\) and the barrier function \(g\) are self-concordant, the (damped) Newton method is particularly useful as it ensures feasibility of the iterates. Moreover, the interplay between the progressive reduction of \(\varepsilon\) towards zero and the approximate resolution of Eq. (9) can be completely characterized (see [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611970791">3</a>, <a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/LecIPM.pdf">4</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-91578-4.pdf">5</a>]). This applies directly to linear programming, second-order cone programming and semidefinite programming.</p>



<h2>Applications in machine learning</h2>



<p class="justify-text">If you have reached this point, you are probably a big fan of self-concordance. While this property is crucial in optimization, is it really relevant for machine learning or statistics? The sad truth is that most of the non-quadratic functions within machine learning are <em>not</em> self-concordant in the sense of Eq. (1) or Eq. (2). In particular, log-sum-exp functions, such that the logistic loss \(f(t) = \log( 1 + \exp(-t) )\),  do satisfy a relationship between third and second-order derivatives, but of the form $$| f^{\prime \prime \prime}(t)| \leqslant f^{\prime \prime }(t),$$ without the power \(3/2\). This seemingly small difference leads to several variations [7] which will the topic of next month blog post. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning two applications in machine learning of classical self-concordance.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Maximum likelihood estimation for covariance matrices.</strong> Beyond its use in interior point methods, self-concordant functions arise naturally when estimating the covariance matrix using maximum likelihood estimation with a Gaussian model. Indeed, the negative log-likelihood can be written as $$ – \log p (x| \mu ,\Sigma) =\frac{d}{2} \log(2\pi) +  \frac{1}{2} \log \det \Sigma + \frac{1}{2} ( x -\mu)^\top \Sigma^{-1} ( x – \mu),$$  which leads to a negative log-determinant of the inverse \(\Sigma^{-1}\) of the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\), which is a self-concordant function, on which the guarantees discussed above apply.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Self-concordant losses.</strong> One can also design losses which are self-concordant. For example, a self-concordant version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss">Huber loss</a> is $$f(t) = \sqrt{1+t^2} \ – 1 \ –  \log \frac{ \sqrt{1+t^2} +1 }{2} .$$ It can be seen as the Fenchel-conjugate of \(– \log(1-t^2)\), and the proximity with a quadratic problem can be leveraged to obtain generalization performances using this loss function which are essentially the same as for the square loss. It can also be used for binary classification (see [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ejs/1609902192">8</a>] for details, and the two nice <a href="https://ostrodmit.github.io/blog/2018/11/12/self-concordance-part-1/">blog posts</a> of Dmitrii Ostrovskii).</p>

<p class="justify-text"><strong>One-step-estimation.</strong> Given the focus of this post on Newton method, I cannot resist mentioning a great technique coming from statistics that relies on a single Newton step. We consider a classical empirical risk minimization problem (statisticians would call it an M-estimation problem), with empirical risk \(\displaystyle \widehat{R}(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, f_\theta(x_i) )\). Given an estimator \(\hat{\theta}\), obtained by any means, then if \(\hat{\theta}\) is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\) away from the optimal parameter (with optimal performance on unseen data), then one Newton step on the function \(\widehat{R}\) started from \(\hat{\theta}\) will lead to an estimator achieving asymptotically the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound">Cramer-Rao</a> lower bound. In a nutshell, a single Newton step on the empirical risk transforms a good estimator into a very good estimator. See [9, Section 5.7] for more details.</p>

<h2>Detailed proofs for self-concordance properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We first show Eq. (7), by considering the function \(a(t) = f(x+t\Delta)\), which is a one-dimensional self-concordant function, for which \(a^\prime(t) = \Delta^\top f^\prime(x+t\Delta)\), and \(a^{\prime\prime}(t) = \Delta^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta) \Delta\). Then \(a^{\prime\prime}(0) = \delta^2\), and Eq. (4) for \(x=1\) and \(a\) exactly leads to Eq. (7).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to show Eq. (5), we consider \(h \in \mathbb{R}^d\), and the function \(b(t) = h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta) h\). We have, \(b'(t) = f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[h,h,\Delta]\), which can be bounded using Eq. (2) as $$ |b'(t) | \leqslant 2 f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[h,h] f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[\Delta,\Delta]^{1/2} = 2 b(t) a^{\prime \prime}(t)^{1/2} \leqslant 2 b(t) \frac{\delta}{1-t\delta}, $$ using Eq. (3). This implies that for \(\delta t \in [0,1)\): $$\frac{d}{dt} \big[ (1-\delta t)^2 b(t) \big] = -2\delta (1-\delta t) b(t) + (1-\delta t)^2 b'(t) \leqslant 0, $$  which implies \(b(t) \leqslant \frac{b(0)}{(1-\delta t)^2} = \frac{h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) h}{(1-\delta t)^2}\), which leads to the right-hand side of Eq. (5) since this is true for all \(h \in \mathbb{R}^d\). The left-hand side is proved similarly.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to show Eq. (6), we consider the function \(g(t) = h^\top f^\prime(x+t\Delta)\), for which, \(g^\prime(t) = h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta) \Delta\), and \(g^{\prime\prime}(t) =   f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta) [h,\Delta,\Delta]\), which satisfies: $$|g^{\prime\prime}(t)| \leqslant 2 f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[\Delta,\Delta] f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[h,h]^{1/2} \leqslant 2 b(t)^{1/2} a^{\prime \prime}(t). $$ This leads to $$ |g^{\prime\prime}(t)| \leqslant 2 \big( h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) h\big)^{1/2} \frac{\delta^2}{(1-\delta t)^3}.$$ We can then integrate twice, using \(g(0) = h^\top f^\prime(x)\) and \(g^\prime(0) = h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) \Delta\), to get: $$h^\top \big(f^\prime(x+t\Delta)-f^\prime(x) \ – f^{\prime \prime}(x)\Delta \big) \leqslant    \big( h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) h\big)^{1/2} \frac{\delta^2}{1-\delta},$$ which leads to Eq. (5) after maximizing with respect to \(h\).</p></div>
