<p>
Here <i>were</i> the open links for the workshop.  <b>Rewritten afterward:</b> Things went smoothly, despite even my “Heisenberg” feeling of uncertainty about whether I had altered the setup by testing the links beforehand.  Dick’s talk for Princeton’s 2012 Turing <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/05/17/turings-tiger-birthday-party/">centennial</a> included among “Grand Challenges” getting AV equipment for lectures to work—well Zoom etc. are a decade-later evolution of that.</p>

    <title>Ranked Enumeration of Join Queries with Projections</title>

relational database management systems. SQL and custom graph query languages
such as Cypher offer this functionality by allowing users to specify the order
via the ORDER BY clause. In many scenarios, the users also want to see the
first $k$ results quickly (expressed by the LIMIT clause), but the value of $k$
is not predetermined as user queries are arriving in an online fashion. Recent
work has made considerable progress in identifying optimal algorithms for
ranked enumeration of join queries that do not contain any projections. In this
paper, we initiate the study of the problem of enumerating results in ranked
order for queries with projections. Our main result shows that for any acyclic
query, it is possible to obtain a near-linear (in the size of the database)
delay algorithm after only a linear time preprocessing step for two important
ranking functions: sum and lexicographic ordering. For a practical subset of
acyclic queries known as star queries, we show an even stronger result that
allows a user to obtain a smooth tradeoff between faster answering time
guarantees using more preprocessing time. Our results are also extensible to
queries containing cycles and unions. We also perform a comprehensive
experimental evaluation to demonstrate that our algorithms, which are simple to
implement, improve up to three orders of magnitude in the running time over
state-of-the-art algorithms implemented within open-source RDBMS and
specialized graph databases.

    <title>Covering Many (or Few) Edges with k Vertices in Sparse Graphs</title>

maximization and a minimization variant). For a fixed $\alpha$ between zero and
one we are given a graph and two numbers $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $t \in
\mathbb{Q}$. The task is to find a vertex subset $S$ of exactly $k$ vertices
that has value at least (resp. at most for minimization) $t$. Here, the value
of a vertex set computes as $\alpha$ times the number of edges with exactly one
endpoint in $S$ plus $1-\alpha$ times the number of edges with both endpoints
in $S$. These two problems generalize many prominent graph problems, such as
Densest $k$-Subgraph, Sparsest $k$-Subgraph, Partial Vertex Cover, and Max
($k$,$n-k$)-Cut.
</p>
<p>In this work, we complete the picture of their parameterized complexity on
several types of sparse graphs that are described by structural parameters. In
particular, we provide kernelization algorithms and kernel lower bounds for
these problems. A somewhat surprising consequence of our kernelizations is that
Partial Vertex Cover and Max $(k,n-k)$-Cut not only behave in the same way but
that the kernels for both problems can be obtained by the same algorithms.

flights, train runs) are only available at certain, scheduled times. When
transporting passengers or commodities, this fact must be considered for the
the planning of itineraries. This has already led to several well-studied
algorithmic problems on temporal graphs. The difficulty of the described task
is increased by the fact that connections are often unreliable -- in
particular, many modes of transportation suffer from occasional delays. If
these delays cause subsequent connections to be missed, the consequences can be
severe. Thus, it is a vital problem to design itineraries that are robust to
(small) delays. We initiate the study of this problem from a parameterized
complexity perspective by proving its NP-completeness as well as several
hardness and tractability results for natural parameterizations.

    <title>The Ideal Membership Problem and Abelian Groups</title>

Bulatov</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rafiey:Akbar.html">Akbar Rafiey</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05218">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given polynomials $f_0,\dots, f_k$ the Ideal Membership Problem, IMP for
short, asks if $f_0$ belongs to the ideal generated by $f_1,\dots, f_k$. In the
search version of this problem the task is to find a proof of this fact. The
IMP is a well-known fundamental problem with numerous applications, for
instance, it underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as
Nullstellensatz, Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. Although the IMP is
in general intractable, in many important cases it can be efficiently solved.
</p>
<p>Mastrolilli [SODA'19] initiated a systematic study of IMPs for ideals arising
from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), parameterized by constraint
languages, denoted IMP($\Gamma$). The ultimate goal of this line of research is
to classify all such IMPs accordingly to their complexity. Mastrolilli achieved
this goal for IMPs arising from CSP($\Gamma$) where $\Gamma$ is a Boolean
constraint language, while Bulatov and Rafiey [ArXiv'21] advanced these results
to several cases of CSPs over finite domains. In this paper we consider IMPs
arising from CSPs over `affine' constraint languages, in which constraints are
subgroups (or their cosets) of direct products of Abelian groups. This kind of
CSPs include systems of linear equations and are considered one of the most
important types of tractable CSPs. Some special cases of the problem have been
considered before by Bharathi and Mastrolilli [MFCS'21] for linear equation
modulo 2, and by Bulatov and Rafiey [ArXiv'21] to systems of linear equations
over $GF(p)$, $p$ prime. Here we prove that if $\Gamma$ is an affine constraint
language then IMP($\Gamma$) is solvable in polynomial time assuming the input
polynomial has bounded degree.

    <title>Multiple Genome Analytics Framework: The Case of All SARS-CoV-2 Complete Variants</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1642377600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Konstantinos Xylogiannopoulos <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05198">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Pattern detection and string matching are fundamental problems in computer
science and the accelerated expansion of bioinformatics and computational
biology have made them a core topic for both disciplines. The SARS-CoV-2
pandemic has made such problems more demanding with hundreds or thousands of
new genome variants discovered every week, because of constant mutations, and
there is a desperate need for fast and accurate analyses. The requirement for
computational tools for genomic analyses, such as sequence alignment, is very
important, although, in most cases the resources and computational power
required are enormous. The presented Multiple Genome Analytics Framework
combines data structures and algorithms, specifically built for text mining and
pattern detection, that can help to efficiently address several computational
biology and bioinformatics problems concurrently with minimal resources. A
single execution of advanced algorithms, with space and time complexity
O(nlogn), is enough to acquire knowledge on all repeated patterns that exist in
multiple genome sequences and this information can be used from other
meta-algorithms for further meta-analyses. The potential of the proposed
framework is demonstrated with the analysis of more than 300,000 SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences and the detection of all repeated patterns with length up to
60 nucleotides in these sequences. These results have been used to provide
answers to questions such as common patterns among all variants, sequence
alignment, palindromes and tandem repeats detection, different organism genome
comparisons, polymerase chain reaction primers detection, etc.

    <title>Persistent Extension and Analogous Bars: Data-Induced Relations Between Persistence Barcodes</title>

barcodes. The classical algebraic-topological approach to interpreting homology
classes is to build maps to spaces whose homology carries semantics we
understand and then to appeal to functoriality. However, we often lack such
maps in real data; instead, we must rely on a cross-dissimilarity measure
between our observations of a system and a reference. In this paper, we develop
a pair of computational homological algebra approaches for relating persistent
homology classes and barcodes: persistent extension, which enumerates potential
relations between cycles from two complexes built on the same vertex set, and
the method of analogous bars, which utilizes persistent extension and the
witness complex built from a cross-dissimilarity measure to provide relations
across systems. We provide an implementation of these methods and demonstrate
their use in comparing cycles between two samples from the same metric space
and determining whether topology is maintained or destroyed under clustering
and dimensionality reduction.

I did not know the part about Laves being sent to the army because the Nazis viewed him as sympathetic to Jews, and then pulled into a secret project to develop unobtanium for Göring, guarded by an alchemist who helpfully insisted on adding lizard bones to the alloys and dangling crystal spheres over them.</p>

    <p>Our quarter started this week, online through Zoom, accessed in Canvas <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/107585920689338985">\(\mathbb{M}\)</a>).</span> To set it up I have to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Find and navigate to another site in which I can request a Canvas site, but get redirected to the campus login page, where I have to hand-type my name and password, then get to a page to choose my two-factor authentication, select the phone option on that page, find and unlock my phone, and find and approve the two-factor authentication request on my phone</li>
      <li>Back at the site to request a Canvas site, use it to actually request a Canvas site; this does not actually create the site, but rather puts it into a queue to be processed one or two hours later</li>
      <li>Once the site is created, navigate to Canvas, going through all the same campus login steps first.</li>
      <li>Search the web for the <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/teachanywhere/home/tools/zoom/">campus page on how to enable Zoom</a>, because the steps to do so are not simple or obvious enough to remember, and neither is the location of the campus page.</li>
      <li>Follow the five non-obvious steps on that page for adding Zoom to a Canvas site.</li>
      <li>Go to the new Zoom tab of my new Canvas site where I still have to go through all of the usual Zoom things to schedule a meeting that repeats weekly but only for some of the weekdays (many more steps).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Someone else in the discussion said that to manage their online classes they have to go through seven different web sites; my count is not nearly that high. Whatever happened to the science of user-friendly interfaces?</p>

I wasn’t particularly surprised to see MDPI and Hindawi high on their hit list, but the presence of a major IEEE journal (IEEE Access) was more interesting.</p>

Thanks to Jannis Harder for finding it for me by tracing through DNS history and trying its old IP address; it wasn’t coming up on searches and I wouldn’t have thought of doing that. Despite being found again, the journal may be in trouble: MathSciNet doesn’t list anything from them in 2021 and the new site says that as of December 2021 the entire editorial board has resigned (with no explanation other than “ask the publisher”).</p>

Richard Lipton founded this blog 1,000 posts ago. He was not quite as young as in the photo. This blog is almost 13 years old but measures time by the count of posts. Time itself occurs only between posts. Unlike what we said <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/03/14/happy-0x50th-birthday-donald-knuth/">here</a> about counting birthdays, we are counting “1,000 posts ago” correctly—because the blog was created before the first post with the <em>pages</em> one can click on above.</p>
<p>
Today we—including many from the community—also salute Dick’s 75th birthday.</p>
<p>
The birthday was last September 6. A year ago, I thought the anniversaries could be made to coincide, but the time between posts flowed heavily. Much as a ship captain’s personal attributes become vested in the ship, I felt the birthday could best be hailed at the blog milestone. In this we take after the Queen of England. Elizabeth Windsor was born on April 21 (1926), but follows the centuries-old royal custom of celebrating the birthday in late spring. </p>
<p>
It has been my great pleasure to know Dick for 35 years in-person and several years before that through his papers. His STOC 1980 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221590666_The_Consistency_of_P_NP_and_Related_Problems_with_Fragments_of_Number_Theory">paper</a> with Rich DeMillo on the possible independence of P versus NP influenced me to focus on systems of logic as a graduate student. We talked most at STACS 1994 in Caen, France, and this led to a <a href="https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/communication-complexity-of-key-agreement-on-small-ranges">paper</a> with four others in the next STACS. I gave an invited talk at Dick’s 2008 birthday celebration workshop—of which more below—and this began our closer association the next year. Dick and the blog are a fount of ideas, and if I say I wish I had time to develop them all, the answer is that our readers are always freely welcome to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Elevator Workshop </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
It is also my delight to have a slate of volunteer speakers for a <b>mini-workshop</b> this coming <b>Monday</b> (Martin Luther King Day, <b>January 17</b>) starting at <b>4pm Eastern Time</b> (US). It will have the theme “Open Problems”—what else?—actually there is “else” as some of the brief talks will be personal notes or nuggets of work that influenced careers. It is open to the public—all readers are invited to attend on Monday via the following Zoom link.  <b>Update:</b> things worked fine, and I have removed the link…</p>
<p>
…except to note that the passcode I made was 111317.  I intended the passcode to be the three primes that multiply to <b>1,001</b>, thinking of what comes next, but those three multiply to 2,431—way far ahead, but see Lance Fortnow’s comment below.  There is no “Waiting Room” and no restriction on when to come or go.</p>
<p>
Here are speakers who have volunteered so far—alphabetical except those in overseas time zones beginning with India will go first:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Subruk Kalyanasundaram <p/>
</li><li>
Ravi Kannan <p/>
</li><li>
Gil Kalai <p/>
</li><li>
Joel Ouaknine<p/>
</li><li>
Harry Buhrman <p/>
</li><li>
Jin-Yi Cai<p/>
</li><li>
Zvi Galil <p/>
</li><li>
Bill Gasarch <p/>
</li><li>
Mitsunori Ogihara <p/>
</li><li>
Rafail Ostrovsky<p/>
</li><li>
Atri Rudra <p/>
</li><li>
Santosh Vempala <p/>
</li><li>
Michael Wehar <p/>
</li><li>
Ryan Williams
</li></ul>
<p>
And possibly a few more. Among the open problems, some may be “Favorite Problems” and some “Formative Problems.” The latter means ones that can shape the field during the coming decade. They should be both important and <em>pliable</em>. The latter word is a pun: it means flexible, but we also mean something a beginning researcher can <em>ply</em> into a dissertation and early career. Computational complexity has many problems that seem to have become rigid, but its sideways growth shows pliable ones are out there. </p>
<p>
One of this blog’s first posts in February, 2009, was on conveying the key idea to solve a problem in the time of an <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/02/16/proofs-and-elevator-rides/">elevator pitch</a>. The same goes for the time to state a good problem. The talks, including pauses and time for questions, will aim to fit within an hour, or 90 minutes at most. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Well-Wishes </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I am also thankful to have the following well-wishes thus far from around the community, including several more fellow bloggers. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Scott Aaronson</b>: Happy birthday Dick! Your results have been an inspiration to me, from DeMillo-Lipton in 1979 on the independence of P vs NP to self-testing of the permanent (which played a central role in my work on BosonSampling). I hear some of your students, like Avi Wigderson, have done OK stuff as well. I look forward to checking your blog for many years to come! <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Andrew Appel</b>: I have <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1676454">Massive Memories</a> of the decade and a half that we overlapped at Princeton, in which you were one of my mentors, explaining to me the ways of the world. When I arrived there from from my PhD it seemed like all the really senior professors (you among them) were celebrating their 40th birthdays. Very best wishes for your 75th. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Boaz Barak</b>: Congratulations to GLL for its 1,000th post and to Dick for his 75th birthday! Dick has done so much for computer science, including many works that have become part of our canon and shaped our “conventional wisdom.” And then with GLL both Ken and Dick have managed to inject fun and humanity into our technical field and also question some of that conventional wisdom itself. Looking forward to the next 1,000 posts! <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Paul Beame</b>: Double congratulations, Dick! and congratulations to Ken, too. Through GLL you have helped foster a closer sense of community in our field. Your thought-provoking and informative posts and depth of engagement are inspirational.<p/>
</li><li>
<b>Avrim Blum</b>: Very happy 75th birthday, Dick! We are fortunate to have you in our field! <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Harry Buhrman</b>: Congratulations to Dick on his birthday and edition 1,000 of this blog. For me it is also the 42nd birthday of the beautiful Karp-Lipton theorem which is one of my favourite theorems. Its quantum variants are still very relevant and are currently of importance in the quantum computing community. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Jin-Yi Cai</b>: My most sincere well wishes to Dick’s 75th birthday! You have been an inspiration to so many of us over many decades! And warm congratulations to your successful 1,000th post! Your blog GLL, now with Ken, has become a most important landmark in our community. (And will speak, as above.)<p/>
</li><li>
<b>Rich DeMillo</b>—see below. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>David Dobkin</b>—see below. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>David Eppstein</b>: Happy birthday, and congratulations on the 1,000th post! I always look forward to your posts, both for their clear explanations of difficult topics and for the way you lighten them up with the biographical parts. May you have many more excellent birthdays and posts.<p/>
</li><li>
<b>Ron Fagin</b>: I have always enjoyed the Gödel’s Lost Letter blog. In fact, I view it as an important part of my computer science experience! Congratulations, Dick and Ken, on the 1,000th post! <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Lance Fortnow</b>: Congrats to Dick and Ken for their millenary post. Learned much about chess, leprechauns, and even some theory. Best wishes for the next 1,000. BTW, Bill Gasarch and I are at 2895 posts so you have some catching up to do. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Merrick Furst</b>: Dick, it’s been an incredible pleasure to work with you and play with you and be allies with you since we first met and became fast friends in the late 70’s.  What a long, strange, wonderfully complex trip it’s been.  Wishing you all the best and hope to find a way to see you sometime soon.<p/>
</li><li>
<b>Bill Gasarch</b>—will speak, as above. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Gil Kalai</b>—will speak, as above. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Subruk Kalyanasundaram</b>: I am delighted to see GLL complete 1,000 posts! Since its inception in February 2009, GLL has created and continues to exist in its own unique space. After putting up a handful of posts, Dick sent a few of us students an understated email that went something like “started a new blog. see if you like it.” At that time, I had no idea that Dick could keep it going for 1,000 posts. I was actively involved in proofreading posts in the first couple of years, but am still a regular reader. It was a privilege to see the posts a day or two before the rest of the world. GLL has been such a successful and popular blog, and wishing many many more exciting posts! <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Richard Karp</b>: Dear Dick, It has been my good fortune to be your friend and collaborate with you over many years, especially during your Berkeley period. Gödel’s Last Letter has been a major source of information and insight for me, consistently demonstrating your virtuosity and the depth of your knowledge. Congratulations also to Kathryn for her support of your efforts, and to Ken for his fruitful partnership with you. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Andrea LaPaugh</b>: Dick, congratulations and the best of wishes as you celebrate your 1,000th GLL post and your 75th birthday! The great energy, insight and joy you bring to computational theory has been an inspiration to me and many others. May you enjoy your passion for theory, and life, for many years to come. (And more below.) <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Jonathan Lenchner</b>: Congratulations on the 1,000th posting to the GLL blog—an incredible go-to reference for the computational complexity community! It has been great to reconnect with Ken, who I first met through chess, over logic. Sending belated well wishes also to Dick on the occasion of his 75th birthday! <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Harry Lewis</b>: Dick—Thank you for being the guy who always made TCS fun! There is no one who better exemplifies the principle that irreverence is key to the creative process. You have always had the gift of showing how seriously you took the questions of the field by taking their canonical answers so lightly. Your milestone sounds better in French, so I’ll paraphrase: Happy sixty-somethingth! And may you be forever young. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Daniel Lopresti</b>: Dick, I want to wish you a happy (belated) 75th birthday. Your deep and broad insights have had a tremendous impact on me and many of our colleagues in the field of computer science over the years. With warm regards, Dan Lopresti.<p/>
</li><li>
<b>Danupon Nanongkai</b>: About a decade ago, I had the privilege to learn about many exciting problems and insights from many meetings with Dick while I was his PhD student. That was when the Gödel’s Lost Letter blog started, and I am grateful that I can continue to learn by reading this blog. Congratulations on the 1,000th post and Dick’s 75th birthday! <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Mitsunori Ogihara</b>—will speak, as above. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Rafail Ostrovsky</b>: My warmest congratulations to Dick and Kathryn on Dick’s birthday wishing Dick many more equally productive and healthy years to come and enjoy. GLL is a truly an inspiration to us all—big thank you to Dick and Ken for an amazing and always inspiring content. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Joel Ouaknine</b>: Thanks for the many many inspirational and insightful posts! I’ve learned more computer science and mathematics on GLL than in any other single source I can think of! <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Vijaya Ramachandran</b>: As one of the Dick’s earlier Ph.D. students (graduating in 1983), I would like to offer Dick my best wishes for a very happy 75th birthday, and for many more years to come. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Atri Rudra</b>: I have always been and continue to be amazed by the frequency of posts on GLL especially given the mathematical depth of the exposition, which somehow still manages to be accessible to a wide audience. Here’s wishing to many more years of GLL posts being prolific!  <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Terence Tao</b>: Happy 1,000th post Dick! I very much appreciate the personal and inclusive style of mathematical storytelling that you bring to the mathematical blogging community. Look forward to the next 1,000. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Santosh Vempala</b>: My best wishes to Dick and many thanks to Dick and Ken for a 1,000 interesting posts! Here’s to the next 1,000. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Suresh Venkatasubramanian</b>: On the internet, last week is like 2 years ago. Or so it feels that way. While some of us are frantically trying to tweet our papers and TikTok our talks, it’s a testimonial to persistence and steadiness that GLL has reached its 1,000th <em>blog</em> post (although I would subscribe to a TikTok live feed of Ken and Dick composing their latest post). GLL is an oasis of depth and substance in the desert of social media, and I for one am glad it’s going strong. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Avi Wigderson</b>: I had the good fortune to be Dick Lipton’s PhD student in the years 1980-83. Being with a researcher so knowledgeable, curious, original and passionate in these formative years has shaped my own research path. Happy 75th, Dick, and many happy returns! <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Ryan Williams</b>—will speak, as above. <p/>
</li><li>
<b>Virginia Vassilevska Williams</b>: Happy 1,000th post, Dick! Your blog posts are always so fun to read, highly informative and polished, a treasured gift to our community. Thank you for working on them all this time. I’m looking forward to many more!

</p><p/><h2> Some Words From Princeton—and Yale </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Andrea LaPaugh <a href="https://dof.princeton.edu/about/clerk-faculty/emeritus/andrea-s-lapaugh">became</a> Dean of the Faculty at Princeton and served until her recent retirement. She has some further words from that perspective going back to the beginning of her 38 years at Princeton.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Dick was a major force in the development of the CS department at Princeton. His work was instrumental in the creation of the department as separate from Electrical Engineering, in recruiting faculty to grow the department, and in acquiring resources. He arrived in 1980 and immediately recruited David Dobkin as a full professor and me as an assistant professor. He continued to have major involvement in recruiting, not only in theoretical computer science, but across the CS disciplines. He was never chair, but worked first with Bruce Arden, chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and then with Bob Sedgewick, the first chair of the Department of Computer Science (after Dick recruited him) to implement a vision of a strong and well-rounded CS department. Of course Dick was not alone in this mission. David Dobkin in particular was an important partner. But from my perspective, Dick was the spark. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
David Dobkin, also writing from Princeton, goes back a few years further still to Yale:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In 1973 when I arrived at Yale as a new faculty member with a fresh PhD, Dick Lipton was the person in the next office who had arrived perhaps a week earlier. He came by to introduce himself. After a bit of formalities, we began to discuss research problems and he asked me about NP-complete problems which were all the rage at the time. The only problem I knew about was the knapsack problem and so I described it.</em></p><em>
<p>
This led to a discussion about integer programming (which neither of us had a good handle on) and then to a discussion about determining in which region of a subdivision of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-space (by a set of hyperplanes) a new point was in. Here again, neither Dick nor I had much background and so we invented things as we went. I had this idea that we could understand things with visual help and so we took one of my moving boxes as our universe and the back of some tablets as planes and began to simulate how regions would be determined in 3d.</p>
<p>
From this work emerged our first paper together which was presented at STOC ’74. This on planar subdivision searching opened up a field and led to a long and enjoyable collaboration that followed.</p>
</em><p><em>
So, congratulations Dick on having escaped the world of cardboard planes in a moving box and headed on to a remarkable career in the field. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> More Words From Georgia Tech </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Rich DeMillo sent the following from summer sunshine and open water:</p>
<p>
The last time I missed Dick’s birthday was 2008. In 2007, Dan Boneh, Merrick Furst, Santosh Vempala, and I sent the following 60th birthday symposium invitation to twenty of Lipton’s closest friends and collaborators:</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://denseoutliers.blogspot.com/2008/03/lipton-theory-symposium.html">Lipton-60</a> <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/05/report-on-sym-for-liptons-60th-bday.html">Symposium</a> was finally held in April 2008. It was less the retrospective I had imagined than a mile marker in a career that continued to accelerate in unexpected ways. A few years later, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. A few months after that, he was announced as winner of the 2014 Knuth Prize. Even more memorable was the other thing that draws us together here today: the launch in 2009 of the GLL blog that he now writes with Ken. </p>
<p>
I have long since strayed from the mainstream of theory and algorithms, but most of the work we did together has found its way into GLL essays that illuminate in startling new ways material I thought I understood thoroughly. Our paper on the nature of proof that now appears in Harry Lewis’s <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ideas-created-future">collection</a> of 46 of the most important (in his view) papers in computer science made its first <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/02/16/proofs-and-elevator-rides/">appearance</a> on the blog in 2009 and has been a recurring character in the “GLL universe” ever since. Our probabilistic <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">algorithm</a> for polynomial zero testing also entered GLL in 2009. For years I harbored vague resentment that Jack Schwartz was often cited in the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma for a result that Dick and I had published two years before in 1979, but the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">exposition</a> in GLL, Ken’s subsequent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/#comment-1993">commentary</a>, and <em>years later</em>, a reader’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/#comment-64661">comment</a> showing that Daniel Erickson’s 1974 Caltech dissertation had scooped us all, laid that to rest. </p>
<p>
We both had a fascination with the idea of algorithm correctness—incorrectness, actually—that turned into entire fields in software engineering and cryptography. Those were documented in an “Un-Birthday” <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/01/29/happy-un-birthday-rich/">post</a> a year ago:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Rich and I started our work together over four decades ago. A central theme of our work was correctness. We were concerned That programs might not work as planned. At the time it was not obvious that this was a major theme of our joint work. But looking back now I can see that it was. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Also recently, I managed to coax Dick into the fraught waters of election security. I stood back to watch how flustered researchers would respond to his (brilliant but unworkable) <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/05/10/making-elections-safe/">reconstructions</a> of what it means to vote in a public election. </p>
<p>
I have been delaying my plans to remove myself from day-to-day management duties to found a new department of cybersecurity at Georgia Tech, and I have missed Dick at my side since his retirement. There was always the possibility when Dick was in the room that someone’s long-held (but wrong) assumption would fall apart under a trademarked but understated Lipton assault. Michael Rabin (who also contributed to the Lipton-60 symposium) was fond of telling Dick on such occasions, “You are a very dangerous person.” </p>
<p>
With this intimate gathering on January 17 to commemorate GLL 1,000 and Dick Lipton’s 75th Birthday, Ken Regan has slyly kept alive the tradition of meetings that take place months after the anniversary of Dick’s birth. Times are different. Virtual meetings have replaced the casual travel and camaraderie of 2008. I cannot attend in any form on January 17 since I am at present on a ship bound for the Drake Passage and Patagonia, and I will lose Internet connectivity soon. I hope that explanation excuses this longer-than-asked-for expression of affection and admiration for Dick, my friend and collaborator for nearly 50 years. </p>

A meta open-problem: Which was the most <em>pliable</em> problem at the time this blog was founded? The Unique Games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture">conjecture</a> strikes us as a perfect example, but you readers may have other examples from then and now.</p>

    <title>TR22-008 |  Approximating Large Powers of Stochastic Matrices in Small Space | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Dean Doron, 

	Ori Sberlo</title>
    <summary>We give a deterministic space-efficient algorithm for approximating powers of stochastic matrices. On input a $w \times w$ stochastic matrix $A$, our algorithm approximates $A^{n}$ in space $\widetilde{O}(\log n + \sqrt{\log n}\cdot \log w)$ to within high accuracy. This improves upon the seminal work by Saks and Zhou (FOCS'95), that requires $O(\log^{3/2}n + \sqrt{\log n} \cdot \log w)$ space, in the regime $n \gg w$.</summary>

	Valentine Kabanets,

    <summary>We give a simplified proof of Hirahara's STOC'21 result showing that $DistPH \subseteq AvgP$ would imply $PH \subseteq DTIME[2^{O(n/\log n)}]$. The argument relies on a proof of the new result: Symmetry of Information for time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity under the assumption that $NP$ is easy on average, which is interesting in its own right and generalizes the ``weak'' Symmetry of Information theorem from the original paper by Hirahara.</summary>

    <title>TR22-006 |  Secret Sharing, Slice Formulas, and Monotone Real Circuits | 

	Benny Applebaum, 

	Amos Beimel, 

	Oded Nir, 

	Naty Peter, 

	Toniann Pitassi</title>
    <summary>A secret-sharing scheme allows to distribute a secret $s$ among $n$ parties such that only some predefined ``authorized'' sets of parties can reconstruct the secret, and all other ``unauthorized'' sets learn nothing about $s$. For over 30 years, it was known that any (monotone) collection of authorized sets can be realized by a secret-sharing scheme whose shares are of size $2^{n-o(n)}$ and until recently no better scheme was known. In a recent breakthrough, Liu and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2018) have reduced the share size to $2^{0.994n+o(n)}$, and this was further improved by several follow-ups accumulating in an upper bound of $1.5^{n+o(n)}$ (Applebaum and Nir, CRYPTO 2021). Following these advances, it is natural to ask whether these new approaches can lead to a truly sub-exponential upper-bound of $2^{n^{1-\epsilon}}$ for some constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, or even all the way down to polynomial upper-bounds.

In this paper, we relate this question to the complexity of computing monotone Boolean functions by monotone real circuits (MRCs)  -- a computational model that was introduced by Pudl\'{a}k  (J. Symb. Log., 1997) in the context of proof complexity. We introduce a new notion of ``separable'' MRCs that lies between monotone real circuits and monotone real formulas (MRFs). As our main results, we show that recent constructions of general secret-sharing schemes implicitly give rise to separable MRCs for general monotone functions of similar complexity, and that some monotone functions (in monotone NP) cannot be computed by sub-exponential size separable MRCs. Interestingly, it seems that proving similar lower-bounds for general MRCs is beyond the reach of current techniques.

We use this connection to obtain lower-bounds against a natural family of secret-sharing schemes, as well as new non-trivial upper-bounds for MRCs. Specifically, we conclude that recent approaches for secret-sharing schemes cannot achieve sub-exponential share size and that every monotone function can be realized by an MRC (or even MRF) of complexity $1.5^{n+o(n)}$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first improvement over the trivial $2^{n-o(n)}$ upper-bound. Along the way, we show that the recent constructions of general secret-sharing schemes implicitly give rise to Boolean formulas over slice functions and prove that such formulas can be simulated by separable MRCs of similar size. On a conceptual level, our paper continues the rich line of study that relates the share size of secret-sharing schemes to monotone complexity measures.</summary>

    <title>On the California Math Framework</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><i>Guest post by Boaz Barak
and Jelani Nelson</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">In a <a href="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/12/defending-status-quo.html">recent
post</a>, Lance Fortnow critiqued our <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a> on the
proposed revisions for the <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">California Mathematics Framework</a> (CMF). We disagree
with Lance’s critique, and he has kindly allowed us to post our rebuttal here
(thank you Lance!).</p><p class="MsoNormal">First, let us point out the aspects where we agree with both
Lance and the authors of the CMF. Inequality in mathematical education, and in
particular the obstacles faced by low-income students and students of color, is
a huge problem in the US at large and California in particular. As a Black
mathematician, this portion of the CMF’s <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter1.docx">introduction</a> particularly resonated
with me (Jelani):</p><blockquote><p class="MsoNormal">Girls and Black and Brown children, notably, represent
groups that more often receive messages that they are not capable of high-level
mathematics, compared to their White and male counterparts (Shah &amp;
Leonardo, 2017). As early as preschool and kindergarten, research and policy
documents use deficit-oriented labels to describe Black and Latinx and
low-income children’s mathematical learning and position them as already behind
their white and middle-class peers (NCSM &amp; TODOS, 2016).</p></blockquote><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">We agree with the observation that bias in the public
education system can have a negative impact on students from underrepresented
groups. Where we strongly oppose the CMF though is regarding their conclusions
on how to address this concern. </p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">The CMF may state that they are motivated by increasing
equity in mathematics. However, if we read past the introduction to the actual
details of the CMF revisions, then we see they suffer from fundamental flaws,
which we believe if implemented, would <b>exacerbate</b> educational gaps, and
in particular make it <b>harder</b> for low-income students and students of
color to reach and be successful in college STEM.</p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">You can read our <a href="https://gdoc.pub/doc/e/2PACX-1vQvuzlJ8MWthsqOhRLxQc5akGS0JkgThz3umqO3K-WQiXFhWiq9qw-9iYdTyC652Ftjvv5nHvgGYTEv">detailed
critique</a> of the CMF, but the revisions we take issue with are:</p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

     to drop the option of Algebra I in the 8th grade<br/>
     <!--[endif]--></li><li class="MsoNormal">Recommendation
     to offer (and in fact push and elevate above others) a “data science”
     pathway for high school education as an alternative to the traditional
     Algebra and Geometry curriculum. While data science can be a deep and
     important field, teaching it for students without a math background will
     be necessarily shallow. Indeed, the proposed data science courses focus on
     tools such as using spreadsheets etc., and do not provide mathematical
     foundations.</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">1 and 2 make it all but impossible for students that follow
the recommended path to reach calculus (perhaps even pre-calculus)  in the
12th grade.  This means that such students will be at a disadvantage if
they want to pursue STEM majors in college. And who will be these students?
Since the CMF is only recommended, wealthier school districts are free to
reject it, and some already <a href="https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2021/11/california-math/">signalled
that they will do so</a>. Within districts that do adopt the recommendations,
students with means are likely to take private Algebra I courses outside the
curriculum (as <a href="https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2021/12/san-francisco-math/">already
</a><a href="https://edsource.org/2021/one-districts-faulty-data-shouldnt-drive-californias-math-policy/663374">happened</a>
in San Francisco), and reject the calculus-free “data science” pathway. Hence
this pathway will amount to a lower-tier track by another name, and worse than
now, students will be tracked based on whether their family has the financial
means to supplement the child’s public education with private coursework.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Notably, though the CMF aims to elevate data science, we’ve
had several data science faculty at the university level express disapproval of
the proposal by signing our opposition letter, including a founding faculty
member of the Data Science Institute at UCSD, and several others who are
directors of various undergraduate programs at their respective universities,
including four who direct their universities' undergraduate data science
programs (at Indiana University, Loyola University in Chicago, MIT, and the
University of Wisconsin)! </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One could say that while the framework may hurt low-income
or students of color who want to pursue STEM in college, it might help other
students who are not interested in STEM. However, interest in STEM majors is <a href="https://www.ppic.org/blog/more-students-are-earning-stem-degrees/">rapidly
rising</a>, and with good reasons: employment in math occupations is projected
to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/mobile/home.htm">grow much faster </a>than
other occupations. With the increasing centrality of technology and STEM to our
society, we urgently need reforms that will diversify these professions rather
than the other way around.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As a final note, Lance claimed that by rejecting the CMF, we
are “defending the status quo”. This is not true. The CMF revisions are far
from the “only game in town” for improving the status quo in mathematics
education. In fact, unlike these largely untested proposals, there is a history
of approaches that do work for teaching mathematics for under-served
populations. We do not need to change the math itself, just invest in more
support (including extracurricular support) for students from under-resourced
communities. For example, Bob Moses’ <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/08/02/206813091/to-60s-civil-rights-hero-math-is-kids-formula-for-success">Algebra
Project</a> has time and again taken the least successful students according to
standardized exams, and turned them into a cohort that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">outperformed</a>
state averages in math. One of our letter’s contact people is Adrian Mims, an
educator with 27 years of experience, whose dissertation was on 
"Improving African American Achievement in Geometry Honors" and who
went on to found <a href="https://thecalculusproject.org/">The Calculus
Project</a>, a non-profit organization creating a pathway for low-income
students and students of color to succeed in advanced mathematics. </p><p class="MsoNormal">To close, a critique of the proposed CMF revision is not a
defense of the status quo. Even if change is needed, not all change is good
change, and our letter does make some recommendations on the front, one of
which is a matter of process: if a goal is to best prepare Californian youth
for majors in data science and STEM more broadly, and ultimately careers in
these spaces, then involve college-level STEM educators and STEM professionals
in the <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/mathcfccapplicants.asp">Curriculum
Framework and Evaluation Criteria Committee</a>.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>(Hopefully no one has taken taken that title yet!)</em></p>



<p>I waste a large fraction of my existence just reading about what’s happening in the world, or discussion and analysis thereof, in an unending scroll of paralysis and depression.  On the first anniversary of the January 6 attack, I read the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/january-6-insurrection-trump-coup-2024-election/620843/n">recent revelations</a> about just how close the seditionists actually came to overturning the election outcome (e.g., by pressuring just one Republican state legislature to “decertify” its electors, after which the others would likely follow in a domino effect), and how hard it now is to see a path by which democracy in the United States will survive beyond 2024.  Or I read <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/10/manchin-bbb-coal-miners-vs-owners/">about</a> Joe Manchin, who’s already entered the annals of history as the man who could’ve halted the slide to the abyss and decided not to.  Of course, I also read about the wokeists, who correctly see the swing of civilization getting pushed terrifyingly far out of equilibrium to the right, so their solution is to push the swing terrifyingly far out of equilibrium to the <em>left</em>, and then they act shocked when their own action, having added all this potential energy to the swing, causes it to swing back <em>even further</em> to the right, as swings tend to do.  (And <em>also</em> there’s a global pandemic killing millions, and the correct response to it—to authorize and distribute new vaccines as quickly as the virus mutates—is completely outside the Overton Window between Obey the Experts and Disobey the Experts, advocated by no one but a few nerds.  When I first wrote this post, I forgot all about the global pandemic.)  And I see all this and I am powerless to stop it.</p>



<p>In such a dark time, it’s easy to forget that I’m a theoretical computer scientist, mainly focused on quantum computing.  It’s easy to forget that people come to this blog because they want to read about quantum computing.  It’s like, who gives a crap about that anymore?  What doth it profit a man, if he gaineth a few thousand fault-tolerant qubits with which to calculateth chemical reaction rates or discrete logarithms, and he loseth civilization?</p>



<p>Nevertheless, in the rest of this post I’m going to share some quantum-related debunking updates—not because that’s what’s at the top of my mind, but in an attempt to find my way back to sanity.  Picture that: quantum mechanics (and specifically, the refutation of outlandish claims related to quantum mechanics) as the part of one’s life that’s comforting, normal, and sane.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>There’s been lots of online debate about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07978">claim</a> to have entangled a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">tardigrade</a> (i.e., water bear) with a superconducting qubit; see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15166">this paper</a> by Vlatko Vedral, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/no-tardigrades-have-not-been-quantum-entangled-with-a-qubit/">this</a> from CNET, <a href="https://twitter.com/benbenbrubaker/status/1472287582654455817?s=20">this</a> from Ben Brubaker on Twitter.  So, do we now have Schrödinger’s Tardigrade: a living, “macroscopic” organism maintained coherently in a quantum superposition of two states?  How could such a thing be possible with the technology of the early 21<sup>st</sup> century?  Hasn’t it been a huge challenge to demonstrate even Schrödinger’s Virus or Schrödinger’s Bacterium?  So then how did this experiment leapfrog (or leaptardigrade) over those vastly easier goals?</p>



<p>Short answer: it didn’t.  The experimenters couldn’t directly measure the degree of freedom in the tardigrade that’s claimed to be entangled with the qubit.  But it’s consistent with everything they report that whatever entanglement is there, it’s between the superconducting qubit and a microscopic <em>part</em> of the tardigrade.  It’s <em>also</em> consistent with everything they report that there’s no entanglement at all between the qubit and <em>any</em> part of the tardigrade, just boring classical correlation.  (Or rather that, if there’s “entanglement,” then it’s the Everett kind, involving not merely the qubit and the tardigrade but the whole environment—the same as we’d get by just measuring the qubit!)  Further work would be needed to distinguish these possibilities.  In any case, it’s of course cool that they were able to cool a tardigrade to near absolute zero and then revive it afterwards.</p>



<p>I thank the authors of the tardigrade paper, who clarified a few of these points in correspondence with me.  Obviously the comments section is open for whatever I’ve misunderstood.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>People also asked me to respond to Sabine Hossenfelder’s recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytyjgIyegDI">video</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism">superdeterminism</a>, a theory that holds that quantum entanglement doesn’t actually exist, but the universe’s initial conditions were fine-tuned to stop us from choosing to measure qubits in ways that would make its nonexistence apparent: even when we <em>think</em> we’re applying the right measurements, we’re not, because the initial conditions messed with our brains or our computers’ random number generators.  (See, I tried to be as non-prejudicial as possible in that summary, and it still came out sounding like a parody.  Sorry!)</p>



<p>Sabine sets up the usual dichotomy that people argue against superdeterminism only because they’re attached to a belief in free will.  She rejects Bell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem#Statistical_independence">statistical independence</a> assumption, which she sees as a mere dogma rather than a prerequisite for doing science.  Toward the end of the video, Sabine mentions the objection that, without statistical independence, a demon could destroy any randomized controlled trial, by tampering with the random number generator that decides who’s in the control group and who isn’t.  But she then reassures the viewer that it’s no problem: superdeterministic conspiracies will only appear when quantum mechanics would’ve predicted a Bell inequality violation or the like.  Crucially, she never explains the mechanism by which superdeterminism, once allowed into the universe (<em>including</em> into macroscopic devices like computers and random number generators), will stay confined to reproducing the specific predictions that quantum mechanics already told us were true, rather than enabling ESP or telepathy or other mischief.  This is <em>stipulated</em>, never explained or derived.</p>



<p>To say I’m not a fan of superdeterminism would be a super-understatement.  And yet, nothing I’ve written previously on this blog—about superdeterminism’s gobsmacking lack of explanatory power, or about how trivial it would be to cook up a superdeterministic “mechanism” for, e.g., faster-than-light signaling—none of it seems to have made a dent.  It’s all come across as obvious to the majority of physicists and computer scientists who think as I do, and it’s all fallen on deaf ears to superdeterminism’s fans.</p>



<p>So in desperation, let me now try another tack: going meta.  It strikes me that no one who saw quantum mechanics as a profound clue about the nature of reality could ever, in a trillion years, think that superdeterminism looked like a promising route forward given our current knowledge.  The only way you could think that, it seems to me, is if you saw quantum mechanics as an <strong>anti-clue</strong>: a red herring, actively misleading us about how the world really is.  To be a superdeterminist is to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>OK, fine, there’s the Bell experiment, which <em>looks like</em> Nature screaming the reality of ‘genuine indeterminism, as predicted by QM,’ louder than you might’ve thought it even <em>logically possible</em> for that to be screamed.  But don’t listen to Nature, listen to us!  If you just drop what you thought were foundational assumptions of science, we can explain this away!  Not <em>explain</em> it, of course, but explain it <em>away</em>.  What more could you ask from us?</p></blockquote>



<p>Here’s my challenge to the superdeterminists: when, in 400 years from Galileo to the present, has such a gambit <em>ever</em> worked?  Maxwell’s equations were a clue to special relativity.  The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of classical mechanics were clues to quantum mechanics.  When has a great theory in physics ever been <em>grudgingly accommodated</em> by its successor theory in a horrifyingly ad-hoc way, rather than gloriously explained and derived?</p>

    <title>What is Synthetic Data?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The concept of synthetic data seems to be having “a moment” in the privacy world as a promising approach to sharing data while protecting privacy.  Strictly speaking, any time you make up data, you have produced a synthetic dataset, but more specifically</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a <strong>synthetic dataset</strong> is a stand-in for some original dataset that has the same format, and accurately reflects the statistical properties of the original dataset, but contains only “fake” records.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intuitively, a synthetic dataset can be used as if it were the real data—we can stare at it, compute summary statistics from it, train models from it, and do everything we normally do with data—but because the records do not correspond to “real” people, we don’t have to worry about protecting privacy.</p>

<p>To be sure, synthetic data is a very appealing concept, but</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>simply making data “synthetic” does not guarantee privacy in any meaningful sense of the word,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and we need to be careful about what it actually means to generate <strong>private synthetic data.</strong></p>

<p>In this post I will briefly describe <strong>differentially private synthetic data</strong>, why we need it, and what we know about producing it.  The post will serve as a warmup to some more technical posts that will follow later, describing general approaches and state-of-the-art algorithms for producing synthetic data.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-synthetic-data">What is synthetic data?</h3>

<p>Given a dataset \(X\), a synthetic dataset \(Y\) is a new dataset that has the same <em>structure</em> as \(X\), but whose elements are “fake.”  For example, if \(X\) is a highly stylized version of the data collected in the US decennial census, then each element of \(X\) would be a tuple of the form (age, census_block, sex, race, ethnicity) corresponding to the data of a real person who filled out a census card.  A synthetic dataset should also contain such tuples, but they no longer need to correspond to real people.</p>

<p>An example of a synthetic dataset for the census would be a dataset consisting of 300,000,000 individuals, all living at one location in rural Mississippi, and all of whom are white, non-hispanic females aged 81.  And therein lies the challenge.  Of course we want a synthetic dataset not to merely have the same <em>structure</em> as the original data, but also to preserve the <em>statistical properties</em> of the original data.  A synthetic dataset for the census should put roughly the right number of individuals of the right types in the right places to reflect the actual population of the US.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, to generate synthetic data, we have to know something about the original data, which creates opportunities to leak sensitive information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="synthetic-data-from-generative-modeling">Synthetic data from generative modeling</h4>

<p>Ensuring that a synthetic dataset really only reflects the statistical properties of the real data, and doesn’t encode sensitive information about the individuals in the real dataset, is quite difficult.  I could go on forever about strawman proposals that would generate records that appear to be “fake” but really just encode the original dataset in obvious ways.  Just so you believe I could do it, suppose for every real record, we get a fake record by adding 10 years to that individual’s age.  But what people typically mean when they talk about generating synthetic data, and what the synthetic data products being sold by companies typically do, is train a generative model for the dataset \(X\) and obtain the synthetic dataset \(Y\) by sampling from that model.  The hope is that samples from the generative model look like the original dataset in aggregate, but the actual people in the sample have nothing to do with the real people in the original dataset.  For example, a generative model from the US population will lead to more people living in California than in Montana, but ideally wouldn’t simply spit out the data of the actual residents of California.</p>

<h4 id="generative-models-dont-magically-protect-privacy">Generative models don’t magically protect privacy</h4>

<p>Simply training a generative model on \(X\) doesn’t actually mean we’ve hidden anything about \(X\) or the people in it.  For an extreme example, suppose the records in \(X\) are \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) and our generative model is arbitrarily expressive and determines that the best model for the data is just the uniform distribution on the set \(x_1,\dots,x_n\).  Then if our synthetic dataset consists of \(n\) iid samples from the generative model, our synthetic dataset will simply contain one or more copies of the real data for a large fraction (about 70%) of the people in the original dataset.</p>

<h4 id="reconstruction-attacks-say-hello">Reconstruction attacks say hello</h4>

<p>My example was admittedly a strawman, and when we train a generative model we typically expect it to produce new examples that aren’t in the original training dataset.  Maybe by training generative models in the right way, we can ensure that the generative model only captures statistics about the dataset, without revealing information about the individuals in the dataset?  Let’s not forget that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>a synthetic dataset is just one of many possible ways to release statistical information about a dataset, and we know from the theory of reconstruction attacks that <strong>any</strong> mechanism that accurately preserves too many statistics inevitably destroys privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, there is a rich and fairly comprehensive theory of <strong>reconstruction attacks</strong>, whose <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/reconstruction-theory/">theory</a> and <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/diffix-attack/">practice</a> we detailed in earlier posts.  This theory says that any synthetic dataset that preserves answers to every statistic of the form “How many elements of the dataset satisfies property P?” with any meaningful notion of accuracy, is spectacularly non-private, in the sense that an attacker can reconstruct nearly all of the private information in the original dataset.  Viewed through this lens, synthetic data becomes something of a red herring.  The important question is which subset of statistics we want to preserve and how to preserve them without compromising privacy.</p>

<h3 id="differentially-private-synthetic-data">Differentially private synthetic data</h3>

<p>Making a dataset “synthetic” may not be a magic bullet, but it’s still a useful goal.  Fortunately, we already have a good working definition of what it means for an algorithm to protect the privacy of the individuals in the dataset—<strong>differential privacy</strong>.  So perhaps we can design a differentially private algorithm that takes the original dataset \(X\) and outputs a synthetic dataset \(Y\) that preserves many of the properties of \(X\) accurately (but still within the limits imposed by reconstruction attacks)?  In fact, the answer turns out to be a resounding yes!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is a differentially private algorithm that takes a dataset \(X\) and outputs a synthetic dataset \(Y\) that preserves an <strong>exponential</strong> number of statistical properties of \(X\) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2229">[BLR08]</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is intentionally quite informal, but intutively this result says that we can hope to do amazing things, like generate a synthetic dataset that satisfies the strong guarantee of differential privacy while still approximately preserving impressively complex statistics of the dataset, such as the marginal distribution of every set of three attributes, or the prediction error of every linear classifier.</p>

<p>So what’s the problem?  Well, primarily it’s computational complexity. This algorithm, and the many beautiful algorithms it inspired, all have exponential worst-case running time.  Specifically, if each element of the dataset contains \(d\) bits, then the worst-case running time is at least as large as \(2^d\).  Unfortunately, this turns out to be an inherent bottleneck for any algorithm that generates synthetic data.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Any private algorithm that takes a dataset \(X\) and outputs a synthetic dataset \(Y\) that preserves even just the correlations between each pair of features must have worst-case running time that grows exponentially in the number of features, under widely believed complexity assumptions. <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2010/017/">[UV11]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While there are inherent limits of the accuracy of all differentially private algorithms (see <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/publications/exposed-survey-attacks-private-data">[DSSU17]</a>), and there are significant barriers to making differentially private algorithms practical,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>computational complexity is the main barrier that is specific to differentially private algorithms for generating synthetic data.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where do we go from here?</h4>

<p>Despite the computational bottlenecks, there has stll been a lot of amazing progress on differentially private synthetic data.  And, despite my criticism of generative modeling in isolation as a means of generating synthetic data, most of these approaches are indeed based on <em>differentially private generative models</em> such as sparse graphical models or GANs, and leverage the fact that these types of models can typically be fit efficiently to realistic data, despite their worst-case hardness.  In the next few posts, we will try to describe the landscape of the most promising approaches that we currently have available.</p>

    <title>TR22-004 |  Analyzing Ta-Shma’s Code via the Expander Mixing Lemma | 

	Silas Richelson, 

	Sourya Roy</title>
    <summary>Random walks in expander graphs and their various derandomizations (e.g., replacement/zigzag product) are invaluable tools from pseudorandomness. Recently, Ta-Shma used s-wide replacement walks in his breakthrough construction of a binary linear code almost matching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound (STOC 2017). Ta-Shma’s original analysis was entirely linear algebraic, and subsequent developments have inherited this viewpoint. In this work, we rederive Ta-Shma’s analysis from a combinatorial point of view using repeated application of the expander mixing lemma. We hope that this alternate perspective will yield a better understanding of Ta-Shma’s construction. As an additional application of our techniques, we give an alternate proof of the expander hitting set lemma.</summary>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Classical algorithms typically provide “one size fits all” performance, and do not leverage properties or patterns in their inputs. A recent line of work aims to address this issue by developing algorithms that use machine learning predictions to improve their performance. In this talk I will present two examples of this type, in the context of streaming and sampling algorithms. In particular, I will show how to use machine learning predictions to improve the performance of (a) low-memory streaming algorithms for frequency estimation (ICLR’19), and (b) sampling algorithms for estimating the support size of a distribution (ICLR’21).   Both algorithms use an ML-based predictor that, given a data item, estimates the number of times the item occurs in the input data set.  </p>



<p>The talk will cover material from papers co-authored with  T Eden, CY Hsu, D Katabi, S Narayanan, R Rubinfeld, S Silwal, T Wagner and A Vakilian.</p>

    <title>Does Gradient Flow Over Neural Networks Really Represent Gradient Descent?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>A lot was said in this blog (cf. <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/06/03/trajectories/">post by Sanjeev</a>) about the importance of studying trajectories of gradient descent (<strong><em>GD</em></strong>) for understanding deep learning.
Researchers often conduct such studies by considering <em>gradient flow</em> (<strong><em>GF</em></strong>), equivalent to GD with infinitesimally small step size.
Much was learned from analyzing GF over neural networks (<strong><em>NNs</em></strong>), but to what extent <strong><em>do results for GF apply to GD with practical step size?</em></strong>
This is an open question in deep learning theory.
My student Omer Elkabetz and I investigated it in a recent NeurIPS 2021 spotlight <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=iX0TSH45eOd">paper</a>.
In a nutshell, we found that, although in general an exponentially small step size is required for guaranteeing that GD is well represented by GF, specifically over NNs, a much larger step size can suffice.
This allows <strong><em>immediate translation of analyses for GF over NNs to results for GD</em></strong>.
The translation bears potential to shed light on both optimization and generalization (implicit regularization) in deep learning, and indeed, we exemplify its use for proving what is, to our knowledge, the <strong><em>first guarantee of random near-zero initialization almost surely leading GD over a deep (three or more layer) NN of fixed size to efficiently converge to global minimum</em></strong>.
The remainder of this post provides more details; for the full story see our <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=iX0TSH45eOd">paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="gf-a-continuous-surrogate-for-gd">GF: a continuous surrogate for GD</h2>

<p>Let $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ be an objective function (e.g. training loss of deep NN) that we would like to minimize via GD with step size $\eta &gt; 0$: 
[
\boldsymbol\theta_{k + 1} = \boldsymbol\theta_k - \eta \nabla f ( \boldsymbol\theta_k ) ~ ~ ~ \text{for} ~ k = 0 , 1 , 2 , …
\qquad \color{green}{\text{(GD)}}
]
We may imagine a continuous curve $\boldsymbol\theta : [ 0 , \infty ) \to \mathbb{R}^d$ that passes through the $k$’th GD iterate at time $t = k \eta$.
This would imply $\boldsymbol\theta ( t + \eta ) = \boldsymbol\theta ( t ) - \eta \nabla f ( \boldsymbol\theta ( t ) )$, which we can write as $\frac{1}{\eta} ( \boldsymbol\theta ( t + \eta ) - \boldsymbol\theta ( t ) ) = - \nabla f ( \boldsymbol\theta ( t ) )$.
In the limit of infinitesimally small step size ($\eta \to 0$), we obtain the following characterization for $\boldsymbol\theta ( \cdot )$:
[
\frac{d}{dt} \boldsymbol\theta ( t ) = - \nabla f ( \boldsymbol\theta ( t ) ) ~ ~ ~ \text{for} ~ t \geq 0 
.
\qquad \color{blue}{\text{(GF)}}
]
This differential equation is known as GF, and represents a continuous surrogate for GD.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>GF brings forth the possibility of employing a vast array of continuous mathematical machinery for studying GD.
It is for this reason that GF has become a popular model in deep learning theory (see our <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=iX0TSH45eOd">paper</a> for a long list of works analyzing GF over NNs).
There is only one problem: GF assumes infinitesimal step size for GD!
This is of course impractical, leading to the following open question $-$ the topic of our <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=iX0TSH45eOd">work</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Open Question:</strong>
Does GF over NNs represent GD with practical step size?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="gd-as-numerical-integrator-for-gf">GD as numerical integrator for GF</h2>

<p>The question of proximity between GF and GD (with positive step size) is closely related to an area of numerical analysis known as <em>numerical integration</em>.
There, the motivation is the other way around $-$ given a differential equation $\frac{d}{dt} \boldsymbol\theta ( t ) = \boldsymbol g ( \boldsymbol\theta ( t ) )$ induced by some vector field $\boldsymbol g : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$, the interest lies on a continuous solution $\boldsymbol\theta : [ 0 , \infty ) \to \mathbb{R}^d$, and numerical (discrete) integration algorithms are used for obtaining approximations.
A classic numerical integrator, known as <em>Euler’s method</em>, is given by $\boldsymbol\theta_{k + 1} = \boldsymbol\theta_k + \eta \boldsymbol g ( \boldsymbol\theta_k )$ for $k = 0 , 1 , 2 , …$, where $\eta &gt; 0$ is a predetermined step size.
With Euler’s method, the goal is for the $k$’th iterate to approximate the sought-after continuous solution at time $k \eta$, meaning $\boldsymbol\theta_k \approx \boldsymbol\theta ( k \eta )$.
Notice that when the vector field $\boldsymbol g ( \cdot )$ is chosen to be minus the gradient of an objective function $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$, i.e. $\boldsymbol g ( \cdot ) = - \nabla f ( \cdot )$, the given differential equation is no other than GF, and its numerical integration via Euler’s method yields no other than GD!
We can therefore employ known results from numerical integration to bound the distance between GF and GD!</p>

<h2 id="gf-matches-gd-if-its-trajectory-is-roughly-convex">GF matches GD if its trajectory is roughly convex</h2>

<p>There exist classic results bounding the approximation error of Euler’s method, but these are too coarse for our purposes.
Instead, we invoke a modern result known as “Fundamental Theorem” (cf. <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-78862-1">Hairer et al. 1993</a>), which implies the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong>
The distance between the GF trajectory $\boldsymbol\theta ( \cdot )$ at time $t$, and iterate $k = t / \eta$ of GD, is upper bounded as:</p>

  <p>[ 
|| \boldsymbol\theta ( t ) - \boldsymbol\theta_{k = t / \eta} || \leq \mathcal{O} \Big( e^{- \smallint_0^{~ t} \lambda_- ( t’ ) dt’} t \eta \Big)
, 
]
where $\lambda_- ( t’ ) := \min \left( \lambda_{min} \left( \nabla^2 f ( \boldsymbol\theta ( t’ ) ) \right) , 0 \right)$, i.e. $\lambda_- ( t’ )$ is defined to be the negative part of the minimal eigenvalue of the Hessian on the GF trajectory at time $t’$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As expected, by using a sufficiently small step size $\eta$, we may ensure that GD is arbitrarily close to GF for arbitrarily long.
How small does $\eta$ need to be?
For the theorem to guarantee that GD follows GF up to time $t$, we must have $\eta \in \mathcal{O} \big( e^{\smallint_0^{~ t} \lambda_- ( t’ ) dt’} / t \big)$.
In particular, $\eta$ must be exponential in $\smallint_0^{~ t} \lambda_- ( t’ ) dt’$, i.e. in the integral of (the negative part of) the minimal Hessian eigenvalue along the GF trajectory (up to time $t$).
If the optimized objective $f ( \cdot )$ is convex then Hessian eigenvalues are everywhere non-negative, and therefore $\lambda_- ( \cdot ) \equiv 0$, which means that a moderately small $\eta$ (namely, $\eta \in \mathcal{O} ( 1 / t )$) suffices.
If on the other hand $f ( \cdot )$ is non-convex then Hessian eigenvalues may be negative, meaning $\lambda_- ( \cdot )$ may be negative, which in turn implies that $\eta$ may have to be exponentially small.
We prove in our <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=iX0TSH45eOd">paper</a> that there indeed exist cases where an exponentially small step size is unavoidable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition 1:</strong>
For any $m &gt; 0$, there exist (non-convex) objectives on which the GF trajectory at time $t$ is <strong>not</strong> approximated by GD if $\eta \notin \mathcal{O} ( e^{- m t} )$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this negative result, not all hope is lost.
It might be that even though a given objective function is non-convex, specifically over GF trajectories it is “roughly convex,” in the sense that along these trajectories the minimal eigenvalue of the Hessian is “almost non-negative.”
This would mean that $\lambda_- ( \cdot )$ is almost non-negative, in which case (by Theorem 1) a moderately small step size suffices in order for GD to track GF!</p>

<h2 id="trajectories-of-gf-over-nns-are-roughly-convex">Trajectories of GF over NNs are roughly convex</h2>

<p>Being interested in the match between GF and GD over NNs, we analyzed the geometry of GF trajectories on training losses of NNs with homogeneous activations (e.g. linear, ReLU, leaky ReLU).
The following theorem (informally stated) was proven:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 2:</strong>
For a training loss of a NN with homogeneous activations, the minimal Hessian eigenvalue is arbitrarily negative across space, but along GF trajectories initialized near zero it is almost non-negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Combined with Theorem 1, this theorem suggests that over NNs (with homogeneous activations), in the common regime of near-zero initialization, a moderately small step size for GD suffices in order for it to be well represented by GF!
We verify this prospect empirically, demonstrating that in basic deep learning settings, reducing the step size for GD often leads to only slight changes in its trajectory.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/gf-gd-experiment.png" style="width: 600px;"/>
<br/>
<i><b>Figure 2:</b> 
Experiment with NN comparing every iteration of GD with step size $\eta_0 := 0.001$, to every $r$'th iteration of GD with step size $\eta_0 / r$, where $r = 2 , 5 , 10 , 20$.
Left plot shows training loss values; right one shows distance (in weight space) of GD with step size $\eta_0$ from initialization, against its distance from runs with smaller step size.
Takeaway: reducing step size barely made a difference, suggesting GD was already close to the continuous (GF) limit.
</i>
</div>

<h2 id="translating-analyses-of-gf-to-results-for-gd">Translating analyses of GF to results for GD</h2>

<p>Theorems 1 and 2 together form a tool for automatically translating analyses of GF over NNs to results for GD with practical step size.
This means that a vast array of continuous mathematical machinery available for analyzing GF can now be leveraged for formally studying practical NN training!
Since analyses of GF over NNs often establish convergence to global minimum and/or characterize the solution found (again, see our <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=iX0TSH45eOd">paper</a> for long list of examples), the translation we developed bears potential to shed new light on both optimization and generalization (implicit regularization) in deep learning.
To demonstrate this point, we analyze GF over arbitrarily deep linear NNs with scalar output, and prove the following result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition 2:</strong>
GF over an arbitrarily deep linear NN with scalar output converges to global minimum almost surely (i.e. with probability one) under a random near-zero initialization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying our translation yields an analogous result for GD with practical step size:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 3:</strong>
GD over an arbitrarily deep linear NN with scalar output efficiently converges to global minimum almost surely under a random near-zero initialization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first guarantee of random near-zero initialization <strong><em>almost surely</em></strong> leading GD over a deep (three or more layer) NN of fixed size to efficiently converge to global minimum!</p>

<h2 id="what-about-large-step-size-momentum-stochasticity">What about large step size, momentum, stochasticity?</h2>

<p>An emerging belief (see our <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=iX0TSH45eOd">paper</a> for several supporting references) is that for GD over NNs, large step size can be beneficial in terms of generalization.
While the large step size regime isn’t necessarily captured by standard GF, recent works (e.g. <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=3q5IqUrkcF">Barrett &amp; Dherin 2021</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=q8qLAbQBupm">Kunin et al. 2021</a>) argue that it is captured by certain modifications of GF.
Modifications were also proposed for capturing other aspects of NN training, for example momentum (cf. <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-084/15-084.pdf">Su et al. 2016</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04245.pdf">Wibisono et al. 2016</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/franca18a/franca18a.pdf">Franca et al. 2018</a>, <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume22/20-195/20-195.pdf">Wilson et al. 2021</a>) and stochasticity (see, e.g., <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume20/17-526/17-526.pdf">Li et al. 2017</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rq_Qr0c1Hyo">Smith et al. 2021</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=goEdyJ_nVQI">Li et al. 2021</a>).
Extending our GF-to-GD translation machinery to account for modifications as above would be very interesting in my opinion.
All in all, I believe that in the years to come, the vast knowledge on continuous dynamical systems, and GF in particular, will unravel many mysteries behind deep learning.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If you haven’t seen it, now is the time to drop everything you are doing and watch <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM">The story of stuff</a></em>. Computer scientists like myself will latch onto the scene where the old computer which looks like a washing machine is thrashed because a tiny component doesn’t fit anymore.  In this spirit, I am happy to announce that after substantial challenges I was able to install Linux on a 32-bit laptop from about 15 years ago.  First I tried Ubuntu, but I was saddened to learn that they dropped support for 32-bit platforms.  Luckily, Debian still supports it for a number of years, and I went for it.  The incidents I had during the installation include missing non-free firmware for the wifi which I had to fetch and stick in random places in the USB stick, and an inexplicable failure of the base installation which can be fixed by mounting the USB stick during it.</p>



<p>When you say these things, you get the familiar shrug which means “In the same time you spent doing this I can write a grant proposal and make enough money to buy two new machines.”  While this is true, it does not mean it is the right thing to do.  We should strive to prolong the life of computers and their components indefinitely, instead of taking pride in showing off the latest gadget purchase.  I am writing this post from an Ubuntu system installed on a 2008 desktop.</p>



<p>Uncharacteristically, I see a bright future in this domain.  We can store drivers for every hardware configuration ever assembled, and create easy-to-use installation packages.  Moreover, all of this can be automated, while we still are at the stage where human intervention is required.  And one thing that gives me a lot of hope and continues to impress me is the amazing network of people that are willing to help each other to get computers to work, especially when they run free software.  You can have the most technical question and quickly get — for free — the most caring and expert advice, say by posting on <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">stackexachange</a>.</p></div>

<p>Some <a href="https://academicpositions.com/ad/bocconi-university/2021/assistant-professor-of-computer-science/172733">details are here</a>. Candidates must apply online by January 15 (end of day Central Europe time) for the application to be considered. To apply online, go to <a href="https://jobmarket.unibocconi.eu/">https://jobmarket.unibocconi.eu/</a> and look at the only opening that has a Jan 15 expiration (currently it is at the top of the list). The negotiable start date is September, 2022. By that time the new Computing Sciences department will be fully operational.</p>



<p>We are interested in all areas of computer science. <a href="https://www.alonrosen.net/">Alon Rosen</a>, <a href="http://www.dirkhovy.com/index.php">Dirk Hovy</a> and I are very happy to talk to prospective candidates about what the university is like and what are its plans for developing computer science.</p>



<p>The university pays internationally competitive salary and provides relocation assistance. The language of instructions of all computer science courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels is English.</p>



<p>Scholars of any nationality who have not lived in Italy for the past two years and who move to Italy to take a university tenure-track or tenured position pay almost no income tax for six years, or more if they buy a home in Italy and/or have children under the age of 18.</p>



<p>For Italians working in Italy: this position is governed by a private-law contract with Bocconi, which is not the same as a RDTA or RDTB position, although the terms are similar. </p>



<p>Subject to a successful mid-term review (which usually happens after three years), and a successful tenure review (which happens within five years from the mid-term review, or possibly earlier depending on the background of the candidate), assistant professors are promoted to associate professors with tenure. (For those familiar with the Italian system, the latter positions are fully recognized as professore associato by the ministry of university.)</p></div>

<p>
Today we introduce some of what their papers are about.<br/>
<span id="more-19459"/></p>
<p>
We covered material <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/04/a-quantum-connection-for-matrix-rank/">related</a> to <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/10/net-zero-graphs/">graph</a> states a few times before the pandemic, <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/17/contraction-and-explosion/">going</a> in the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/08/26/a-matroid-quantum-connection/">direction</a> of <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/02/11/using-negative-nodes-to-count/">matroid</a> theory.

<p>
Wehner was the advisor of Dahlberg and Helsen, and she was in turn a student of Harry Buhrman at CWI Amsterdam, where Helsen is now. Wehner’s <a href="https://qutech.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CV-Wehner-June-2021.pdf">CV</a> lists one of her jobs prior to graduate study as “Hacker” for ITSX BV in Amsterdam, a fact used in the lead sentence in a 2018 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01835-3">news feature</a> in <em>Nature</em> on work toward a quantum Internet. Both that and her Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Wehner">page</a> call her a theoretical physicist. We would claim her for theoretical computer science. </p>
<p>
Amid the entanglement of fields, a key point is that simple problems about simple graphs govern blueprints for vast networking technology that we can now only conceive. Is all this simple enough to introduce in a short post? We’ll see.</p>
<p>

</p><p/><h2> Entanglement Examples </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
If we start with the graph <img alt="{K_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with just one edge on <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> nodes, then the quantum graph state is given by the first column of the matrix <img alt="{\mathsf{E}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> above: <img alt="{|K_2\rangle = \frac{1}{2}[1,1,1,-1]^T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK_2%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5B1%2C1%2C1%2C-1%5D%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If we follow with a single Hadamard gate on line <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then the state becomes </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[1,0,0,1]^T = \frac{|00\rangle + |11\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%5B1%2C0%2C0%2C1%5D%5ET+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%7C00%5Crangle+%2B+%7C11%5Crangle%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>This is the <em>Bell pair</em>. Named after John Bell, which is the simplest entangled state. If we say that the first qubit is held by “Alice” and the second by “Bob,” then Alice and Bob are entangled. For any <img alt="{n \geq 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the state <img alt="{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0^n\rangle + |1^n\rangle)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%28%7C0%5En%5Crangle+%2B+%7C1%5En%5Crangle%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger_state">GHZ state</a> after Daniel Greenberger, Michael Horne, and Anton Zeilinger, has the maximum possible entanglement among <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> qubits by several quantitative measures. </p>
<p>
Now let us add interactions with two more qubits held by “Charlie” and “Donna” in the form of the cycle graph <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/01/05/quantum-graph-theory/abcd/" rel="attachment wp-att-19467"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19467" height="130" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ABCD.png?resize=168%2C130&amp;ssl=1" width="168"/></a></p>
<p>
Questions that we can ask include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Are Alice and Bob entangled? Or Alice and Charlie? <p/>
</li><li>
Do they have less entanglement than a Bell pair? <p/>
</li><li>
Do the four parties together have as much entanglement as the <img alt="{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-qubit GHZ state?
</li></ol>
<p>
The answers to the first two questions are, “it depends.” Absent any knowledge of what Charlie and Donna do with their qubits, the status of Alice and Bob is conveyed by the <img alt="{4 \times 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <em>density matrix</em> resulting from the <em>partial trace-out</em> of Charlie and Donna. Here is a direct <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2p8dj2pd">shortlink</a> to view it on <em>Quirk</em> under its native “little-endian” qubit order (Donna uppermost), or <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4yd323pt">this</a> to view with Alice uppermost. This gives the <img alt="{4 \times 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> identity matrix, which represents the <em>completely mixed state</em> of two qubits, by which Alice and Bob have two independent classical coins with no entanglement. Regardless of what unitary operations Charlie and Donna do unto themselves, the trace-out remains the same.</p>
<p>
However, if Charlie and Donna <em>measure</em> their qubits, different effects can occur to Alice and Bob depending primarily on <em>how</em> they measure, and secondarily on the measurement results they get. If they both immediately measure in the standard basis, then Alice and Bob “collapse” to one of the four two-qubit basis states, as can be viewed on <em>Quirk</em> using the <em>post-selection</em> widgets “<img alt="{|0 \rangle\langle 0|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C0+%5Crangle%5Clangle+0%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>” and “<img alt="{|1 \rangle\langle 1|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C1+%5Crangle%5Clangle+1%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.” </p>
<p>
Yet if Charlie and Donna each apply one Hadamard gate before their measurement, then Alice and Bob get <img alt="{|K_2\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK_2%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, or something they can make equal to <img alt="{|K_2\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK_2%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by applying one of the Pauli matrices on being told Charlie’s and Donna’s outcomes. A further Hadamard by Alice or Bob then creates the Bell pair, as viewable <a href="https://tinyurl.com/bddz37zj">here</a> (or <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2p8dm9bm">here</a> for a big-endian view).</p>
<p>
To ask about Alice and Charlie, it is most convenient to re-order <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> so that Donna and Bob are consecutive: </p>

Tracing out Donna and Bob now <a href="https://tinyurl.com/26b52vtd">leaves</a> <a href="https://tinyurl.com/5bksjwau">the</a> density matrix <font size="-2"><img alt="{\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+0+%26+0+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+0+%26+0+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+0+%26+0+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+0+%26+0+%26+1+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></font>. This means that Alice and Charlie have classical coins that are fully correlated, but not quantum entanglement. However, if <em>just one</em> of Bob or Donna applies one Hadamard gate before measuring, Alice and Charlie <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4v3h9brv">become</a> a Bell pair (perhaps after a local tweak like the <img alt="{\mathsf{Z}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-gate <a href="https://tinyurl.com/524praur">here</a>). </p>
<p>
We can pose the same questions for other graphs. On the third, given the star <img alt="{S_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with Alice at the center, let her apply one Hadamard gate to her qubit. The <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2cmmdp4r">result</a> is the GHZ state. </p>
<p>
Given <img alt="{K_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we can do the same by involving two more gates: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{S} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; i \end{bmatrix},\qquad \mathsf{V} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} 1+i &amp; 1-i \\ 1-i &amp; 1+i \end{bmatrix}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BS%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+i+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%2C%5Cqquad+%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1%2Bi+%26+1-i+%5C%5C+1-i+%26+1%2Bi+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
These obey the identities <img alt="{\mathsf{S}^2 = \mathsf{Z}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BS%7D%5E2+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{\mathsf{V} = \mathsf{HSH}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BHSH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and so </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{V}^2 = \mathsf{HSHHSH} = \mathsf{HSSH} = \mathsf{HZH} = \mathsf{X}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D%5E2+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BHSHHSH%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BHSSH%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BHZH%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BX%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
Thus <img alt="{\mathsf{V}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is also written <img alt="{\mathsf{X^{1/2}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BX%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as by <em>Quirk</em>. Applications of these along with Hadamard and the Pauli matrices on any one qubit generate the <em>local Clifford group</em>. Now let three of the qubits do <img alt="{\mathsf{V}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> while the fourth does <img alt="{\mathsf{S}^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BS%7D%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> followed by <img alt="{\mathsf{H}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yrjrr57r">result</a> is again the GHZ state. The same tricks work with <img alt="{S_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{K_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for any <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>
Can we get the GHZ state from the cycle <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? The answer is <em>no</em>. This leads into the basic quantum connection to graphs.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Neighborhood Flip </h2><p/>

The upshot is that because the graph states of <img alt="{K_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and the star <img alt="{S_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can each produce the GHZ state, they can produce each other. The graph operation that does this is to choose one node <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and for every pair <img alt="{j,k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%2Ck%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of neighbors of <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>:</p>

If Alice is chosen in the graph at right after Donna’s flip, then Charlie is disconnected from Bob and Donna but Bob and Donna are connected. The edges to Alice do not change, so we get a triangle of Alice-Bob-Donna plus the edge Alice-Charlie. </p>

<p>
What gives this power is that <em>every</em> local quantum transformation of graph states arises this way. This was proved in a 2004 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308151">paper</a> by Maarten Van den Nest, Jeroen Dehaene, and Bart De Moor, among <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0307130.pdf">several</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0004051">related</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301052">papers</a> leading to a long 2006 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0602096.pdf">synthesis</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em><a name="flip"/> A graph state <img alt="{|G\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CG%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be converted to a graph state <img alt="{|G'\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CG%27%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by local Clifford operations if and only if <img alt="{G \sim_{F} G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Csim_%7BF%7D+G%27%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The star and complete graphs go only to each other, though the center of the star can be moved to any vertex. This answers the last section’s question about <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
Hence the entanglement in <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is different from that of the four-qubit GHZ state from the standpoint of local Clifford conversions.  It is further known that no local unitary operations can convert them.</p>

The new papers, in particular <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05305.pdf">this</a> by Dahlberg and Wehner, complete the above-mentioned earlier work to prove the following extension of Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#flip">1</a>.

</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
In our example of entangling Alice and Charlie in <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, Donna’s applying <img alt="{\mathsf{H}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and then measuring left Alice and Charlie connected only to Bob. Bob’s <em>not</em> applying <img alt="{\mathsf{H}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> before measuring was the same as applying it twice, first to flip Alice and Charlie into being connected, and then to drop himself out. Donna and Bob still needed to communicate their measurement results in order for Alice and Charlie to choose exactly the operations that produce the state <img alt="{|K_2\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK_2%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </p>
<p>
This opens the possibility of creating new entanglements by adding a node, flipping some neighborhoods, then deleting it. For example, neither <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> nor <img alt="{K_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can work itself into two entangled pairs by local means, because <img alt="{\sim_{F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_%7BF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> cannot disconnect a graph. Suppose we invite Eve not to eavesdrop but to slot between Bob and Charlie in the path graph shown at left below.</p>

<p/><p><br/>
Bob and Charlie do neighborhood flips that connect Eve to Alice and Donna as well. This yields the bowtie graph in the middle. Then Eve can measure and step away, leaving Alice-Bob and Charlie-Donna as separate couples.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The New Hardness Results </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In 1991, before the quantum connection was visible, André Bouchet <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01275668">showed</a> that whether two <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-vertex graphs are equivalent under <img alt="{\sim_F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is polynomial-time decidable. The corresponding quantum problem about graph states is part-and-parcel with simulation questions for the larger class of <em>stabilizer states</em>, which we have also covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/04/a-quantum-connection-for-matrix-rank/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/10/net-zero-graphs/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
But once deletion is allowed, Dahlberg, Helsen, and Wehner show that the feasible picture changes—at least when the target graph is on a fixed set of vertices.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 4</b> <em> Given <img alt="{G = (V,E)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%3D+%28V%2CE%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{G' = (V',E')}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27+%3D+%28V%27%2CE%27%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with <img alt="{V' \subset V}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%27+%5Csubset+V%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (but not necessarily <img alt="{E' \subset E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27+%5Csubset+E%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), the problem of whether <img alt="{G' \leq_F G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27+%5Cleq_F+G%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete.

</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The disjoint edges are on prescribed pairs of vertices. They also show hardness when both graphs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_graph">circle graphs</a>, a subclass on which many other <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete problems become polynomial-time decidable. In consequence:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 5</b> <em> It is <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-hard to decide whether an <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-qubit graph state can be converted into a GHZ state on a given subset of the qubits, or into Bell pairs on designated pairs of qubits, by local unitary operations, measurements, and classical communication. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The fifth paper contains a further surprise. Even though the decision problem of <img alt="{\sim_F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> belongs to <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (indeed, to a subclass defined by parity and linear algebra), the associated counting problem is hard.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 6</b> <em> Given a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, counting the number of labeled graphs equivalent to <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> under <img alt="{\sim_F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_F%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Again the completeness holds under restriction to circle graphs, which furnish machinery for the proof that connects to other linear- and group-algebraic constructs important to quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>
What does the hardness mean? One takeaway is that shortcuts with multi-variable polynomials that suffice to simulate quantum graph-state and stabilizer circuits may not extend nicely to describe entanglement and how it is affected by measurement. Another is that various other problems about quantifying and channeling quantum entanglement are likely to be hard as well. To pick up one theme we took from Lance Fortnow in our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/31/make-a-trillion-dollars/">post</a>, the decision hardness channels questions about approximate optimization and heuristic most-case solving. Can entanglement be moved around a network and delivered to clients on demand, at what practical cost and loss of quantum coherence? I’ve tried to hint at such wider quantitative problems in the third section.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What other areas of graph theory may be enriched by the quantum connection? The role of vertex deletion makes us think of the graph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_conjecture">reconstruction</a> conjecture in particular. Can results on minors in this 2019 <a href="http://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/771369/files/771369.pdf">dissertation</a> extend to show that the <img alt="{\sim_F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> relation is <em>reconstructible</em>? There are other uses of graphs in quantum mechanics, even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schild's_Ladder">novel</a> about them.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
For a footnote, the double-<img alt="{\oplus}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Coplus%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> construction can be added to the <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/CQuIC/Qcircuit/">Qcircuit.tex</a> macro package by including the two lines</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Happy 2022 everyone! We now cover the last papers of 2021. Our readers have pointed out a number of papers from previous months that we missed (sorry). To adequately cover (and publicize) these papers, we’ve decided to just incorporate those papers on this post rather than update previous posts. </p>



<p>We have a breakthrough on Locally Testable Codes, sublinear algorithms for testing pattern freeness, new thoughts on convexity testing, and a perspective on sampling community structure. And here’s the final list for 2021.</p>



<p><strong>Locally Testable Codes with constant rate, distance, and locality</strong> by Irit Dinur, Shai Evra, Ron Livne, Alexander Lubotzky, and Shahar Mozes (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/151/">ECCC</a>, posted Nov 2021). A Locally Testable Code (LTC) is one where the set of codewords has a property tester. The study of LTCs started with the PCP theorem, but blossomed into a deep research agenda. The holy grail is a \(c^3\)-LTC: one with constant rate, constant distance, and constant query property tester. Just to recall, the rate \(r \in (0,1)\) is the ratio of the message length to the encoding length. The distance \(\delta \in (0,1)\) is the (normalized) Hamming distance between codewords (we typically expect this to be constant for an error correcting code). And, most familiar to us, \(q\) is the number of queries required to property test codewords. The aim is to get all these parameters to be constants independent of the message length. The classic linearity test of BLR basically proves that the Hadamard code is 3-query testable. But the Hadamard code has poor (exponentially small) rate. Low-degree tests prove that Reed-Muller codes are constant-query testable, but they have inverse polynomial rate. Further work constructed LTCs with inverse polylogarithmic rate, meaning that the encoding has length \(n\cdot poly(\log n)\) for message length \(n\). There was even some belief that any LTC must have a rate going to zero. This paper invalidates that belief, and gives a truly \(c^3\)-construction. The construction is based on a 2-dimensional simplicial complex based on Cayley graphs. This is basically a graph with hyperedges corresponding to “squares” of vertices. Concurrent and independent work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09271.pdf">Breuckmann-Ebedhardt</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03654">Panteleev-Kalachev</a> also have similar constructions, though their perspective is of quantum codes.</p>



<p><strong>On the Locally Testable Code of Dinur et al. (2021)</strong> by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/175/">ECCC</a>). As the title says, this short paper gives a high level discussion of the previous result. It abstracts out some of the graph theoretic aspects, to explain connections to more combinatorial constructions. The construction and analysis is based on expander codes. These codes (e.g. low-density parity check, LDPC codes) have constant rate and distance, but we do not know how to test them. A string far from a codeword might only fail on (say) one parity check constraint. Interpreting the Dinur et al as an expander code, we essentially get a collection of correlated parity constraints. Hence, a string that is far from a codeword violates many constraints, leading to a tester. (Of course, this is an extremely watered down version of the analysis idea.) The construction takes two Cayley graphs on a non-Abelian group (which form the vertices). Specific 4-cycles in this graph (together with a constant sized tensor code) are used to make the final codewords.</p>



<p><strong>Strongly Sublinear Algorithms for Testing Pattern Freeness</strong> by Ilan Newman and Nithin Varma (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04856">arXiv</a>, posted Jun 2021). Pattern freeness is a major generalization of monotonicity testing. The input is (query access to) a function \(f: [n] \mapsto \mathbb{R}\). Let \(\pi: [k] \mapsto [k]\) be a permutation. The input is \(pi\)-free if no restriction of \(f\) to \(k\) elements induces the permutation \(pi\). <a href="http://cs.haifa.ac.il/~ilan/online-papers/permutations.pdf">Newman-Rabinovich-Rajendraprasad-Sohler</a> introduced this problem. When \(k=2\), this property is precisely monotonicity, for which (many) \(O(\varepsilon^{-1} \log n)\) property testers are known. Is such a bound achievable for \(k \geq 3\)? Interestingly, for non-adaptive algorithms, an optimal bound of \(\Theta(n^{1-1/(k-1)})\) (ignoring, \(\varepsilon, k\) dependencies) was achieved by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10660">Ben-Eliezer and Canonne</a>. This papers shows that there is an adaptive algorithm that makes \(n^{o(1)}\) queries, thereby proving a separation between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms. A key idea is to visualize the input as a set of points in the plane, and construct a coarse grid that partitions the points. There is a highly non-trivial case analysis on top of this that leads to a \(O(\sqrt{n})\)-query algorithm (this already beats the non-adaptive lower bound).</p>



<p><strong>Parameterized Convexity Testing</strong> by Abhiruk Lahiri, Ilan Newman, and Nithin Varma (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13012">arXiv</a>, posted Oct 2021). Given a function \(f:[n] \mapsto \mathbb{R}\), the property of interest is (discrete) convexity. The discrete derivatives should be monotonically non-decreasing. It is known that there is a \(O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log n)\) query non-adaptive tester for this property. This paper studies this problem from the perspective of parameterized property testing, where the range is restricted. The main result is that if the number of distinct discrete derivates is at most \(s\), there is a \(O(\varepsilon^{-1} \log s)\) query non-adaptive tester. Moreover, this bound is optimal even for adaptive algorithms. This picture parallels that of monotonicity. Interestingly, when there are only two distinct discrete derivatives, the tester can be made deterministic.</p>



<p><strong>Modularity and edge sampling</strong> by Colin McDiarmid and Fiona Skerman (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13190">arXiv</a>). Not your typical sublinear algorithms paper, but certainly of interest to us. The main problem is to understand when a random samples of edges in a graph can reveal information about the “community structure”. The modularity of a graph is a measure of this structure. Essentially, a partition has low modularity if the number of edges crossing the partition is close to that of a random graph with the same degree distribution. A partition of high modularity has significant fewer edges, and is thus a valid “clustering” of the graph. The modularity of the graph is obtained by maximizing over partitions. (The normalization of modularity is chosen so that the partition generally has a constant number of sets.) This paper proves a concentration inequality for the modularity of a constant sample of uniform random edges. The modularity of a sample of \(\Theta(\varepsilon^{-5})\) edges is an additive \(\varepsilon\)-approximation of the overall modularity, whp.</p></div>

    <summary>We give a new characterization of the Sherali-Adams proof system, showing that there is a degree-$d$ Sherali-Adams refutation of an unsatisfiable CNF formula $C$ if and only if there is an $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and a degree-$d$ conical junta $J$ such that $viol_C(x) - \varepsilon = J$, where $viol_C(x)$ counts the number of falsified clauses of $C$ on an input $x$. Using this result we show that the linear separation complexity, a complexity measure recently studied by Hrubeš (and independently by de Oliveira Oliveira and Pudlák under the name of weak monotone linear programming gates), monotone feasibly interpolates Sherali-Adams proofs; this sharpens a recent feasible interpolation result due to Hakoniemi.

We then investigate separation results for $viol_C(x) - \varepsilon$. In particular, we give a family of unsatisfiable CNF formulas $C$ which have polynomial-size and small-width resolution proofs, but for which any representation of $viol_C(x) - 1$ by a conical junta requires degree $\Omega(n)$; this resolves an open question of Filmus, Mahajan, Sood, and Vinyals. Since Sherali-Adams can simulate resolution, this separates the non-negative degree of $viol_C(x) - 1$ and $viol_C(x) - \varepsilon$ for arbitrarily small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Finally, by applying lifting theorems, we translate this lower bound into new separation results between extension complexity and monotone circuit complexity.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Deal friends,</p>



<p><br/>We are happy to announce the third edition of the conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography (ITC). Information-theoretic cryptography studies security in the presence of computationally unbounded adversaries and covers a wide array of topics at the intersection of cryptography, coding theory, information theory and theory of computation. Notable examples include randomness extraction and privacy amplification, secret sharing,  secure multiparty computation and proof systems, private-information retrieval and locally decodable codes, authentication codes and non-malleable codes, differential privacy, quantum information processing, and information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security.</p>



<p><br/>See <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The conference will have two tracks: a conference track and a spotlight track. The conference track will operate like a traditional conference with the usual review process and published proceedings. The spotlight track consists of invited talks (not included in the proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in the area. We are soliciting nominations for spotlight talks from the community. (See the Call for Papers.)</p>



<p>ITC2022 will take place on July 5-7, 2022 in Boston, MA. We are planning for a hybrid online/in-person event.  The submission deadline is <strong>Jan 10, 2022</strong> and the call for papers (including a nomination procedure for the spotlight track) is available here: <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2022/2022cfp.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io/2022/2022cfp.html</a>.</p>

<p>One week ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a>—the legendary naturalist and conservationist, and man who was universally acknowledged to know more about ants than anyone else in human history—passed away at age 92.  A mere three days later, <em>Scientific American</em>—or more precisely, the zombie clickbait rag that now flaunts that name—published a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-complicated-legacy-of-e-o-wilson/">shameful hit-piece</a>, smearing Wilson for his “racist ideas” without, incredibly, so much as a single quote from Wilson, or any other attempt to substantiate its libel (see also <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/12/30/scientific-american-does-an-asinine-hit-job-on-e-o-wilson-calling-him-a-racist/">this response by Jerry Coyne</a>).  <em>SciAm</em>‘s <em>Pravda</em>-like attack included the following extraordinary sentence, which I thought worthy of <a href="https://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html">Alan Sokal’s <em>Social Text</em> hoax</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The so-called normal distribution of statistics assumes that there are default humans who serve as the standard that the rest of us can be accurately measured against.</p></blockquote>



<p>There are intellectually honest people who don’t know what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> is.  There are no intellectually honest people who, not knowing what it is, figure that it must be something racist.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Laura Helmuth, the editor-in-chief now running <em>SciAm</em> into the ground, <a href="https://twitter.com/laurahelmuth/status/1476531766118682625">described</a> her magazine’s calumny against Wilson as “insightful” (the replies, including from Richard Dawkins, are fun to read).  I suppose it was as “insightful” as <em>SciAm</em>‘s <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eric-lander-is-not-the-ideal-choice-for-presidential-science-adviser/">disgraceful attack</a> last year on Eric Lander, President Biden’s ultra-competent science advisor and a leader in the war on COVID, for … being a white male, which appears to have been E. O. Wilson’s crime as well.  (Think I must be misrepresenting the “critique” of Lander?  Read it!)</p>



<p>Anyway, in response to <em>Scientific American</em>‘s libel of Wilson, I wrote on my Facebook that I’ll no longer agree to write for or be interviewed by them (you can read my old stuff free of charge <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/The_Limits_of_Quantum_Computers.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">here</a>), unless and until there’s a complete change of editorial direction.  I encourage all other scientists to commit likewise, thereby making it common knowledge that the entity that now calls itself “Scientific American” bears the same relation to the legendary home of Martin Gardner as does a corpse to a living being.  Fortunately, there are high-quality online venues (e.g., <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta</a></em>) that partly fill the role that <em>Scientific American</em> abdicated.</p>



<p>After reading my Facebook post, my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/curiouswavefn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ashutosh Jogalekar</a> was inspired to post an essay of his own.  Ashutosh used to write regularly for <em>Scientific American</em>, until he was fired seven years ago over a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/richard-feynman-sexism-and-changing-perceptions-of-a-scientific-icon/">column</a> in which he advocated acknowledging Richard Feynman’s flaws, including his arrogance and casual sexism, but also understanding those flaws within the context of Feynman’s whole life, including the tragic death of his first wife Arlene.  (Yes, that was really it!  Read the piece!)  Below, I’m sharing Ashutosh’s moving essay about E. O. Wilson with Ashutosh’s very generous permission. —<em>Scott Aaronson</em></p>

<p><strong>Guest Post by Ashutosh Jogalekar</strong></p>



<p>As some know, I was “fired” from Scientific American in 2014 for three “controversial” posts (among 200 that I had written for the magazine).  When I parted from the magazine I chalked up my departure to an unfortunate misunderstanding more than anything else.  I still respected some of the writers at the publication, and while I wore my separation as a badge of honor and in retrospect realized its liberating utility in enabling me to greatly expand my topical range, I occasionally still felt bad and wished things had gone differently.</p>



<p>No more.  Now the magazine has done me a great favor by allowing me to wipe the slate of my conscience clean. What happened seven years ago was not just a misunderstanding but clearly one of many first warning signs of a calamitous slide into a decidedly unscientific, irrational and ideology-ridden universe of woke extremism.  Its logical culmination two days ago was an absolutely shameless, confused, fact-free and purely ideological hit job on someone who wasn’t just a great childhood hero of mine but a leading light of science, literary achievement, humanism and biodiversity.  While Ed (E. O.) Wilson’s memory was barely getting cemented only days after his death, the magazine published an op-ed calling him a racist, a hit job endorsed and cited by the editor-in-chief as “insightful”.  One of the first things I did after reading the piece was buy a few Wilson books that weren’t part of my collection.</p>



<p>Ed Wilson was one of the gentlest, most eloquent, most brilliant and most determined advocates for both human and natural preservation you could find.  Under Southern charm lay hidden unyielding doggedness and immense stamina combined with a missionary zeal to communicate the wonders of science to both his fellow biologists and the general public.  His autobiography, “Naturalist”, is perhaps the finest, most literary statement of the scientific life I have read; it was one of a half dozen books that completely transported me when I read it in college.  In book after book of wide-ranging intellectual treats threading through a stunning diversity of disciplines, he sent out clarion calls for saving the planet, for enabling dialogue between the natural and the social sciences, for understanding each other better. In the face of unprecedented challenges to our fragile environment and continued barriers to interdisciplinary communication, this is work that likely will make him go down in history as one of the most important human beings who ever lived, easily of the same caliber and achievement as John Muir or Thoreau.  Even in terms of achievement strictly defined by accolades – the National Medal of Science, the Crafoord Prize which recognizes fields excluded by the Nobel Prize, and not just one but two Pulitzer Prizes – few scientists from any field in the 20th century can hold a candle to Ed Wilson.  My friend Richard Rhodes who knew Wilson for decades as a close and much-admired friend said that there wasn’t a racist bone in his body; Dick should know since he just came out with a first-rate biography of Wilson weeks before his passing.</p>



<p>The writer who wrote that train wreck is a professor of nursing at UCSF named Monica McLemore.  That itself is a frightening fact and should tell everyone how much ignorance has spread itself in our highest institutions.  She not only maligned and completely misrepresented Wilson but did not say a word about his decades-long, heroic effort to preserve the planet and our relationship with it; it was clear that she had little acquaintance with Wilson’s words since she did not cite any.  It’s also worth noting the gaping moral blindness in her article which completely misses the most moral thing Wilson did – spend decades advocating for saving our planet and averting a catastrophe of extinction, climate change and divisiveness – and instead focuses completely on his non-existent immorality.  This is a pattern that is consistently found among those urging “social justice” or “equity” or whatever else: somehow they seem to spend all their time talking about fictional, imagined immorality while missing the real, flesh-and-bones morality that is often the basis of someone’s entire life’s work.</p>



<p>In the end, the simple fact is that McLemore didn’t care about any of this.  She didn’t care because she had a political agenda and the facts did not matter to her, even facts as basic as the definition of the normal distribution in statistics.  For her, Wilson was some obscure white male scientist who was venerated, and that was reason enough for a supposed “takedown”.  And the editor of <em>Scientific American</em> supported and lauded this ignorant, ideology-driven tirade.</p>



<p>Ironically, Wilson would have found this ideological hit job all too familiar. After he wrote his famous book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sociobiology-Synthesis-Edward-Wilson-ebook/dp/B00L9XW7Q2">Sociobiology</a></em> in the 1970s, a volume in which, in a single chapter about human beings, he had the temerity to suggest that maybe, just maybe, human beings operate with the same mix of genes that other creatures do, the book was met by a disgraceful, below-the-belt, ideological response from Wilson’s far left colleagues Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould who hysterically compared his arguments to thinking that was well on its way down the slippery slope to that dark world where lay the Nazi gas chambers. The gas chamber analogy is about the only thing that’s missing from the recent hit job, but the depressing thing is that we are fighting the same battles in 2021 that Wilson fought forty years before, although turbocharged this time by armies of faithful zombies on social media. The sad thing is that Wilson is no longer around to defend himself, although I am not sure he would have bothered with a piece as shoddy as this one.</p>



<p>The complete intellectual destruction of a once-great science magazine is now clear as day.  No more should <em>Scientific American</em> be regarded as a vehicle for sober scientific views and liberal causes but as a political magazine with clearly stated ideological biases and an aversion to facts, an instrument of a blinkered woke political worldview that brooks no dissent. Scott Aaronson has taken a principled stand and said that after this proverbial last straw on the camel’s back, he will no longer write for the magazine or do interviews for them.  I applaud Scott’s decision, and with his expertise it’s a decision that actually matters.  As far as I am concerned, I now mix smoldering fury at the article with immense relief: the last seven years have clearly shown that leaving <em>Scientific American</em> in 2014 was akin to leaving the Soviet Union in the 1930s just before Stalin appointed Lysenko head biologist.  I could not have asked for a happier expulsion and now feel completely vindicated and free of any modicum of regret I might have felt.</p>



<p>To my few friends and colleagues who still write for the magazine and whose opinions I continue to respect, I really wish to ask: Why?  Is writing for a magazine which has sacrificed facts and the liberal voice of real science at the altar of political ideology and make believe still worth it?  What would it take for you to say no more?  As Oscar Wilde would say, one mistake like this is a mistake, two seems more like carelessness; in the roster of the last few years, this is “mistake” 100+, signaling that it’s now officially approved policy.  Do you think that being an insider will allow you to salvage the reputation of the magazine?  If you think that way, you are no different from the one or two moderate Republicans who think they can still salvage the once-great party of Lincoln and Eisenhower.  Both the GOP and <em>Scientific American</em> are beyond redemption from where I stand.  Get out, start your own magazine or join another, one which actually respects liberal, diverse voices and scientific facts; let us applaud you for it.  You deserve better, the world deserves better.  And Ed Wilson’s memory sure as hell deserves better.</p>

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (from Scott):</span></strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29778348">See here</a> for the Hacker News thread about this post.  I was amused by the conjunction of two themes: (1) people who were uncomfortable with my and Ashutosh’s expression of strong emotions, and (2) people who actually clicked through to the <em>SciAm</em> hit-piece, and then reported back to the others that the strong emotions were completely, 100% justified in this case.</p></div>

    <title>Did Betty White  die in 2021?/Why do people have their `end-of-the-year' lists before the end of the year?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> I am looking at Parade Magazine's issue whose cover story is</p><p>                                          <i>We say goodbye to the stars we lost in 2021.</i></p><p>The date on the magazine is Dec 19-26. Betty White is not in it. Neither is Bishop Tutu. Why not? Maybe they did not die in 2021. No, that's not it.  They died after the magazine appeared. They also won't be in the issue a year from now which has cover story </p><p>                                          <i>We say goodbye to the stars we lost in 2022.</i></p><p>Why do magazines and TV shows have their <i>end-of-the-year </i>stuff before the end of the year? Because they want to beat the competition? Because they all do it, so its a race-to-the-bottom? Tradition? </p><p>This blog does the same--- we already posted our end-of-the-year post. Every year I worry that someone will prove P=NP or P NE NP between Dec 24 and Jan 1.  We don't have the Betty-White-Problem since the end-of-the-year post is based on when we blogged about it, not when it happened. So if  theorist X died on Dec 27 then we would do the blog obit in Jan, and would mention it in the end-of-the-year post for the next year. (This happened with Martin Kruskal who died on Dec 26, 2006.) </p><p>Why do we have our end-of-the-year post before the end of the year? Tradition! That might not be a good reason.  </p><p>ADDED LATER: Ken Regan in the comments points out that Betty White DID die in 2022 if you use AWE: Anywhere on Earth!</p><p>This leads to the following question:</p><p>a) If a celebrity dies on Dec 31 but its Jan 1 in some time zones then do they get to be in the</p><p>WE SAY GOODBYE TO THE STARS</p><p>articles for the Jan 1 year? </p><p>b) Is there a general rule on this? I doubt it and I doubt it comes up a lot. I noticed that <i>celebrities dying</i> <i>between Dec 24 and Dec 31 don't make those lists </i>about 20 years ago, and I have never seen a Dec 31 case before, though I am sure there have been some.</p><p>c) Note that this `<i>bad to die in that zone'</i> really only applies to minor celebrities.

    <title>TR22-002 |  Extending Merge Resolution to a Family of Proof Systems | 

	Sravanthi Chede, 

	Anil Shukla</title>
    <summary>Merge Resolution (MRes [Beyersdorff et al. J. Autom. Reason.'2021]) is a recently introduced proof system for false QBFs. Unlike other known QBF proof systems, it builds winning strategies for the universal player within the proofs. Every line of this proof system consists of existential clauses along with countermodels. MRes stores the countermodels as merge maps. Merge maps are deterministic branching programs in which isomorphism checking is efficient as a result MRes is a polynomial time verifiable proof system.

In this paper, we introduce a family of proof systems MRes-$\mathcal{R}$ in which, the information of countermodels are stored in any pre-fixed complete representation $\mathcal{R}$, instead of merge maps. Hence corresponding to each possible complete representation $\mathcal{R}$, we have a sound and refutationally complete QBF-proof system in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. To handle arbitrary representations for the strategies, we introduce consistency checking rules in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$ instead of isomorphism checking in MRes. As a result these proof systems are not polynomial time verifiable. Consequently, the paper shows that using merge maps is too restrictive and can be replaced with arbitrary representations leading to several interesting proof systems.

The paper also studies proof theoretic properties of the family of new proof systems MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. We show that eFrege+$\forall$red simulates all valid refutations from proof systems in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. Since proof systems in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$ may use arbitrary representations, in order to simulate them, we first represent the steps used by the proof systems as a new simple complete structure. As a consequence, the corresponding proof system belonging to MRes-$\mathcal{R}$ is able to simulate all proof systems in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. Finally, we simulate this proof system via eFrege+$\forall$red using the ideas from [Chew et al. ECCC.'2021].

On the lower bound side, we lift the lower bound result of regular MRes ([Beyersdorff et al. FSTTCS.'2020]) for all regular proof systems in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. To be precise, we show that the completion principle formulas from [Jonata et al. Theor. Comput. Sci.'2015] which are shown to be hard for regular MRes in [Beyersdorff et al. FSTTCS.'2020], are also hard for any regular proof system in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. Thereby, the paper lifts the lower bound of regular MRes to an entire class of proof systems, which use some complete representation, including those undiscovered, instead of merge maps.</summary>

    <title>TR22-001 |  On (Simple) Decision Tree Rank | 

	Yogesh Dahiya, 

	Meena Mahajan</title>
    <summary>In the decision tree computation model for Boolean functions, the depth corresponds to query complexity, and size corresponds to storage space. The depth measure is the most well-studied one, and is known to be polynomially related to several non-computational complexity measures of functions such as certificate complexity. The size measure is also studied, but to a lesser extent. Another decision tree measure that has received very little attention is the minimal rank of the decision tree, first introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler in 1989. This measure is not polynomially related to depth, and hence it can reveal additional information about the complexity of a function. It is characterised by the value of a Prover-Delayer game first proposed by Pudl{\'a}k and Impagliazzo in the context of tree-like resolution proofs. In this paper we study this measure further. We obtain upper and lower bounds on rank in terms of (variants of) certificate complexity. We also obtain upper and lower bounds on the rank for composed functions in terms of the depth of the outer function and the rank of the inner function. We compute the rank exactly for several natural functions and use them to show that all the bounds we have obtained are tight. We also observe that the size-rank relationship for decision trees, obtained by Ehrenfeucht and  Haussler, is tight upto constant factors.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Happy New Year, everyone!</p>



<p>It was exactly two years ago that it first became publicly knowable—though most of us <em>wouldn’t</em> know for at least two more months—just how freakishly horrible is the branch of the wavefunction we’re on.  I.e., that our branch wouldn’t <em>just</em> include Donald Trump as the US president, but <em>simultaneously</em> a global pandemic far worse than any in living memory, and a world-historically bungled response to that pandemic.</p>



<p>So it’s appropriate that I just finished reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Viral-Search-COVID-19-Matt-Ridley/dp/006313912X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8">Viral: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19</a>, by Broad Institute genetics postdoc Alina Chan and science writer Matt Ridley.  Briefly, I think that this is one of the most important books so far of the twenty-first century.</p>



<p>Of course, speculation and argument about the origin of COVID goes back all the way to that fateful January of 2020, and most of this book’s information was already available in fragmentary form elsewhere.  And by their own judgment, Chan and Ridley don’t end their search with a smoking-gun: no Patient Zero, no Bat Zero, no security-cam footage of the beaker dropped on the Wuhan Institute of Virology floor.  Nevertheless, as far as I’ve seen, this is the first analysis of COVID’s origin to treat the question with the full depth, gravity, and perspective that it deserves.</p>



<p><em>Viral</em> is essentially a 300-page plea to follow every lead as if we actually wanted to get to the bottom of things, and in particular, yes, to take the possibility of a lab leak a hell of a lot more seriously than was publicly permitted in 2020.  (Fortuitously, much of this shift already happened as the authors were writing the book, but in June 2021 I was still <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5542#comment-1893250">sneered at</a> for discussing the lab leak hypothesis on this blog.)  <em>Viral</em> is simultaneously a model of lucid, non-dumbed-down popular science writing and of cogent argumentation.  The authors never once come across like tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorists, railing against the sheeple with their conventional wisdom: they’re simply investigators carefully laying out what they’re confident should <em>become</em> conventional wisdom, with the many uncertainties and error bars explicitly noted.  If you read the book and your mind works anything like mine, be forewarned that you might come out agreeing with a lot of it.</p>



<p>I would say that <em>Viral</em> proves the following propositions beyond reasonable doubt:</p>



<ul><li>Virologists, including at Shi Zhengli’s group at WIV and at Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance, were engaged in <em>unbelievably</em> risky work, including collecting virus-laden fecal samples from thousands of bats in remote caves, transporting them to the dense population center of Wuhan, and modifying them to be more dangerous, e.g., through serial passage through human cells and the insertion of furin cleavage sites.  Years before the COVID-19 outbreak, there were experts remarking on how risky this research was and trying to stop it.  Had they known just <em>how</em> lax the biosecurity was in Wuhan—dangerous pathogens experimented on in BSL-2 labs, etc. etc.—they would have been louder.<br/></li><li>Even if it <em>didn’t</em> cause the pandemic, the massive effort to collect and enhance bat coronaviruses now appears to have been of dubious value.  It did not lead to an actionable early warning about how bad COVID-19 was going to be, nor did it lead to useful treatments, vaccines, or mitigation measures, all of which came from other sources.<br/></li><li>There are multiple routes by which SARS-CoV2, or its progenitor, could’ve made its way, otherwise undetected, from the remote bat caves of Yunnan province or some other southern location to the city of Wuhan a thousand miles away, as it has to do in any plausible origin theory.  Having said that, the regular Yunnan→Wuhan traffic in scientific samples of precisely these kinds of viruses, sustained over a decade, <em>does</em> stand out a bit!  On the infamous coincidence of the pandemic starting practically next door to the world’s center for studying SARS-like coronaviruses, rather than near where the horseshoe bats live in the wild, Chan and Ridley memorably quote Humphrey Bogart’s line from <em>Casablanca</em>: “Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.”<br/></li><li>The seafood market was probably “just” an early superspreader site, rather than the site of the original spillover event.  No bats or pangolins at all, and relatively few mammals of any kind, appear to have been sold at that market, and no sign of SARS-CoV2 was ever found in any of the animals despite searching.<br/></li><li>Most remarkably, <strong>Shi and Daszak have increasingly stonewalled</strong>, refusing to answer 100% reasonable questions from fellow virologists.  They’ve acted more and more like defendants exercising their right to remain silent than like participants in a joint search for the truth.  That might be understandable if they’d already answered ad nauseam and wearied of repeating themselves, but with many crucial questions, they haven’t answered even once.  They’ve refused to make available a key database of all the viruses WIV had collected, which WIV inexplicably took offline in September 2019.  When, in January 2020, Shi disclosed to the world that WIV had collected a virus called RaTG13, which was 96% identical to SARS-CoV2, she didn’t mention that it was collected from a mine in Mojiang, which the WIV had sampled from over and over because six workers had gotten a SARS-like pneumonia there in 2012 and three had died from it.  She didn’t let on that her group had been studying RaTG13 for years—giving, instead, the false impression that they’d just noticed it recently, when searching WIV’s records for cousins of SARS-CoV2.  And she didn’t see fit to mention that WIV had collected <em>eight other</em> coronaviruses resembling SARS-CoV2 from the same mine (!).  Shi’s original papers on SARS-CoV2 also passed in silence over the virus’s furin cleavage site—even though SARS-CoV2 was the first sarbecoronavirus with that feature, and Shi herself had recently demonstrated adding furin cleavage sites to other viruses to make them more transmissible, and the cleavage site would’ve leapt out immediately to any coronavirus researcher as the most interesting feature of SARS-CoV2 and as key to its transmissibility.  Some of these points had to be uncovered by Internet sleuths, poring over doctoral theses and the like, after which Shi would glancingly acknowledge the points in talks without ever explaining her earlier silences.  Shi and Daszak refused to cooperate with Chan and Ridley’s book, and have stopped answering questions more generally.  When people politely ask Daszak about these matters on Twitter, he blocks them.<br/></li><li>The Chinese regime has been every bit as obstructionist as you might expect: destroying samples, blocking credible investigations, censoring researchers, and preventing journalists from accessing the Mojiang mine.  So Shi at least has the excuse that, even if she’d <em>wanted</em> to come clean with everything relevant she knows about WIV’s bat coronavirus work, she might not be able to do so without endangering herself or loved ones.  Daszak has no such excuse.</li></ul>



<p>It’s important to understand that, even in the worst case—that (1) there was a lab leak, and (2) Shi and Daszak are knowingly withholding information relevant to it—they’re far from monsters.  Even in <em>Viral</em>‘s relentlessly unsparing account, they come across as genuine believers in their mission to protect the world from the next pandemic.</p>



<p>And it’s like: imagine devoting your life to that mission, having most of the world refuse to take you seriously, and then the calamity happens exactly like you said … <em>except</em> that, not only did your efforts fail to prevent it, but there’s a live possibility that they <em>caused</em> it.  It’s conceivable that your life’s work managed to save <em>minus</em> 15 million lives and create <em>minus</em> $50 trillion in economic value.</p>



<p>Very few scientists in history have faced that sort of psychic burden, perhaps not even the ones who built the atomic bomb.  I <em>hope</em> I’d maintain my scientific integrity under such an astronomical weight, but I’m doubtful that I would.  Would you?</p>



<p><em>Viral</em> very wisely never tries to psychoanalyze Shi and Daszak.  I fear that one might need a lot of conceptual space between “knowing” and “not knowing,” “suspecting” and “not suspecting,” to do justice to the planet-sized enormity of what’s at stake here.  Suppose, for example, that an initial investigation in January 2020 reassured you that SARS-CoV2 <em>probably</em> hadn’t come from your lab: would you continue trying to get to the bottom of things, or would you thereafter decide the matter was closed?</p>



<p>For all that, I agree with Chan and Ridley that COVID-19 might well have had a zoonotic origin after all.  And one point <em>Viral</em> makes abundantly clear is that, if our goal is to prevent the next pandemic, then resolving the mystery of COVID-19 actually matters less than one might think.  This is because, whichever possibility—zoonotic spillover <em>or</em> lab leak—turns out to be the truth of this case, <strong>the other possibility would remain absolutely terrifying and would demand urgent action as well</strong>.  Read the book and see for yourself.</p>



<p>Searching my inbox, I found an email from April 16, 2020 where I told someone who’d asked me that the lab-leak hypothesis seemed perfectly plausible to me (albeit no <em>more</em> than plausible), that I couldn’t understand why it wasn’t being investigated more, but that I was hesitant to blog about these matters.  As I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5542">wrote</a> seven months ago, I now see my lack of courage on this as having been a personal failing.  Obviously, I’m just a quantum computing theorist, not a biologist, so I don’t <em>have</em> to have any thoughts whatsoever about the origin of COVID-19 … but I <em>did</em> have some, and I didn’t share them here only because of the likelihood that I’d be called an idiot on social media.  Having now read Chan and Ridley, though, I think I’d take being called an idiot for this book review more as a positive signal about my courage than as a negative signal about my reasoning skills!</p>



<p>At one level, <em>Viral</em> stands alongside, I dunno, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eichmann-Jerusalem-Banality-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039881">Eichmann in Jerusalem</a></em> among the saddest books I’ve ever read.  It’s 300 pages of one of the great human tragedies of our lifetime balancing on a hinge between happening and not happening, and we all know how it turns out.  On another level, though, <em>Viral</em> is optimistic.  Like with Richard Feynman’s famous <a href="https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt">“personal appendix”</a> about the Space Shuttle <em>Challenger</em> explosion, the very act of writing such a book reflects a view that you’re still allowed to ask questions; that one or two people armed with nothing but arguments can run rings around governments, newspapers, and international organizations; that we don’t yet live in a post-truth world.</p></div>
