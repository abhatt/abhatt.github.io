<p>Let <img alt="\mathbf{A}_1,\mathbf{A}_2" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_1%2C%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_2" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{A}_1,\mathbf{A}_2"/> be square matrices and <img alt="\mathbf{t}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{t}"/> a row vector such that</p>
<p><img alt="\mathbf{t}\mathbf{A}_1 = x_1 \mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}\mathbf{A}_2 = x_2 \mathbf{t}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_1%20%3D%20x_1%20%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D%2C%20%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_2%20%3D%20x_2%20%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{t}\mathbf{A}_1 = x_1 \mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}\mathbf{A}_2 = x_2 \mathbf{t}"/><br/>
Using high-school algebra lingo, we would refer to <img alt="\mathbf{t}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{t}"/> as the eigenvector of <img alt="\mathbf{A}_1,\mathbf{A}_2" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_1%2C%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_2" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{A}_1,\mathbf{A}_2"/>. It is easy to see that</p>
<p><img alt="\mathbf{t} \cdot (\mathbf{A}_1+\mathbf{A}_2) = (x_1 + x_2)\mathbf{t}, \; t \cdot \mathbf{A}_1 \mathbf{A}_2 = x_1x_2 \mathbf{t}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%28%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_1%2B%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_2%29%20%3D%20%28x_1%20%2B%20x_2%29%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D%2C%20%5C%3B%20t%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_1%20%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_2%20%3D%20x_1x_2%20%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{t} \cdot (\mathbf{A}_1+\mathbf{A}_2) = (x_1 + x_2)\mathbf{t}, \; t \cdot \mathbf{A}_1 \mathbf{A}_2 = x_1x_2 \mathbf{t}"/><br/>
This extends readily to any polynomial <img alt="p(x_1,\ldots,x_n)" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%28x_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_n%29" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="p(x_1,\ldots,x_n)"/>, namely: if <img alt="\mathbf{t} \mathbf{A}_i = x_i \mathbf{t}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D%20%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_i%20%3D%20x_i%20%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{t} \mathbf{A}_i = x_i \mathbf{t}"/>, then</p>
<p><img alt="\mathbf{t} \cdot f(\mathbf{A}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{A}_n) = f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mathbf{t}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D%20%5Ccdot%20f%28%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_1%2C%5Cldots%2C%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_n%29%20%3D%20f%28x_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_n%29%20%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{t} \cdot f(\mathbf{A}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{A}_n) = f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mathbf{t}"/><br/>
As in turns out, much of advanced lattice-based crypto boils down to a generalization of this statement! The generalization is along two orthogonal dimensions:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>arbitrary matrices <img alt="\mathbf{A}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{A}_n" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_1%2C%5Cldots%2C%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_n" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{A}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{A}_n"/> that may not share the same eigenvector <img alt="\mathbf{t}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{t}"/>, and</li>
<li>a relaxation to “approximate” equality, namely <img alt="\mathbf{t} \mathbf{A}_i \approx x_i \mathbf{t}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D%20%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D_i%20%5Capprox%20x_i%20%5Cmathbf%7Bt%7D" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="\mathbf{t} \mathbf{A}_i \approx x_i \mathbf{t}"/>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The generalization underlies fully homomorphic encryption, homomorphic signatures, attribute-based encryption schemes and many more!</p>

    <title>Faster Divergence Maximization for Faster Maximum Flow</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1584662400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Liu:Yang_P=.html">Yang P. Liu</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sidford:Aaron.html">Aaron Sidford</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08929">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we provide an algorithm which given any $m$-edge $n$-vertex
directed graph with integer capacities at most $U$ computes a maximum $s$-$t$
flow for any vertices $s$ and $t$ in $m^{4/3+o(1)}U^{1/3}$ time. This improves
upon the previous best running times of $m^{11/8+o(1)}U^{1/4}$ (Liu Sidford
2019), $\tilde{O}(m \sqrt{n} \log U)$ (Lee Sidford 2014), and $O(mn)$ (Orlin
2013) when the graph is not too dense or has large capacities.
</p>
<p>To achieve the results this paper we build upon previous algorithmic
approaches to maximum flow based on interior point methods (IPMs). In
particular, we overcome a key bottleneck of previous IPMs applying to maxflow
(M\k{a}dry 2013, M\k{a}dry 2016, Cohen M\k{a}dry Sankowski Vladu 2017, Liu
Sidford 2019, Axiotis M\k{a}dry Vladu 2020), which make progress by maximizing
the energy of local $\ell_2$ norm minimizing electric flows. We generalize this
approach and instead maximize the divergence of flows which minimize the
Bregman divergence distance with respect to the weighted logarithmic barrier.
This allows our algorithm to depend on the $\ell_\infty$ norm as opposed to the
$\ell_4$ norm when bounding the amount of weight perturbation needed. Further,
we show that smoothed $\ell_2$-$\ell_p$ flows (Kyng, Peng, Sachdeva, Wang
2019), which we previously used to efficiently maximize energy (Liu Sidford
2019), can also be used to efficiently maximize divergence, thereby yielding
our desired runtimes. We believe both this generalized view of energy
maximization and generalized flow solvers we develop may be of further
interest.

    <title>Minimum Scan Cover with Angular Transition Costs</title>

motivated by questions in the context of satellite communication and
astrophysics. In the problem Minimum Scan Cover with Angular Costs (MSC), we
are given a graph $G$ that is embedded in Euclidean space. The edges of $G$
need to be scanned, i.e., probed from both of their vertices. In order to scan
their edge, two vertices need to face each other; changing the heading of a
vertex takes some time proportional to the corresponding turn angle. Our goal
is to minimize the time until all scans are completed, i.e., to compute a
schedule of minimum makespan.
</p>
<p>We show that MSC is closely related to both graph coloring and the minimum
(directed and undirected) cut cover problem; in particular, we show that the
minimum scan time for instances in 1D and 2D lies in $\Theta(\log \chi (G))$,
while for 3D the minimum scan time is not upper bounded by $\chi (G)$. We use
this relationship to prove that the existence of a constant-factor
approximation implies $P=NP$, even for one-dimensional instances. In 2D, we
show that it is NP-hard to approximate a minimum scan cover within less than a
factor of $\frac{3}{2}$, even for bipartite graphs; conversely, we present a
$\frac{9}{2}$-approximation algorithm for this scenario. Generally, we give an
$O(c)$-approximation for $k$-colored graphs with $k\leq \chi(G)^c$. For general
metric cost functions, we provide approximation algorithms whose performance
guarantee depend on the arboricity of the graph.

    <title>The Strahler number of a parity game</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1584662400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Daviaud:Laure.html">Laure Daviaud</a>, Marcin Jurdziński, K. S. Thejaswini <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08627">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The Strahler number of a rooted tree is the largest height of a perfect
binary tree that is its minor. The Strahler number of a parity game is proposed
to be defined as the smallest Strahler number of the tree of any of its
attractor decompositions. It is proved that parity games can be solved in
quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the number of vertices~$n$
and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $d$ is the number of priorities and $k$ is
the Strahler number. This complexity is quasi-polynomial because the Strahler
number is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. The proof is based on
a new construction of small Strahler-universal trees.
</p>
<p>It is shown that the Strahler number of a parity game is a robust parameter:
it coincides with its alternative version based on trees of progress measures
and with the register number defined by Lehtinen~(2018). It follows that parity
games can be solved in quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the
number of vertices and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $k$ is the register
number. This significantly improves the running times and space achieved for
parity games of bounded register number by Lehtinen (2018) and by Parys (2020).
</p>
<p>The running time of the algorithm based on small Strahler-universal trees
yields a novel trade-off $k \cdot \lg(d/k) = O(\log n)$ between the two natural
parameters that measure the structural complexity of a parity game, which
allows solving parity games in polynomial time. This includes as special cases
the asymptotic settings of those parameters covered by the results of Calude,
Jain Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan (2017), of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (2017),
and of Lehtinen (2018), and it significantly extends the range of such
settings, for example to $d = 2^{O\left(\sqrt{\lg n}\right)}$ and $k =
O\!\left(\sqrt{\lg n}\right)$.

vision and interactive computer graphics, with many real-world applications.
This paper investigates the novel problem of generating 3D shape point cloud
geometry from a symbolic part tree representation. In order to learn such a
conditional shape generation procedure in an end-to-end fashion, we propose a
conditional GAN "part tree"-to-"point cloud" model (PT2PC) that disentangles
the structural and geometric factors. The proposed model incorporates the part
tree condition into the architecture design by passing messages top-down and
bottom-up along the part tree hierarchy. Experimental results and user study
demonstrate the strengths of our method in generating perceptually plausible
and diverse 3D point clouds, given the part tree condition. We also propose a
novel structural measure for evaluating if the generated shape point clouds
satisfy the part tree conditions.

    <title>Fan-Crossing Free Graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1584662400</feedworld_mtime>

Brandenburg</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08468">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A graph is fan-crossing free if it admits a drawing in the plane so that each
edge can be crossed by independent edges. Then the crossing edges have distinct
vertices. In complement, a graph is fan-crossing if each edge can be crossed by
edges of a fan. Then the crossing edges are incident to a common vertex. Graphs
are k-planar if each edge is crossed by at most k edges, and k-gap-planar if
each crossing is assigned to an edge involved in the crossing, so that at most
k crossings are assigned to each edge. We use the s-subdivision, path-addition,
and node-to-circle expansion operations to show that there are fan-crossing
free graphs that are not fan-crossing, k-planar, and k-gap-planar for k &gt;= 1,
respectively. A path-addition adds a long path between any two vertices to a
graph. An s-subdivision replaces an edge by a path of length s, and a
node-to-circle expansion substitutes a vertex by a 3-regular circle, so that
each vertex of the circle inherits an edge incident to the original vertex. We
introduce universality for an operation and a graph class, so the every graph
has an image in the graph class. In particular, we show the fan22 crossing free
graphs are universal for 2-subdivision and for node-to-circle 3 expansion.
Finally, we show that some graphs have a unique fan-crossing free embedding,
that there are maximal fan-crossing free graphs with less edges than the
density, and that the recognition problem for fan-crossing free graphs is
NP-complete.

    <title>Convex Hulls of Random Order Types</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1584662400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Goaoc:Xavier.html">Xavier Goaoc</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Welzl:Emo.html">Emo Welzl</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08456">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We establish the following two main results on order types of points in
general position in the plane (realizable simple planar order types, realizable
uniform acyclic oriented matroids of rank~$3$):
</p>
<p>- The number of extreme points in an $n$-point order type, chosen uniformly
at random from all such order types, is on average $4+o(1)$. For labeled order
types, this number has average $4-\frac{8}{n^2-n+2}$ and variance at most $3$.
</p>
<p>- The (labeled) order types read off a set of $n$ points sampled
independently from the uniform measure on a convex planar domain, smooth or
polygonal, or from a Gaussian distribution are concentrated, i.e. such sampling
typically encounters only a vanishingly small fraction of all order types of
the given size.
</p>
<p>Result~(a) generalizes to arbitrary dimension $d$ for labeled order types
with the average number of extreme points $2d+o(1)$ and constant variance. We
also discuss to what extent our methods generalize to the abstract setting of
uniform acyclic oriented matroids. Moreover, our methods allow to show the
following relative of the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem: for any fixed $k$, as $n
\to \infty$, a proportion $1 - O(1/n)$ of the $n$-point simple order types
contain a triangle enclosing a convex $k$-chain over an edge.
</p>
<p>For the unlabeled case in (a), we prove that for any antipodal, finite subset
of the $2$-dimensional sphere, the group of orientation preserving bijections
is cyclic, dihedral or one of $A_4$, $S_4$ or $A_5$ (and each case is
possible). These are the finite subgroups of $SO(3)$ and our proof follows the
lines of their characterization by Felix Klein.

rectangle contains exactly one clue, rectangles containing + are square,
rectangles containing - are strictly longer horizontally than vertically,
rectangles containing | are strictly longer vertically than horizontally, and
no four rectangles share a corner. We prove this puzzle NP-complete,
establishing a Nikoli gap of 16 years. Along the way, we introduce a gadget
framework for proving hardness of similar puzzles involving area coverage, and
show that it applies to an existing NP-hardness proof for Spiral Galaxies. We
also present a mathematical puzzle font for Tatamibari.

Delaunay triangulation (DT) when the input instances $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ follow
some unknown \emph{product distribution}. That is, $x_i$ comes from a fixed
unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}_i$, and the $x_i$'s are drawn independently.
After spending $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ time in a learning phase, the subsequent
expected running time is $O((n+ H)/\varepsilon)$, where $H \in
\{H_\mathrm{S},H_\mathrm{DT}\}$, and $H_\mathrm{S}$ and $H_\mathrm{DT}$ are the
entropies of the distributions of the sorting and DT output, respectively. In
this paper, we allow dependence among the $x_i$'s under the \emph{group product
distribution}. There is a hidden partition of $[1,n]$ into groups; the $x_i$'s
in the $k$-th group are fixed unknown functions of the same hidden variable
$u_k$; and the $u_k$'s are drawn from an unknown product distribution. We
describe self-improving algorithms for sorting and DT under this model when the
functions that map $u_k$ to $x_i$'s are well-behaved. After an
$O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$-time training phase, we achieve $O(n + H_\mathrm{S})$ and
$O(n\alpha(n) + H_\mathrm{DT})$ expected running times for sorting and DT,
respectively, where $\alpha(\cdot)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.

location problem. Suppose that there is a fixed query distribution in
$\mathbb{R}^2$, and we are given an oracle that can return in $O(1)$ time the
probability of a query point falling into a polygonal region of constant
complexity. We can maintain a convex subdivision $\cal S$ with $n$ vertices
such that each query is answered in $O(\mathrm{OPT})$ expected time, where OPT
is the minimum expected time of the best linear decision tree for point
location in $\cal S$. The space and construction time are $O(n\log^2 n)$. An
update of $\cal S$ as a mixed sequence of $k$ edge insertions and deletions
takes $O(k\log^5 n)$ amortized time. As a corollary, the randomized incremental
construction of the Voronoi diagram of $n$ sites can be performed in $O(n\log^5
n)$ expected time so that, during the incremental construction, a nearest
neighbor query at any time can be answered optimally with respect to the
intermediate Voronoi diagram at that time.

$A^*(\lambda)$ can cover a rectangle of dimensions $\lambda\times 1$.
</p>
<p>We show that there is a threshold value $\lambda_2 = \sqrt{\sqrt{7}/2 - 1/4}

    <title>Site2Vec: a reference frame invariant algorithm for vector embedding of protein-ligand binding sites</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1584662400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Arnab Bhadra, Kalidas Y <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08149">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Protein-ligand interaction is one of the fundamental molecular interactions
of living systems. Proteins are the building blocks of functions in life at the
molecular level. Ligands are small molecules that interact with proteins at
specific regions on the surface of proteins called binding sites. Understanding
the physicochemical properties of ligand-binding sites is very important in the
field of drug discovery as well as understanding biological systems.
Protein-ligand binding site plays an essential role in the interaction between
protein and ligand that is necessary for any living system to survive.
Comparing similarities between binding sites has been one of the main focus
areas since the last decade in bioinformatics and drug discovery. In this
regard, several computational methods have been developed to compare binding
sites so far. Binding site comparison requires fast and efficient method as the
amount of three-dimensional protein structural information is increasing
rapidly nowadays. We report in this study, development of Site2Vec, a novel
machine learning-based method for reference frame invariant ligand-independent
vector embedding of the 3D structure of a protein-ligand binding site. Each
binding site is represented in a $d$-dimensional vector form. The 3D structures
of binding sites are mapped to vector form such that similar binding sites hash
into proximal localities, and dissimilar sites fall across diverse regions. A
sensitivity analysis of rotation and perturbation and validation study is
performed to understand the behavior of the method. Benchmarking exercises have
been carried out against state of the art binding site comparison methods on
state of the art datasets. The exercises validate our proposed method and
demonstrate that the proposed method is rotationally invariant and can handle
natural perturbations expected in the biological system.

<p>In light of the very unusual developments in the world due to the spread of Covid-19 and the disruption it is causing to many people in our field, especially those with young children at home, the FOCS PC has decided to push back the final deadline for papers by six days. We would have liked to do more, but we still are trying to stick to our timeline for notification since that date is coordinated with other deadlines in the theory community. In addition, some members of the committee are also affected by this crisis and there is concern that we may not be able to do our job as a committee in a shorter time frame. Pre-registration (including titles and abstracts) is still required by the original deadline. Here are the new dates:</p>



<p><strong>Pre-registration (including titles and abstracts):</strong> Thursday <strong>April 9</strong>, 11:59 PM (EDT)</p>



<p><strong>Final Paper Submission:</strong> Wednesday <strong>April 15</strong>, 11:59 PM (EDT)</p>

    <title>What to do while stuck at home Part I</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First of all both the <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/">Turing award</a> and <a href="https://www.abelprize.no/seksjon/vis.html?tid=76020">Abel Prize</a> announced yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
As we start moving from the panic phase of the coronavirus to the boring phase, what kinds of things should you do or not do while stuck at home for the next two weeks to eighteen months.<br/>
<br/>
First of all still do your job. Teach your online classes. Try to do some research. Meet with your colleagues/students/advisor virtually (best with Zoom or something similar). Submit to conferences. What else? Use the situation for your advantage.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Attend virtual conferences: </b>Really attend. Pretend that you flew there and devote the entire day to going to virtual talks or chatting with other attendees in virtual hallways. I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/03/the-importance-of-networking.html">said it wouldn't happen this way</a> last week so prove me wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Create a Virtual Workshop: </b>Because you can. Invite people to give online talks. Open it up for all to listen. Find ways to discuss together.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Connect: </b>Make a virtual get-together with an old colleague or someone you've always wanted to meet. Researchers around the world will be holed up and happy to get some interactions.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Learn Something New: </b>Read a textbook. Take an online course in CS or something completely different. There are plenty.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Help Others Learn: </b>Start that book you've always wanted to write. Or just write a short survey article giving your view of a slice of the theory world. Create some videos or a podcast to explain stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Pick up a hobby: </b>Something outside computer science just to keep your sanity.<br/>
<b><br/></b>
<b>Watch some fun computer-related movies: </b>Her, Sneakers, The Computer wore Tennis Shoes, 2001, The Imitation Game, Hidden Figures, Colossus: The Forbin Project, Ex Machina. Add your own favorites in the comments.<br/>
<br/>
And on the other hand don't<br/>
<br/>
<b>Become an epidemiologist: </b>As a computer scientist you are an expert in networks, graph theory and exponential growth so you can create models that show we are grossly under preparing and/or overreacting to the virus and want to tell the world how you are right and the so-called "experts" are wrong. Please don't.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Prove P ≠ NP</b>: Trying to settle P v NP and failing is instructive. Trying to settle P v NP and thinking you succeeded is delusional.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Freak Out: </b>We will get past this virus and the world will recover.<br/>
<br/>
Bill will follow up with his own ideas in part II next week.</div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The second Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place next Friday, March 27th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC).  <strong>Sujay Sanghavi</strong> from University of Texas at Austin will speak about “<em>Towards Model Agnostic Robustness</em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: It is now common practice to try and solve machine learning problems by starting with a complex existing model or architecture, and fine-tuning/adapting it to the task at hand. However, outliers, errors or even just sloppiness in training data often lead to drastic drops in performance. </p>



<p>We investigate a simple generic approach to correct for this, motivated by a classic statistical idea: trimmed loss. This advocates jointly (a) selecting which training samples to ignore, and (b) fitting a model on the remaining samples. As such this is computationally infeasible even for linear regression. We propose and study the natural iterative variant that alternates between these two steps (a) and (b) – each of which individually can be easily accomplished in pretty much any statistical setting. We also study the batch-SGD variant of this idea. We demonstrate both theoretically (for generalized linear models) and empirically (for vision and NLP neural network models) that this effectively recovers accuracy in the presence of bad training data.</p>

    <title>Network disruption: maximizing disagreement and polarization in social networks</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1584576000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Mayee Chen, Miklos Z. Racz <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08377">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Recent years have seen a marked increase in the spread of misinformation, a
phenomenon which has been accelerated and amplified by social media such as
Facebook and Twitter. While some actors spread misinformation to push a
specific agenda, it has also been widely documented that others aim to simply
disrupt the network by increasing disagreement and polarization across the
network and thereby destabilizing society. Popular social networks are also
vulnerable to large-scale attacks. Motivated by this reality, we introduce a
simple model of network disruption where an adversary can take over a limited
number of user profiles in a social network with the aim of maximizing
disagreement and/or polarization in the network.
</p>
<p>We investigate this model both theoretically and empirically. We show that
the adversary will always change the opinion of a taken-over profile to an
extreme in order to maximize disruption. We also prove that an adversary can
increase disagreement / polarization at most linearly in the number of user
profiles it takes over. Furthermore, we present a detailed empirical study of
several natural algorithms for the adversary on both synthetic networks and
real world (Reddit and Twitter) data sets. These show that even simple,
unsophisticated heuristics, such as targeting centrists, can disrupt a network
effectively, causing a large increase in disagreement / polarization. Studying
the problem of network disruption through the lens of an adversary thus
highlights the seriousness of the problem.

    <title>Enumeration of Unordered Forests</title>

that can be used both to address theoretical issues and to solve data mining
problems. This method has already been successfully developed to handle
unordered trees. If the literature proposes solutions to enumerate singletons
of trees, we study in this article a more general, higher combinatorial
problem, the enumeration of sets of trees - forests. By compressing each forest
into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), we develop a reverse search like method to
enumerate DAG compressing forests. Remarkably, we prove that these DAG are in
bijection with the row-Fishburn matrices, a well-studied class of combinatorial
objects. In a second step, we derive our forest enumeration to provide
algorithms for tackling two related problems : (i) the enumeration of
"subforests" of a forest, and (ii) the frequent "subforest" mining problem. All
the methods presented in this article enumerate each item uniquely, up to
isomorphism.

grammar compression. In the literature, a target string $T$ has been compressed
as a context-free grammar $G$ in Chomsky normal form satisfying $L(G) = \{T\}$.
Such a grammar is often called a \emph{straight-line program} (SLP). In this
paper, we consider a probabilistic grammar $G$ that generates $T$, but not
necessarily as a unique element of $L(G)$. In order to recover the original
text $T$ unambiguously, we keep both the grammar $G$ and the derivation tree of
$T$ from the start symbol in $G$, in compressed form. We show some simple
evidence that our proposal is indeed more efficient than SLPs for certain
texts, both from theoretical and practical points of view.

convex function $f$ in an $\ell_2$ ball of radius $r$ around $x$. It is
straightforward to show that roughly $r^{-1}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ calls to
the oracle suffice to find an $\epsilon$-approximate minimizer of $f$ in an
$\ell_2$ unit ball. Perhaps surprisingly, this is not optimal: we design an
accelerated algorithm which attains an $\epsilon$-approximate minimizer with
roughly $r^{-2/3} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ oracle queries, and give a matching
lower bound. Further, we implement ball optimization oracles for functions with
locally stable Hessians using a variant of Newton's method. The resulting
algorithm applies to a number of problems of practical and theoretical import,
improving upon previous results for logistic and $\ell_\infty$ regression and
achieving guarantees comparable to the state-of-the-art for $\ell_p$
regression.

applied to solve various problems in a wide range of areas, including
operations research, engineering, economics, or even more abstract mathematical
areas such as combinatorics. It is also used in many machine learning
applications, such as $\ell_1$-regularized SVMs, basis pursuit, nonnegative
matrix factorization, etc. Interior Point Methods (IPMs) are one of the most
popular methods to solve LPs both in theory and in practice. Their underlying
complexity is dominated by the cost of solving a system of linear equations at
each iteration. In this paper, we consider \emph{infeasible} IPMs for the
special case where the number of variables is much larger than the number of
constraints. Using tools from Randomized Linear Algebra, we present a
preconditioning technique that, when combined with the Conjugate Gradient
iterative solver, provably guarantees that infeasible IPM algorithms (suitably
modified to account for the error incurred by the approximate solver), converge
to a feasible, approximately optimal solution, without increasing their
iteration complexity. Our empirical evaluations verify our theoretical results
on both real-world and synthetic data.

execution-intensive and memory-intensive. In this paper, we study the
computational structure of Vietoris-Rips persistence barcodes, and identify
several unique mathematical properties and algorithmic opportunities with
connections to the GPU. Mathematically and empirically, we look into the
properties of apparent pairs, which are independently identifiable persistence
pairs comprising up to 99\% of persistence pairs. We give theoretical upper and
lower bounds of the apparent pair rate and model the average case. We also
design massively parallel algorithms to take advantage of the very large number
of simplices that can be processed independently of each other. Having
identified these opportunities, we develop a GPU-accelerated software for
computing Vietoris-Rips persistence barcodes, called Ripser++. The software
achieves up to 30x speedup over the total execution time of the original Ripser
and also reduces CPU-memory usage by up to 2.0x. We believe our
GPU-acceleration based efforts open a new chapter for the advancement of
topological data analysis in the post-Moore's Law era.

    <title>Hardness of Bounded Distance Decoding on Lattices in $\ell_p$ Norms</title>

</p>
<p>$Bounded Distance Decoding $\BDD_{p,\alpha}$ is the problem of decoding a
lattice when the target point is promised to be within an $\alpha$ factor of
the minimum distance of the lattice, in the $\ell_{p}$ norm. We prove that
$\BDD_{p, \alpha}$ is $\NP$-hard under randomized reductions where $\alpha \to
1/2$ as $p \to \infty$ (and for $\alpha=1/2$ when $p=\infty$), thereby showing
the hardness of decoding for distances approaching the unique-decoding radius
for large $p$. We also show fine-grained hardness for $\BDD_{p,\alpha}$. For
example, we prove that for all $p \in [1,\infty) \setminus 2\Z$ and constants
$C &gt; 1, \eps &gt; 0$, there is no $2^{(1-\eps)n/C}$-time algorithm for
$\BDD_{p,\alpha}$ for some constant $\alpha$ (which approaches $1/2$ as $p \to
\infty$), assuming the randomized Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH).
Moreover, essentially all of our results also hold (under analogous non-uniform
assumptions) for $\BDD$ with preprocessing, in which unbounded precomputation
can be applied to the lattice before the target is available.
</p>
<p>Compared to prior work on the hardness of $\BDD_{p,\alpha}$ by Liu,
Lyubashevsky, and Micciancio (APPROX-RANDOM 2008), our results improve the
values of $\alpha$ for which the problem is known to be $\NP$-hard for all $p &gt;
p_1 \approx 4.2773$, and give the very first fine-grained hardness for $\BDD$
(in any norm). Our reductions rely on a special family of "locally dense"
lattices in $\ell_{p}$ norms, which we construct by modifying the
integer-lattice sparsification technique of Aggarwal and Stephens-Davidowitz
(STOC 2018).

    <title>Private and Secure Distributed Matrix Multiplication</title>
    <summary>Machine learning on big data sets takes a significant amount of computational power, so it is often necessary to offload some of the work to external distributed systems, such as an Amazon EC2 cluster. It is useful to be able to utilize external resources for computation tasks while keeping the actual data private and secure. In particular, matrix multiplication is an essential step in many machine learning processes, but the owner of the matrices may have reasons to keep the actual values protected. In this post, we’ll discuss four works about secure distributed computation.

It is useful to be able to utilize external resources for computation tasks while keeping the actual data <em>private</em> and<em> secure</em>. In particular, matrix multiplication is an essential step in many machine learning processes, but the owner of the matrices may have reasons to keep the actual values protected.</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll discuss four works about secure distributed computation. First, we’ll talk about a method of using MDS (maximum distance separable) error correcting codes to add security and privacy to general data storage (“<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07457.pdf">Cross Subspace Alignment and the Asymptotic Capacity of X-Secure T-Private Information Retrieval”</a> by Jia, Sun, Jafar). </p>



<p>Then we’ll discuss method of adapting a coding strategy for straggler mitigation (<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7027-polynomial-codes-an-optimal-design-for-high-dimensional-coded-matrix-multiplication.pdf">“Polynomial codes: an optimal design for high-dimensional coded matrix multiplication”</a> by Yu, Qian, Maddah-Ali, Avestimehr) in matrix multiplication to instead add security or privacy (<a href="https://uweb.engr.arizona.edu/~wchang/Globecom-SecureMM-2018.pdf">“On the capacity of secure distributed matrix multiplication”</a> by Chang, Tandon and <a href="https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/abstract/document/8832193">“Private Coded Matrix Multiplication”</a> by Kim, Yang, Lee)</p>



<p>Throughout this post we will use variations on the following communication model:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1572" height="192" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/blog_fig1.png?w=1024" width="404"/></figure>



<p>The data in the grey box is only given to the master, so workers only have access to what they receive (via green arrows). Later on we will also suppose the workers have a shared library not available to the master. The workers do not communicate with each other as part of the computation, but we want to prevent them from figuring out anything about the data if they do talk to each other.</p>



<p> This model is related to <em>private computation</em> but not exactly the same. We assume the servers are “honest but curious”, meaning they won’t introduce malicious computations. We also only require the master to receive the final result, and don’t need to protect any data from the master. This is close to the BGW scheme ([Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Wigderson ’88]), but we do not allow workers to communicate with each other as part of the computation of the result.</p>



<p> We consider <em>unconditional</em> or <em>information-theoretic</em> security, meaning the data is protected even if the workers have unbounded computational power. Furthermore, we will consider having <em>perfect  secrecy</em>, in which the mutual information between the information revealed to the workers and the actual messages is zero.</p>



<h2>X-Secure T-Private Information Retrieval</h2>



<p> Before we get into matrix-matrix multiplication, consider the problem of storing information on the workers to be retrieved by the master, such that it is “protected.” What do we mean by that? [Jia, Sun, and Jafar ’19] define X-secure T-private information retrieval as follows: </p>

<p>Given these constraints, Jia et al. give bounds on the capacity of the system. Capacity is the maximum rate achievable, where rate is defined as bits requested by the worker (<img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="L"/>, the length of a single message) divided by the number of bits downloaded by the worker. The bounds are in terms of the capacity of T-Private Information Retrieval, (which is the same as the above definition, with only requirement 2).</p>

<p>Jia et al. give schemes that achieve these bounds while preserving the privacy and security constraints by introducing random noise vectors into how data is stored and queries are constructed. The general scheme for <img alt="N&gt;X+T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3EX%2BT&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N&gt;X+T"/> uses <em>cross subspace alignment</em>, which essentially chooses how to construct the stored information and the queries such that the added noise mostly “cancels out” when the master combines all the response from the servers. The scheme for <img alt="N\leq X+T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Cleq+X%2BT&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N\leq X+T"/> is straightforward to explain, and demonstrates the idea of using error correcting codes that treat the random values as the message and the actual data as the “noise.”</p>



<p>For this scheme, the message length <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="L"/> is set to <img alt="N-X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N-X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N-X"/> (the number of nodes <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>, minus the maximum number of colluding servers <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X"/>).

The length <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> string downloaded from  row <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> can be used to decode <img alt="\bar{Z}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7BZ%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{Z}_i"/>: <img alt="\bar{W}_{L+1},\bar{W}_{L+2},...,\bar{W}_{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7BW%7D_%7BL%2B1%7D%2C%5Cbar%7BW%7D_%7BL%2B2%7D%2C...%2C%5Cbar%7BW%7D_%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{W}_{L+1},\bar{W}_{L+2},...,\bar{W}_{N}"/> are all zero, so columns <img alt="L+1 = N-X+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%2B1+%3D+N-X%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="L+1 = N-X+1"/> through <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> have the values of <img alt="\bar{Z}_{i,N-X+1},...,\bar{Z}_{i,N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7BZ%7D_%7Bi%2CN-X%2B1%7D%2C...%2C%5Cbar%7BZ%7D_%7Bi%2CN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{Z}_{i,N-X+1},...,\bar{Z}_{i,N}"/>. This gives the user <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X"/> values from the MDS code used on each row, so they can decode and get <img alt="Z_1,...,Z_K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_1%2C...%2CZ_K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="Z_1,...,Z_K"/> and <img alt="\bar{Z}_{1},...,\bar{Z}_K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7BZ%7D_%7B1%7D%2C...%2C%5Cbar%7BZ%7D_K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{Z}_{1},...,\bar{Z}_K"/>.

Because of the MDS property of the code used to get <img alt="\bar{Z}_1,...,\bar{Z}_K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7BZ%7D_1%2C...%2C%5Cbar%7BZ%7D_K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{Z}_1,...,\bar{Z}_K"/>, this scheme is X-secure and because the user downloads all bits, it is T-private.</p>



<h2>Matrix Multiplication with Polynomial Codes</h2>



<p>We now move on to the task of matrix-matrix multiplication. The methods for secure and private distributed matrix multiplication we will discuss shortly are based on <em>polynomial codes</em>, used by [Yu, Maddah-Ali, Avestimehr ’17] for doing distributed matrix multiplications robust to stragglers. Suppose the master has matrices <img alt="{\bf{A}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{m\times n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BA%7D%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_q%5E%7Bm%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{A}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{m\times n}"/> and <img alt="{\bf{B}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BB%7D%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_q%5E%7Bn+%5Ctimes+p%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{B}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times p}"/> for some finite field <img alt="\mathbb{F}_q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{F}_q"/>, and <img alt="m,n,p \in \mathbb{Z}^+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%2Cn%2Cp+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5E%2B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="m,n,p \in \mathbb{Z}^+"/>. Assume <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="m"/> and <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> are divisible by <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>, so we can represent the matrices divided into <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> submatrices: </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="{\bf{A}}= \begin{bmatrix}A_1\\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ A_m\end{bmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BA%7D%7D%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7DA_1%5C%5C+A_2+%5C%5C+%5Cvdots+%5C%5C+A_m%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{A}}= \begin{bmatrix}A_1\\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ A_m\end{bmatrix}"/>               and        <img alt="{\bf{B}}= \begin{bmatrix}B_1&amp; B_2 &amp; \dots &amp;B_n\end{bmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BB%7D%7D%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7DB_1%26+B_2+%26+%5Cdots+%26B_n%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{B}}= \begin{bmatrix}B_1&amp; B_2 &amp; \dots &amp;B_n\end{bmatrix}"/> </p>



<p>So to recover <img alt="\bf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{AB}"/>, the master needs each entry of: </p>



<p><img alt="{\bf{AB}} = \begin{bmatrix}A_1B_1 &amp; A_1B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_1B_n\\A_2B_1 &amp; A_2B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_2 B_n\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots\\A_mB_1 &amp;A_mB_2 &amp; \dots&#xA0; &amp; A_mB_n \end{bmatrix}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BAB%7D%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7DA_1B_1+%26+A_1B_2+%26+%5Cdots+%26+A_1B_n%5C%5CA_2B_1+%26+A_2B_2+%26+%5Cdots+%26+A_2+B_n%5C%5C%5Cvdots+%26+%5Cvdots+%26%5Cvdots+%26%5Cvdots%5C%5CA_mB_1+%26A_mB_2+%26+%5Cdots%C2%A0+%26+A_mB_n+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{AB}} = \begin{bmatrix}A_1B_1 &amp; A_1B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_1B_n\\A_2B_1 &amp; A_2B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_2 B_n\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots\\A_mB_1 &amp;A_mB_2 &amp; \dots&#xA0; &amp; A_mB_n \end{bmatrix}."/></p>



<p>The key idea of polynomial codes is to encode <img alt="A_1,...,A_m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1%2C...%2CA_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A_1,...,A_m"/> and <img alt="B_1,...,B_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_1%2C...%2CB_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B_1,...,B_n"/> in polynomials <img alt="\tilde{A}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}_i"/> and <img alt="\tilde{B}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{B}_i"/> to be sent to the <img alt="i^{th}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%5E%7Bth%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i^{th}"/> worker,  where they are multiplied and the result is returned. The goal of Yu et al. was to create robustness to stragglers, and so they add redundancy in this process so that not all workers need to return a result for the master to be able to determine <img alt="\bf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{AB}"/>. In particular, only <img alt="mn" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=mn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="mn"/> returned values are needed, so <img alt="N-mn" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N-mn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N-mn"/> servers can be slow or fail completely without hurting the computation. This method can be thought of as setting up the encodings of <img alt="\bf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{A}"/> and <img alt="\bf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{B}"/> so that the resulting multiplications <img alt="\tilde{C}_1=\tilde{A}_1\tilde{B}_1,...,\tilde{C}_N=\tilde{A}_N\tilde{B}_N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BC%7D_1%3D%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_1%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_1%2C...%2C%5Ctilde%7BC%7D_N%3D%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_N%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{C}_1=\tilde{A}_1\tilde{B}_1,...,\tilde{C}_N=\tilde{A}_N\tilde{B}_N"/> are evaluations of a polynomial with coefficients  <img alt="A_1B_1,A_1B_2,...,A_2B_1....,A_mB_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1B_1%2CA_1B_2%2C...%2CA_2B_1....%2CA_mB_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A_1B_1,A_1B_2,...,A_2B_1....,A_mB_n"/> at <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> different points — equivalent to a Reed-Solomon code. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1603" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/blog_fig7.png?w=1024"/></figure>



<p>This idea is adapted by [Chang, Tandon ’18] to protect the data from colluding servers: noise is incorporated into the encodings such that the number of encoded matrices required to determine anything about the data is greater than the security threshold <img alt="X &lt; N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3C+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X &lt; N"/>. Since the master receives all <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> responses it is able to decode the result of <img alt="\textbf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{AB}"/>, but no set of <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X"/> nodes can decode <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/>, <img alt="\textbf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{B}"/>, or <img alt="\textbf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{AB}"/>. Similarly, [Kim, Yang, Li ’19] adapts this idea to impose privacy on a matrix-matrix multiplication: workers are assumed to have a shared library <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_i%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M"/>, and the user would like to multiply <img alt="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D%7D%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_{D}"/> for some <img alt="D \in[1:M]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+%5Cin%5B1%3AM%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="D \in[1:M]"/> without revealing the value of <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="D"/> to the workers. The workers encode the entire library such that when the  encoding is multiplied by an encoded input <img alt="\tilde{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}"/> from the master, the result is useful to the master in decoding <img alt="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D%7D%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_D"/>.</p>



<p>Chang and Tandon consider the following two privacy models, where up to <img alt="\ell" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\ell"/> servers may collude. The master also has <img alt="K^{(A)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%5E%7B%28A%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="K^{(A)}"/> (and in the second model, <img alt="K^{(B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%5E%7B%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="K^{(B)}"/>), which are matrices of random values with the same dimensions as <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> (and <img alt="\textbf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{B}"/>). These are used in creating the encodings <img alt="\tilde{A}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}_i"/> (and <img alt="\tilde{B}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{B}_i"/>).</p>



<p> <img alt="\textbf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{B}"/> is public, <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> is private:</p>

<p>Both private:</p>

<p>Kim, Yang, and Lee take a similar approach of applying the method of polynomial code to <em>private</em> matrix multiplication. As before, there are <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> workers, but now the master wants to multiply <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> with some <img alt="{\textbf{B}}_D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\textbf{B}}_D"/> in shared library <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_i%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M"/> (all the workers have the shared library). </p>



<p>Since the master isn’t itself encoding <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M"/> it has to tell the workers how to encode the library so that it can reconstruct the desired product. This is done by having the master tell the workers what values of <img alt="\vec{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\vec{y}"/> they should use to evaluate the polynomial that corresponds to encoding each library matrix. We denote the encoding of the library done by each worker <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> as the multivariate polynomial <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="h"/> which is evaluated at <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M"/> and the node-specific vector <img alt="y^{(i)}_{[1:M]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E%7B%28i%29%7D_%7B%5B1%3AM%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="y^{(i)}_{[1:M]}"/> to get the node’s encoding, <img alt="\tilde{B}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{B}_i"/>. The worker multiplies this with the encoding of <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> it receives, <img alt="\tilde{A}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}_i"/> and returns the resulting value <img alt="Z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="Z_i"/>. All together, we get the following communication model: </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As we’ve seen, coding techniques originally designed to add redundancy and protect against data loss can also be used to intentionally incorporate noise for data protection. In particular, this can be done when out-sourcing matrix multiplications, making it a useful technique in many data processing and machine learning applications.</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Existing proofs that deduce BPP=P from circuit lower bounds convert randomized algorithms into deterministic algorithms with a large polynomial slowdown. We convert randomized algorithms into deterministic ones with little slowdown. Specifically, assuming exponential lower bounds against randomized single-valued nondeterministic (SVN) circuits, we convert any randomized algorithm over inputs of length n running in time <img alt="t\geq n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5Cgeq+n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="t\geq n"/> to a deterministic one running in time <img alt="t^{2+\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5E%7B2%2B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="t^{2+\alpha}"/> for an arbitrarily small constant <img alt="\alpha &gt; 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%3E+0&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\alpha &gt; 0"/>. Such a slowdown is nearly optimal, as, under complexity-theoretic assumptions, there are problems with an inherent quadratic derandomization slowdown. We also convert any randomized algorithm that errs rarely into a deterministic algorithm having a similar running time (with pre-processing). The latter derandomization result holds under weaker assumptions, of exponential lower bounds against deterministic SVN circuits. Our results follow from a new, nearly optimal, explicit pseudorandom generator. The construction uses, among other ideas, a new connection between pseudoentropy generators and locally list recoverable codes.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>So far, I confess, this pandemic is not shaping up for me like for Isaac Newton.  It’s not just that I haven’t invented calculus or mechanics: I feel little motivation to think about research at all.  Or to catch up on classic literature or films … or even to shower, shave, or brush my teeth.  I’m quarantined in the house with my wife, our two kids, and my parents, so certainly there’s been plenty of family time, although my 7-year-daughter would inexplicably rather play fashion games on her iPad than get personalized math lessons from the author of <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>.</p>



<p>Mostly, it seems, I’ve been spending the time sleeping.  Or curled up in bed, phone to face, transfixed by the disaster movie that’s the world’s new reality.  Have you ever had one of those nightmares where you know the catastrophe is approaching—whether that means a missed flight, a botched presentation at your old high school, or (perhaps) more people dying than in any event since WWII—but you don’t know exactly when, and you can do nothing to avert it?  Yeah, that feeling is what I now close my eyes to <em>escape</em>.  And then I wake up, and I’m back in bizarro-nightmare-land, where the US is in no rush whatsoever to test people or to build ventilators or hospitals to cope with the coming deluge, and where ideas that could save millions have no chance against rotting institutions.</p>



<p>If nothing else, I guess we now have a decisive answer to the question of why humanity can’t get its act together on climate change.  Namely, if we can’t wrap our heads around a catastrophe that explodes exponentially over <strong>a few weeks</strong>—if those who denied or minimized it face no consequences even when they’re dramatically refuted before everyone’s eyes—then what chance could we possibly have against a catastrophe that takes a century?  (Note that I reject the view that the virus was sent by some guardian angel as the only possible <em>solution</em> to climate change, one crisis cancelling another one.  For one thing, I expect emissions to roar back as soon as this new Black Death is over; for another, the virus punishes public transportation but not cars.)</p>



<p>Anyway, I realized I needed something, not necessarily to take my mind off the crisis, but to break me out of an unproductive spiral.  Also, what better time than the present for things that I wouldn’t normally have time for?  So, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?cat=34">continuing a tradition</a> from 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018, we’re going to do an Ask Me Anything session.  Questions directly or tangentially related to the crisis (continuing the discussion from the previous thread) are okay, questions <em>totally unrelated</em> to the crisis are even okayer, goofball questions are great, and questions that I can involve my two kids in answering are greatest of all.  Here are this year’s ground rules:</p>



<ul><li>24 hours or until I get bored</li><li>One question per person total</li><li><strong>Absolutely no</strong> multi-part questions</li><li>Self-contained questions only—nothing that requires me to read a paper, watch a video, etc.</li><li>Scan the previous AMAs to see if your question is already there</li><li>Any sufficiently patronizing, hostile, or annoying questions might be left in the moderation queue, 100% at my discretion</li></ul>



<p>So ask away!  And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M">always look on the bright side of life</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Update (March 19):</strong> Thanks, everyone!  No more questions please.  It will take me a few days just to work through all the great questions that are already in the queue. </p></div>

<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/rogers.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19530" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/rogers.jpg?w=640"/></a></p>
<p>It is a famous problem what is the densest (or, most efficient) packing of unit balls in Euclidean n-dimensional spaces and, of course, you can ask the same questions for other convex bodies. A sort of a dual problem, also famous, is the question of the most efficient covering the n-dimensional Euclidean space by balls or by translates of other convex bodies.</p>
<p>A very basic insight is that covering is much more efficient than packing. Can you explain the reason for that? The only thing that came up to my mind was that convex sets are roundish from the outside but not from the inside which makes it easier to cover with them.</p>
<p>But how efficiently can we cover the n-dimensional Euclidean space with translates of a convex body $K$?</p>
<p>C.A. Rogers with coauthors had some very fundamental results regarding covering (and packing) in the 50s and 60s. Or Ordentlich, Oded Regev and Barak Weiss have made a terrific improvement for one of the main questions in this area. They showed that for every convex set <em>K,</em> you can find a lattice <em>L </em> of determinant 1, and <em>r&gt;0</em>  such that <img alt="rK+L = \mathbb R^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=rK%2BL+%3D+%5Cmathbb+R%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="rK+L = \mathbb R^n"/> and</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="{\rm vol} (rK) \le cn^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crm+vol%7D+%28rK%29+%5Cle+cn%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="{\rm vol} (rK) \le cn^2"/>.</p>
<p>The best earlier upper bound was <img alt="n^{\log \log n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B%5Clog+%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{\log \log n}"/>.</p>
<p>One surprising aspect of the proof is the use of finite field Kakeya-type questions. Since the<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2336"> breakthrough</a> by <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/03/24/dvirs-proof-of-the-finite-field-kakeya-conjecture/">Zeev Dvir</a>, many people had hopes for applications from the finite fields results to the Euclidean setting (in particular, to the Euclidean Kakeya problem itself) and it is rare to see such applications. The proof here relies on results by  Dvir, Kopparty, Saraf, Sudan, and Lev. The Ordentlich-Regev-Weiss paper is not yet on the arXiv but the lecture gives a good picture about the results and the proofs.</p>

<p>For those of you confined at home, it may be hard to remain connected with the TCS community or stay up-to-date with the current research, as in-person seminars and conferences are cancelled. In case this may help, we have decided to <strong>increase for now the frequency of our online seminars</strong>, to try and mitigate this aspect. This won’t restore normalcy, but every little thing counts.</p>
<p>Here is our current, now <strong>weekly</strong> schedule: we may add more talks to it in the days to come, so keep an eye on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">our calendar</a> and don’t hesitate to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest talks and results</a> you are curious about.</p>
<ul>
<li>03/25: <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana Moshkovitz</a> (UT Austin) on <em>“Nearly Optimal Pseudorandomness From Hardness”</em></li>
<li>04/01: <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~venkatg/">Venkat Guruswami</a> (CMU) on <em>“Arıkan meets Shannon: Polar codes with near-optimal convergence to channel capacity”</em></li>
<li>04/08: Rahul Ilango (MIT) on <em>“NP-Hardness of Circuit Minimization for Multi-Output Functions”</em></li>
<li>04/15: <span class="JtukPc"><span id="rAECCd"><a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rvan/">Ramon van Handel</a> (Princeton) </span></span>on <em>“Rademacher type and Enflo type coincide”</em></li>
<li>04/22: <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~hy2/">Huacheng Yu</a> (Princeton) on <em>“Nearly Optimal Static Las Vegas Succinct Dictionary”</em></li>
<li>04/29: <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~mahabadi/">Sepideh Mahabadi</a> (TTIC) on<em> “Non-Adaptive Adaptive Sampling on Turnstile Streams”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We emphasize that <strong>you can</strong> (and <em>should</em>) <strong>join as individuals</strong>, from home: if you are interested in a talk, ask for a spot for yourself, no need to go to your institution. We have the live audience capacity for this to work, so don’t hesitate!</p>
<p>We will post individual announcements several days before each talk, including the abstracts and how to ask for a spot, as usual; and the talks will of course be available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TCSplusSeminars/">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/past-talks">our website</a> afterwards if you couldn’t make it to the live, interactive one. Crucially, <strong>we would like your feedback</strong>: not only talk suggestions as pointed out before, but also any idea or suggestion you may have of things we could do or implement, or of content you would like to see. You can send us feedback by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/credits">emailing any of our organizers</a>, or leaving a comment below.</p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>
<p>The TCS+ team</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"><strong>Note:</strong> <em>you don’t need to sign up in advance</em> (the link will be made public on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk">our website</a></span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> the day of the talk, and you can just join then). We only encourage you to do so in order for us to get a sense of the audience size, but it’s optional: don’t feel you have to plan ahead!</span></p></div>

<p>
Neil L. is a Leprechaun. He has visited me once every year since I started GLL. I had never seen a leprechaun before I began the blog—there must be some connection.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I want to share the experiences we had with him on this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>
I thought because of the pandemic that he might not come. I thought that since New York City is on virtual lock-down he might not come. So I decided not to wait up for his visit, which always occurs in the wee hours of the morning. I looked it up: Wee hours is between 1am and 4am. We—that is Kathryn and I not wee—went to bed before midnight.</p>
<p>
Something woke me up at 3am. Not any noise but a bright green light. It was coming from my laptop, which was on the dresser but closed and switched off. I took it out of the bedroom and opened the lid and there he was.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Top o’ the morning to ye. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p/><h2> Neil Says Hi </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The first thing I noticed was: no pipe. There was no puff of smoke in my living room. Neil smokes a special brand of tobacco—green of course—that I would recognize in an instant. Otherwise he looked as usual: green coat and hat, brown vest and shoes, red beard. I could see all of him.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<em>“Glad as always to see you Neil. But why no pipe?”</em></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Neil started his usual pipe-puffing gesture but stopped his hand from touching his face.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">‘Tis virus not microbe. Smoke nae gan do good. All of us doing without. Least of our troubles. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Wow—that was hard for me to fathom. I thought of the travel bans. <em>“Are you all having to stay home?”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Aye. We obey the bans. Crown or Republic, nae matter. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I had to wrap my mind around this—leprechauns too? <em>“The virus applies to you?”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Sadly, we can carry it. Were it not, we could help folks point-to-point. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I realized: leprechauns can go anywhere instantly. The planar aspects of simulations like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">this</a> do not apply to them. Neil read my mind—at least he could do <em>that</em> remotely:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Aye. I noted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109232">all</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109234">your</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109244">comment</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109268">thread</a> about expander graphs and spreading the disease. Fixed dimensions don’t constrain us. This compounds our main trouble, which be…  </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Of course <em>our</em> main trouble and concern is the danger of the virus—our being able to care for those who catch it and measures to ensure many do not catch it. I realize leprechauns, being immortal, have fewer worries there—and I did not ask Neil if they can get sick. So I thought of all the canceled St. Patrick’s Day parades, bars closing, no public merriment, sporting events gone too. But Neil’s next word went straight to the heart.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Boredom. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Boredom and Randomness </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I thought about fun things Neil had recounted in the past: tricks with <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/03/17/happy-st-patricks-day-2014/">math</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/happy-st-patricks-day-2/">codes</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/16/leprechauns-go-universal/">logic</a>, tricks on <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/leprechauns-will-find-you/">people</a>, even tricks during <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/leprechauns-are-multiplying/">March</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/03/17/leprechauns-know-what-it-feels/">Madness</a>. The NCAA tournament got completely canceled, unpostponable. Neil read my mind again and picked up on the topic of sporting events.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Consider me neighbor Bertie. He had his accommodations booked on the wee island in the pond of the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass. For last weekend during the Players Championship. That’s why they built the island, ye know.  </font>
</p></blockquote>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
But of course, the Players was canceled. Even the Masters has been postponed. Neil continued,</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">He and his fellows’ best craic was playing with the balls goon o’er the water. Not in a nasty way. Ye know by the <b>Rule of Indistinguishability</b> we canna do them bad. Not allowed to make them play worse than other tough holes so ye could tell it is more than the usual hobgoblins in your head and butterflies in your chest. What we do must have the same expectation and other moments as random variation. But random is measure-1 so it is easy to comply. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
Of course. We have written about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/a-world-without-randomness/">feigned</a> randomness, and we haven’t yet had time to write a post this year on scientists <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/03/essays-elsewhere.html">taking</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism">superdeterminism</a> <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-path-we-didnt-take.html">seriously</a>—<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/02/guest-post-undecidability.html">even</a> <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/02/guest-post-undecidability_10.html">computationally</a>. How could we <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.0286.pdf">tell</a> that stuff apart from leprechauns? But thinking of Bertie gave me a more obvious question:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<em>“Neil, can’t Bertie and his pals do that remotely? Like lots of other things we’re doing now.”</em></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Neil’s answer exposed my lack of basic leprechaun knowledge.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">In every story of leprechaun tricks, who is present? The leprechaun. He cannot be remote—and he must run the risk of being catched. He can dance, run to the end of the rainbow, and disappear, but fun happens only when he is around. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Hearing this, I would have puffed my own pipe, if I smoked and had one. Neil continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Besides, remotely we cannot control well enough to abide the Rule of Indistinguishability. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
All this about randomness and conspiracy physics, with the world already weighing heavily, was too much. I winked out on the couch, without closing my laptop or seeing if Neil said goodbye with his usual flourish. </p>
<p>
I woke up in late morning and called Ken. As I told this part, Ken was instantly alarmed and horrified.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<em>“We must get Neil back. Is he still on your laptop?”</em> </p>
<p/><p><br/>
He was not. Ken plugged in and opened his own laptop—Neil has in the past visited him too—but nothing. He could not find any leprechauns registered on Skype or Zoom or Hangouts. Then Ken had a thought: “See if your laptop has the IP records.”</p>
<p>
It did. I could not tell what they signified, but my old IT contact at Tech said he could pinpoint the origin in minutes. Meanwhile, Ken calmed down enough to explain. I’ll let him write the rest of the story.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The One Uncanceled Competition </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What is apparently the lone major sporting competition in the world not to be canceled began today. It is chess—the Candidates Tournament to determine who will face Magnus Carlsen in the next world championship match. It is taking place in Yekaterinburg, Russia—in Siberia, still far from the worst virus activity. It has only the 8 players plus officials onsite—no spectators, press limited—and they are all subject to daily screenings. The players shake hands only <a href="https://worldchess.com/news/players-replicas-to-pose-for-photos-while-real-players-avoid-being-in-public">virtually</a>.</p>
<p>
Controversy about its starting continued today with one former World Champion, Vladimir Kramnik, stepping down from a broadcast commentary team “considering the nowadays disastrous humanitarian situation in the world.” But I’m with those saying that its value as a diversion—something to follow live in community—outweighs the concerns. I said this after some reflection on risks from our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/">post</a> and before being contacted about monitoring the tournament. One Chinese <a href="http://tiyutai.qingk.cn/comprehensivelive-info/sfbsrbdcpawqsxrbxrrvvudpcsvxpwfw/6fabf42212b308041e861a2005d12572/6b1607c0df6745e7b59e54f8a87a6309?from=singlemessage&amp;isappinstalled=0&amp;fbclid=IwAR06QhidyVdArI_RPSjTBWo2iUDVSbrJRkRvkPppohNtWT2J3AMRQxRD8Vk">broadcast</a> had over <a href="https://twitter.com/FIDE_chess/status/1239946569404817408">1 million</a> viewers today. Other broadcasts can be found on the official <a href="https://en.candidates-2020.com/main">site</a> and <a href="https://www.chess.com/tv">several</a> <a href="https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/fide-candidates-2020/1/1/1">other</a> <a href="https://new.uschess.org/news/2020-candidates-couch-potatoes/">places</a>. Today’s first round was vigorous, with all four games going beyond the turn-40 time control and two decisive.</p>
<p>
But if it is a lone attraction for us, omigosh, for the leprechauns… Dick’s story proved they can at least <em>read</em> minds remotely. What if they all banded together to mess with the players’ moves? Neil had told of the Indistinguishability constraint, but I realized <em>my own work</em> could enable getting around it. My model enables randomly simulating a human distribution of moves at any rating level. I’ve had the idea to try a “Turing Test” akin to one Garry Kasparov turned aside, as part of the Turing Centennial in 2012, by distinguishing five games played by human 2200-level players from five by computers set to play at 2200 strength. If the leprechauns passed the Turing test at a 2800 rating level they could derange the tournament. This all verges on real concerns in my statistical anti-cheating work, with humans not leprechauns.</p>
<p>
I quickly looked up the lore for <a href="https://mysticinvestigations.com/leprechaun-summoning-spell/">summoning</a> a leprechaun. This is far more audacious than knocking on a professor’s door outside office hours—not that that will happen anytime soon. I did not have real shamrocks but strewed countryside photos from my family’s trip to Ireland last summer around my laptop. I needed Kathryn as well as Dick online by videoconference to make the quorum of three. The IT person came back with the coordinates so that uniquely Neil would be summoned. I adapted the ancient incantation to our new age of interaction by laptop: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Oh Leprechaun, Leprechaun, I humbly call unto thee,<br/>
Ride the Irish rainbows of joy across the virtual sea,<br/>
Let the cables be lit with the beacon of your Shillelagh,<br/>
In dire peril of bad luck I make this plea,<br/>
For an unknown evil lies near, I ween:<br/>
Oh Leprechaun, Leprechaun, please appear on my screen! </b>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
It worked. Neil crackled into view. After a short greeting I blurted out my concerns.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Nae worry. Nae worry. The International Chess Federation—FIDE—took the most important step to assure the fair play.</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Wait—I know the fair-play measures FIDE developed. I’ve been part of them. That didn’t assuage what I’d just said.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">FIDE put not just one but two Scotsmen on the tournament staff. One of them is in charge of fair play. Nae Leprechaun gan cross a Scotsman! </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
And with that Neil was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our hearts go out to all those affected more immediately than we so far. Amid all the worries, we wish you a happy and safe St. Patrick’s Day.</p>

    <title>Richard Guy passed away at the age of 103</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Richard Guy passed away on March 9, 2020 at the age of 103. Before he died he was the worlds oldest living mathematician (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_centenarians_(scientists_and_mathematicians)">here</a> for a list of centenarians who are famous scientists or mathematicians). He was also the oldest <i>active </i>mathematician-- he had a paper on arxiv (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03379">here</a>) in October of 2019.  (ADDED later since a commenter pointed it out to me--- a paper by Berlekamp and Guy posted in 2020: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03705">here</a>)<br/>
<br/>
I met him twice- once at a Gathering for Gardner, and once at an AMS meeting. I told him that Berlekamp-Conway-Guy had a great influence on me. He asked if it was a positive or negative influence. He also seemed to like my talk on The Muffin Problem, though he might have been being polite.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did a blog about Richard Guy on his 103rd birthday, so I recommend readers to go <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/09/richard-guy-is-102-years-old-today.html">there</a><br/>
for more about him.  One point I want to re-iterate:<br/>
<br/>
Richard Guy thought of himself of an amateur mathematician. If he means someone who does it for love of the subject then this is clearly true.  If it is a measure of how good he is (the term `amateur' is sometimes used as an insult) then it is clearly false. If it means someone who does not have formal training than it is partially true.<br/>

    <title>TR20-036 |  Strong (D)QBF Dependency Schemes via Tautology-free Resolution Paths | 

	Olaf Beyersdorff, 

	Joshua Blinkhorn, 

	Tomáš Peitl</title>
    <summary>We suggest a general framework to study dependency schemes for dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBF). As our main contribution, we exhibit a new tautology-free DQBF dependency scheme that generalises the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme. We establish soundness of the tautology-free scheme, implying that it can be used in any DQBF proof system. We further explore the power of DQBF resolution systems parameterised by dependency schemes and show that our new scheme results in exponentially shorter proofs in comparison to the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in the basic DQBF expansion proof system.

On QBFs, we demonstrate that our new scheme is exponentially stronger than the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in Q Resolution, thus resulting in the strongest QBF dependency scheme known to date.</summary>

    <title>TR20-035 |  No-Signaling MIPs and Faster-Than-Light Communication, Revisited | 

	Justin Holmgren</title>
    <summary>We revisit one original motivation for the study of no-signaling multi-prover
  interactive proofs (NS-MIPs): specifically, that two spatially separated
  provers are guaranteed to be no-signaling by the physical principle that
  information cannot travel from one point to another faster than light.

  We observe that with more than two provers, the physical connection between
  no-signaling and faster-than-light communication is more nuanced, depending on
  the relative positioning of the provers.  In particular, we observe that
  provers are guaranteed to be no-signaling if and only if their positions are
  convexly independent.  Other prover positionings provide weaker guaranteees.

  We consider a new issue that thus arises only in the many-prover setting:
  how precisely must provers be positioned in order to guarantee the
    soundness of a (NS-)MIP?  We prove that substantially more precision is
  required to guarantee full no-signaling than to guarantee soundness of a
  specific NS-MIP for PSPACE implicit in the work of Kalai and Raz (CRYPTO 2009).</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Things do not look that good, and these are difficult times. But here on the blog we have plenty of things to cheer you up and assure you. And today we point to two book proofs — two book proofs to the same theorem– and, as a matter of fact, two book proofs to the same theorem by the same person, <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/">Rom Pinchasi</a>.  One of the proofs, the one chosen for presentation, is by Rom Pinchasi and  <a href="http://polyanskii.com/">Alexandr Polyanskii</a>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rom Pinchasi has an immense proving power, both for difficult proofs at all costs, for book proofs, and for a large variety of proofs in between. (See, for example, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/a-discrepency-problem-for-planar-configurations/"> this post</a>.)</span></p>
<p>Before moving on, let me mention that there is a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/03/10/options-for-giving-math-talks-and-lectures-online/">timely blog post</a> by Terry Tao on Online teaching, and here is <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/349283/software-and-ideas-for-workshops-and-conferences-with-long-distance-participants">a related MO question about online conferences</a> that I asked last December.</p>
<h2>Proofs from the book</h2>
<p>Famously, the mathematician Paul Erdős, often referred to “The Book” in which God keeps the most elegant proof of each mathematical theorem. During a lecture in 1985, Erdős said, “You don’t have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book.” (And you do not have even to believe in the book to enjoy proofs from the book.)</p>
<h2>The Theorem: a 1978 conjecture by Erdős and Purdy</h2>
<p><strong>Theorem: </strong> Let <em>P</em> be a set of <em>n</em> points in general position in the plane. Suppose that <em>R</em> is a set of red points disjoint from <em>P</em> such that every line determined by <em>P</em> passes through a point in <em>R</em>. Then <em>|R|≥ n</em> for <em>n &gt; 6</em>.</p>
<p>This theorem settles a problem by Erdős and Purdy from 1978. Erdős and Purdy also asked about the case where the set of points is not required to be in general position. For that problem the best known lower bound, also proved by Rom Pinchasi, is <em>n/3</em>.</p>
<p>Book Proof I: <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EP_genpos.pdf">An algebraic solution of a problem of Erdős and Purdy</a>, by Rom Pinchasi</p>
<p>Book Proof II: <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EP_book.pdf">A one-page solution of a problem of Erdős and Purdy, by Rom Pinchasi and Alexandr Polyanskii</a></p>
<h2>Murty’s magic configurations conjecture.</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/magic.pdf">first proof of the Erdős-Purdy 1978 Conjecture</a> was achieved in 2008 by Eyal Ackerman, Kevin Buchin, Christian Knauer, Rom Pinchasi, and Günter Rote. They derived it from their solution to the 1971 conjecture on magic configurations by Murty. A planar set of points P is called magic if it possible to assign positive weights to the points so that the sum of weights in every line determined by the points is one. Murty conjectured that the only magic configurations are those in general position, and those which have a line missing at most one of the points, and a certain configuration of seven points.</p>
<h2>The Pinchasi-Polyanskii Book-Proof:</h2>
<p>Here, we very closely follow the Pinchasi-Polyanskii’s paper.</p>
<p>We say that a line is determined by a set of points in the plane if it contains at least two of the points. Since the points in P are in general position, each pair of points determines a different line.</p>
<p>Under the contrary assumption we must have <em>|R| = n−1</em>. Then it must be that every point in <em>R</em> is incident to precisely <em>n/2</em> lines determined by <em>P</em> and every line determined by <em>P</em> is incident to precisely one point in <em>R</em>. We would like to reach a contradiction.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Preliminary step: apply a projective transformation to the plane such that the convex hull of <em>P</em> becomes a triangle.</span></p>
<p><strong>Observation 1:</strong>  No point of R lies outside the convex hull of P.</p>
<p>Such a point <em>r</em> should be incident to two lines supporting the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Each of these supporting lines must contain precisely two points of <em>P</em>. Since the convex hull of <em>P</em> is a triangle this is impossible.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Regard the points in the plane as complex numbers. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">(This is really cool. I am not aware of many examples in discrete geometry that thinking about planar points as complex numbers helps.)</span></p>
<p>Notation: for every point<em> p</em> in the plane we denote by <img alt="p_x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p_x"/>  the <em>x</em>-coordinate of <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Crucial definition: For every point <em>p ∈ P</em> deﬁne</p>
<p><img alt="f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p-r) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p-p')." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28p%29+%3D+%5Cprod_%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D%28p-r%29+%2F+%5Cprod_%7Bp%27+%5Cin+P%5Cbackslash+%5C%7Bp%5C%7D%7D%28p-p%27%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p-r) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p-p')."/></p>
<p><strong>Observation 2:</strong> <em>f(p)</em> is a real number!</p>
<p>The proof will surely make you smile: For every <em>p’ ∈ P \{p}</em> there is a unique <em>r ∈ R</em> such that <em>p, p’</em>, and <em>r</em> are collinear. So <em>(p-r)/(p-p’)</em> is real. And the big ratio between products split to many small fractions that are all real.  <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Walla!</strong></span></p>
<p>Note that <em>f(p)</em> is thus also invariant under rotations of the plane.</p>
<p>Now, if the vertical line through p does not contain any other point in P ∪ R, then, for the unique <em>r ∈ R</em> such that <em>p, p’</em>, and<em> r</em> are collinear, we have that:</p>
<p><img alt="(1)~~~(p-r)/(p-p')~=~(p_x-r_x)/(p_x-p'_x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%29%7E%7E%7E%28p-r%29%2F%28p-p%27%29%7E%3D%7E%28p_x-r_x%29%2F%28p_x-p%27_x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(1)~~~(p-r)/(p-p')~=~(p_x-r_x)/(p_x-p'_x)"/>.</p>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<p><strong>Observation 3:</strong>  if the vertical line through <em>p</em> does not contain any other point in <em>P ∪ R</em>, then</p>
<p><img alt="(2)~~~ f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p_x-r_x) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p_x-p'_x)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282%29%7E%7E%7E+f%28p%29+%3D+%5Cprod_%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D%28p_x-r_x%29+%2F+%5Cprod_%7Bp%27+%5Cin+P%5Cbackslash+%5C%7Bp%5C%7D%7D%28p_x-p%27_x%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(2)~~~ f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p_x-r_x) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p_x-p'_x)."/></p>
<p><strong>Crucial observation 4:</strong>  Let <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> be any two points in <em>P</em> and let <em>r</em> be the unique point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>p</em> and<em> q</em>. Then</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>f(p)/f(q)=-(p-r)/(q-r).</em></h3>
<p>To see this rotate the plane so that the x-coordinates of <em>p,q</em>, and <em>r</em> are equal (or nearly equal) and apply Equations (2) and (1). (You will get the same, or nearly the same, contributions for <em>r’ ≠ r</em>  and you are left with the contribution for <em>r</em>. ) This also leads to:</p>
<p><strong>Observation 5:</strong> <em>f(p)/f(q)</em> <em>&gt;0</em>  if and only if the unique point <em>r ∈ R</em> that is collinear with <em>p</em> and<em> q</em> lies in the straight line segment delimited by <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>.</p>
<h3>A complete graph with green and red edges.</h3>
<p>Consider the complete graph <em>G</em> whose vertices are the points in <em>P</em>. For every two points <em>p, q ∈ P</em> we color the edge connecting  <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>red</strong></span> if the unique point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> lies outside the straight line segment connecting <em>p</em> and<em> q. </em>Otherwise we color the edge <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>green</strong></span>. In other words, the edge is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span></strong> if<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> f(p)/f(q) &lt; 0</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: #339966;">green</span></strong> if <strong><span style="color: #339966;">f(p)/f(q) &gt; 0</span></strong>.</p>
<p>The vertices of G can naturally be partitioned into two sets:<i> U = {p ∈ P | f(p) &gt; 0}</i> and<i> W = {p ∈ P | f(p) &lt; 0}</i>.</p>
<p>Without loss of generality assume that the three vertices of the convex hull of P belong to <em>U</em>. (Since no point of R is outside this convex hull all edges of the triangle forming the convex hull are green.)</p>
<p><strong>Observation 6:</strong> <em>|U| = n/2 + 1.</em></p>
<p>To see this let <em>a,b</em> ∈ <em>U</em> be two vertices of the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Let <em>c</em> ∈ <em>R</em> be the point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. The point <em>c</em> must be between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the boundary of the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Therefore, all the other n/2 −1 pairs of points of <em>P</em> that are collinear with c must form red edges. Consequently, precisely one point of every such pair belongs to U. Together with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, we obtain <em>|U| = n/2+1</em>.</p>
<p><strong>End of proof:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-19479"/></p>
<p>Consider now any triangulation of the convex hull of <em>P</em> using all the vertices of <em>U</em>. This triangulation contains precisely <em>3|U|−6</em> edges all of which correspond to green edges in the graph <em>G</em>. Each edge in the triangulation contains a unique point in <em>R</em>. Therefore,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>|R|≥ 3|1|−6 = 3n/2 −3.</em></p>
<p>This expression is greater than or equal to <em>n</em> for every <em>n ≥ 6</em>, as desired. <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>ahla!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">(Good old Euler’s theorem is used.)</span></p>
<h2>Related things.</h2>
<p>Yesterday, our PM explained on TV what geometric (exponential) growth is.  If I try to describe related results and problems to the theorem presented here, and move on to related results and problems to those and so on, the amount of beautiful results from discrete geometry will grow exponentially but this post will never be completed.</p>
<p>So let me mention just a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The result is related to the Motzkin-Rabin Colorful Sylvester-Gallai theorem. Given a set of red points and blue points in the plane, not all on a line, the Motzkin-Rabin theorem asserts that there is a line that contains two or more points in the set, such that all the points on the line have the same color.</li>
<li>Starting with the Sylvester-Gallai theorem itself, there is a rich Gallai-Sylvester theory, with recent deep connections to the theory of computing; My <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4661/the-sylvester-gallai-theorem-and-sections-of-varieties-with-simple-topology">third MathOverflow question</a> was about a Sylvester-Gallai type problem and here is a link to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4661/the-sylvester-gallai-theorem-and-sections-of-varieties-with-simple-topology#comment8133_4661">Greg Kuperberg remark</a>‘s regarding potential Gylvester-Kalai theorems.</li>
<li>Let me mention the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/on-sets-defining-few-ordinary-lines/">2012 solution by Ben Green and Terry Tao</a> of the ordinary line conjecture and the Orchard conjecture.</li>
<li>Let me mention the proof of Andreii Kupavskii and Alexandr Polyanskii to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3694.pdf">Shur’s conjecture</a>.</li>
<li>Here is a <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EPnCubic_s2.pdf">link to a very recent paper</a> by Chaya Keller and Rom Pinchasi. There they make the following <strong>bold conjecture</strong>: Let <em>P</em> be a set of n points in general position and and let <em>R</em> be a set of n points disjoint from P. If every line determined by P passes through a point in<em> R,</em> then <em>P </em>∪<em> R</em> is contained in a cubic curve.</li>
<li>There is, of course the famous book by Martin Aigner and Günter Ziegler: Proofs from the book.</li>
<li>At some point I tried to interest Günter with a companion book: The book of examples. We did not proceed with this project but this motivated my successful <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4994/fundamental-examples">MathOverflow questions about fundamental examples</a>.</li>
<li>Eventually, Günter and I decided to write instead: the book of examples of polytopes. We went as far as writing a list of chapters of the book! (Which is a very advanced stage of writing a book, I suppose.)</li>
<li>When I took a class for high-school students interested in mathematics, the Sylvester problem was a starred problem in the first problem set and the assertion of the Motzkin-Rabin colored theorem was a double starred problem. Among the 20-30 students none of us found a (correct) solution. (We referred to it in a trivia question in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/natis-influence/">this post</a>.) Years later, I gave the same class and gave the same starred problems, and one student managed to prove the Gallai-Sylvester theorem. Can you guess who he was?</li>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>When I launched bit-player.org in 2006, displaying any sort of mathematical notation on the web was torture. I would typeset an equation in LaTeX, convert the output to a JPEG image, upload the image file to a directory on the server, and embed a reference to the file in an HTML <code>img</code> tag. The process was cumbersome and the product was ugly. In 2009 I wrote <a href="http://bit-player.org/bph-publications/AmSci-2009-03-Hayes-webmath.pdf">an <em>American Scientist</em> article</a> whining about this sorry state of affairs—but at just that moment an elegant solution was coming on the scene. Davide Cervone of Union College had created a program called jsMath, which could process TeX commands placed directly in an HTML document. For example, I could write:</p>
<pre style="text-align: center;"><code>e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots</code></pre>
<p>and it would appear on your screen as:</p>
<p>\[e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots\]</p>
<p class="undent">All the work of parsing the TeX code and typesetting the math was done by a JavaScript program downloaded into your browser along with the rest of the web page.</p>
<p>Cervone’s jsMath soon evolved into <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/mathjax">open-source project</a> initially supported by the AMS and SIAM. There are now about two dozen sponsors, and the project is under the aegis of <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>. From the MathJax web page: “The MathJax team consists of Davide Cervone and Volker Sorge. Regular contributors include Christian Lawson-Perfect, Omar Al-Ithawi, and Peter Krautzberger.”Cervone remains the principal author, though not the only contributor.</p>
<p>MathJax has made a big difference in my working life, transforming a problem into a pleasure. Putting math on the web is fun! Sometimes I do it just to show off. Furthermore, the software has served as an inspiration as well as a helpful tool. Until I saw MathJax in action, it simply never occurred to me that interesting computations could be done within the JavaScript environment of a web browser, which I had thought was there mainly to make things blink and jiggle. With the example of MathJax in front of me, I realized that I could not only display mathematical ideas but also explore and animate them within a web page.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Last fall I began hearing rumors about MathJax 3.0, “a complete rewrite of MathJax from the ground up using modern techniques.” It’s the kind of announcement that inspires both excitement and foreboding. What will the new version add? What will it take away? What will it fix? What will it break?</p>
<p>Before committing all of bit-player to the new version, I thought I would try a small-scale experiment. I have a standalone web page that makes particularly tricky use of MathJax. The page is a repository of the <a href="https://bit-player.github.io/dotster/">Dotster</a> programs extracted from a recent bit-player post, <a href="http://bit-player.org/2019/my-god-its-full-of-dots">My God, it’s full of dots</a>. In January I got the Dotster page running with MathJax 3.</p>
<p>Most math in web documents is static content: An equation needs to be formatted once, when the page is first displayed, and it never changes after that. The initial type­setting is handled automatically by MathJax, in both the old and the new versions. As soon as the page is downloaded from the server, MathJax makes a pass through the entire text, identifying elements flagged as TeX code and replacing them with typeset math. Once that job is done, MathJax can go to sleep.</p>
<p>The Dotster programs are a little different; they include equations that change dynamically in response to user input. Here’s an example:</p>


<p>The slider on the left sets a numerical value that gets plugged into the two equation on the right. Each time the slider is moved, the equations need to be updated and reformatted. Thus with each change to the slider setting, MathJax has to wake up from its slumbers and run again to typeset the altered content.</p>
<p>The MathJax program running in the little demo above is the older version, 2.7. Cosmetically, the result is not ideal. With each change in the slider value, the two equations contract a bit, as if pinched between somebody’s fingers, and then snap back to their original size. They seem to wink at us. The progress banner would normally appear in the lower left corner of the browser window, where it is less intrusive. It has a more prominent position here because the demo is encapsulated in an iFrame, which acts as a window within the window. This structure is necessary in order to run two versions of MathJax in a single page. Also, a small gray progress indicator pops up in the lower left corner and hangs around just long enough to grab your attention. It says: “Typesetting math: 100%.” I find these visual distractions pretty annoying. They are analogous to the dreaded FOUC—the “flash of unstyled content”—that appears when a web browser displays the text of a page before the associated stylesheets are fully loaded and processed.</p>
<p>The winking effect is caused by a MathJax feature called Fast Preview. The system does a quick-and-dirty rendering of the math content without calculating <img alt="Math settings submenus" border="0" class="alignright" height="180" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/math-settings-submenus.png" width="350"/> the correct final sizes for the various typographic ele­ments. (Evi­dently that calculation takes a little time). You can turn off Fast Preview by right-clicking or control-clicking one of the equa­tions and then navigating through the sub­menus shown at right. How­ever, you’ll probably judge the result to be worse rather than better. Without Fast Preview, you’ll get a  glimpse of the raw TeX commands. Instead of winking, the equations do jumping jacks.</p>
<p>I am delighted to report that all of this visual noise has been eliminated in the new MathJax. On changing a slider setting, the equations are updated in place, with no unnecessary visual fuss. And there’s no need for a progress indication, because the change is so quick it appears to be instantaneous. See for yourself:</p>


<p>Thus version 3 looks like a big win. There’s a caveat: Getting it to work did not go quite as smoothly as I had hoped. Nevertheless, this is a story with a happy ending.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you have only static math content in your documents, making the switch to MathJax 3 is easy. In your HTML file you change a URL to load the new MathJax version, and convert any configuration options to a new format. As it happens, all the default options work for me, so I had nothing to convert. What’s most important about the upgrade path is what you <em>don’t</em> need to do. In most cases you should not have to alter any of the TeX commands present in the HTML files being processed by MathJax. (There are a <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#input-changes">few small exceptions</a>.)</p>
<p>With dynamic content, further steps are needed. Here is the JavaScript statement I used to reawaken the typesetting engine in MathJax version 2.7:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset", MathJax.Hub, mathjax_demo_box]);
</code></pre>
<p>The statement enters a <code>Typeset</code> command into a queue of pending tasks. When the command reaches the front of the queue, MathJax will typeset any math found inside the HTML element designated by the identifier <code>mathjax_demo_box</code>, ignoring the rest of the document.</p>
<p>In MathJax 3, the <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/typeset.html#typesetting-math-in-a-web-page">documentation</a> suggested I could simply replace this command with a slightly different and more direct one:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>MathJax.typeset([mathjax_demo_box]);
</code></pre>
<p>I did that. It didn’t work. When I moved the slider, the displayed math reverted to raw TeX form, and I found an error message in the JavaScript console:</p>
<p><img alt="AppendChild null error 530x170" border="0" class="centered" height="170" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/appendChild-null-error-530x170.png" width="530"/></p>
<p>What has gone wrong here? JavaScript’s <code>appendChild</code> method adds a new node to the treelike structure of an HTML document. It’s like hanging an ornament from some specified branch of a Christmas tree. The error reported here indicates that the specified branch does not exist; it is <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s not tarry over my various false starts and wrong turns as I puzzled over the source of this bug. I eventually found the cause and the solution in the “issues” section of the MathJax repository on GitHub. Back in September of last year Mihai Borobocea had <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2191">reported a similar problem</a>, along with the interesting observation that the error occurs only when an existing TeX expression is being replaced in a document, not when a new expression is being added. Borobocea had also discovered that invoking the procedure <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> before <code>MathJax.typeset()</code> would prevent the error.</p>
<p>A comment by Cervone explains much of what’s going on:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are correct that you should use <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> if you have removed previously typeset math from the page. (In version 3, there is information stored about the math in a list of typeset expressions, and if you remove typeset math from the page and replace it with new math, that list will hold pointers to math that no longer exists in the page. That is what is causing the error you are seeing . . . )</p></blockquote>
<p>I found that adding <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> did indeed eliminate the error. As a practical matter, that solved my problem. But Borobocea pointed out a remaining loose end. Whereas <code>MathJax.typeset([mathjax_demo_box])</code> operates only on the math inside a specific container, <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> destroys the list of math objects for the entire document, an act that might later have unwanted consequences. Thus it seemed best to reformat all the math in the document whenever any one expression changes. This is inefficient, but with the 20-some equations in the Dotster web page the typesetting is so fast there’s no perceptible delay.</p>
<p>In January a fix for this problem was merged into MathJax 3.0.1, which is now the shipping version. Cervone’s comment on this change says that it “prevents the error message,” which left me with the impression that it might suppress the message without curing the error itself. But as far as I can tell the entire issue has been cleared up. There’s no longer any need to invoke <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In my first experiments with version 3.0 I stumbled onto another bit of weirdness, but it turned out to be a quirk of my own code, not something amiss in MathJax. </p>
<p>I was seeing occasional size variations in typeset math that seemed reminiscent of the winking problem in version 2.7. <img alt="large and small math superimposed" border="0" class="alignright" height="99" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/zs-large-and-small-math.png" width="159"/>Sometimes the initial, automatic typesetting would leave the equations in a slightly smaller size; they would grow back to normal as soon as <code>MathJax.typeset()</code> was applied. In the image at right I have superimposed the two states, with the correct, larger image colored red. It looks like Fast Preview has come back to haunt us, but that can’t be right, because Fast Preview has been removed entirely from version 3.</p>
<p>My efforts to solve this mystery turned into quite a debugging debacle. I got a promising clue from an exchange on the <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax-docs/wiki/Dealing-with-display:none">MathJax wiki</a>, discussing size anomalies when math is composed inside an HTML element temporarily flagged <code>display: none</code>, a style rule that makes the math invisible. In that circumstance MathJax has no information about the surrounding text, and so it leaves the typeset math in a default state. The same mechanism might account for what I was seeing—except that my page has no elements with a <code>display: none</code> style.</p>
<p>I first observed this problem in the Chrome browser, where it is intermittent; when I repeatedly reloaded the page, the small type would appear about one time out of five. What fun! It takes multiple trials just to know whether an attempted fix has had any effect. Thus I was pleased to discover that in Firefox the shrunken type appears consistently, every time the page is loaded. Testing became a great deal easier.</p>
<p>I soon found a cure, though not a diagnosis. While browsing again in the MathJax issues archive and in a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/mathjax-users">MathJax user forum</a>, I came across suggestions to try a different form of output, with mathematical expressions constructed not from text elements in HTML and style rules in CSS but from paths drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics, or SVG. I found that the SVG expressions were stable and consistent in size, and in other respects indistinguishable from their HTML siblings. Again my problem was solved, but I still wanted to know the underlying cause.</p>
<p>Here’s where the troubleshooting report gets a little embarrassing. Thinking I might have a new bug to report, I set out to build a minimal exemplar—the smallest and simplest program that would trigger the bug. I failed. I was starting from a blank page and adding more and more elements of the original program—<code>div</code>s nested inside <code>div</code>s in the HTML, various stylesheet rules in the CSS, bigger collections of more complex equations—but none of these additions produced the slightest glitch in typesetting. So I tried working in the other direction, starting with the complex misbehaving program and stripping away elements until the problem disappeared. But it didn’t disappear, even when I reduced the page to a single equation in a plain white box.</p>
<p>As often happens, I found the answer not by banging my head against the problem but by going for a walk. Out in the fresh air, I finally noticed the one oddity that distinguished the failing program from all of the correctly working ones. Because the Dotster program began life embedded in a WordPress blog post, I could not include a link to the CSS stylesheet in the <code>head</code> section of the HTML file. Instead, a JavaScript function constructed the link and inserted it into the <code>head</code>. That happened <em>after</em> MathJax made its initial pass over the text. At the time of typesetting, the elements in which the equations were placed had no styles applied, and so MathJax had no way of determining appropriate sizes.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When Don Knuth unveiled TeX, circa 1980, I was amazed. Back then, typewriter-style word processing was impressive enough. TeX did much more: real typesetting, with multiple fonts (which Knuth also had to create from scratch), automatic hyphenation and justification, and beautiful mathematics.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, when Cervone created MathJax, I was amazed again—though perhaps not for the right reasons. I had supposed that the major programming challenge would be capturing all the finicky rules and heuristics for building up math expressions—placing and sizing superscripts, adjusting the height and width of parentheses or a radical sign to match the dimensions of the expression enclosed, spacing and aligning the elements of a matrix. Those are indeed nontrivial tasks, but they are just the beginning. My recent adventures have helped me see that another major challenge is making TeX work in an alien environment.</p>
<p>In classic TeX, the module that typesets equations has direct access to everything it might ever need to know about the surrounding text—type sizes, line spacing, column width, the amount of interword “glue” needed to justify a line of type. Sharing this information is easy because all the formatting is done by the same program. MathJax faces a different situation. Formatting duties are split, with MathJax handling mathematical content but the browser’s layout engine doing everything else. Indeed, the document is written in two different languages, TeX for the math and HTML/CSS for the rest. Coordinating actions in the two realms is not straightforward.</p>
<p>There are other complications of importing TeX into a web page. The classic TeX system runs in batch mode. It takes some inputs, produces its output, and then quits. Batch processing would not offer a pleasant experience in a web browser. The entire user interface (such as the buttons and sliders in my Dotster programs) would be frozen for the duration. To avoid this kind of rudeness to the user, MathJax is never allowed to monopolize JavaScript’s single thread of execution for more than a fraction of a second. To ensure this cooperative behavior, earlier versions relied on a hand-built scheme of queues (where procedures wait their turn to execute) and callbacks (which signal when a task is complete). Version 3 takes advantage of a new JavaScript construct called a <em>promise</em>. When a procedure cannot compute a result immediately, it hands out a promise, which it then redeems when the result becomes available.</p>
<p>Wait, there’s more! MathJax is not just a TeX system. It also accepts input written in MathML, a dialect of XML specialized for mathematical notation. Indeed, the internal language of MathJax is based on MathML. And MathJax can also be configured to handle <a href="http://asciimath.org/">AsciiMath</a>, a cute markup language that aims to make even the raw form of an expression readable. Think of it as math with emoticons: Type <code>`oo`</code> and you’ll get \(\infty\), or <code>`:-`</code> for \(\div\).</p>
<p>MathJax also provides an extensive suite of tools for accessibility. Visually impaired readers can have an equation read aloud. As I learned at the January Joint Math Meetings, there are even provisions for generating Braille output—but that’s a subject that deserves a post of its own.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When I first encountered MathJax, I saw it as a marvel, but I also considered it a workaround or stopgap. Reading a short document that includes a single equation entails downloading the entire MathJax program, which can be much larger than the document itself. And you need to download it all again for every other mathy document (unless your browser cache hangs onto a copy). What an appalling waste of bandwidth. </p>
<p>Several alternatives seemed more promising as a long-term solution. The best approach, it seemed to me then, was to have support for mathematical notation built into the browser. Modern browsers handle images, audio, video, SVG, animations—why not math? But it hasn’t happened. Firefox and Safari have limited support for MathML; none of the browsers I know are equipped to deal with TeX.</p>
<p>Another strategy that once seemed promising was the browser plugin. A plugin could offer the same capabilities as MathJax, but you would download and install it only once. This sounds like a good deal for readers, but it’s not so attractive for the author of web content. If there are multiple plugins in circulation, they are sure to have quirks, and you need to accommodate all of them. Furthermore, you need some sort of fallback plan for those who have not installed a plugin.</p>
<p>Still another option is to run MathJax on the server, rather than sending the whole program to the browser. The document arrives with TeX or MathML already converted to HTML/CSS or SVG for display. This is the preferred modus operandi for several large websites, most notably Wikipedia. I’ve considered it for bit-player, but it has a drawback: Running on the server, MathJax cannot provide the kind of on-demand typesetting seen in the demos above.</p>
<p>As the years go by, I am coming around to the view that MathJax is not just a useful stopgap while we wait for the right thing to come along; it’s quite a good approximation to the right thing. As the author of a web page, I get to write mathematics in a familiar and well-tested notation, and I can expect that any reader with an up-to-date browser will see output that’s much like what I see on my own screen. At the same time, the reader also has control over how the math is rendered, via the context menu. And the program offers accessibility features that I could never match on my own.</p>
<p>To top it off, the software is open-source—freely available to everyone. That is not just an economic advantage but also a social one. The project has a community that stands ready to fix bugs, listen to suggestions and complaints, offer help and advice. Without that resource, I would still be struggling with the hitches and hiccups described above.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-034 |  On Proof complexity of Resolution over Polynomial Calculus | 

	Erfan Khaniki</title>
    <summary>The refutation system ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ is a natural extension of resolution refutation system such that it operates with disjunctions of degree $d$ polynomials over ring $R$ with boolean variables. For $d=1$, this system is called ${Res}_R({lin})$. Based on properties of $R$, ${Res}_R({lin})$ systems can be too strong to prove lower bounds for CNFs with current methods. The reachable goal might be proving lower bounds for ${Res}_R({lin})$ when $R$ is a finite field such as $\mathbb{F}_2$. Interestingly, ${Res}_{\mathbb{F}_2}({lin})$ is also fairly strong, and there is no known nontrivial lower bound for it, but for ${Res}^*_R({lin})$ (tree-like ${Res}_R({lin})$) we know exponential lower bounds for every finite field.
 For the stronger systems ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ and ${Res}_R^*({PC}_d)$ for $d&gt;1$ on finite ring $R$, there is no known lower bounds till now. In this paper we will investigate these refutation systems and make some progress toward understanding these systems, including the case $d=1$. We prove a size-width relation for ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ and ${Res}^*_R({PC}_d)$ for every finite ring $R$. This relation is proved by a new idea to reduce the problem to the original Ben-Sasson and Wigderson size-width relation for ${Res}$ and ${Res}^*$ using extension variables. As a by product, we get the following new lower bounds for every finite field $\mathbb{F}$:
(1) We prove the first nontrivial lower bounds for ${Res}_\mathbb{F}({PC}_d)$ for fixed $d$: a nearly quadratic lower bounds for mod $q$ Tseitin formulas ($char(\mathbb{F})\neq q$) for suitable graphs.
(2) We also prove superpolynomial and exponential lower bounds for ${Res}^*_\mathbb{F}({PC}_{d})$ where $d$ is not too large with respect to $n$ for the following principles:
 (a) mod $q$ Tseitin formulas ($char(\mathbb{F})\neq q$),
 (b) Random $k$-CNFs.</summary>

<p><strong>In the beginning of the year 1665 I found the method of approximating series and the rule for reducing any dignity [power] of any binomial into such a series. The same year in May I found the method of tangents of Gregory and Slusius, and in November had the direct method of fluxions and the next year [1666] in January had the theory of colours and in May following I had entrance into the inverse method of fluxions. And the same year I began to think of gravity extending to the orb of the moon … All this was in the two plague years of 1665 and 1666, for in those days I was in the prime of my age for invention and minded Mathematics and Philosophy more than at any time since.</strong></p>



<p>Today’s Coronavirus pandemic is probably the first in history that’s been fought with telecommunication.  People are advised to work remotely, and many universities are switching to online courses.  Besides the suffering and horror, it is also an opportunity <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/02/18/working-remotely-will-be-the-most-significant-transformation-since-agriculture/">to realize that many things can be done remotely just as well if not better, change our lifestyle, and stop polluting the environment.</a></p></div>

<p>
Robert Dorfman was a professor of political economy at Harvard University, who helped create the notion of group testing. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss this notion and its possible application to the current epidemic crisis. We also discuss other mathematical aspects that have clear and immediate value.  <font color="red"><b>Update 03/19/20:</b></font> Israel Cidon in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109506">comment</a> links to an actual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxs11ryS9Dg&amp;feature=emb_logo">implementation</a> of group testing for the virus up to 64 samples from the Technion.<br/>
<span id="more-16778"/></p>
<p>
The novel coronavirus (and its disease <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19</a>) is the nasty issue we all face today. I live in New York City and can see the reduced foot traffic every day. The issue is discussed every minute on the news. I hope you are all safe, and well. But we are all worried about this. </p>
<p>
The point of group testing is that it can reduce the number of tests needed to find out who has the virus. I assume that we are not using Dorfman’s idea because it does not apply to today’s testing. But it seems like it could fit. One issue is the need for more individual testing kits. As we write this, the US is still well short of the needed supply of kits. Are there situations where group testing can still help economize?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Group Testing </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Dorfman created the notion of <em>group testing</em> in 1943. You could say he was driven by the need to test light bulbs:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16781" height="188" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png?w=300&amp;h=188" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>As Wikipedia group-testing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_testing">article</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> [Suppose] one is searching for a broken bulb among six light bulbs. Here, the first three are connected to a power supply, and they light up (A). This indicates that the broken bulb must be one of the last three (B). If instead the bulbs did not light up, one could be sure that the broken bulb was among the first three. Continuing this procedure can locate the broken bulb in no more than three tests, compared to a maximum of six tests if the bulbs are checked individually. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Okay, Dorfman’s motivation was not light bulbs. It was testing soldiers during WWII for a certain disease, that will go unnamed. This type of testing reduced the number of blood samples needed. What was analogous to connecting groups of light bulbs into one circuit was combining portions of individual blood samples into one sample. If it tested negative then that entire group could be dismissed without further testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Fewer Kits </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The point of using group testing is made stark when you think about recent issues with cruise ships. On one ship there were around <img alt="{3500}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3500}"/> passengers who were eventually found to be almost all okay. I believe only <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/> were infected. This could have been checked by group testing with many fewer than <img alt="{3500}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3500}"/> tests. </p>
<p>
According to the current outbreak <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html">maps</a>, known <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#us">cases</a> in the US are still fairly sparse. Those in New York are mainly in the city, Westchester, and along the Hudson River to Albany. Let’s say we wish assurance that all non-virus related admits to a hospital are free of the virus. Can group testing apply?</p>
<p>
The original version of group testing would apply if it were deemed mandatory that all new admits give a blood sample. Some kinds of coronavirus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing">test kits</a> use blood samples. Taking blood samples might however be as costly and intrusive as having the individual tests to begin with. There are other kinds of tests involving taking swabs, but it is not apparent whether those samples can be combined at scale as readily as blood samples can.</p>
<p>
At least the <em>idea</em> of group testing has interesting connections to other parts of theory. Here is a 2000 <a href="https://www.cs.umn.edu/sites/cs.umn.edu/files/tech_reports/00-007.pdf">survey</a> by Ken’s former Buffalo colleague Hung Ngo with his PhD advisor, Ding-Zhu Du, where the application is to large scale screening of DNA samples. Hung and Ken’s colleague Atri Rudra taught a <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2011/709/">course</a> in Buffalo on group testing in relation to <em>compressed sensing</em>. More recent is a 2015 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7308980">paper</a> that tries to solve problems of counting the number of positive cases, not just whether they exist. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Other Mathematical Effects </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
As we write, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has just declared a cap of 500 attendees for any assembly. This is forcing the suspension of Broadway shows among many other activities. Yesterday the entire SUNY system joined numerous other institutions in moving to distance-only learning after this week.  </p>
<p>
The cap is based on the likelihood of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> persons including someone who is already infected. That likelihood in turn is based on the density of known cases and what is known about the proportion of unknown to known cases. The virus has a long (two weeks) incubation time during which it is contagious but not symptomatic.</p>
<p>
Here is a graph from a PSA <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> posted just today by Alex Tabarrok for the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog (note that the calculations are by <a href="https://biosciences.gatech.edu/people/joshua-weitz">Joshua</a> <a href="http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/">Weitz</a> of Georgia Tech):</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-16782" height="425" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg?w=550&amp;h=425" width="550"/></a></p>
<p>
The <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>-axis is the number of cases (in proportion to the US on the whole) and the <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>-axis is the group size. Which axis is more important—has more effect on the danger? Tabarrok notes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Now here is the most important point. It’s the size of the group, not the number of carriers that most drives the result. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This involves comparing two partial derivatives. The <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> gives a brief worked-out example without using calculus. </p>
<p>
I, Ken, have been connected this week to another example. I was statistically monitoring the World Senior Team Chess Championship, which began last Friday in Prague. Almost 500 players in teams of 4 or 5 players took part. Initially the players were roughly evenly divided between two halls. Effective Tuesday, a cap of 100 was declared for the Czech Republic, so more playing rooms were found and spectators were banned. Today, however, after an update on the density of cases in the Czech Republic, the cap was lowered to 30 effective tomorrow.  Thus the tournament was forced to finish today, two rounds earlier than planned. Even though chess events have a lower size footprint than all of the spectator sports whose seasons have been suspended in recent days, the growth of the outbreak is making cancellation the only reasonable policy for all but the smallest events.</p>
<p>
The main purpose of these and other <em>social isolation</em> measures is to flatten out the growth of cases. The target is not just to contain the outbreak but also to stay below the number of serious cases that our treatment systems can bear at once. Here is one of numerous versions of a <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/flattening-curve-for-covid-19-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-you-help">graphic</a> that is being widely circulated:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-16783" height="223" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg?w=400&amp;h=223" width="400"/></a></p>
<p>
The graphic is not necessarily talking about reducing the number of cases <em>total</em>. The area under both curves is the same. A sentence in accompanying article—</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If individuals and communities take steps to slow the virus’s spread, that means the number of cases of COVID-19 will stretch out across a longer period of time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
—seems to imply that “the number of cases” is the same in both scenarios, but stretched out over time in the latter. The point is how the stretching keeps the <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>-value bounded.  <b>Update 3/15:</b> To complete the thoughts here, we <i>should</i> be talking about reducing the number of cases—see <a href="https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727">this</a>.</p>
<p>
We certainly hope that isolation can reduce that number—i.e., that containment data out of Southeast Asia in particular holds true, as opposed to fears being voiced in the West that the virus will spread to a large percentage of the population over time. See charts <a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca">here</a>, especially chart 7.  This tracking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/22/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/?arc404=true">map</a> has free access and is updated daily.</p>
<p>
What governs the spreading process? This is being understood via simple mathematical models of contagion, such as come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory">percolation theory</a> and its associated <img alt="{R_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R_0}"/> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895684/">factor</a>. Almost a month ago, the Washington Post made an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/coronavirus-how-epidemics-spread-and-end/">interactive</a> showing how epidemics spread according to the parameters in these models. How and whether the COVID-19 pandemic follows these models remains to be seen. Of course we hope it stays on the better side of the equations.  <b>Update 3/15:</b> This new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">animation</a> from the Washington Post shows how the “better side” can arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is group testing a practical <em>mechanism</em> for mapping and constraining the epidemic? How can we promote the understanding of mechanisms and equations and models, not only for those shaping policy but for us who must abide by it and know why.</p>
<p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Harvard University, as well most other places that I know of will be moving to remote lectures. I just gave the last in-person lecture in my <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">cryptography course</a>. I would appreciate technical suggestions on the best format for teaching remotely. At the moment I plan to use Zoom and log-in from both my laptop (for the video) and from my iPad pro (for the interactive whiteboard).  </p>



<p>The one silver lining is that more lectures will be available online. In particular, if you’re teaching algorithms, you might find <a href="https://gt-algorithms.com/">Eric Vigoda’s videos helpful</a>. (If you know of more sources, please let us know.)</p>



<p>I was hoping that reducing meetings and activities will be good for research, but currently find it hard to concentrate on anything except this train-wreck of a situation. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff3affea-63c7-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5">financial times</a> has a chart that summarizes the progress of the  disease in several countries:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7646" src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/http___com.ft_.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.png?w=700"/></figure>



<p>The number of confirmed cases grows by about 33% each day. This growth in confirmed cases is partially due to increased testing  as cases increase – there is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext">some evidence</a>  that the doubling time of the disease (time between <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> infected people to <img alt="2n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2n"/> infected) is about 6 days (rather than the 2.4 days that this figure suggest). However, a doubling time of 6 days still means that the number of cases grows 10-fold in a month, and so if there are 10K actual cases in the U.S., today, there would be 100K by mid April and 1M by mid May.</p>



<p/>



<p>Strong quarantine regimes, contact tracing, and drastically reducing activity and increasing “social distance” can very significantly reduce the base of this exponent. Reducing the base of the exponent is more than simply “delaying the inevitable”. The mortality statistics mask the fact that this can be a very serious illness even for the people who don’t die of it – about 5% of the cases need intensive care (see this <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/12/covid-19-is-rapidly-spreading-in-america-the-country-does-not-look-ready">Economist article</a>). Spreading the infections over time will enable the healthcare system to handle the increased caseload, which will completely overwhelm it otherwise.</p>



<p>Such steps are clearly much easier to achieve before the number of cases is too large to be manageable, but despite having “advance warning” from other countries, this lesson does not seem at the moment to have sunk in, at least here in the U.S. At the moment no such initiatives are taken at the federal level, the states are doing more but still not enough, and it’s up to private companies and institutions to come up with their own policies. As faculty and citizens there is not much we can do about it except support such decisions even when they are <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/12/parents-petition-coronavirus-measure/">unpopular</a>, and just try to make the remote experience as good as possible for us, our colleagues, and our students.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-033 |  New Exponential Size Lower Bounds against Depth Four Circuits of Bounded Individual Degree | 

	Suryajith Chillara</title>
    <summary>Kayal, Saha and Tavenas [Theory of Computing, 2018] showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size $n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases. Further, the bound is superpolynomial only when $\delta$ is $o(d)$. It is natural to ask if the dependence on $\delta$ in the bound could be weakened. Towards this, in an earlier result [STACS, 2020], we showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d = \Theta(\log^2{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{0.2}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\log{n})}$.

  In this paper, we make further progress by proving that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$, and absolute constants $a$ and $b$ such that $\omega(\log^2n)\leq d\leq n^{a}$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{b}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Our bound is obtained by carefully adapting the proof of Kumar and Saraf [SIAM J. Computing, 2017] to the complexity measure introduced in our earlier work [STACS, 2020].</summary>
