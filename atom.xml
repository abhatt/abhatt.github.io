Thomas Keller and Heiko Rölke led a team at the University of Applied Sciences in Graubünden, Switzerland, that set a new record for the computation of <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> last August. They computed 62.8 trillion digits of <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The last ten digits they obtained are 7817924264.</p>
<p>
Today, we wish people Happy Pi Day amid wishes for happier days overall.</p>
<p>
Pi Day needs the day to be written American-style as 3/14/22. In international style it would be 31/4/22, but April does not have 31 days. This year involves the numerator of the simplest serviceable approximation to pi: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pi \approx \frac{22}{7} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Because <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is irrational, any finite fraction or number of digits is an approximation. Because <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is computable—indeed highly efficiently computable in <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/03/15/cooks-class-contains-pi/">senses</a> we have <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/07/14/making-an-algorithm-an-algorithm-bbp/">covered</a>—we can adduce that the code for doing so represents <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> exactly. Furthermore, the symbol <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> lends itself to many other calculations that yield exact finite results. </p>
<p>
The digits, however, have their own mystique. We still do not know whether they are <a href="http://pi314.at/math/normal.html">normal</a> in any base, let alone base ten. Speaking as mathematical Platonists, we regard the infinite sequence as a completed, unchanging entity—one for which assertions like “it is normal” have currently-definite truth values. </p>
<p>
This is what events of the past few weeks have prompted Dick and me to question. If our world presently stops existing, 7817924264 will be the last digits of <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that we know.</p>

<p/><h2> Not Just WW III </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I already have a story of impermanent truth rooted in Russia. On my phone I have a free app for the <a href="https://chessok.com/?page_id=27966">Lomonosov Tablebases</a>, which give the perfect result of all chess positions with 7 or fewer pieces. Those tables took years to compile and exist only as 100+ terabytes on a machine at the Lomonosov Moscow State University computer center. </p>
<p>
Sometime over the new year, I noticed that the server stopped working. It was <a href="http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=74046">reportedly</a> the victim of a ransomware attack. Is it meaningful to say that the tables currently exist? Mathematically, yes, and physically likely also yes—assuming the bits were merely blocked and not altered on the storage plates. </p>
<p>
Happily, there is a second 7-piece table called <a href="https://lichess.org/blog/W3WeMyQAACQAdfAL/7-piece-syzygy-tablebases-are-complete">Syzygy</a>, which uses only about 18 terabytes and exists in multiple dowloaded copies. However, this leads us to another question about correctness. The Syzygy computation reproduced some key extremal features of the Lomonosov compilation, such as the position with the longest number of moves needed to win. Not all have been verifiable, because Syzygy counts the time needed to make concrete progress in the form of a capture or pawn advance rather than the time to give checkmate. What I don’t know—and maybe now won’t know—is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Has Syzygy been used to verify every win/draw/loss (WDL) verdict computed by Lomonosov, and vice-versa? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Doing so would require cross-checking many trillions of chess positions. Of course, we should expect that the algorithms used to produce these tables have been verified as completely correct. </p>
<p>
That is worth saying again: The chess algorithms have been verified in themselves. This is not a case of a shock I had before Christmas, when a module in my own chess software threw an error for the first time since I wrote it in 2014, having worked perfectly on over 100 million moves in several million games. The function in question records not only the exact source and destination squares of a move but also the minimum information required by short-form notation systems to disambiguate it from other pieces that could move to the square. There was one game where the players horsed around until one side had 5 queens that could all move to the same square, and that was 1 more than my scheme had presumed possible. My code is thus not-quite correct.</p>
<p>
But even analytical correctness fails in cases of hardware error. A cosmic ray temporarily <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/subatomic-particles-cosmic-rays-computers-change-elections-planes-autopilot-a7584616.html">changed</a> the outcome of an election in Belgium. Fortunately, the systems have cross-checks to catch these events. When the subject is <em>mathematical truths</em>, however, how are we checking? On what basis can we be satisfied by such checks?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Emergence </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Despite our Platonist convictions, as practitioners of mathematics we experience its truths as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergent</a>. By “emergent” we mean more than saying theorems are unknown until the point in time where they are clearly proved. <em>Pace</em> our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/04/21/pnp-proofs/">claimers</a>, P versus NP has not been proved either way, and we live in a world where even those who strongly believe <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> will aver it is unknown. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/31/make-a-trillion-dollars/">covered</a> this recently.</p>
<p>
Our sense of <em>emergent</em> meets at least the “weak” criterion enunciated <a href="http://consc.net/papers/emergence.pdf">here</a> by David Chalmers, a sense of unexpectedness <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/10/29/guessing-conjectures/">that</a> we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/04/13/even-great-mathematicians-guess-wrong/">have</a> often <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/06/19/guessing-the-truth/">discussed</a> going <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/09/27/surprises-in-mathematics-and-theory/">back</a> to the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/02/19/we-all-guessed-wrong/">beginning</a> of the blog. </p>
<p>
Chalmers’s strong sense, when applied to mathematics, leads into independence results of the kind effected by Kurt Gödel, this blog’s eponym. We realize that none of our 1,000+ posts has yet attempted a deep appraisal of what these independence results <em>mean</em>. We will not do so now because we are questioning something more basic: Discussion of Gödelian independence is with regard to a truth value that is presumed to exist. What if it doesn’t exist?</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/14/are-these-the-last-digits-of-pi/provemewrong/" rel="attachment wp-att-19741"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19741" height="218" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ProveMeWrong.jpg?resize=277%2C218&amp;ssl=1" width="277"/></a></p>
<p>
We are not just catching the tension of Platonism with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a> and related paths to asking, what is science? We are asking whether reality aligns with the position that we already feel is best for <em>practice</em>. </p>
<p>
“Emergent Mathematics” is a teaching movement that, in the words of one prominent <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23434871">paper</a>, gets away from mathematics courses that “are focused on completed results that often hide the messiness and complication that led to their production.” In trying to explain much data showing that the most experienced mathematicians are not the most accomplished teachers, the paper’s two authors seem to identify the former with the position of putting emphasis on completed results. They seek the best attitude for childhood <em>learning</em> of mathematics, and believe it to be orthogonal to that of presenting finished mathematics.  But going another 90 degrees around the dial, perhaps their compass needle’s other end points to the best philosophical position for <em>creating</em> mathematics.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I think we would all still agree that the next trillion digits of <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> currently exist. The tougher question is whether it is scientifically meaningful to postulate knowledge of them, without knowing them. We may get an opinion on that from a regular friend late Wednesday into Thursday.</p></font></font></div>

    <title>A mysterious constant called pi, arising from the Gaussian integral (with a minor application to circles)</title>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Hi, nerd blog! (This is a post that I wrote a long time ago and then never published. I figured it would be nice to publish it on March 14th.)</p>



<p>Today, we’re interested in the Gaussian integral </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[f(C) := \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-Cx^2} {\rm d} x\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-096cdf537e620c218a57694e9aca2bf4_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="170"/></p> for <img alt="C &gt; 0" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-87ddd944257c5bf57009a80226e5c414_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="47"/>. This integral of course has lots of very serious practical applications, as it arises naturally in the study of the Gaussian/normal distribution. But, more importantly, it’s a lot of fun to play with and is simply beautiful. We’ll see a bit about what it makes it so pretty below. We start by simply trying to figure out the value of this thing, which isn’t super easy.<p/>



<p>By a change of variables, we immediately see that <img alt="f(C)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-051ceeda9119a5fc9be66053f9dd40a3_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="37"/> is proportional to <img alt="1/\sqrt{C}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="21" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-94fd71739495e33d6c86fe0b70cdbcf1_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="46"/>. But, what is the constant of proportionality? It’s actually nicer to ask a slightly different question: what is the unique value of <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f34f74d98915e33f37a086f8cbfb996a_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> such that <img alt="f(C) = 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="18" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a4141e7514a6f611842effecf51c1199_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="70"/>. A quick numerical computation shows that <img alt="f(3.14159) \approx 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-24b068172655b4e41a85afb20c734882_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="114"/>. E.g., here’s some Mathematica code to find this value:<br/><img alt="" class="wp-image-552" height="110" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-27-at-3.25.48-PM.png" style="width: 400px;" width="1066"/>.</p>



<p>This constant <img alt="C \approx 3.14159" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="13" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3351e9436eef51bd249c328e212df088_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="97"/> is so important for this blog post that it is worth giving it a name. So, I looked through the Greek alphabet for a nice letter that doesn’t get used much and chose the obscure lowercase letter <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>—spelled <em>pi</em> in English, and pronounced like “pie”. In other words, by definition <img alt="f(\pi) = 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-64cecd17d70571e9f6e5d0e701cda533_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="67"/>. (If this implicit definition bothers you, we can equivalently just define <img alt="\pi := f(1)^{2}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="20" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fd24a2e8eab1e07787b7429db8502015_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="80"/>. But, I find the implicit definition to be more elegant.)</p>



<p>So, we have this brand new mysterious constant <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>. What should we do with it? It is of course natural to try to find different expressions for it (though our integral expression can already be used to compute it to quite high precision). A first idea is to apply the change of variables <img alt="u = \pi x^2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="15" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fcb6cf4e246632c794949355411b046b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="62"/> to obtain </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[1 = 2\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\pi x^2}{\rm d} x = \pi^{-1/2} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-u}/u^{1/2} {\rm d} u\; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f10d9cf7ba99c79b8b6410cfbffbcb0d_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="343"/></p> So, <p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\pi =\Big( \int_0^\infty e^{-u}/u^{1/2} {\rm d} u\Big)^2\; ,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a70346615d75d7bd8aad3e871d66f99c_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="199"/></p> which you might recognize as the square of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gamma function</a> evaluated at <img alt="1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-872abde626b8cdf8e983a3345ee98925_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>, i.e., <img alt="\pi = \Gamma(1/2)^2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="20" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f89e7a589afd5b47baf442a3c38013ee_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="93"/>.

<p>This mysterious identity will play a key role later. We could, of course, find other identities involving this new constant <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>. But, I thought instead I’d jump ahead to a rather obscure fact about the relationship between <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> and a circle.</p>



<h2>Our constant’s relationship with circles</h2>



<p>In my opinion, the Gaussian distribution is far more interesting in dimensions larger than one. In particular, consider the distribution on <img alt="\mathbb{R}^n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f9868b4451c5811a288f7fdd10be5558_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="21"/> given by the probability density function </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 24px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\Pr[\mathbf{x}] = e^{-\pi \|\mathbf{x}\|^2}\; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="24" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-cbeee2e0bc6e4a6f5288818cb4aa2a7a_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="129"/></p> Notice that <p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}e^{-\pi \|\mathbf{x}\|^2} {\rm d} \mathbf{x} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cdots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\pi x_1^2 -\cdots - \pi x_n^2} {\rm d}x_1 \ldots {\rm d} x_n = 1\; ,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8c88f8ef8350b5bf5e3924147dbed5de_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="457"/></p> so that this is in fact a distribution. <p/>



<p>In fact, up to scaling, this distribution is the <em>unique</em> continuous radial product distribution—i.e., the unique distribution such that <img alt="\Pr[\mathbf{x}]" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="18" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-17a91f072153c1ba54d02a280dccc979_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="38"/> can be written both as a function only of the norm of <img alt="\mathbf{x}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bcda923e732ff6e429d93d0fa7ea8a47_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>, <img alt="\Pr[\mathbf{x}] = f^*(\|\mathbf{x}\|)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-2c1674e9adcb304d86d51e6e3e89bd93_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="124"/> for some continuous function <img alt="f^*" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="16" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d1bc0c1e9f63254ef68d09d8ea3e316d_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="17"/>, <em>and</em> as a product of functions of its coordinates, <img alt="\Pr[\mathbf{x}] = f_1(x_1)\cdots f_n(x_n)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-724a32e8712eb42c68f40510a4461d33_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="188"/>. This makes the Gaussian a uniquely powerful tool for reducing complicated multi-dimensional problems to one-dimensional problems. </p>



<p>For example, suppose that for some strange reason we wish to know the circumference of a circle with radius one. (If we were less civilized mathematicians, we might instead set the diameter to be equal to <img alt="1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="13" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-4868771cbc422b5818f85500909ce433_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="7"/>, so that the radius would be <img alt="1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-872abde626b8cdf8e983a3345ee98925_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>.) We can try to write this as some kind of path integral or something—and suffer quite a bit in the process—or we can use the following beautiful trick. We can write<br/></p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[1 = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} e^{-\pi \|x\|^2} {\rm d} x = \int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} \sigma_r {\rm d} r= \sigma_1 \int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} r {\rm d} r\;,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7d71e3575dad757294955cdf449254fa_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="430"/></p><br/>where <img alt="\sigma_r" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="11" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-192e8dc0de46182a65dec93ebf8b5081_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/> is the circumference of a circle of with radius <img alt="r" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c409433a9e2dfcdb83360a974d243f18_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="8"/>. (The <em>only</em> facts that we have used here are our definition of <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> together with the fact that <img alt="\sigma_r = r \sigma_1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="11" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c8ca93d60deca29a9a89487ef2eddf50_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="66"/>.) Fortunately, the last integral is easy to compute as <br/><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} r {\rm d} r = \frac{1}{2\pi} \cdot \int_0^\infty e^{-u} {\rm d} u = \frac{1}{2\pi} \;.\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f7b0b0433407f63b0c9f6682c331ab63_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="303"/></p> Rearranging, we see that <img alt="\sigma_1 = 2\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="15" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bceb0469014bc513c98176ca8e9baf1d_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="61"/>!<p/>



<p>So, surprisingly, our mysterious constant <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> is actually intimately related with the circumference of a circle. (If we were less civilized mathematicians, we might even have simply defined <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> to be the circumference of a circle with radius <img alt="1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-872abde626b8cdf8e983a3345ee98925_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>.)</p>



<h2>What’s so special about two dimensions? Surface area of n-spheres.</h2>



<p>But, why stop in dimension <img alt="2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e584dd0bab4e6c8efc164939c28db757_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="8"/>? This same <em>one neat trick</em> is just as useful in higher dimensions. E.g., what is the surface area <img alt="\sigma_1^{(n-1)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="24" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e14b74f2c92c5d34a31da4576bfaecc9_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="46"/> of a unit sphere in <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> dimensions?

Rearranging, we see that the surface area of the unit sphere in <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> dimensions is exactly <img alt="\frac{2\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="30" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-50d143fa8519caff967068ce2d9de43f_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="42"/>.<p/>



<p>If the Gamma function intimidates you, that’s fine. (It certainly intimidates me.)

(I.e., “<img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>-dimensional unit spheres are tiny.”) We also see the rather strange fact that <img alt="\sigma_1^{(n-1)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="24" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e14b74f2c92c5d34a31da4576bfaecc9_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="46"/> is a rational multiple of <img alt="\pi^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="17" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-362edd7540e9e43db2e65a0ddc45e684_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="43"/>.<p/>



<p>We can also plug in low values of <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> to see what we get. E.g., I have heard that some people are interested in the case when <img alt="n = 2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a47a3377f14fefc160d10b089a4aab45_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="42"/> and <img alt="n = 3" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8eda9fc1983d40517cca42fa671a0f51_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="43"/>. Plugging in, one sees that the circumference of a circle with radius one is <img alt="2\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5bfa2124624f767670227d1aeab8d85c_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> (which, ok, we already saw before), and that the surface area of a sphere with radius one is <img alt="4\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a64f86508ea52835b7fd42736282275d_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/>. But, we can easily go farther: the surface area in four dimensions is <img alt="2\pi^2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="15" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7249ec3f5fb52ad8207e0f9d873c7a4f_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="27"/>, and in five dimensions, it is <img alt="8\pi^{2}/3" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="20" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5b263bf1209b153f5824b853138f0510_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="45"/>.</p>



<p>And, we can of course find the volume of the unit <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>-ball by computing a simple integral </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 44px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[V^{(n)} = \int_0^{1}\sigma_r^{(n)} {\rm} d r = \sigma_1^{(n)} \cdot \int_0^{1} r^{n-1} {\rm d} r = \sigma_1^{(n)}/n \; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="44" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-08b8932dcb424209e24a111106e869b2_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="366"/></p><p/>



<p>In short, I think this mysterious constant <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> is rather nice.

    <title>TR22-039 |  Parallel Repetition For All 3-Player Games Over Binary Alphabet | 

	Kunal Mittal, 

	Uma Girish, 

	Justin Holmgren, 

	Wei Zhan, 

	Ran Raz</title>
    <summary>We prove that for every 3-player (3-prover) game, with binary questions and answers and value less than $1$, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game decays polynomially fast to $0$. That is, for every such game, there exists a constant $c&gt;0$, such that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game is at most $n^{-c}$.

Along the way to proving this theorem, we prove two additional parallel repetition theorems for multiplayer (multiprover) games, that may be of independent interest:

$\textbf{Playerwise Connected Games (with any number of players and any Alphabet size):}$ We identify a large class of multiplayer games and prove that for every game with value less than $1$ in that class, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game decays polynomially fast to $0$.

More precisely, our result applies for $\textit{playerwise connected games}$, with any number of players and any alphabet size:
For each player $i$, we define the graph $G_i$, whose vertices are the possible questions for that player and two questions $x,x'$ are connected by an edge if there exists a vector $y$ of questions for all other players, such that both $(x,y)$ and $(x',y)$ are asked by the referee with non-zero probability. We say that the game is $\textit{playerwise connected}$ if for every $i$, the graph $G_i$ is connected.

Our class of playerwise connected games is strictly larger than the class of connected games that was defined in [DHVY17] and for which exponentially fast decay bounds are known [DHVY17]. For playerwise connected games that are not connected, only inverse Ackermann decay bounds were previously known [Ver96].

$\textbf{Exponential Bounds for the Anti-Correlation Game:}$ In the 3-player $\textit{anti-correlation game}$, two out of three players are given $1$ as input, and the remaining player is given $0$. The two players who were given $1$ must produce different outputs in $\{0,1\}$. We prove that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of that game decays exponentially fast to $0$. That is, there exists a constant $c&gt;0$, such that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game is at most $2^{-cn}$. Only inverse Ackermann decay bounds were previously known [Ver96].

The 3-player anti-correlation game was studied and motivated in several previous works. In particular, Holmgren and Yang gave it as an example for a 3-player game whose non-signaling value (is smaller than $1$ and yet) does not decrease at all under parallel repetition [HY19].</summary>

    <title>(In-)Approximability Results for Interval, Resource Restricted, and Low Rank Scheduling</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1647216000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Maack:Marten.html">Marten Maack</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Pukrop:Simon.html">Simon Pukrop</a>, Anna Rodriguez Rasmussen <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06171">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider variants of the restricted assignment problem where a set of jobs
has to be assigned to a set of machines, for each job a size and a set of
eligible machines is given, and the jobs may only be assigned to eligible
machines with the goal of makespan minimization. For the variant with interval
restrictions, where the machines can be arranged on a path such that each job
is eligible on a subpath, we present the first better than $2$-approximation
and an improved inapproximability result. In particular, we give a
$(2-\frac{1}{24})$-approximation and show that no better than
$9/8$-approximation is possible, unless P=NP. Furthermore, we consider
restricted assignment with $R$ resource restrictions and rank $D$ unrelated
scheduling. In the former problem, a machine may process a job if it can meet
its resource requirements regarding $R$ (renewable) resources. In the latter,
the size of a job is dependent on the machine it is assigned to and the
corresponding processing time matrix has rank at most $D$. The problem with
interval restrictions includes the 1 resource variant, is encompassed by the 2
resource variant, and regarding approximation the $R$ resource variant is
essentially a special case of the rank $R+1$ problem. We show that no better
than $3/2$, $8/7$, and $3/2$-approximation is possible (unless P=NP) for the 3
resource, 2 resource, and rank 3 variant, respectively. Both the approximation
result for the interval case and the inapproximability result for the rank 3
variant are solutions to open challenges stated in previous works. Lastly, we
also consider the reverse objective, that is, maximizing the minimal load any
machine receives, and achieve similar results.

    <title>Cheeger Inequalities for Vertex Expansion and Reweighted Eigenvalues</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1647216000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kwok:Tsz_Chiu.html">Tsz Chiu Kwok</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Lau:Lap_Chi.html">Lap Chi Lau</a>, Kam Chuen Tung <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06168">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The classical Cheeger's inequality relates the edge conductance $\phi$ of a
graph and the second smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ of the Laplacian matrix.
Recently, Olesker-Taylor and Zanetti discovered a Cheeger-type inequality
$\psi^2 / \log |V| \lesssim \lambda_2^* \lesssim \psi$ connecting the vertex
expansion $\psi$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ and the maximum reweighted second
smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2^*$ of the Laplacian matrix.
</p>
<p>In this work, we first improve their result to $\psi^2 / \log d \lesssim
\lambda_2^* \lesssim \psi$ where $d$ is the maximum degree in $G$, which is
optimal assuming the small-set expansion conjecture. Also, the improved result
holds for weighted vertex expansion, answering an open question by
Olesker-Taylor and Zanetti. Building on this connection, we then develop a new
spectral theory for vertex expansion. We discover that several interesting
generalizations of Cheeger inequalities relating edge conductances and
eigenvalues have a close analog in relating vertex expansions and reweighted
eigenvalues. These include an analog of Trevisan's result on bipartiteness, an
analog of higher order Cheeger's inequality, and an analog of improved
Cheeger's inequality.
</p>
<p>Finally, inspired by this connection, we present negative evidence to the
$0/1$-polytope edge expansion conjecture by Mihail and Vazirani. We construct
$0/1$-polytopes whose graphs have very poor vertex expansion. This implies that
the fastest mixing time to the uniform distribution on the vertices of these
$0/1$-polytopes is almost linear in the graph size. This does not provide a
counterexample to the conjecture, but this is in contrast with known positive
results which proved poly-logarithmic mixing time to the uniform distribution
on the vertices of subclasses of $0/1$-polytopes.

each pair of edges share at most one point (a proper crossing or a common
endpoint). We introduce a special kind of simple drawings that we call
generalized twisted drawings. A simple drawing is generalized twisted if there
is a point $O$ such that every ray emanating from $O$ crosses every edge of the
drawing at most once and there is a ray emanating from $O$ which crosses every
edge exactly once.
</p>
<p>Via this new class of simple drawings, we show that every simple drawing of
the complete graph with $n$ vertices contains $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$
pairwise disjoint edges and a plane path of length $\Omega(\frac{\log n }{\log
\log n})$. Both results improve over previously known best lower bounds. On the
way we show several structural results about and properties of generalized
twisted drawings. We further present different characterizations of generalized
twisted drawings, which might be of independent interest.

    <title>Fully-dynamic $\alpha + 2$ Arboricity Decomposition and Implicit Colouring</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1647216000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Aleksander B. G. Christiansen, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rotenberg:Eva.html">Eva Rotenberg</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06039">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the implicit dynamic colouring problem, the task is to maintain a
representation of a proper colouring as a dynamic graph is subject to
insertions and deletions of edges, while facilitating interspersed queries to
the colours of vertices. The goal is to use few colours, while still
efficiently handling edge-updates and responding to colour-queries. For an
n-vertex dynamic graph of arboricity $\alpha$, we present an algorithm that
maintains an implicit vertex colouring with $4\cdot2^\alpha$ colours, in
amortised poly-$(\log n)$ update time, and with $O({\alpha} log n)$ worst-case
query time. The previous best implicit dynamic colouring algorithm uses
$2^{40\alpha}$) colours, and has a more efficient update time of $O(\log^3 n)$
and the same query time of $O({\alpha} log n)$ [Henzinger et al'20].
</p>
<p>For graphs undergoing arboricity $\alpha$ preserving updates, we give a
fully-dynamic $\alpha+2$ arboricity decomposition in poly$(\log n,\alpha)$
time, which matches the number of forests in the best near-linear static
algorithm by Blumenstock and Fischer [2020] who obtain $\alpha+2$ forests in
near-linear time. Our construction goes via dynamic bounded out-degree
orientations, where we present a fully-dynamic explicit, deterministic,
worst-case algorithm for $\lfloor (1+\varepsilon)\alpha \rfloor + 2$ bounded
out-degree orientation with update time $O(\varepsilon^{-6}\alpha^2 \log^3 n)$.
The state-of-the-art explicit, deterministic, worst-case algorithm for bounded
out-degree orientations maintains a $\beta\cdot \alpha + \log_{\beta} n$
out-orientation in $O(\beta^2\alpha^2+\beta\alpha\log_{\beta} n)$ time

    <title>Delaunay-like Triangulation of Smooth Orientable Submanifolds by L1-Norm Minimization</title>

reconstruction problem, in which the shape we wish to reconstruct is an
orientable smooth submanifold of the Euclidean space. Assuming we have as input
a simplicial complex K that approximates the submanifold (such as the Cech
complex or the Rips complex), we recast the reconstruction problem as a L1-norm
minimization problem in which the optimization variable is a chain of K.
Providing that K satisfies certain reasonable conditions, we prove that the
considered minimization problem has a unique solution which triangulates the
submanifold and coincides with the flat Delaunay complex introduced and studied
in a companion paper. Since the objective is a weighted L1-norm and the
contraints are linear, the triangulation process can thus be implemented by
linear programming.

scale parameter, we introduce a construction which we call the flat Delaunay
complex (FDC). This is a variant of the tangential Delaunay complex (TDC)
introduced by Boissonnat et al.. Building on their work, we provide a short and
direct proof that when the point cloud samples sufficiently nicely the
submanifold and is sufficiently safe (a notion which we define in the paper),
our construction is homeomorphic to the submanifold. Because the proof works
even when data points are noisy, this allows us to propose a perturbation
scheme that takes as input a point cloud sufficiently nice and returns a point
cloud which in addition is sufficiently safe. Equally importantly, our
construction provides the framework underlying a variational formulation of the
reconstruction problem which we present in a companion paper.

We prove that if
we restrict attention to a class of problems whose dependency graphs have some
fixed subexponential growth, then the expected total number of random bits used
by the algorithm is constant; in particular, it is independent from the number
of variables. This is achieved by using the same random bits to resample
variables which are far enough in the dependency graph.

<p>There are two colloraries. First, we obtain a deterministic algorithm for
finding a satisfying assignment, which in any class of problems as in the
previous paragraph runs in time $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of variables.
Second, we present a Borel version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma.

fixed-parameter tractable problem. FPT algorithms are most interesting when the
parameter is small. Several lower bounds on k are well-known, such as the
maximum size of a matching. This has led to a line of research on
parameterizations of Vertex Cover by the difference of the solution size k and
a lower bound. The most prominent cases for such lower bounds for which the
problem is FPT are the matching number or the optimal fractional LP solution.
We investigate parameterizations by the difference between k and other graph
parameters including the feedback vertex number, the degeneracy, cluster
deletion number, and treewidth with the goal of finding the border of
fixed-parameter tractability for said difference parameterizations. We also
consider similar parameterizations of the Feedback Vertex Set problem.

    <title>Finding Weakly Simple Closed Quasigeodesics on Polyhedral Spheres</title>

locally straight outside of the vertices, where it forms an angle at most $\pi$
on both sides. While the existence of a simple closed quasigeodesic on a convex
polyhedron has been proved by Pogorelov in 1949, finding a polynomial-time
algorithm to compute such a simple closed quasigeodesic has been repeatedly
posed as an open problem. Our first contribution is to propose an extended
definition of quasigeodesics in the intrinsic setting of (not necessarily
convex) polyhedral spheres, and to prove the existence of a weakly simple
closed quasigeodesic in such a setting. Our proof does not proceed via an
approximation by smooth surfaces, but relies on an adapation of the disk flow
of Hass and Scott to the context of polyhedral surfaces. Our second result is
to leverage this existence theorem to provide a finite algorithm to compute a
weakly simple closed quasigeodesic on a polyhedral sphere. On a convex
polyhedron, our algorithm computes a simple closed quasigeodesic, solving an
open problem of Demaine, Hersterberg and Ku.

subject of interest due to their potential for use in computational methods. In
this paper, we develop a method to track an isolated invariant set -- a salient
feature of a combinatorial dynamical system -- across a sequence of multivector
fields. This goal is attained by placing the classical notion of the
"continuation" of an isolated invariant set in the combinatorial setting. In
particular, we give a "Tracking Protocol" that, when given a seed isolated
invariant set, finds a canonical continuation of the seed across a sequence of
multivector fields. In cases where it is not possible to continue, we show how
to use zigzag persistence to track homological features associated with the
isolated invariant sets. This construction permits viewing continuation as a
special case of persistence.

sum-of-squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs does not exactly represent
the hypercube $\{\pm 1\}^n$ until degree at least $n$ of the hierarchy. Laurent
also observed that the pseudomoment matrices her proof constructs appear to
have surprisingly simple and recursively structured spectra as $n$ increases.
While several new proofs of the Grigoriev-Laurent lower bound have since
appeared, Laurent's observations have remained unproved. We give yet another,
representation-theoretic proof of the lower bound, which also yields exact
formulae for the eigenvalues of the Grigoriev-Laurent pseudomoments. Using
these, we prove and elaborate on Laurent's observations.
</p>
<p>Our arguments have two features that may be of independent interest. First,
we show that the Grigoriev-Laurent pseudomoments are a special case of a Gram
matrix construction of pseudomoments proposed by Bandeira and Kunisky (2020).
Second, we find a new realization of the irreducible representations of the
symmetric group corresponding to Young diagrams with two rows, as spaces of
multivariate polynomials that are multiharmonic with respect to an equilateral
simplex.

If we have an
algorithm that uses $M$ memory cells throughout its execution, and in addition
is sparse, in the sense that, at any point in time, only $m$ out of $M$ cells
will be non-zero, then we may "compress" it into another algorithm which uses
only $m \log M$ memory and runs in almost the same time. We may do so by
simulating the memory using either a hash table, or a self-balancing tree.
</p>
<p>We show an analogous result for quantum algorithms equipped with quantum
random-access gates. If we have a quantum algorithm that runs in time $T$ and
uses $M$ qubits, such that the state of the memory, at any time step, is
supported on computational-basis vectors of Hamming weight at most $m$, then it
can be simulated by another algorithm which uses only $O(m \log M)$ memory, and
runs in time $\tilde O(T)$.
</p>
<p>We show how this theorem can be used, in a black-box way, to simplify the
presentation in several papers. Broadly speaking, when there exists a need for
a space-efficient history-independent quantum data-structure, it is often
possible to construct a space-inefficient, yet sparse, quantum data structure,
and then appeal to our main theorem. This results in simpler and shorter
arguments.

    <title>FOCS 2021 Test-of-Time Award winners (and one deserving paper that missed out)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As members of the TCS community will most likely know, FOCS established<a href="https://focs2021.cs.colorado.edu/test-of-time-awards/" target="_blank"> Test-of-Time Awards from its 2021 edition</a> to celebrate contributions published at that conference 30, 20 and 10 years before. The first list of selected winners is, as one might have expected, stellar: <br/></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Uriel Feige, Shafi Goldwasser, László Lovász, Shmuel Safra, Mario Szegedy:<br/>Approximating Clique is Almost NP-Complete.<br/>FOCS 1991</li><li>David Zuckerman:<br/>Simulating BPP Using a General Weak Random Source.<br/>FOCS 1991</li><li>Serge A.

Awards are a scarce resource! My goal with this post is simply to remind our community (and especially its younger members) of a seminal contribution that they might want to read or re-read. <br/></p><p>The paper in question is "<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6860/2019sp/Handouts/EmersonJutla91.pdf" target="_blank">Tree automata, mu-calculus and determinacy</a>" by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~emerson/" target="_blank">Allen Emerson</a> and <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-csjutla" target="_blank">Charanjit S. Jutla</a>, which appeared at FOCS 1991. (Emerson shared the 2007 A.M. Turing Award for the invention of model checking and Jutla went on to doing path-breaking work in cryptography.) That paper is absolutely fundamental for the mu-calculus, but also for automata theory, and verification in general. It introduced many ideas and results that became the basis for extensive research. </p><p>As a first contribution, the article introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_game" target="_blank">parity games</a> and proved their fundamental properties. The parity condition was a missing link in automata theory on infinite objects. It made the whole theory much simpler than that proposed in earlier work.  Technically, the parity condition is both universal and positional. Universal means that tree automata with parity conditions are as expressive as those with Rabin or Muller conditions. Positional means that in the acceptance game if a player has a winning strategy then she has one depending only on the current position and not on the history of the play so far. This is a huge technical advance for all automata-theoretic constructions and for the analysis of  infinite-duration games. It allows one, for instance,  to avoid the complicated arguments of Gurevich and Harlington in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/800070.802177" target="_blank">their seminal STOC 1982 article</a>, which were already a huge simplification of <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1969-141-00/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1.pdf" target="_blank">Rabin's original argument from 1969</a> proving the decidability of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadic_second-order_logic#Decidability_and_complexity_of_satisfiability" target="_blank">monadic second-order theory of the infinite binary tree</a> and much more. In passing, let me remark that Rabin has gone on record saying that "I consider this to be the most difficult research I have ever done." See <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69370-an-interview-with-michael-rabin/fulltext" target="_blank">this interview</a> in CACM. </p><p>The second main contribution of that paper is the discovery of the relation between parity games and the mu-calculus. The authors show how a mu-calculus model-checking problem can be reduced to solving a parity game, and conversely, how the set of winning positions in a parity game can be described by a mu-calculus formula. This result is the birth of the "model-checking via games" approach. It also shows that establishing a winner in parity games is contained both in NP and in co-NP. As a corollary, the model-checking problem is as complex as solving games. It is still not known if the problem is in PTIME. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3055399.3055409" target="_blank">recent advance from STOC'17</a> gives a quasi-polynomial-time algorithm. (See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/03/parity-games-in-quasipolynomial-time.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for a discussion of that result, which received the STOC 2017 best paper award and was immediately followed up by a flurry of related papers.) </p><p>Finally, the paper also shows how to prove Rabin's complementation lemma, which is the most difficult step in his celebrated aforementioned decidability result, with the help of parity conditions. The proof is radically simpler than previous approaches. The paper puts this contribution most prominently, but actually the conceptual and technical contributions presented later in the paper turned out to be most important for the community. </p><p>Overall, the above-mentioned paper by Emerson and Jutla is a truly seminal contribution that has stood the test of time, has sown the seeds for much research  over the last thirty years (as partly witnessed by the over 1,130 citations it has received so far) and is still stimulating advances at the cutting edge of theoretical computer science that bridge the Volume A-Volume B divide. </p><p>I encourage everyone to read it!</p><p><b>Acknowledgement:</b> I have learnt much of the content of this post from Igor Walukiewicz. The responsibility for any infelicity is mine alone. <br/></p></div>

<p><strong>Nomination Procedure.</strong> Anyone in the Theoretical Computer Science community may nominate a candidate. To do so, please send nominations to <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">knuth.prize.2022@gmail.com</a></strong> by <strong>March 31, 2022</strong>. The nomination should state the nominee’s name, summarize their contributions in one or two pages, provide a CV for the nominee or a pointer to the nominee’s web page, and give telephone and email contact information for the nominator. Any supporting letters from other members of the community (up to a limit of 5) should be included in the package that the nominator submits. Supporting letters should contain substantial information not in the nomination. Others may endorse the nomination simply by adding their names to the nomination letter. If you have nominated a candidate in past years, you can re-nominate the candidate by sending a message to that effect to the above email address. (You may revise the nominating materials if you so desire.)</p>



<p><strong>Criteria for Selection.</strong> The winner is selected by a Prize Committee consisting of six people appointed by the SIGACT and TCMF Chairs, see below for the composition of the committee.</p>



<p>Previous nominations made or updated in the last 5 years will be considered. Older nominations must be updated for consideration. Note that the Knuth Prize is awarded to a single individual each year. Nominations of groups of researchers will not be considered.</p>



<p>In selecting the Knuth Prize winner, the Committee pays particular attention to a <em>sustained record</em> of high-impact, seminal contributions to the foundations of computer science. The selection may also be based partly on educational accomplishments and contributions such as fundamental textbooks and high-quality students. The award is not given for service to the theoretical computer science community, but service may be included in the citation for a winner if appropriate.</p>



<p>The 2022 prize committee consists of Harold Gabow (U. Colorado), Monika Henzinger (U. Vienna), Kurt Mehlhorn (Max Planck Institute), Dana Randall (Chair, Georgia Tech), Madhu Sudan (Harvard U.), and Andy Yao (Tsinghua U.).</p></div>

<p>The Gödel Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science is sponsored jointly by the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and the Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM SIGACT). This award is presented annually, with the presentation taking place alternately at the International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP) and the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC). The thirtieth Gödel Prize will be awarded at the forty-ninth International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), which will be hybrid, happening both physically and virtually. The physical meeting will take place in Paris, France, July 4–8 2022.</p>



<p>The Prize is named in honor of Kurt Gödel in recognition of his major contributions to mathematical logic and of his interest, discovered in a letter he wrote to John von Neumann shortly before von Neumann’s death, in what has become the famous “P versus NP” question. The Prize includes an award of USD 5,000.</p>



<p><strong>Award Committee</strong></p>



<p>The 2022 Award Committee consists of Samson Abramsky (Chair, University College London), Nikhil Bansal (University of Michigan), Irit Dinur (Weizmann Institute), Anca Muscholl (University of Bordeaux), Ronitt Rubinfeld (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and David Zuckerman (University of Texas at Austin).</p>



<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>



<p>The 2022 Prize rules are given below and they supersede any different interpretation of the generic rule to be found on websites of both SIGACT and EATCS. Any research paper or series of papers by a single author or by a team of authors is deemed eligible if:</p>



<p>• The main results were not published (in either preliminary or final form) in a journal or conference proceedings before January 1, 2009.</p>



<p>• The paper was published in a recognized refereed journal no later than December 31, 2021.<br/>The research work nominated for the award should be in the area of theoretical computer science. Nominations are encouraged from the broadest spectrum of the theoretical computer science community so as to ensure that potential award winning papers are not overlooked. The Award Committee shall have the ultimate authority to decide whether a particular paper is eligible for the Prize.</p>



<p><strong>Nominations</strong></p>



<p>Nominations for the award should be submitted by email to the Award Committee Chair: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">s.abramsky@ucl.ac.uk</a>. Please make sure that the Subject line of all nominations and related messages begin with “Goedel Prize 2022”. To be considered, nominations for the 2022 Prize must be received by March 31, 2022.</p>



<p>A nomination package should include:</p>



<p>• A printable copy (or copies) of the journal paper(s) being nominated, together with a complete citation (or citations) thereof.</p>



<p>• A statement of the date(s) and venue(s) of the first conference or workshop publication(s) of the nominated work(s) or a statement that no such publication has occurred.</p>



<p>• A brief summary of the technical content of the paper(s) and a brief explanation of its significance.</p>



<p>• A support letter or letters signed by at least two members of the scientific community.<br/>Additional support letters may also be received and are generally useful. The nominated paper(s) may be in any language. However, if a nominated publication is not in English, the nomination package must include an extended summary written in English.</p>



<p>Those intending to submit a nomination should contact the Award Committee Chair by email well in advance. The Chair will answer questions about eligibility, encourage coordination among different nominators for the same paper(s), and also accept informal proposals of potential nominees or tentative offers to prepare formal nominations. The committee maintains a database of past nominations for eligible papers, but fresh nominations for the same papers (especially if they highlight new evidence of impact) are always welcome.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This month has seen a flurry of activity in sublinear algorithms and a diverse collection of papers have come up, with topics ranging from differentially private sublinear algorithms to local testers for multiplicity codes. Apologies to the readers for the delay in putting this post together!</p>



<p><strong>Almost-Optimal Sublinear-Time Edit Distance in the Low Distance Regime</strong> by Karl Bringmann, Alejandro Cassis, Nick Fischer and Vasileios Nakos (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08066">arXiv</a>)</p>



<p>This paper considers the problem of gap edit distance, i.e., of determining if the edit distance between two strings \(x\) and \(y\) is at most \(k\) or at least \(K\). Their main result is an algorithm that runs in time \(O(n/k + \text{poly}(k))\) and solves the problem for \(K =  k \cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log k})}\). The paper improves upon earlier results of Goldenberg, Krauthgamer and Saha (2019) and Kociumaka and Saha (2020) who solved the problem for \(K = k^2\) with the same asymptotic guarantee on the query complexity. </p>



<p>One of the interesting takeaways from the paper is that the complexity of solving the gap Hamming distance and gap edit distance are similar in the low distance regime. For both, the complexity of solving the \((k, k^{1+o(1)})\)-gap problem is \(n/k^{1 \pm o(1)}\). This needs to be contrasted with the fact that solving \((k, \Omega(n))\)-gap edit distance requires \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) queries as shown by Batu, Ergun, Kilian, Magen and Raskhodnikova (2003), whereas \((k, \Omega(n))\)-gap Hamming distance can be solved in \(O(1)\) time. </p>



<p>These results are incomparable to those obtained by Goldenberg, Kociumaka, Krauthgamer and Saha (which was discussed in our November 2021 post), where they give a nonadaptive algorithm with complexity \(O(n/k^{1.5})\) for \((k, k^2)\)-gap edit distance problem. The algorithm in the present paper is adaptive and works faster for smaller values of \(k\).</p>

<p><strong>Privately Estimating Graph Parameters in Sublinear time</strong> by Jeremiah Blocki, Elena Grigorescu, Tamalika Mukherjee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05776">arXiv</a>)</p>



<p>Differentially private approximation algorithms for optimization problems on graphs is a well-studied topic. This paper opens up an exciting research direction by initiating a systematic study of the design of differentially private sublinear-time algorithms. The setting is that graphs are viewed as databases and two graphs are neighboring if they differ in an edge (or a node). An algorithm \(A\) is \(\epsilon\)-differentially private if for every pair of edge-neighboring(or node-neighboring) graphs \(G, G’\) and for every subset \(S\) of outputs, \(\Pr[A(G) \in S] \leq \exp(\epsilon) \cdot \Pr[A(G’) \in S]\).</p>



<p>The paper presents \(\epsilon\)-differentially private sublinear-time algorithms for well-studied problems such as estimating the average degree, the size of a min vertex cover and the size of a maximum matching. These algorithms access the input graphs via <em>neighbor queries</em> and <em>degree queries</em>. </p>



<p>In addition to providing a strong privacy guarantee, their algorithms nearly match the approximation and complexity guarantees of their non-differentially private counterparts. The main idea seems to be the formalization of a sensitivity notion, which they refer to as Global Coupled Sensitivity, and bounding it for the known sublinear-time algorithms for the aforementioned problems. Finally, they add Laplace noise calibrated with this sensitivity value to the output of the algorithms to make them differentially private.  </p>

<p><strong>Testability and Local Certification of Monotone Properties in Minor-closed Classes</strong> by Louis Esperet And Sergey Norin (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00543">arXiv</a>)</p>



<p>One of the major interests in graph property testing is to characterize which properties are testable, i.e, can be \(\epsilon\)-tested with query complexity that depends only on the parameter \(\epsilon\). The question of testability is well-understood in the dense graph model as well as the bounded degree model. This paper concerns itself with testability questions in the general model or the sparse model of graph property testing, where graphs are represented as adjacency lists with no bound on the maximum degree. </p>



<p>The authors prove that every monotone property of<strong> </strong>minor-closed graph classes is testable with one-sided error, where a property is monotone if it is closed under taking subgraphs and a graph class is minor-closed if it is closed under taking minors. A crucial fact to be noted here is that a tester is allowed to make only uniformly random nerighbor queries. </p>



<p>This result is a significant generalization of a 2019 result by Czumaj and Sohler, who proved that for every finite set of graphs \(\mathcal{H}\), every \(\mathcal{H}\)-free property of minor-closed graph classes is testable with one-sided error, where a graph satisfies \(\mathcal{H}\)-freeness if none of its subgraphs belong to \(\mathcal{H}\). </p>



<p>They show an interesting consequence of their results to designing a short local certification scheme for monotone properties of minor-closed graph classes. Roughly speaking, they show the existence of a prover-verifier system for the aforementioned testing problem where proofs of length \(O(\log n)\) are assigned to each vertex and that verifier needs to observe only the proofs assigned to a vertex and its neighbors.<br/></p>



<p><strong>The plane test is a local tester for Multiplicity Codes</strong> by Dan Karliner, Roie Salama, and Amnon Ta-Shma (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/028/">ECCC</a>)</p>



<p>Multiplicity codes are a generalization of Reed-Muller codes and was first studied by Guruswami and Wang (2013) and Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin (2014). The messages here are polynomials of degree \(d\) over \(m\) variables and the codeword corresponding to a polynomial \(p\) is the evaluation of \(p\) and of all of its directional derivatives of order upto \(s\) over all the points in \(\mathbb{F}_q^m\), where \(q\) is a prime power. </p>



<p>Even though multiplicity codes are known to be locally decodable, it was open whether they are locally testable. Local testers for Reed Muller codes work by restricting the evaluations to a uniformly random line in \(\mathbb{F}_q^m\) and checking whether it corresponds to the evaluations of a degree \(d\) univariate polynomial. The authors first show that such a tester does not work for the case of multiplicity codes when \(d\) is large. They then show that a <em>plane test</em> is a good local tester for multiplicity codes even for larger values of \(d\). Specifically, a plane test checks whether the restriction of a given word, which is purportedly the evaluation of a polynomial of degree \(d\) and of its derivatives, to a uniformly random plane in \(\mathbb{F}_q^m\) is a bivariate multiplicity code of degree \(d\). </p>



<p/>



<p>We conclude the post with a short note from Nader Bshouty and Oded Goldreich on a fundamental characterization result in property testing. </p>



<p><strong>On properties that are non-trivial to test</strong> by Nader H. Bshouty and Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/013/">ECCC</a>)</p>



<p>A property on binary strings is nontrivial if for infinitely many \(n\), the property contains at least one string of length \(n\) and at most \(2^{n – \Omega(n)}\) strings of length \(n\). The note shows that every nontrivial property requires \(\Omega(1/\epsilon)\) queries to \(\epsilon\)-test. </p></div>

    <title>TR22-037 |  Robust Radical Sylvester-Gallai Theorem for Quadratics | 

	Rafael Mendes de Oliveira, 

	Abhibhav Garg, 

	Akash Sengupta</title>
    <summary>We prove a robust generalization of a Sylvester-Gallai type theorem for quadratic polynomials, generalizing the result in [S'20].
More precisely, given a parameter $0 &lt; \delta \leq 1$ and a finite collection $\mathcal{F}$ of irreducible and pairwise independent polynomials of degree at most 2, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $(\delta, 2)$-radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration if for any polynomial $F_i \in \mathcal{F}$, there exist $\delta(|\mathcal{F}| -1)$ polynomials $F_j$ such that $|\mathrm{rad}(F_i, F_j) \cap \mathcal{F}| \geq 3$, that is, the radical of $F_i, F_j$ contains a third polynomial in the set.

In this work, we prove that any $(\delta, 2)$-radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration $\mathcal{F}$ must be of low dimension: that is 
$$\dim \mathrm{span}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathrm{poly}(1/\delta).$$</summary>

    <title>TR22-036 |  Classes of Hard Formulas for QBF Resolution | 

	Agnes Schleitzer, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff</title>
    <summary>To date, we know only a few handcrafted quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) that are hard for central QBF resolution systems such as Q and QU, and only one specific QBF family to separate Q and QU. 

Here we provide a general method to construct hard formulas for Q and  QU. The construction uses simple propositional formulas (e.g. minimally unsatisfiable formulas) in combination with easy QBF gadgets (Sigma_2^b formulas without constant winning strategies). 
This leads to a host of new hard formulas, including new classes of hard random QBFs. 

We further present generic constructions for formulas separating Q and QU, and for separating Q and LDQ.</summary>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>:  A standard assumption for causal inference from observational data is that one has measured a sufficiently rich set of covariates to ensure that within covariates strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed treatment values. Skepticism about the exchangeability assumption in observational studies is often warranted because it hinges on one’s ability to accurately measure covariates capturing all potential sources of confounding. Realistically, confounding mechanisms can rarely if ever, be learned with certainty from measured covariates. One can therefore only ever hope that covariate measurements are at best proxies of true underlying confounding mechanisms operating in an observational study, thus invalidating causal claims made on basis of standard exchangeability conditions.</p>



<p>Causal learning from proxies is a challenging inverse problem which has to date remained unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a formal potential outcome framework for proximal causal learning, which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn about causal effects in settings where exchangeability based on measured covariates fails. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are given, leading to the proximal g-formula and corresponding proximal g-computation algorithm for estimation, both generalizations of Robins’ foundational g-formula and g-computation algorithm, which account explicitly for bias due to unmeasured confounding. Both point treatment and time-varying treatment settings are considered, and an application of proximal g-computation of causal effects is given for illustration.</p>

    <title>Mathematics books by women, in need of more reviews</title>
    <summary>The last couple of years, for International Women’s Day, I’ve posted about mathematics books by women covered by recently added Wikipedia articles. I have a few more of those that I could list today, and a few more that I plan to add, but instead, I thought I’d list books on mathematics and related areas that look interesting enough to me that I want to add them to Wikipedia, but haven’t, because I haven’t found enough reviews to use as the basis for an article.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The last couple of years, for International Women’s Day, I’ve posted about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/03/08/more-mathematics-books.html">mathematics books by women covered by recently added Wikipedia articles</a>. I have a few more of those that I could list today, and a few more that I plan to add, but instead, I thought I’d list books on mathematics and related areas that look interesting enough to me that I want to add them to Wikipedia, but haven’t, because I haven’t found enough reviews to use as the basis for an article.</p>

<p>If you know of more reviews for these, please let me know! I need at least three in-depth reviews, published in journals or by major societies rather than just on a web site or someone’s blog, by three different reviewers, to be comfortable writing a Wikipedia article. It would also help convince other Wikipedians that the topic is a worthy one for Wikipedia if it had at least one review in an actual journal, not just in the MAA, EMS, AMS, and zbMATH review collections, for which one could argue that a review is “routine coverage” that doesn’t suggest any particular significance for a book. Even if you can’t find more reviews, you might find some of these titles and topics intriguing enough to read the books.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>A Course on Tug-of-War Games with Random Noise</em> (2020), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Lewicka">Marta Lewicka</a>. Research monograph concerning a game-theoretic twist on Brownian motion. Reviewed by <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/a-course-on-tug-of-war-games-with-random-noise">MAA</a> and <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1452.91002">zbMATH</a>. Listed by MathSciNet as “pending” so maybe there’ll be a third review soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Alfonso’s Rectifying the Curved</em> (2021), Ruth Glasner and Avinoam Baraness. A history of medieval Spanish circle-squaring. Reviewed by <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/alfonsos-rectifying-the-curved">MAA</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Bodies of Constant Width: An Introduction to Convex Geometry with Applications</em> (2019), Horst Martini, Luis Montejano, and Déborah Oliveros. A very thorough reference on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_constant_width">surfaces of constant width</a> and related topics, one that I’ve used as a reference in several other Wikipedia articles. Reviewed by <a href="https://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3930585">MathSciNet</a> and <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an:06999635">zbMATH</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Bubbles</em> (2018), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Czerski">Helen Czerski</a>. A children’s book on the science of bubbles and foam. I haven’t found any reviews.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Certificates of Positivity for Real Polynomials</em> (2021), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Powers">Victoria Powers</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum-of-squares_optimization">Sum-of-squares optimization</a> and the related Lasserre hierarchy has been a hot topic in theoretical computer science in recent years. A polynomial that can be represented as a sum of squares of other polynomials automatically takes only positive values, although the converse is untrue. This book concerns both the mathematical foundations and computational aspects of this topic. MathSciNet lists it only as “preliminary” and zbMATH gives only a publisher blurb.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The Classification of Quadrilaterals: A Study in Definition</em> (2008), Zalman Usiskin and Jennifer Griffin. This calls itself a “micro-curricular analysis” in mathematics education, on the best way to organize basic definitions of four-sided shapes in elementary geometry. The mathematics education community is usually pretty good about reviewing their books, but I haven’t found any reviews for this one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Combinatorial Rigidity</em> (1993), Jack Graver, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Servatius">Brigitte Servatius</a>, and Herman Servatius. Combinatorial and matroid-theoretic analysis of when a spatial structure made from rigid bars connected by flexible ball joints has some freedom of motion, and when its bars constrain it to a single configuration. I have three reviews for this one, in <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1090%2FS0273-0979-96-00670-2">Bull. AMS</a></em>, <a href="https://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1251062">MathSciNet</a>, and <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an:0788.05001">zbMATH</a>, but they only count as two because the first two are by the same reviewer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Computability Theory</em> (2012), Rebecca Weber. An undergraduate textbook on what can and cannot be computed by algorithms. Reviewed by <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/computability-theory">MAA</a> and <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an:1246.03001">zbMATH</a>. It’s listed on MathSciNet, but only with a copy of the publisher’s blurb, not an actual review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Configurations from a Graphical Viewpoint</em> (2013), Tomo Pisanski and Brigitte Servatius. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_(geometry)">configuration</a>, in this context, means a finite system of points and lines with uniform numbers of points per line and lines per point, or more abstractly a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biregular_graph">biregular graph</a>. Reviewed in <a href="https://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2978043">MathSciNet</a> and <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an:1277.05001">zbMATH</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Do Not Erase</em> (2021), Jessica Wynne. I have this one in hardcopy. It’s a photo-essay of mathematicians’ blackboards, set side-by-side with personal reflections from each mathematician. Some of the boards are obviously set up with pretty diagrams specifically for the photo, while others show the blackboards as tools for recording work-in-progress. Reviewed by <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/do-not-erase">MAA</a> and <em><a href="https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/12284">First Monday</a></em>. MathSciNet has publisher’s blurb (surprising me a little that it was listed at all; usually they only cover graduate and research level mathematics). zbMATH lists it but with a blank review (they didn’t follow the instructions in the title).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>A Field Guide to Digital Color</em> (2003), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_C._Stone">Maureen C. Stone</a>. When I used to work at Xerox PARC, Stone was the go-to researcher there on anything related to color. I suspect that, despite its age, there’s still plenty of useful material in her book. But I haven’t found any reviews.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Fixed Point Theory and Applications</em> (2001), Ravi P. Agarwal, Maria Meehan, and Donal O’Regan. A well-cited reference work on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem">Brouwer fixed-point theorem</a> and its relatives. Reviewed in <a href="https://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1825411">MathSciNet</a> and <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A0960.54027">zbMATH</a>.</p>

Reviewed in <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1426.20001">zbMATH</a>, but MathSciNet has only the publisher’s blurb.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Geometry of Cuts and Metrics</em> (1997), Michel Deza and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monique_Laurent">Monique Laurent</a>. The polyhedral combinatorics of cut polytopes, with connections to the Kahn–Kalai counterexample to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsuk%27s_conjecture">Borsuk’s conjecture</a> on the existence of partitions of \(d\)-dimensional convex bodies into \(d+1\) pieces of smaller diameter.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Geometry Through History: Euclidean, Hyperbolic, and Projective Geometries</em> (2018), Meighan Dillon. The title is a bit generic and makes this sound like a generic undergraduate textbook on non-Euclidean geometry. It could be used as that, but I think it goes beyond that as a thorough exploration of the history of thought that went into the development of non-Euclidean geometry. Reviewed by <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/geometry-through-history-euclidean-hyperbolic-and-projective-geometries">MAA</a> and <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3753698">MathSciNet</a> but only very briefly by <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1395.51002">zbMATH</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Gröbner Bases in Commutative Algebra</em> (2011), Viviana Ene and Jürgen Herzog. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis">Gröbner bases</a> are the key structure in a computational method for triangularizing systems of polynomial equations. In the worst case, this method has high complexity but in practice it often works. They’ve been rediscovered multiple times by multiple people, Gröbner not among them.

    <p><em>Hyperbolic Knot Theory</em> (2020), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Purcell">Jessica Purcell</a>. The space surrounding a knot can often be given a uniform geometric structure, in which the knot itself recedes to infinity, as depicted in the well-known video <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Knot">Not Knot</a></em>. For most knots the resulting geometry is hyperbolic. This book brings this material to the level of an undergraduate text.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Symmetric positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices come up in a variety of places in machine learning, statistics, and optimization, and more generally in most domains of applied mathematics. When estimating or optimizing over the set of such matrices, several geometries can be used. The most direct one is to consider PSD matrices as a convex set in the vector space of all symmetric matrices and thus to inherit the Euclidean geometry. Like for the positive orthant (which corresponds to diagonal PSD matrices), this is not natural for a variety of reasons. In this post we will consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bregman_divergence">Bregman divergences</a> to define our notion of geometry.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A first natural and common geometry is to consider PSD matrices as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix">covariance matrices</a> (or their inverses, often referred to a precision or concentration matrices). They can thus be seen as parameters of zero-mean Gaussian random vectors, and classical notions from information theory, such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, can be brought to bear to define a specific geometry. This happens to be equivalent to using the negative log determinant to define the Bregman divergence, and leads to the usual Stein divergence $$ – \log \det A + \log \det B \ – {\rm tr}[ – B^{\, -1} ( A \, – B) ] =  -\log \det (AB^{\, -1}) + {\rm tr}( A B^{\, -1}) + d, $$ which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback Leibler divergence</a> between two Gaussian random vectors with zero means and covariance matrices \(B\) and \(A\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we consider a different but related matrix function, which will be \(A \mapsto {\rm tr }  [ A \log A]\) instead of \(– {\rm tr} [ \log A ]\). This will have stronger links with the Shannon entropy of discrete random variables [1]. In particular, we will be able to extend two classical notions related to discrete entropy:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>The entropy function \(H(p) = \ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i\), defined on the simplex \(\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) (vectors with non-negative components that sum to one), is concave, while the associated Bregman divergence, here the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence</a>, is $$ \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}. $$ It is jointly convex in the vectors \(p\) and \(q\) (see this nice article [<a href="http://carma.newcastle.edu.au/resources/jon/Preprints/Books/CUP/CUPold/MaterialI/bregman.pdf">6</a>] for other jointly convex Bregman divergences). Note that the joint convexity is here a direct application of classical results regarding the convexity of the perspective of a convex function [<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf">10</a>, section 3.2.6].</li><li>The Fenchel-Legendre conjugate of \(-H\) (with the simplex as domain) is $$\sup_{p \in \Delta} \ \ p^\top z\ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i = \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^d \exp(z_i) \Big).$$ With the positive orthant as the domain, we have $$\sup_{p \in \mathbb{R}_+^d }\ \ p^\top z \ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i = \sum_{i=1}^d \exp(z_i-1) .$$ This has many consequences in probabilistic modelling, notably the duality between maximum likelihood and maximum entropy [1, <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/Papers/WaiJor08_FTML.pdf">7</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">The extension to matrices will have several interesting consequences:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>This defines a Bregman divergence that has interesting applications to mirror descent and smoothing techniques in optimization.</li><li>The non-trivial joint convexity of the associated Bregman divergence will lead to elegant methods for deriving concentration inequalities for symmetric matrices [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>].</li><li>Application to covariance operators in infinite-dimensional spaces will lead to a whole range of information-theoretic results [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>], but this is for next month!</li></ul>



<h2 id="von-neumann-entropy-and-relative-entropy">Von Neumann entropy and relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given a positive semi-definite symmetric matrix \(A \in \mathcal{S}_d\), the von Neumann entropy is defined as $$H(A) =\ – {\rm tr} [ A \log A],$$ as the trace of the matrix function \(– A \log A\), or equivalently as \(– \sum_{i=1}^d \! \lambda_i \log \lambda_i\) where \(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_d \geqslant 0\) are the \(d\) eigenvalues of \(A\) (note that we can have a zero eigenvalue and still be finite). </p>



<p class="justify-text">From <a href="https://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last month blog post</a>, we get that \(H\) is concave. We can then naturally define on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrahedron">spectrahedron</a> (set of positive semi-definite matrices with unit trace), the <em>relative entropy</em>, which is the Bregman divergence associated with the function \(A \mapsto {\rm tr} [ A \log A]\), whose gradient is \(\log A + I \), leading to: $$D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} [ A \log A ] \, – {\rm tr} [ B \log B] \, – {\rm tr} \big[ ( A \, – B) ( \log B + I ) \big],$$ which is equal to $$ D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} \big[ A ( \log A \,  – \log B ) \big] – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ This time we have to be careful to avoid infinite values: it is finite if and only if the null space of \(B\) is included in the one of \(A\), or, equivalently if \(B^{\, -1/2} A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2}\) is finite. Note that when \(A\) and \(B\) have unit traces, the term in \(– {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B)\) goes away.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As a Bregman divergence of a strictly convex function, \(D(A\|B)\) is non-negative and equal to zero if and only if \(A = B\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(A = {\rm Diag}(p)\) and \(B = {\rm Diag}(q)\) are diagonal, we get $$D(A\| B) = \sum_{i=1}^d \Big\{ p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \, – p_i + q_i \Big\},$$ and we recover the traditional relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Please refrain from writing \(D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} \big[ A \log ( A B^{\,-1} ) \big] – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B)\), which is not true unless \(A\) and \(B\) commute. See however below how using Kronecker products can make a similar equality always true.</p>



<h2>A geometry on matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The von Neumann relative entropy (also referred to as matrix KL divergence) defines a new notion of geometry, which is different from the Euclidean geometry based on the squared Frobenius norm \(\| A – B \|_{\rm F}^2 = {\rm tr} [ ( A -B)^2]\). Below, we plot and compare balls for these various geometries. We first consider Euclidean balls, defined as $$\mbox{ Euclidean : } \  \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  \| A – B \|_{\rm F}^2 \leqslant r \big\},$$ as well as the two KL balls (one for each side of the KL divergence): $$ \mbox{ Left KL : } \ \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  D(B\|A)  \leqslant r \big\},$$ $$\mbox{ Right KL : } \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  D(A\|B) \leqslant r \big\}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Diagonal matrices with unit trace (isomorphic to the simplex).</strong> We consider diagonal matrices \(A = {\rm Diag}(p)\) with \(p\) in the simplex. We compare the three balls below (in yellow), with \(r = 1/16\) for the three of them.</p>

<p class="justify-text">While the Euclidean balls have the same shapes at all positions, the KL balls adapt their shapes to their centers.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Unit trace PSD matrices in dimension two (isomorphic to the Euclidean ball).</strong> We consider matrices \(A = \Big( \begin{array}{cc} x &amp; y \\[-.15cm] y &amp; \!\!\!1-x\!\end{array} \Big)\) with the PSD constraint being equivalent to \(y^2 \leqslant x(1-x)\), that is, \((x,y)\) is in the disk of center \((\frac{1}{2},0)\) and radius \(\frac{1}{2}\). We compare the three balls below (in yellow), with \(r = \frac{1}{32}\) for the Euclidean ball, and \(r =\frac{1}{16}\) for the KL balls, with a similar difference between geometries.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6798" height="422" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ellipsoid_geom.gif" width="1486"/></figure></div>



<h2 id="pinsker-inequality-1">Pinsker inequality</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to use the relative entropy within mirror descent, we need an extension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsker%27s_inequality">Pinsker inequality</a> $$\sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \Big(\sum_{i=1}^d | p_i – q_i| \Big)^2,$$ which is, in optimization terms, the \(1\)-strong-concavity of the entropy with respect to the \(\ell_1\)-norm. It turns out that the natural extension is true, that is, for PSD matrices with unit trace, $$D(A\| B) =  {\rm tr} \big[ A ( \log A\,   – \log B ) \big] \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \| A \ – B \|_\ast^2,$$ where \(\| \cdot \|_\ast\) denotes the trace norm, a.k.a. the nuclear norm, that is, the \(\ell_1\)-norm of eigenvalues. See [<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yaoliang/mynotes/sc.pdf">3</a>] for a nice and simple proof.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This allows to use the relative entropy when optimizing over the spectrahedron using mirror descent [<a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/MLOptChapterI.pdf">11</a>]. Note that the diameter \(\sup_{A} {\rm tr} [ A \log A] \ –   \inf_{A} {\rm tr} [ A \log A] \) over PSD matrices with unit trace is equal to \(\log d\). Using duality, the relative entropy can also be used for smoothing the maximal eigenvalue of a matrix [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10107-006-0001-8.pdf">12</a>].</p>



<h2 id="joint-convexity-of-matrix-relative-entropy">Joint convexity of matrix relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While the convexity with respect to \(A\) is straightforward, the relative entropy \(D(A \| B)\) is also <em>jointly</em> convex in \((A,B)\), which is crucial in the developments below. There exist several proofs, but one is particularly elegant [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0604206.pdf">4</a>] and will use the matrix-monotonicity that I presented in the <a href="https://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last post</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kronecker products.</strong> We need to make a clever use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product">Kronecker products</a>. Given two matrices \(A\) and \(B\) of any sizes, \(A \otimes B\) is the matrix defined by blocks \(A_{ij} B\), thus of size the products of the number of rows and columns of \(A\) and \(B\). In the derivations below, both \(A\) and \(B\) will be of size \(d \times d\), and thus \(A \otimes B\) is then of size \(d^2 \times d^2\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Kronecker products have very nice properties (they would probably deserve their own post!), such as (when dimensions are compatible), \((A \otimes B) ( C\otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\) or \((A \otimes B)^{\, -1} = A^{-1} \otimes B^{\, -1}\). What we will leverage is their use in characterizing linear operations on matrices. For a rectangular matrix \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_2}\), \({\rm vec}(X) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 d_2 \times 1}\) denotes the <em>vectorization</em> of \(X\) obtained by stacking all columns of \(X\) one after the other in a single column vector. Then, we have $$ (B^\top \otimes A){\rm vec}(X) = {\rm vec}(AXB)$$ for any \(A, X, B\) with compatible dimensions. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Reformulation of relative entropy.</strong> We can now use Kronecker products to get: $$ {\rm tr} [A \log A] = {\rm tr}[ A^{1/2}( \log A) A^{1/2} ] = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top [ I \otimes \log A ] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}),$$ and $$ {\rm tr} [A \log B] = {\rm tr} [ A^{1/2}( \log B) A^{1/2} ] = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top [    \log B \otimes I  ] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}),$$ leading to $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ I \otimes \log A \ – \log B \otimes I \big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ The key element is then to use the identity for PSD matrices $$\log(C \otimes D) = \log C \otimes I + I \otimes \log D$$ (which can be shown using the fact that eigenvalue decomposition of a Kronecker product of symmetric matrices can be obtained from the decompositions of the factors), leading to $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ \log ( I \otimes A) \ – \log (B \otimes I) \big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})\, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ It seems we have not achieved much, but now, the matrices \( I \otimes A\) and \(B \otimes I\) commute! Therefore, we can now write $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \Big[ \log \big( ( I \otimes A) (B \otimes I)^{-1} \big) \Big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})- {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ This can then be rewritten as $$D(A\|B)  =\, – {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ \log ( B \otimes A^{-1}) \big] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Using matrix-convexity.</strong> We can now use the matrix-convexity of \(\lambda \mapsto \ – \log \lambda\), and the representation from <a href="http://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last post</a> as $$ -\log \lambda = 1-\lambda + (\lambda-1)^2 \int_0^{+\infty} \!\!\frac{1}{\lambda +u} \frac{du}{(1+u)^2},$$ leading to $$D(A\|B) =  \int_0^{+\infty}  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \Big[ ( B\otimes A^{-1} – I)^2 (B\otimes A^{-1} + u I)^{-1} \Big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \frac{du}{(1+u)^2},$$ and then, by using  \(( B\otimes A^{-1} – I) ( I \otimes A^{1/2})  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})  =  {\rm vec}(B-A)\), $$D(A\|B) =   \int_0^{+\infty}  {\rm vec}(A-B)^\top  (B\otimes I+ u I \otimes A)^{-1}   {\rm vec}(A-B)   \frac{du}{(1+u)^2}.$$ We can then use the joint convexity of the function \((C,D) \mapsto {\rm tr} \big[  C^\top D^{-1} C \big] \) to get the  joint convexity of \(D(A\|B)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This extends to all matrix-convex functions beyond the logarithm, such as \(\lambda \mapsto (\lambda-1)^2\), \(\lambda \mapsto 1 \, – \lambda^{1/2}\) or \(\displaystyle \lambda \mapsto \frac{1}{\lambda}(\lambda-1)^2\), leading to other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence">\(f\)-divergences</a> between matrices. See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>, Appendix A.4] for details.</p>



<h2 id="lieb-concavity-theorems">Lieb concavity theorems</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that \((A,B) \mapsto D(A\|B)\) is jointly convex on all PSD matrices (not only unit trace), for any fixed symmetric matrix \(M\), the function $$ \varphi: B \mapsto \sup_{ A \succcurlyeq 0} \ {\rm tr}(AM) + {\rm tr}(A) \ – D(A\|B), $$ as the partial maximization (with respect to \(B\)) of a jointly concave function of \((A,B)\), is concave. We can maximize in closed form with respect to \(A\) by computing the gradient \(M \ – \log A  + \log B\), leading to \(A = \exp( M + \log B)\), and $$\varphi(B) = {\rm tr} \exp ( M + \log B),$$ which defines a concave function. This is one version of the classical Lieb concavity theorems [<a href="http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000187087390011X/pdf?md5=09b7ceaa543358cef395fa6af8de62aa&amp;pid=1-s2.0-000187087390011X-main.pdf">8</a>]. </p>



<p class="justify-text">As a consequence, we can obtain the “subadditivity of the matrix cumulant generative function”. That is, for any random <em>independent</em> symmetric matrices \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) of the same sizes, $$ \mathbb{E} \Big[  {\rm tr} \exp \big(   \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \big) \Big] \leqslant {\rm tr} \exp \big( \sum_{i=1}^n \log \big( \mathbb{E} [ \exp( X_i ) ] \big),$$ which can be shown by recursion using Jensen’s inequality for the function \(\varphi\) above with a well-chosen matrix \(M\). See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are now ready to consider concentration inequalities for random matrices.</p>



<h2 id="application-to-concentration-inequalities">Application to concentration inequalities</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider random independent random matrices \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) such that \(\mathbb{E} [ X_i ] = 0\) for all \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\). Let \(S = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \! X_i\) (which has zero mean). Our goal is to provide upper bounds on \(\mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big]\) and \(\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big]\). We follow the outstanding work and presentation of <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~jtropp/">Joel Tropp</a> [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>]: using the proper matrix tools presented above, we can get for matrix-valued random variables the almost exact same proofs of the usual concentration inequalities for real-valued random <em>variables</em>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality">Hoeffding</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_inequalities_(probability_theory)">Bernstein</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azuma%27s_inequality">Azuma</a>, or Mac-Diarmid inequalities. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Expectation. </strong>We have, for any \(u &gt; 0\), by homogeneity of the largest eigenvalue: $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] = \frac{1}{u}  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(uS) \big] =  \frac{1}{u}  \mathbb{E} \big[  \log \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big].$$ We can then use Jensen’s inequality for the logarithm to get (together with the fact the largest eigenvalue of the exponential is the exponential of the largest eigenvalue): $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big]=\frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ ( \lambda_{\max}( \exp ( uS) ) \big], $$ and finally that for a PSD matrix the trace is larger than the largest eigenvalue, to get $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big].$$ Experts in concentration inequalities have probably recognized the usual argument to bound the expectation of the maximum of \(d\) random <em>real-valued</em> (non necessarily independent) variables \(X_1,\dots,X_d\), as $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \max \{Y_1,\dots,Y_d\} \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u} \log \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp(uY_1)+ \cdots + \exp(u Y_d) \big].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Tail bound.</strong> We have, using Markov’s inequality, for any \(u &gt; 0\): $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] = \mathbb{P} \big[ \exp(\lambda_{\max}(uS)) \geqslant \exp(ut) \big] \leqslant e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big],$$ thus leading to $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] \leqslant e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big].$$ The same experts have recognized $$ \mathbb{P} \big[ \max \{Y_1,\dots,Y_d\} \geqslant t \big] \leqslant  e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp(uY_1)+ \cdots + \exp(u Y_d) \big].$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">We can now consider random matrices such that \(a I \preccurlyeq X_i \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely for all \(i=1,\dots,n\) (and still with zero mean). We first need a lemma whose proof is given at the end of the post, with the exact same proof as for the uni-dimensional case.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lemma.</strong> If \(\mathbb{E} [ X ] = 0\) and \(a I \preccurlyeq X \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely, then for all \(u &gt; 0\), $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp( u X) \big] \preccurlyeq \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \big) I.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Together with the consequence of Lieb’s result presented above and the matrix-monotonicity of the logarithm, we get: $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big] \leqslant {\rm tr} \exp \Big( n \big( \frac{u^2}{8n^2}(b-a)^2 I \big) \Big) = d  \exp \big(   \frac{u^2}{8n}(b-a)^2 \big).$$ We can then get immediately, by optimizing with respect to \(u\) (with optimal value \(u=4 n t /(b-a)^2\)), $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] \leqslant d \exp\big( – \frac{2 n t^2 }{(b-a)^2} \big),$$ and, with optimal value \(u= {2 \sqrt{2 n \log d }}/ { (b-a) }\): $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{b-a}{\sqrt{2n}} \sqrt{ \log d}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that these are the exact same results as when \(d=1\)! </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Extensions.</strong> As nicely detailed in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>], there are extensions to all classical concentration inequalities. Moreover, this can be applied to rectangular matrices, where the largest eigenvalue is replaced by the largest singular value. Finally, for those who like to work in infinite dimensions and cannot bear the explicit dependence in dimension, it is possible to derive results that depend only on a well-defined notion of “intrinsic dimension” (the associated results can then be used for the study of kernel methods, see [<a href="http://di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf">13</a>, chapter 9]).</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we know everything about the matrix relative entropy and its convexity properties, we will explore next month a new link between eigenvalues of covariance operators and the regular Shannon entropy of the generating probability distribution [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>], thus mixing my favorite recent mathematical topic with my probably all-time favorite one: positive definite kernels!</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-lemma-on-matrix-cumulant-generating-functions">Proof of lemma on matrix cumulant generating functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lemma.</strong> If \(\mathbb{E} [ X ] = 0\) and \(a I \preccurlyeq X \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely, then for all \(u &gt; 0\), $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp( u X) \big] \preccurlyeq \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 I \big) =  \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \big) I .$$ Note that we have \(a \leqslant 0 \leqslant b\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proof</strong>. We follow the standard proof [9] for real-valued random variables, simply transferred to the matrix case. On the interval \([a,b]\), by convexity of the exponential function $$ \exp(u\lambda) \leqslant \exp(ub) \frac{\lambda-a}{b-a} + \exp(ua) \frac{b \, – \lambda}{b-a}.$$ Thus (check why we can do this), almost surely: $$ \exp(uX) \preccurlyeq \exp(ub) \frac{X-a I }{b-a} + \exp(ua) \frac{bI  – X}{b-a},$$ leading to \(\displaystyle \mathbb{E} [ \exp(uX) ]  \preccurlyeq   \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a} I\). We can then show that \(\displaystyle \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a}  \leqslant \exp \Big(  \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \Big)\) to conclude the proof. We thus need to show that \(\displaystyle \psi(u) = \log \Big( \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a}  \Big) \leqslant \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2\) for all \(u \geqslant 0\). We can simply express \(\psi(u)\) as a rescaled logistic function as $$\psi(u) =  ua + \log \frac{b}{b-a} + \log\Big[ 1 + \exp\Big( u(b-a) + \log\frac{-a}{b-a} \Big) \Big].$$ We have \(\psi(0) = 0\), and $$\psi'(u) =  \frac{ba \exp(ua)\ – ab \exp(ub)}{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}, $$ thus \(\psi'(0) = 0\), and through the link with the logistic function, the second-order derivarive is less than \((b-a)^2 / 4\). This leads to the desired result by Taylor’s formula.</p>

    <title>TR22-035 |  A Characterization of Multiclass Learnability | 

	Nataly Brukhim, 

	Daniel Carmon, 

	Irit Dinur, 

	Shay Moran, 

	Amir Yehudayoff</title>
    <summary>A seminal result in learning theory characterizes the PAC learnability of binary classes through the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Extending this characterization to the general multiclass setting has been open since the pioneering works on multiclass PAC learning in the late 1980s. This work resolves this problem: we characterize multiclass PAC learnability through the DS dimension, a combinatorial dimension defined by Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014). 

The classical characterization of the binary case boils down to empirical risk minimization. In contrast, our characterization of the multiclass case involves a variety of algorithmic ideas; these include a natural setting we call list PAC learning. In the list learning setting, instead of predicting a single outcome for a given unseen input, the goal is to provide a short menu of predictions. 

Our second main result concerns the Natarajan dimension, which has been a central candidate for characterizing multiclass learnability. This dimension was introduced by Natarajan (1988) as a barrier for PAC learning. Whether the Natarajan dimension characterizes PAC learnability in general has been posed as an open question in several papers since. This work provides a negative answer: we construct a non-learnable class with Natarajan dimension one. 

For the construction, we identify a fundamental connection between concept classes and topology (i.e., colorful simplicial complexes). We crucially rely on a deep and involved construction of hyperbolic pseudo-manifolds by Januszkiewicz and Swiatkowski. It is interesting that hyperbolicity is directly related to learning problems that are difficult to solve although no obvious barriers exist. This is another demonstration of the fruitful links machine learning has with different areas in mathematics.</summary>

    <title>Random thoughts on the Russian Invasion of Ukraine</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> 1) My first thought was: Doesn't Putin know that his army (and his society) is corrupt and people are promoted on loyalty rather than talent, hence the invasion is not going to work? But then note</p><p>a) He invaded Georgia (the country not the state)</p><p>b) He annexed Crimea</p><p>c) NATO agreeing on sanctions? They can't even agree on what to have for lunch.  </p><p>d) The above question ASSUMES that he will lose. This is not clear yet.</p><p>2) The US and other countries are imposing sanctions. Visa, MC, and Netflix have withdrawn from Russia. Will these cause Putin to stop, or will they just impose hardships on the citizens without having an affect? I ask non-rhetorically. Foreign Policy is hard, though I suspect Biden has hired experts and is listening to them. Doesn't mean they are right. </p><p>3) This seems like a case where its obvious that Putin is in the wrong so I was surprised to see some Pro-Putin arguments. To be fair, some were more that we should not get involved, which is not quite Pro Putin. Here are some and my thoughts on them.</p><p>a) Putin never called me a racist and never made my kids learn Critical Race Theory. This is meant as a GOTCHA comment. To take it seriously one would have to (1) examine what American's are learning in grade school, (2) examine what Russians are learning in grade school, (3) see which country is giving their students a more honest view of things (particularly history), and (4) decide that whichever school is teaching more honest material deserves are support. </p><p>b) Putin is a strong leader and I admire strong leaders. Really? If  Biden was a strong leader who could push through the Build-Back-Better plan, would you admire that? You can't just admire strong leaders in the abstract, you have to see where they lead. (Same with admiring people who have principles.)</p><p>c) Putin stands for good Christian values. OH- so Putin likes to help the poor and does not approve of divorce or pre-marital sex. Oh, that NOT what you mean? Oh, you just mean that he does not like gay people or abortion. OH, thats not correct- Russia has the second most number of abortions of any country (see <a href="https://www.worldblaze.in/countries-with-highest-abortion-rates/">here</a>) So the only issue where Russia shares your values is in not liking gay people. Is that enough  commonality is enough to justify invading a country? This does raise the serious question: who do you support in a war? The country that shrares your values? The country that didn't start it (sometimes hard to tell, though not in this case)? The country you have a treaty with? These are good and serious questions. </p><p>d) How come the world does not like Putin's war based on lies and had no problem with W's war on Iraq that was based on lies? This is actually a good question. Being an academic by first impulse is to write a paper on it. There are differences between the invasion of Ukraine and Gulf War II, but still, lets assume that they really are somewhat equivalent. The person asking the question was probably AGAINST Gulf War II. Hence they should be against the invasion of Ukraine as well. So this is a good question about the America and NATO's Double standard and hypocrisy but is not a reason to be pro-Putin. (I was emailed that there are many conflicts that American and NATO do not care about that are as bad as Putin's invasion.) </p><p>e) Russia had real concerns about security. The last time Russia was invaded was WW II (if I am wrong then please correct me in the comments). Even so, I've heard analogies made to America freaking out when Cuba had Nuclear missiles. There were no nukes in Ukraine. Ukraine was not going to join NATO anytime soon. I wonder if this was a pretense on Putin's part and not a real reason. </p><p>f) See <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/3/4/2083726/-This-week-in-QAnon-Chronicles-Ukraine-enters-the-conspiracy">here</a>. I give an excerpt (I am not making this up). </p><p>But as its Covid mission has become less clear, the group’s channels have turned to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where conspiracy-minded thinking has flourished. While some group members have admonished Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion, QAnon and anti-vaccine contingents within the groups have seized on a false conspiracy theory that the war is a cover for a military operation backed by former President Donald Trump in Ukraine.</p><p>The conspiracy theory, which is baseless and has roots in QAnon mythology, alleges that Trump and Putin are secretly working together to stop bioweapons from being made by Dr. Anthony Fauci in Ukraine and that shelling in Ukraine has targeted the secret laboratories. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has emerged in the past year as a main target for far-right conspiracy theories.</p><p>3) I was somewhat surprised when Hungary came out against Putin. But Putin's arrangments with his allies are transactional- there is no real love there. I was much more surprised when Switzerland came out against Putin. Switzerland has been neutral since 1515 (I think I read that some place). </p><div><br/></div><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR22-034 |  Fourier Growth of Regular Branching Programs | 

	Chin Ho Lee,

    <summary>We analyze the Fourier growth, i.e. the $L_1$ Fourier weight at level $k$ (denoted $L_{1,k}$),  of read-once regular branching programs.
We prove that every read-once regular branching program $B$ of width $w \in [1,\infty]$ with $s$ accepting states on $n$-bit inputs must have its $L_{1,k}$ bounded by
$$
  \min\left\{ \Pr[B(U_n)=1] (w-1)^k , s \cdot O\left((n \log n)/k\right)^{\frac{k-1}{2}} \right\}.
$$
For any constant $k$, our result is tight up to constant factors for the AND function on $w-1$ bits, and is tight up to polylogarithmic factors for unbounded width programs. In particular, for $k=1$ we have $L_{1,1}(B)\leq s$, with no dependence on the width $w$ of the program.

Our result gives new bounds on the coin problem and new pseudorandom generators (PRGs). Furthermore, we obtain an explicit generator for unordered permutation branching programs of unbounded width with a constant factor stretch, where no PRG was previously known.

Applying a composition theorem of B{\l}asiok, Ivanov, Jin, Lee, Servedio and Viola (RANDOM 2021), we extend our results to ``generalized group products,'' a generalization of modular sums and product tests.</summary>
