<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: The Kannan-Lovasz and Simonovits (KLS) conjecture considers the following isoperimetric problem on high-dimensional convex bodies: Given a convex body <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, consider the optimal way to partition it into two pieces of equal volume so as to minimize their interface. Is it true that up to a universal constant, the minimal partition is attained via a hyperplane cut? Roughly speaking, this question can be thought of as asking “to what extent is a convex set a good expander”?</p>
<p>In analogy to expander graphs, such lower bounds on the capacity would imply bounds on mixing times of Markov chains associated with the convex set, and so this question has direct implications on the complexity of many computational problems on convex sets. Moreover, it was shown that a positive answer would imply Bourgain’s slicing conjecture.</p>
<p>Very recently, Yuansi Chen obtained a striking breakthrough, nearly solving this conjecture. In this talk, we will overview some of the central ideas used in the proof. We will start with the classical concept of “localization” (a very useful tool to prove concentration inequalities) and its extension, stochastic localization – the main technique used in the proof.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>———————————–</p>



<p>I’m sure that, like me, you read on social media: “TOC is in crisis, scratch that, it is lost! We do not have agreed-upon challenges (that are not way out of reach) and do not know how to evaluate papers. Therefore our conferences are favoring progress in techniques and favor complicated papers on obscure problems over progress on important problems (in fact, there is shortage of interesting work on relevant problems). Our flagship conferences are broken and newer conferences, that aimed to do better, have become just more of the same. This is not TCS as we remember it!”</p>



<p>There are many points with which I agree. Like others, I have been critical at times about the way we do some things, mourning papers and subfields that our conferences have missed. On several occasions, I have been pushing for change. At times I was successful but in other instances <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2015/06/08/can-we-get-serious/">my suggestions </a>were deemed radical by the powers that be (and more modest/timid suggestions were adopted). <strong><em>But did TOC really lose its way?</em> </strong> </p>



<p>One of the commenter was saying “I have been hearing these complaints about focs and Stoc for more than ten years. They have come from powerful people that sit on committees. … So why nothing changes?“ This comment strikes a chord with me, but let me revise it and say that I have been hearing such complaints for the last 25 years (since attending my first conference), and it is almost always stated by the powerful people, those that have the responsibility to shape the field.</p>



<p>Following the continuous self-criticism, we are likely to assume that TOC is a dysfunctional field and has been so for many years. But if we look at the research achievements of TOC in the last quarter century, we must conclude that this was a glorious period. And the contributions of TCS were on different fronts. Contributions to applied CS and industry, growing contributions outside of CS as well as progress on fundamental questions within TOC. Said progress was obtained by simple papers and by complex and long papers. By papers developing new techniques, by papers making progress on known problems and by papers that introduced new problems, models or even papers that initiated new subfields. They have been made by breakthrough papers and by long sequences of modest papers. By papers in FOCS/STOC and papers in other conferences. So <strong>if TOC is in a continuous crisis, it is the most wonderful crisis possible</strong>.</p>



<p>During my studies (ages ago), I was intensely attracted to TOC. But at the same time, I felt that the field is under constant external attack. It was claimed that we are not as deep as Math and not as useful as CS. Many fewer universities than today have been hiring theoreticians. The field was grossly underfunded (still underfunded but less grossly) but still calls have been made to reduce funding to any area in which TOC is not directly serving other, more applied areas. The dissonance between my intuitive attraction and external criticism could have deterred me from TOC, but there were incredible leaders of TOC that effectively defended the field and shouted – look, something amazing is happening here. “TOC: a Scientific Perspective (1996),” by Oded Goldreich and Avi Wigderson gave me courage to continue. 25 years later, the case they once made in defense of TOC is so much easier to support (and they kept on making this case throughout the years in essays and <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/book">books</a>). <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tbd-271">As Avi argued</a>, TOC’s success have brought growth and diversification, influx of young talent, scientific respect, industrial respect, and societal respect. <strong>We should do better on self-respect.</strong></p>



<p>I am of course not advocating resting on our laurels’. Like in Alice’s adventures, in our fast field, it takes all the running we can do, to keep in the same place. If we want to get somewhere else, we must run at least twice as fast as that! Constructive criticism is a good thing but our tendency for alarmist/defeatist cries is not serving us well. As someone who grew (scientifically) in an atmosphere of struggle, I am grateful for the progress made in establishing our field by the generations that preceded me. We shouldn’t take for granted how easy we have it. But more importantly, confidence in our field and optimism towards our future are important for our impact on the world (I discussed one aspect of this <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2019/06/24/on-the-importance-of-disciplinary-pride-for-multidisciplinary-collaboration/">here</a>). Finally, thinking of students interested in TOC today and hearing the most powerful people in the field announcing that it is lost. I ask myself, who are the Avi and Oded that will give them the needed courage and optimism? The answer is still that their Avi and Oded are the very same Avi and Oded from my student years. But isn’t it about time that we lend a hand?</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In this blog post, I outline how existing advertising platforms do not prevent high-stakes ads from reaching different demographics at different rates. The post then describes how pushing this responsibility down to advertisers rather than addressing it at the platform leaves manipulating a complex system to those least aware of the system’s inner workings. She then proposes a simpler, more unified solution to this problem: advertising slots should be either targetable or untargetable, and high-stakes ads should be in the untargeted segment. Finally, the post concludes with a discussion of how this segmentation need not cost these systems substantial revenue if reserve prices are used appropriately.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: In this talk I will cover a new technique for worst-case to average-case reductions. There are two primary concepts introduced in this talk: “factored” problems and a framework for worst-case to average-case fine-grained (WCtoACFG) self reductions.</p>
<p>We will define new versions of OV, kSUM and zero-k-clique that are both worst-case and average-case fine-grained hard assuming the core hypotheses of fine-grained complexity. We then use these as a basis for fine-grained hardness and average-case hardness of other problems. Our hard factored problems are also simple enough that we can reduce them to many other problems, e.g. to edit distance, k-LCS and versions of Max-Flow. We further consider counting variants of the factored problems and give WCtoACFG reductions for them for a natural distribution.</p>
<p>To show hardness for these factored problems we formalize the framework of [Boix-Adsera et al. 2019] that was used to give a WCtoACFG reduction for counting k-cliques. We define an explicit property of problems such that if a problem has that property one can use the framework on the problem to get a WCtoACFG self reduction. In total these factored problems and the framework together give tight fine-grained average-case hardness for various problems including the counting variant of regular expression matching.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">After several attempts, I finally found the energy to start writing a book. It grew out of lecture notes for a graduate class I taught last semester. I make the <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf">draft</a> available so that I can get feedback before a (hopefully) final effort next semester.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The goal of the book is to present old and recent results in learning theory, for the most widely-used learning architectures. This book is geared towards theory-oriented students as well as students who want to acquire a basic mathematical understanding of algorithms used throughout machine learning and associated fields that are large users of learning methods, such as computer vision or natural language processing.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A particular effort is made to prove <strong>many results from first principles</strong>, while keeping the exposition as simple as possible. This will naturally lead to a choice of key results that show-case in simple but relevant instances the important concepts in learning theory. Some general results will also be presented without proofs. Of course the concept of first principles is subjective, and a good knowledge of linear algebra, probability theory and differential calculus will be assumed.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, I will focus on the part of learning theory that does not exist outside of algorithms that can be run in practice, and thus all algorithmic frameworks described in this book are routinely used. For most learning methods, some simple <strong>illustrative experiments</strong> are presented, with the plan to have accompanying code (Matlab, Julia, and Python) so that students can see for themselves that the algorithms are simple and effective in synthetic experiments.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This is <em>not</em> an introductory textbook on machine learning. There are already several good ones in several languages [1, 2]. Many topics are not covered, and many more are not covered in much depth. There are many good textbooks on learning theory that go deeper [3, 4, 5].</p>



<p class="justify-text">The choice of topics is arbitrary (and thus personal). Many important algorithmic frameworks are forgotten (e.g.,  reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, etc.). Suggestions of extra themes are welcome! A few additional chapters are currently being written such as: ensemble learning, bandit optimization, probabilistic methods, structured prediction.</p>



<h2>Help wanted!</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This is still work in progress. In particular, there are still a lot of typos, probably some mistakes, and almost surely places where more details are needed; readers are most welcome to report them to me (and then get credit for it). Also, the bibliography is currently quite short and would benefit from some expansion (all suggestions welcome, in particular for giving proper credit).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, I am convinced that simpler mathematical arguments are possible in many places in the book. If you are aware of elegant and simple ideas that I have overlooked, please let me know.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: This talk reviews diffusion methods to identify low-dimensional manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets, and illustrates that by pinpointing additional mathematical structure, improved results can be obtained. Much of the talk draws on a case study from a collaboration with biological morphologists, who compare different phenotypical structures to study relationships of living or extinct animals with their surroundings and each other. This is typically done from carefully defined anatomical correspondence points (landmarks) on e.g. bones; such landmarking draws on highly specialized knowledge. To make possible more extensive use of large (and growing) databases, algorithms are required for automatic morphological correspondence maps, without any preliminary marking of special features or landmarks by the user.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>With a bit of a delay, we are starting to upload the videos of our seminar’s talks. The <a href="https://toc4fairness.org/inaugural-meeting-toc4fairness-seminar-annette-zimmermann/">Inaugural Meeting</a> of our seminar was devoted to a wonderful talk by Dr. <a href="https://www.annette-zimmermann.com/">Annette Zimmermann</a>.  I highly recommend watching <a href="https://toc4fairness.org/inaugural-meeting-toc4fairness-seminar-annette-zimmermann-2/">the video</a>, and following up with some additional reading (some pointers below).</p>



<p>I won’t try to summarize the talk because I doubt that I can do it justice, but one of the themes (which I fully support) is that it is not enough to consider “fair” implementations of specific tasks. Instead, we (also) want to explore the right task to implement and if it is appropriate to implement any algorithmic task in any specific context. </p>



<p>As a side note, I loved Annette’s statement on ethics,  “if we can choose, we’re on the hook.” For me, it beautifully complements the paradigm that “ought implies can.” In other words, ethical imperatives only exist when the expected action is possible but every choice has ethical implications.   </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We revisit and settle a fundamental problem in statistics: given access to independent samples from a 1D random variable (with finite but unknown mean and variance), what is the best way to estimate the mean in the high probability regime, in terms of error convergence with respect to sample size? The conventional wisdom is to use the empirical mean as our estimate. However, it is known that the empirical mean can in fact have exponentially sub-optimal convergence for certain heavy-tailed distributions. On the other hand, the median-of-means estimator (invented and reinvented in various literature) does have sub-Gaussian convergence for all finite-variance distributions, albeit only in the big-O sense with a sub-optimal multiplicative constant. The natural remaining question then, is whether it is possible to bridge the gap, and have an estimator that has optimal convergence with the right constant for all finite-variance distributions.</p>
<p>In this talk, we answer the question affirmatively by giving an estimator that converges with the optimal constant inside the big-O, up to a 1+o(1) multiplicative factor. The estimator is also easy to compute. The convergence analysis involves deriving tail bounds using linear and convex-concave programming dualities, which may be of independent interest.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Paul Valiant.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>A Boolean function <img alt="f\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Ccolon+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is called a <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-junta if it depends only on <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> out of the <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> input bits. Junta testing is the task of distinguishing between <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-juntas and functions that are far from <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-juntas. A long line of work settled the query complexity of testing <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-juntas, which is <img alt="O(k log(k))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28k+log%28k%29%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> [Blais, STOC 2009; Saglam, FOCS 2018]. Suppose, however, that <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is not a perfect <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-junta but rather correlated with a <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-junta. How well can we estimate this correlation? This question was asked by De, Mossel, and Neeman [FOCS 2019], who gave an algorithm for the task making <img alt="\sim\exp(k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim%5Cexp%28k%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> queries. We present an improved algorithm that makes <img alt="\sim\exp(\sqrt{k})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim%5Cexp%28%5Csqrt%7Bk%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> many queries. Along the way, we also give an algorithm, making <img alt="\mathrm{poly}(k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bpoly%7D%28k%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> queries, that provides “implicit oracle access” to the underlying <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-junta. Our techniques are Fourier analytical and introduce the notion of “normalized influences” that might be of independent interest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: The best algorithm for a computational problem generally depends on the “relevant inputs”, a concept that depends on the application domain and often defies formal articulation. While there is a large literature on empirical approaches to selecting the best algorithm for a given application domain, there has been surprisingly little theoretical analysis of the problem.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We adapt concepts from statistical and online learning theory to reason about application-specific algorithm selection. Our models are straightforward to understand, but also expressive enough to capture several existing approaches in the theoretical computer science and AI communities, ranging from self-improving algorithms to empirical performance models. We present one framework that models algorithm selection as a statistical learning problem, and our work here shows that dimension notions from statistical learning theory, historically used to measure the complexity of classes of binary- and real-valued functions, are relevant in a much broader algorithmic context. We also study the online version of the algorithm selection problem, and give possibility and impossibility results for the existence of no-regret learning algorithms.</p>

In this post, we will discuss machine learning techniques as well as possible directions for future research.</p>



<p><strong>Machine Learning. </strong>The use of machine-learning techniques to study ECCs has increased exponentially in recent years. The main strength of machine learning methods is that they can adapt well to a variety of conditions (c.f., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03038.pdf">this paper</a>), unlike the codes produced by formal methods which are often designed for a rigid application. On the other hand, it is much more difficult to give any formal guarantees for error-correcting codes designed with machine learning, although such an obstacle may be overcome in the future (see the conclusion). </p>



<p><strong>Error-correcting output codes. </strong>One interface between machine learning and error correcting codes which has been studied for decades is the construction of error correcting codes for multiclass learning. Multiclass learning is classifying a group of objects into a number of categories. Instead of trying to distinguish the categories all up front, one can instead try to do a binary classification of some subset of the categories from another subset of the categories.” If an error correcting code (called an error-correcting output code–ECOC) is used for the distinguishing, it can provide a more robust classification.</p>



<p>This technique was studied theoretically for a preset error-correcting code (e.g., <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/307400.307429">[Guruswami, Sahai, 1999]</a>). There are also works which synthesize an ECOC for multiclass learning. For example, the work of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1624364">Pujol, Radeva, and Vitria [2006]</a> used a heuristic which tries to find tests which reveal the highest amount of information (subject to a prior that each class is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_gaussians#Gaussian_mixture_model">mixture of gaussians</a>).</p>



<p>A related recent work <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01942.pdf">[Xiang, Wang, Kitani, 2018]</a> uses the technique of <em>deep hashing</em> to hash images so that images of a similar class have hashes which are close in Hamming distance, while images of different classes have hashes which are far in edit distance.</p>



<p><strong>Deep Learning. </strong>The bulk of recent machine learning research on the automation of ECCs has been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">Deep Learning</a> techniques; that is, training a constructed deep learning network to either encode–given a message as input, output a robust encoding–or decode–given a noisy transmission, recover the original message. As deep neural networks pass messages from earlier neurons to deeper neurons, the commonly referred to benchmark is that of <em>belief propagation</em>.</p>



<p>In brief (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04793.pdf">Nachmani, et. al, 2016</a>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_propagation">belief propagation</a> (BP) algorithm starts by taking the parity-check matrix defining a given linear code and converts it into a bipartite graph–one side of the vertices are the symbols of the code and the other vertices are the parity checks. Each vertex starts with a prior (i.e., probability that the vertex should be a 0 or 1) based on the received transmission, and then messages are passed back and forth. In odd-numbered rounds, the symbols give their confidence levels to the parity checks, which then update probabilities based on being satisfied or not. In even-numbered rounds the parity checks inform the symbols if they should change their prior to better satisfy the parity checks. After some number of rounds, a decoding is deduced.</p>



<p>Some of the earlier papers using deep learning to automate ECCs [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04793.pdf">Nachmani, et. al, 2016</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07043.pdf">2018</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06901.pdf">Crammerer, et.al., 2017</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07738.pdf">Gruber, et.al., 2017</a>] tried to generalize a belief propagation algorithm for decoding ECCs. At a high level, the works of Nachmani, et.al. “unroll” the belief propagation into a deep neural network with many layers. Unlike BP which has a fixed weight for the value of each message in each stage, they have trainable weights which allow one to obtain a lower BER than plain BP. Both Nachmani, et.al., and the works of Crammerer, et.al., and Gruber, et.al., consider more complex neural architectures which use BP as a subroutine. The latter two works show success in these methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_code_(coding_theory)">polar codes</a> and random linear codes. Note that all of these works are only training a decoder, as the encodings are fixed.</p>



<p>A later group of papers [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00801.pdf">Kim, et.al. 2020</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02295.pdf">Jiang, et.al., 2019a</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03038.pdf">2019b</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9053254">2020</a>] (see also <a href="https://deepcomm.github.io/">their blog</a>) introduce what is known as DeepCode. Unlike previous work, the initial DeepCode paper [Kim, et.al., 2020] builds both a custom encoder and decoder. A particular tool which the authors utilized is that of <em>feedback</em>–after each bit is transmitted the noisy received bit is sent back (possibly with more noise added). Intuitively, feedback allows for the encoder to have an approximate understanding of what the decoder doesn’t know, allowing for on-the-fly adjustments to the encoding. The encoder sends the original message in plain-text and then incorporates the feedback with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">RNN</a> units to add two redundant bits per message bit (and thus the rate is one-third). The decoder incorporates the noisy plain text and these redundant bits using bidirectional-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit">GRU</a>s. Their methods can get a BER of as low as <img alt="10^{-7}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B-7%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for a block length of 50 bits.</p>



<p>Follow-up work [Jiang, et.al., 2019a, 2019b, 2020] consider variants of the model. In [Jiang, et.al., 2019a], the encoder is fixed to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_code">turbo code</a> (a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_code">convolutional code</a>), a “standard” code in many applications, but the goal is to train a deep net to beat the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCJR_algorithm">standard decoder</a> in a “non-Gaussian noise” model. The work [Jiang, et.al., 2019b] tries to beat the turbo code at its own game by constructing a turbo code-like deep net where a commonly used finite automata is replaced by a deep net (and a corresponding decoder is constructed as well). Finally, the work [Jiang, et.al, 2020] generalized [Jiang, et.al., 2019b] by also using feedback, like in DeepCode.</p>



<p>Outside of deep learning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> techniques have also been used to construct a decoder (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09277.pdf">[Liao, et.al., 2020]</a>).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion and Future Directions</strong>. Although the technology is still in its infancy, the automation of error correction codes is an exciting domain which could have a variety of applications in the future. As we have seen in this post, both formal methods and machine learning allow for powerful methods for obtaining automating various aspects of ECCs, whether it be constructing error correcting codes with provable guarantees or designing non-standard decodes which are robust to a variety of conditions. Looking ahead, there are a number of exciting directions which could be ripe for theoretical and practical contributions.</p>



<ol><li>A very active field of research currently is DNA storage–that is, synthesizing DNA molecules which encode data (rather than biological life). The primary theoretical challenge of DNA storage is that data loss is no longer a “bit flip,” rather nucleotides can be inserted, deleted, replicated, etc. Very recently, convolutional codes have proved successful in this setting <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.871939v2.full">[Chandak, et.al., 2020]</a>, but an analogue to DeepCode does not currently exist in this setting. One barrier is that it is difficult for a fixed-architecture neural network to easily accommodate “index shifting” taking place during insertions and deletions. Automated techniques have been used to give lower bounds on how much redundancy is needed for such codes <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/kiyavash/files/2015/06/Kulkarni_it_trans_2013.pdf">[Kulkarni, Kiyavash, 2013]</a>.</li><li>One potential theoretical contribution in this space is understanding how these automation techniques relate to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_learning"><em>augmented learning</em></a>. An example of augmented learning is the problem of picking the “best” algorithm from a class of algorithms for a given problem. A theoretical framework for understanding such questions has recently been developed by <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/papers/features.pdf">Gupta and Roughgarden</a>. Such a framework seems natural in the context of error-correcting codes, as there are many different kinds of codes, and even within one family of codes, such as Reed-Solomon codes, there are many parameter choices whose optimal values can vary significantly from application to application. </li><li>As a final thought, the use of “Formal Methods” in contrast to “Machine Learning” for automating ECCs has been largely separate. Recently, outside the context of ECCs, there have been a number of works (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.01320.pdf">[Ehlers, 2017]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01057">[Raghunathan, Steinhardt, Liang, 2018]</a>) which use formal methods to <em>provably verify</em> that a machine learning model such as a deepnet runs correctly under given conditions. It would be exciting if such methods could be extended to ECCs by showing that machine learning encoders/decoders like DeepCode can be utilized correctly. </li></ol>



<p>Are there other directions for which you would like to see the automation of ECCs extended? If so, please leave a comment.</p>

    <title>Going beyond least-squares – II : Self-concordant analysis for logistic regression</title>
    <summary>Last month, we saw that self-concordance is a key property in optimization, to use local quadratic approximations in the sharpest possible way.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text"><a href="https://francisbach.com/self-concordant-analysis-newton/">Last month</a>, we saw that self-concordance is a key property in optimization, to use local quadratic approximations in the sharpest possible way. In particular it was an affine-invariant quantity leading to a simple and elegant analysis of Newton method. The key assumption was a link between third and second-order derivatives, which took the following form for one-dimensional functions, $$|f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)| \leqslant 2 f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{3/2}.$$ Alas, some of the most classical smooth functions appearing in machine learning are not self-concordant with this particular link between derivatives. The main example is the logistic loss, which is widely used across machine learning.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Indeed, if we take this logistic loss function \(f(x) = \log ( 1 + \exp(-x))\), it satisfies $$ f^\prime(x) =  \frac{ -\exp(-x)}{1+\exp(-x)} =\  – \frac{1}{1+\exp(x)} = \ – \sigma(-x),$$ where \(\sigma\) is the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">sigmoid function</a> defined as \(\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\), and which is increasing from \(0\) to \(1\). We then have \(f^{\prime\prime}(x) = \sigma(x) ( 1- \sigma(x) )\) and \(f^{\prime \prime \prime}(x) = \sigma(x) ( 1- \sigma(x) )( 1 – 2 \sigma(x) )\) leading to $$|f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)| \leqslant f^{\prime\prime}(x).$$ See below for plots of the logistic loss (left) and its derivatives (right).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5795" height="267" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/losses_logistic.png" width="639"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">There is thus a link between third and second-order derivatives, but <em>without the power \(3/2\)</em>. Does this difference really matter? In this post, I will show how some properties from classical self-concordance can be extended to this slightly different notion. We will then present applications to stochastic gradient descent as well as the statistical analysis of generalized linear models, and in particular logistic regression.</p>



<p class="justify-text">I will describe applications to Newton method for large-scale logistic regression [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8980-globally-convergent-newton-methods-for-ill-conditioned-generalized-self-concordant-losses.pdf">8</a>] in later posts (you read well: Newton method for large-scale machine learning can be useful, in particular for severely ill-conditioned problems).</p>



<h2>\(\nu\)-self-concordance</h2>



<p class="justify-text">A function \(f: C \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) is said \(\nu\)-self-concordant on the open interval \(C\) if and only if it is convex, three-times differentiable on \(C\), and there exists \(R &gt; 0\), such that $$\tag{1}\forall x \in C, \  |f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)| \leqslant R f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{\nu\: \!  /2}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Note the difference with classical self-concordance (which corresponds to \(\nu=3\) and \(R=2\)). All positive powers are possible (see [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10107-018-1282-4.pdf">1</a>]), but we will focus primarily on \(\nu=2\), for which most of the properties below were derived in [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journalArticle/Download?urlid=10.1214%2F09-EJS521">2</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that the definition above in one dimension is still “affine-invariant” if the constant \(R\) is allowed to change (that is, if it is true for \(f\), it is true for \(x \mapsto f(ax)\) for any \(a\)). However, unless \(\nu = 3\), this will not be true in higher dimension, and therefore, the analysis of Newton method will be more complicated.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For a convex function defined on a convex subset \(C\) of \(\mathbb{R}\), we need the same property along all rays, or equivalently, if \(f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)[h,h^\prime,h^{\prime\prime}]= \sum_{i,j,k=1}^d h_i h_j^\prime h^{\prime\prime}_k \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j \partial x_k}(x)\) is the third-order tensor (with three different arguments, as needed below) and \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)[h,h] = \sum_{i,j=1}^d h_i h_j  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(x)\) the symmetric second-order one, then there exists \(R\) such that $$\tag{2} \forall x \in C, \ \forall h \in \mathbb{R}^d , \ |f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)[h,h^\prime,h^{\prime}]| \leqslant R \| h\| \cdot f^{\prime\prime}(x)[h^\prime,h^{\prime}],$$ where \(\| h\|\) is the standard Euclidean norm of \(h\). Note here the difference with classical self-concordance where we could consider the symmetric third-order tensor (that is, no need for \(h^\prime\) and \(h^{\prime\prime}\)), and only the Euclidean norm based on the Hessian \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\) was used.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Examples. </strong>One can check that if \(f\) and \(g\) are \(2\)-self-concordant, then so is their average \(\frac{1}{2} ( f+g ) \) with the same constant \(R\) (this is one key advantage over \(3\)-self-concordance). Moreover, if \(f\) is \(2\)-self-concordant with constant \(R\), then \(g(x) = f(Ax)\) is also \(2\)-self concordant, with constant \(R \| A\|_{\rm op}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Classical examples are all linear and quadratic functions (with constant \(R = 0\)), the exponential function and the logistic loss \(f(x) = \log(1+\exp(-x))\), both with constant \(R=1\). This extends to the “log-sum-exp” function \(f(x) = \log\big( \sum_{i=1}^d \exp(x_i)\big)\), which is \(2\)-self-concordant with constant \(R = \sqrt{2}\). More generally, as shown at the end of the post, any log-partition function of the form $$ f(x) = \log \Big( \int_\mathcal{A} \exp( \varphi(a)^\top x) d\mu(a) \Big) $$ arising from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model">generalized linear models</a> with bounded features, will be \(2\)-self-concordant, with constant the diameter of the set of features. Thus, self-concordance applies to all generalized linear models with the canonical link function. This includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression">softmax regression</a> (for multiple classses), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field">conditional random fields</a>, and of course logistic regression which I will focus on below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Logistic regression.</strong> The most classical example is thus logistic regression, with $$f(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log(1 + \exp( – x^\top a_i b_i ) ),$$ for observations \((a_i,b_i) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \{-1,1\}\). See an example below in \(d=2\) dimensions.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5814" height="261" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/video_log_reg.gif" width="660"/>Logistic regression in two dimensions: data space with \(a_i \in \mathbb{R}^2\) represented with a different color/mark depending on the label \(b_i\) (left), parameter space (right) with level sets of the objective function \(f\) and its minimizer (purple asterisk).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Properties in one dimension.</strong>  Mimicking what was done <a href="https://francisbach.com/self-concordant-analysis-newton/">last month</a>, a nice reformulation of Eq. (1) (which is one-dimensional) is $$ \big| \frac{d}{dx} \big( \! \log( f^{\prime\prime}(x)) \big) \big| = \big|   f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)  f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1} \big| \leqslant R,$$ which allows to define upper and lower bounds on \(f^{\prime \prime}(x)\) by integration, as, for \(x &gt; 0\), $$ – Rx \leqslant \log( f^{\prime\prime}(x))  \, – \log(f^{\prime\prime}(0)) \leqslant Rx,$$ which can be transformed into (by isolating \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\)): $$ \tag{3}  f^{\prime\prime}(0) \exp(\  – R x ) \leqslant f^{\prime\prime}(x) \leqslant f^{\prime\prime}(0) \exp( R x ).$$ We thus obtain global upper and lower bounds on \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then integrate Eq. (3) twice between \(0\) and \(x\) to obtain lower and upper bounds on \(f^\prime\) and then \(f\): $$  f^{\prime\prime}(0) \frac{1-\exp( \ – R x )}{R} \leqslant f^\prime(x)-f^\prime(0) \leqslant f^{\prime\prime}(0) \frac{\exp( R x )\  – 1}{R},$$ and  $$ \tag{4} \!\!\!\!\!\! f^{\prime\prime}(0) \frac{\exp( \ – R x ) + Rx \ – 1}{R^2}\leqslant f(x) \ – f(0) \ – f^\prime(0) x \leqslant  f^{\prime\prime}(0) \frac{\exp( R x ) \ – Rx \ – 1}{R^2}.$$ We thus get a bound $$f(x) \ – f(0) \ – f^\prime(0) x \in f^{\prime\prime}(0) \frac{x^2}{2} \cdot [ \rho(-Rx), \rho(Rx) ],$$ with \(\displaystyle \rho(u) =\ \frac{\exp( u ) \ – u\  – 1}{u^2 / 2 } \sim 1 \) when \(u\to 0\), that is, the second-order expansion is tight at \(x =0\), but leads to global lower and upper bounds. These upper and lower Taylor expansions are illustrated below.</p>

<p class="justify-text"><strong>Properties in multiple dimensions.</strong> The properties above in Eq. (3) and (4) directly extend to multiple dimensions. For any \(x \in C\), then for any \(\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^d\), we have upper and lower bounds for the Hessian, the gradient (not presented below) and the functions value at \(x + \Delta\), that is, denoting by \(\| \cdot \|\) the standard Euclidean norm $$\tag{5}\exp(\ – R\|\Delta\|) f^{\prime \prime}(x) \preccurlyeq  f^{\prime \prime}(x+\Delta) \preccurlyeq \exp( R\|\Delta\|)  f^{\prime \prime}(x),$$ and $$\tag{6} \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \frac{ \Delta^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x) \Delta}{2} \rho(-R \|\Delta\|_2) \leqslant f(x+\Delta)\ -f(x) \ – f^\prime(x)^\top \Delta \leqslant \frac{ \Delta^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x) \Delta}{2} \rho(R \|\Delta\|_2).\! $$ These approximations are “second-order tight” at \(\Delta=0\), that is, the term in \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\) in Taylor expansion around \(x\) is exact. These can be derived by considering \(g(t) = f(x+ t\Delta)\), which is \(2\)-self-concordant with constant \(R \|\Delta\|_2\), and applying the one-dimensional properties above in Eqs. (2) and (3) between \(0\) and \(1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Avoiding exponentially decaying constants.</strong> In this post, I will focus primarily on the use self-concordant functions in optimization (stochastic gradient descent in this post and Newton method in another post) as well as in statistics.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The main benefit of using self-concordance is to avoid exponential constants traditionally associated with the analysis of logistic regression. Indeed, for the logistic loss, the second-derivative at \(x\) is is equal to \(\sigma(x) ( 1 – \sigma(x) )\) and is equivalent to \(\exp(-|x|)\) when  \(| x| \) is large. Thus, if we are willing to only apply the logistic loss to small values of \(|x|\), let’s say less than \(M\), then the logistic loss is strongly-convex with constant greater than \(\exp(-M)\). Therefore, we can apply many results in optimization and statistics that apply to such losses. However, all of these results will be impacted by the constant \(\exp(-M)\), which is strictly positive but can be very small. With self-concordance, the analysis will get rid of these annoying constants and replace them by eigenvalues of Hessian matrices at the optimum, which are typically much larger (note that in the worst case, the exponential constants are unavoidable [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v35/hazan14a.pdf">3</a>]).</p>



<h2>Adaptivity of stochastic gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">I have not written about stochastic gradient descent for quite a while. Self-concordance gives me the occasion to talk about <em>adaptivity</em>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">It is well known that for smooth convex functions, gradient descent will converge exponentially fast if the function is also strongly-convex (essentially all eigenvalues of all Hessians being strictly positive). If the problem is ill-conditioned, then the exponential convergence rate turns into a rate of \(O(1/t)\) where \(t\) is the number of iterations. Gradient descent is <em>adaptive</em> as the exact same algorithm (with constant step-size or line-search) can be applied without the need to know the strong-convexity parameter. Moreover, if locally around the global optimum, the Hessians are better conditioned, gradient descent will also benefit from it. Therefore, gradient descent is great! What about stochastic gradient descent (SGD)?</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that similar adaptivity exists for a well-defined version of SGD, and that self-concordance is one way to achieve simple non-asymptotic bounds (asymptotic bounds exist more generally [4]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Logistic regression. </strong>We consider the logistic regression problem where we aim to minimize the expectation $$f(x) = \mathbb{E}_{a,b} \log( 1 + \exp(-b a^\top x) ) = \mathbb{E}_{a,b} g(x|a,b) ,$$ where \((a,b) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \{-1,1\}\) is a pair of input \(a\) and output \(b\) (hopefully, the machine learning police will excuse my use of \(x\) as the parameter and not the input). We are given \(n\) independent and identically distributed observations \((a_1,b_1),\dots, (a_n,b_n)\) and we aim at finding the minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(f\) (which is the logistic loss on unseen data), which we assume to exist. We assume that the feature norms \(\|a\|\) are almost surely bounded by \(R\).</p>



<p>Note here that we are not trying to minimize the empirical risk and by using a single pass, we obtain bounds on the generalization performance. This is one of the classical benefits of SGD.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Averaged stochastic gradient descent.</strong> We consider the stochastic gradient recursion: $$x_i = x_{i-1} – \gamma_i g^\prime(x_{i-1}|a_i,b_i),$$ for \(i=1,\dots,n\), with a single pass over the data. We also consider the average iterate \(\bar{x}_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Standard results from the stochastic gradient descent literature [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070704277">5</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2011/file/40008b9a5380fcacce3976bf7c08af5b-Paper.pdf">6</a>] show that if \(\gamma_i = \frac{1}{R^2 \sqrt{i}}\), then, up to universal (small) constants, $$ \mathbb{E} f(\bar{x}_i)\  – f(x_\ast) \leqslant (1 + R^2 \| x_0 – x_\ast\|^2) \frac{\log n}{\sqrt{n}}.$$ If in addition, the function \(f\) is \(\mu\)-strongly-convex, then with the step-size \(\gamma_i = \frac{1}{\mu i}\), up to universal (small) constants, $$ \mathbb{E} f(\bar{x}_i) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant   \frac{R^2 \log n}{n\mu}.$$ The strongly convex result seems beneficial as we get a rate in \(O(( \log n) / n)\) instead of \(O(( \log n) / \sqrt{n})\), <em>but</em>, (1) it depends on \(\mu\), which can be very small in problems in high dimension \(d\), (2) it depends on this global strong-convexity constant \(\mu\), that is a lower bound on all Hessians, which is zero for logistic regression unless a projection step is used (and with exponentially small constant as explained above), and (3) the step-size has to be adapted. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptivity. </strong>Wouldn’t it be great if these three problems could be solved at once? This is what I worked on a few years ago [<a href="http://">7</a>], where I showed that for constant step-size \(\gamma\) proportional to \(\frac{1}{R^2 \sqrt{n}}\) (thus dependent on the total number of gradient steps), we have. up to constants: $$ \mathbb{E} f(\bar{x}_i)\ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant (1 + R^2 \| x_0 – x_\ast\|^2) \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},$$ <em>and</em> $$ \mathbb{E} f(\bar{x}_i)\ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant (1 + R^4 \| x_0 – x_\ast\|^4) \frac{R^2 }{\mu_\ast n},$$ where \(\mu_\ast\) is the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian \(f^{\prime\prime}(x_\ast)\) <em>at the optimum</em>. The two bounds are always satisfied and one can be bigger than the other depending on \(n\) and the condition number \(R^2 / \mu_\ast\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus get (almost) the best of all worlds! The proof relies strongly on self-concordance and applies to all generalized linear models. Note that (a) no new algorithm is proposed here, I am simply providing partial theoretical justifications why a classical algorithm works so well, (b) this is <em>only an upper-bound</em> on performance (more on this below).</p>



<h2>Generalization bounds for generalized linear models</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Beyond optimization, the use of self-concordant can make the non-asymptotic <em>statistical</em> analysis of logistic regression, and more generally all generalized linear models, sharper in the regularized unregularized setting [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journalArticle/Download?urlid=10.1214%2F09-EJS521">2</a>, <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journalArticle/Download?urlid=10.1214%2F20-EJS1780">10</a>], with \(\ell_1\)-norm [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journalArticle/Download?urlid=10.1214%2F20-EJS1780">10</a>], or with non-parametric kernel-based models [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journalArticle/Download?urlid=10.1214%2F09-EJS521">2</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v99/marteau-ferey19a/marteau-ferey19a.pdf">9</a>]. The first benefit is to avoid exponential constants associated with usual strong-convexity arguments of the loss (which can also be achieved with other tools, see [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/kakade10a/kakade10a.pdf">11</a>]). But there is another important benefit that requires some digression.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Asymptotic statistics is great…</strong> Supervised learning through empirical risk minimization is the workhorse of machine learning. It can be analyzed from different perspectives and with different tools. As shown in the great book by Aad Van der Vaart [12], asymptotics statistics is a very clean way of understanding the behavior of statistical estimators when the number of observations \(n\) goes to infinity. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Empirical risk minimization is indeed an example of M-estimation problems (estimators based on minimizing the empirical average of some loss functions), and it is known that under general conditions, the estimator has a known asymptotic mean and variance (with the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information">Fisher information matrices</a>), which leads to an asymptotic equivalent of the unseen population risk (e.g., the “test error”). We recover the usual \(d/n\) bound for unregularized problems as well as dimension-independent results when using regularization with squared Euclidean norms (then with worse dependence in \(n\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Because we deal with <em>limits</em>, one can formally compare two methods by favoring the one with the smallest asymptotic risk. This is not possible when non-asymptotic <em>upper bounds</em> are available: the fact that they are true for all \(n\) is a strong benefit, but since they are only bounds, they don’t say anything about which method is best.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>… But it is only asymptotic.</strong> Of course, these comparisons are only true in the limit of large \(n\), and, in particular for high-dimensional problems (e.g., data and/or parameters in large dimensions), we are unlikely to be in the asymptotic regime. So we cannot really rely only on letting \(n\) go to infinity. Moreover, these asymptotic limits typically depend on some information which is not available at training time. But does this mean that we have to throw away all asymptotic results?</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Self-concordance to the rescue.</strong> Since many of the asymptotic results are obtained by second-order Taylor expansions, we need non-asymptotic ways of dealing with these expansions, which is exactly what self-concordance allows you to do (with some extra effort of course). Therefore the best of both worlds can be achieved with such tools; see, e.g., [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v99/marteau-ferey19a/marteau-ferey19a.pdf">9</a>, <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journalArticle/Download?urlid=10.1214%2F20-EJS1780">10</a>], for examples of analysis, and [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aos/1360332187">13</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/acf4b89d3d503d8252c9c4ba75ddbf6d-Paper.pdf">14</a>] for other tools that can achieve similar results. It is then possible to prove that some asymptotic expansions are valid non-asymptotically.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post I focused on two aspects of self-concordant analysis for logistic regression and its extensions, namely adaptivity of stochastic gradient descent and statistical generalization bounds.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In a later post, I will go back to Newton’s method, where the lack of affine invariance of \(2\)-self-concordance makes the analysis more complicated. However it will come with some interesting benefits for large-scale severely ill-conditioned problems [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8980-globally-convergent-newton-methods-for-ill-conditioned-generalized-self-concordant-losses.pdf">8</a>]. You may wonder why we should bother with Newton method for large-scale machine learning when stochastic gradient descent, with or without variance reduction, seems largely enough. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Self-concordance for generalized linear models</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a probability distribution on some set \(\mathcal{A}\), with density $$\exp\big( \varphi(a)^\top x) \ – f(x) \big)$$ with respect to the positive measure \(d\mu\), with \(f(x)\) the log-partition function, defined so that the total mass is one, that is, $$ f(x) = \log \Big( \int_\mathcal{A} \exp( \varphi(a)^\top x) d\mu(a) \Big). $$ We assume the feature vector \(\varphi(a)\) and the parameter \(x\) are in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family">exponential families</a> tells us that the function \(f(x)\) is the “cumulant generating” function. That is, the cumulants of \(\varphi(a)\) for the probability distribution defined by \(x\), are exactly the derivatives of \(f\) taken at \(x\). More precisely, for the usual mean and covariance matrix, we get $$ \mathbb{E}_{a|x} \varphi(a) = f^\prime (x),$$ $$ \mathbb{E}_{a|x} \big(\varphi(a) \ –  f^\prime (x)\big) \otimes \big(\varphi(a) \ – f^\prime (x)\big) = f^{\prime\prime}(x).$$ For the third order cumulant, we get: $$ \mathbb{E}_{a|x} \big(\varphi(a)\  – f^\prime (x)\big)\otimes \big(\varphi(a)\  – f^\prime (x)\big) \otimes \big(\varphi(a) \ – f^\prime (x)\big) = f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x).$$ Thus, for any \(h \in \mathbb{R}^d\), \(\big(\varphi(a) \ – f^\prime (x)\big)^\top h \leqslant \| h\| D\), where \(D\) is the diameter of the set \(\{ \varphi(a), \ a \in \mathcal{A} \}\), which leads to the desired \(2\)-self-concordance property.</p></div>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Basic ECC paradigm.</p>



<p>Since the days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, many error-correcting codes have been discovered, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed-Solomon codes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCH_code">BCH codes</a>. Each error-correcting code has its own tradeoffs (e.g., some have higher rate, some are more resistant to special kinds of channel corruptions, etc.). With the large number of ECCs which have been discovered, it can sometimes be overwhelming what the proper error correcting code is for a given application. Further, if the application is sufficiently specialized there may be <em>no </em>known ECC which meets your needs. Such concerns motivate the <em>automation</em> <em>of error correcting codes</em>, which is the main topic of this blog post. </p>



<p>I’m using the word “automation” to cover a variety of tasks which various computational methods could assist with in the study of ECCs:</p>



<ol><li>Existence — Does the code I want even exist?</li><li>Encoding — What is the “best” way to convert my messages into a code?</li><li>Decoding — How do I recover from noisy transmissions?</li><li>Verification — Is the proposed ECC design provably correct?</li><li>Selection — Which ECC from a given class should I use for a given application?</li></ol>



<p>Each of these facets of the automation of ECCs is a whole field of research! In this and the subsequent post, I will discuss at a high level two types of techniques which have been used to approach these questions: “Formal Methods” and “Machine Learning.” We’ll cover formal methods in this post, and in the next post we will cover machine learning methods.</p>



<p><strong>Formal Methods. </strong>The field of Formal Methods strives to give <em>provable guarantees</em> for various computational questions by reducing them to formal logic. Although formal methods are mostly used for software and hardware verification (that is, making sure they are “bug free”), such tools are also used by mathematicians to show the validity of mathematical statements that would be difficult to prove by hand. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_conjecture">Kepler conjecture</a>, a question of what is the best way to pack spheres in three dimensions–essentially finding an optimal error-correcting code in Euclidean space–was only firmly proved by <a href="https://github.com/flyspeck/flyspeck">Thomas Hales and his team</a> through the use of automated theorem-proving tools.</p>



<p>A line of work for using formal methods to directly construct practical ECCs was initiated by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5699220">Shamshiri and Cheng</a> in 2010. In their work, they are motivated by designing error-correcting codes for static random-access memory (SRAM), the kind that is often used for CPU caches. When using SRAM (pictured below), a worry is that cosmic rays could hit some of the bits, causing them to flip. Further, it is not uncommon for a group of consecutive bits to flip. As such, it is desirable to esure that the error correcting code can correct either <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <em>global </em>errors or <img alt="l" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <em>local</em> errors. Correcting global errors is a common property of error correcting codes, such as BCH codes or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Golay_code">Golay code</a>. However, local error correction is a much less common property to guarantee. Thus, the authors use a <em>SAT solver</em> to construct error correcting codes with the properties they desire.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Static random-access memory (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hyundai_RAM_HY6116AP-10.jpg" rel="prettyphoto">Wikipedia</a>)</p>



<p>Assuming that the code to be construction is linear (the encoding map is a linear function over the field <img alt="\mathbb F_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+F_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), then the error correcting code can be described by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity-check_matrix">parity check matrix</a> M in <img alt="{0,1}^{(n-k) \times n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%2C1%7D%5E%7B%28n-k%29+%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The key observation the authors make is that for M to be a proper error correcting code, every error pattern <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (i.e., vectors with hamming weight at most <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or consecutive errors in a block of length <img alt="l" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) must have <img alt="Mp" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Mp&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be a distinct vector. For instance  <img alt="M(0, 1, 0, 0, 1) \neq M(1,1,1,0,0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%280%2C+1%2C+0%2C+0%2C+1%29+%5Cneq+M%281%2C1%2C1%2C0%2C0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if <img alt="g = 2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g+%3D+2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="l = 3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l+%3D+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>These Boolean constraints can be expressed in conjunctive normal form, i.e., a SAT instance. As such a SAT-solver can be used to determine if there exists a matrix M with the given properties for a given k and n. For instance, they are able to find an error correcting code with parameters <img alt="k = 16, n = 26, g = 2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+16%2C+n+%3D+26%2C+g+%3D+2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="l = 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l+%3D+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In their follow-up work [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6139156">Shamshi, Ghofrani, Cheng, 2011]</a>, they use this error-correcting code for modeling an “on-chip network” between CPU cores in a multi-core processor<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Another line of work led by Ben Curtis (see the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cbright/reports/cacm-preprint.pdf">survey by Curtis, Kotsireas, and Ganesh</a>) has been seeking to construct ECC-like combinatorial objects. An example of such an object is a Hadamard matrix: a square matrix with <img alt="\pm 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> entries such that every row and column is orthogonal in <img alt="\mathbb R^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In fact, the authors search for a special type of Hadamard matrix made up of a quartet Williamson matrices which have an intricate algebraic structure. They find these objects by using an algorithm which goes back-and-forth between a SAT solver with a CAS (computer algebraic system) to help narrow the search space. </p>



<p>Formal Methods have further applications in error-correcting codes for <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6649704">distributed cloud storage</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02317.pdf">value-deviation-bounded codes</a>.</p>



<p>This concludes our first post. In the <a href="https://wordpress.com/post/theorydish.blog/1823">next post</a>, we discuss machine learning methods. </p>



<p>Are you aware of other examples or applications of automation to error-correcting codes? If so, please leave a comment.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: How quickly can a given class of concepts be learned from examples? It is common to measure the performance of a supervised machine learning algorithm by plotting its “learning curve”, that is, the decay of the error rate as a function of the number of training examples. However, the classical theoretical framework for understanding learnability, the PAC model of Vapnik-Chervonenkis and Valiant, does not explain the behavior of learning curves: the distribution-free PAC model of learning can only bound the upper envelope of the learning curves over all possible data distributions. This does not match the practice of machine learning, where the data source is typically fixed in any given scenario, while the learner may choose the number of training examples on the basis of factors such as computational resources and desired accuracy.</p>
<p>In this work, we study an alternative learning model that better captures such practical aspects of machine learning, but still gives rise to a complete theory of the learnable in the spirit of the PAC model. More precisely, we consider the problem of universal learning, which aims to understand the performance of learning algorithms on every data distribution, but without requiring uniformity over the distribution. The main result of this work is a remarkable trichotomy: there are only three possible rates of universal learning. More precisely, we show that the learning curves of any given concept class decay either at an exponential, linear, or arbitrarily slow rates. Moreover, each of these cases is completely characterized by appropriate combinatorial parameters, and we exhibit optimal learning algorithms that achieve the best possible rate in each case.</p>

<p>Our first talk for the season will take place on <strong>Thursday, Feb 18</strong>th at <strong>11:00 AM Pacific Time</strong> (14:00 Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC).  <strong>Costis Daskalakis</strong> from <strong>MIT</strong> will speak about “<strong>Equilibrium Computation and the Foundations of Deep Learning</strong>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Deep Learning has recently yielded important advances in single-agent learning challenges, much of that progress being fueled by the empirical success of gradient descent and its variants in computing local optima of non-convex optimization problems. In multi-agent learning applications, the role of single-objective optimization is played by equilibrium computation, yet our understanding of its complexity in settings that are relevant for Deep Learning remains sparse. In this talk we focus on min-max optimization of nonconvex-nonconcave objectives, which has found applications in GANs, and other adversarial learning problems. Here, not only are there no known gradient-descent based methods converging to even local and approximate min-max equilibria, but the computational complexity of identifying them remains poorly understood. We show that finding approximate local min-max equilibria of Lipschitz and smooth objectives requires a number of queries to the function and its gradient that is exponential in the relevant parameters, in sharp contrast to the polynomial number of queries required to find approximate local minima of non convex objectives. Our oracle lower bound is a byproduct of a complexity-theoretic result showing that finding approximate local min-max equilibria is computationally equivalent to finding Brouwer fixed points, and Nash equilibria in non zero-sum games, and thus PPAD-complete.</p>



<p>Minimal complexity theory knowledge will be assumed in the talk. Joint work with Stratis Skoulakis and Manolis Zampetakis.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We present the first non-trivial pseudorandom generator (PRG) for linear threshold (LTF) circuits of arbitrary constant depth and super-linear size. This PRG fools circuits with depth <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="n^{1 + \delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1+%2B+%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> wires, where <img alt="\delta = \exp(-O(d))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%3D+%5Cexp%28-O%28d%29%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, using seed length <img alt="O(n^{1 - \delta})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B1+-+%5Cdelta%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and with error <img alt="\exp(-n^{\delta})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28-n%5E%7B%5Cdelta%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This tightly matches the best known lower bounds for this circuit class. As a consequence of our result, all the known hardness for LTF circuits has now effectively been translated into pseudorandomness. This brings the extensive effort in the last decade to construct PRGs and deterministic circuit-analysis algorithms for this class to the point where any subsequent improvement would yield breakthrough lower bounds.</p>
<p>A key ingredient in our construction is a pseudorandom restriction procedure that has tiny failure probability, but simplifies the function to a non-natural “hybrid computational model” that combines decision trees and LTFs. As part of our proof we also construct an “extremely low-error” PRG for the class of functions computable by an arbitrary function of s linear threshold functions that can handle even the extreme setting of parameters <img alt="s = n/\mathrm{polylog}(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+n%2F%5Cmathrm%7Bpolylog%7D%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="\epsilon = \exp(-n/\mathrm{polylog}(n))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon+%3D+%5Cexp%28-n%2F%5Cmathrm%7Bpolylog%7D%28n%29%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Least-squares is a workhorse of optimization, machine learning, statistics, signal processing, and many other scientific fields. I find it particularly appealing (too much, according to some of my students and colleagues…), because all algorithms, such as stochastic gradient [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/7fe1f8abaad094e0b5cb1b01d712f708-Paper.pdf">1</a>], and analyses, such as for kernel ridge regression [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-006-0196-8">2</a>], are much simpler and rely on reasonably simple linear algebra.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Despite the unique appeal of least-squares, most interesting optimization or machine problems go beyond quadratic functions. While there are many algorithms and analyses dedicated to more general situations, it is tempting to use least-squares for analysis or algorithms by considering the functions at hand to be approximately quadratic.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Using bounds on the third-order derivatives and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor expansions</a> are the usual ways to go, but they are not ideal for sharp non-asymptotic results where the deviation from quadratic functions has to be precisely quantified. In many situations, more finer structures can be used. In a series of posts, I will describe <em>self-concordance</em> properties, that relate the third order derivatives to second order ones.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are many great books that cover this topic where the material below is taken from [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611970791">3</a>, <a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/LecIPM.pdf">4</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-91578-4.pdf">5</a>, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf">6</a>].</p>



<h2>Self-concordance</h2>



<p class="justify-text">A function \(f: C \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) is said self-concordant on the open interval \(C\) if and only if it is convex, three-times differentiable on \(C\), and $$\tag{1}\forall x \in C, \  |f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)| \leqslant 2 f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{3/2}.$$ You may wonder why the power \(3/2\) or why the constant \(2\). The constant is just a convention (multiplying the function \(f\) by \(c\) would replace \(2\) by \(2/\sqrt{c}\)), while the power \(3/2\) is fundamental, as it makes the definition “affine-invariant”, that is, if \(f\) is self-concordant, so is \(y \mapsto f(ay)\) for any \(a \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For a convex function defined on a convex subset \(C\) of \(\mathbb{R}\), this has to be true along all rays, or equivalently, if \(f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)[h,h,h]= \sum_{i,j,k=1}^d h_i h_j h_k \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j \partial x_k}(x)\) is the symmetric third-order tensor and \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)[h,h] = \sum_{i,j=1}^d h_i h_j  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(x)\) the second-order one, then $$\tag{2} \forall x \in C, \ \forall h \in \mathbb{R}^d , \ |f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)[h,h,h]| \leqslant 2 f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{3/2}[h,h].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Examples. </strong>One can check that if \(f\) and \(g\) are self-concordant, then so is \(f+g\) (but not their average). Moreover, if \(f\) is self-concordant, so is \(y\mapsto f(Ay)\) for any matrix \(A\). The property is also preserved by Fenchel conjugation. Classical examples are all linear and quadratic functions, the negative logarithm, the negative log-determinant, or the negative logarithm of quadratic functions. The three previous examples are particularly important because they are “barrier functions”, with non-full domains, and are instrumental to interior-point methods (see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Properties in one dimension.</strong>  A nice reformulation of Eq. (1) (which is one-dimensional) is $$ \big| \frac{d}{dx} \big( f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{-1/2} \big) \big| = \big| \frac{1}{2} f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)  f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-3/2} \big| \leqslant 1,$$ which allows to define upper and lower bounds on \(f^{\prime \prime}(x)\) by integration, as, for \(x &gt; 0\), $$ – x \leqslant f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{-1/2} \, – f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{-1/2} \leqslant x,$$ which can be transformed into (by isolating \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\)): $$ \tag{3} \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)}{\big(1 + x f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}\big)^2} \leqslant f^{\prime\prime}(x) \leqslant \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)}{\big(1 – x f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}\big)^2}.$$ We thus obtain global upper and lower bounds on \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then integrate Eq. (3) twice between \(0\) and \(x\) to obtain lower and upper bounds on \(f^\prime\) and then \(f\): $$-f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}}{1+x f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}} \leqslant f^\prime(x)-f^\prime(0) \leqslant -f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}}{1-x f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2}},$$ and  $$ \tag{4} \rho \big( – f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} x \big) \leqslant f(x) \ – f(0) \ – f^\prime(0) x \leqslant   \rho \big( f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} x \big),$$ with \(\displaystyle \rho(u) =\  – \log(1-u) \ – u \sim \frac{u^2}{2} \) when \(u\to 0\), that is, the second-order expansion is tight at \(x =0\), but leads to global lower and upper bounds. This upper-bound is valid as long as \(\delta = f^{\prime\prime}(0)^{1/2} x \in [0,1]\), while the lower-bound on \(f\) is always true. The function \(\rho\) is plotted below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5631" height="233" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rho.png" width="303"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Properties in multiple dimensions.</strong> The properties above in Eq. (3) and (4) directly extend to multiple dimensions. For any \(x \in C\), then for any \(\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^d\) such that \(\delta^2 = \Delta^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) \Delta &lt; 1\), we have upper and lower bounds for the Hessian, the gradient and the functions value at \(x + \Delta\), that is, denoting by \(\| \cdot \|\) the standard Euclidean norm (see detailed proofs at the end of the post) $$\tag{5}(1-\delta)^2 f^{\prime \prime}(x) \preccurlyeq  f^{\prime \prime}(x+\Delta) \preccurlyeq  \frac{1}{(1-\delta)^2}  f^{\prime \prime}(x),$$ $$ \tag{6}\big\| f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{-1/2} \big(f^\prime(x+\Delta)-f^\prime(x) -f^{\prime \prime}(x)\Delta \big) \big\|  \leqslant \frac{\delta^2}{1-\delta},$$ and $$\tag{7} \rho(-\delta) \leqslant f(x+\Delta)\ -f(x) \ – f^\prime(x)^\top \Delta \leqslant \rho(\delta).$$ A nice consequence is that if \(\delta &lt; 1\), then \(x+\Delta \in C\), that is, we get “for free” a feasible point. Moreover, these approximations are “second-order tight” at \(\Delta=0\), that is, the term in \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\) in Taylor expansion around \(x\) is exact.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Dikin ellipsoid.</strong> The condition that \(\delta^2 = \Delta^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) \Delta &lt; 1\) defines an ellipsoid around \(x\) which is always strictly inside the domain of \(f\) (see example in the plot below). The results above essentially state that when inside the Dikin ellipsoid, the locally quadratic approximation can be used. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5642" height="307" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dykin.gif" width="388"/>Dikin ellipsoids for the function \(f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^k \log (b_i – a_i^\top x)\), which is self-concordant with a domain which is a polytope.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will focus primarily on the use self-concordant functions in optimization through the analysis of Newton method.</p>



<h2>Why should you care about Newton method?</h2>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>For fun: Newton method is one of the classics of optimization!</li><li>For high precisions: as we will see, it is quadratically convergent and attains machine precision after solving a few linear systems.</li><li>Even in high dimensions where the linear system can be expensive, Newton method may still be the method of choice for severely ill-conditioned problems where even accelerated first-order methods are too slow to obtain low precision solutions.</li><li>It sometimes comes for free in situations where gradients are expensive to evaluate compared to \(d\).</li></ol>



<h2>Classical analysis of Newton method</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), Newton method is an iterative optimization algorithm consisting in locally approximating the function \(f\) around the iterate \(x_{t}\) by a second-order Taylor expansion $$f(x_t) + f^\prime(x_t)^\top(x-x_t) + \frac{1}{2} (x-x_t)^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x_t) ( x – x_t),$$ whose minimum can be found in closed form as $$\tag{8} x_{t+1} = x_t \ – f^{\prime \prime}(x_t)^{-1} f^{\prime}(x_t).$$</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5705" height="275" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/approx_taylor.gif" width="323"/>Quadratic approximation and Newton step (in green) for varying starting points (in red). When the starting point is far from the global minimizer (in 0), the Newton step totally overshoots the global minimizer.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Newton method is classically analyzed for three times differentiable convex functions with bounded Hessians and third-order derivatives. The method is only locally convergent, that is, far away from the global minimizer \(x_\ast\) (even for very regular convex function), the method may diverge. In the non-convex setting, this leads to nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal">fractal plots</a>, but even for convex functions, the method can be unstable (see plot above).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Locally, it is quadratically convergent, that is, there exists \(c&gt;0\), such that if \(\| x_t \ – x_\ast\| \leqslant c\), then \(\| x_{t+1} \ – x_\ast \| /c  \leqslant \big( \|x_t\  – x_\ast\| / c \big)^2\). Roughly, the number of significant digits doubles at every iteration.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to $$ \| x_{t} \ – x_\ast \| \leqslant c \big( \|x_{t_0} \ – x_\ast\| / c \big)^{2^{t-t_0}} ,$$ for \(t \geqslant t_0\) and \(t_0\) an index for which \(\| x_{t_0} \ – x_\ast\| \leqslant c\). It is less than \(\varepsilon\), as soon as \(2^{t-t_0} \log ( c / \| x_{t_0} – x_\ast \| ) \geqslant \log ( c / \varepsilon)\), that is, $$ t \geqslant t_0 + \frac{ \log \log ( c / \varepsilon)}{ \log 2} \  –  \frac{\log \log ( c / \| x_{t_0} – x_\ast \| )}{\log 2}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">That is, once we enter the quadratic phase, we obtain a number of iterations in \( \log \log ( 1/ \varepsilon)\), that is, only very few iterations. For example, for \(\varepsilon = 10^{-16}\), \(\log \log ( 1/ \varepsilon) \leqslant 4\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Two major issues may be solved elegantly using self-concordant analysis: </p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>Dealing with the two phases of Newton method, the quadratically convergent final phase, as well as the initial phase.</li><li>Obtaining convergence rates which are affine-invariant, that is, minimizing \(f(x)\) of \(f(Ax+b)\) for \(A\) an invertible matrix should lead to exactly the same convergence rate (this is not the case for the classical analysis, where for example the constant \(c\) depends on non affine-invariant quantities).</li></ol>



<h2>Self-concordant analysis of Newton method</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Consider \(f: \mathcal{C} \to \mathbb{R}\) which is self-concordant. Since Newton method in Eq. (8) is not globally convergent, we need to study a version where the Newton step is performed partially. There are several possible strategies. Here I present the so-called “damped Newton” iteration and thus study the iteration $$ x^+ = x\  – \frac{1}{1+\lambda(x)} f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1} f^\prime(x),$$ where we define the “Newton decrement” \(\lambda(x)\) at \(x \in C\), as $$ \lambda^2 = \lambda(x)^2 =f^\prime(x)^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1} f^\prime(x) = \|f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1/2} f^\prime(x) \|^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The Newton decrement is a key quantity in the analysis of Newton method, as \(\frac{1}{2} \lambda(x)^2\) is exactly the decrease in the quadratic approximation obtained by a full Newton step. Moreover, </p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>If \(\lambda(x) &lt; 1\), then \(x^+\) is in the Dikin ellipsoid where we can expect the local quadratic approximation to be relevant.</li><li>If \(\lambda(x) &lt; 1\), then one can show that \(f(x) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \rho( \lambda(x)) \sim \frac{1}{2} \lambda(x)^2\) when \(\lambda(x)\) is close to zero, that is, the Newton decrement provides an upper bound on the distance to optimum.</li></ol>



<p class="justify-text">The update corresponds to \(\Delta = \ – \frac{1}{1+\lambda(x)} f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1} f^\prime(x)\), and \(\delta  = \frac{\lambda(x)}{1+\lambda(x)}  \in [0,1]\), thus \(x^+\) is automatically feasible (which is important for constrained case, see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, using Eq. (7), we get $$f(x^+)-f(x) \leqslant \ – \frac{f^\prime(x)^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1} f^\prime(x)}{1+\lambda(x)} + \rho \Big( \frac{\lambda(x)}{1+\lambda(x)} \Big) = \log (1+ \lambda(x)) \ – \lambda(x).$$ This immediately leads to a fixed decrease of \(\frac{1}{4} \, – \log \frac{5}{4} \geqslant 0.0268\) if \(\lambda(x) \geqslant \frac{1}{4}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">We can now compute the Newton decrement at \(x^+\), to see how it decreases, by first bounding $$\lambda(x^+) =\|f^{\prime \prime}(x^+)^{-1/2} f^\prime(x^+) \| \leqslant \frac{1}{1-\delta} \|f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1/2} f^\prime(x^+) \|,$$ using Eq. (5). We then have, using Eq. (6): $$ \|f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1/2} f^\prime(x^+) \| \leqslant \big\| f^{\prime \prime}(x)^{-1/2} \big( f^\prime(x) + f^{\prime\prime}(x) \Delta  \big) \big\| + \frac{\delta^2}{ 1-\delta } \leqslant \frac{\lambda(x)^2}{1+\lambda(x)} + \frac{\delta^2}{ 1-\delta  }.$$ This exactly leads to $$\lambda(x^+) \leqslant 2  \lambda(x)^2, $$ which leads to quadratic convergence if \(\lambda(x)\) is small enough.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then divide the analysis in two phases: before \(\lambda(x) \leqslant 1/4\) and after. The first integer \(t_0\) such that \(\lambda(x) \leqslant 1/4\) is less than \(\frac{ f(x_0) – f(x_\ast)}{0.0268} \leqslant 38 [ f(x_0) – f(x_\ast) ]\). Then, for the second phase, \(2\lambda(x_t) \leqslant (1/2)^{2^{t-t_0}}\). Given that for \(\lambda \leqslant 1/4\), \(\rho(\lambda) \leqslant 2\lambda\), we reach precision \(\varepsilon\) as soon as \(2^{t-t_0} \log 2 \geqslant \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\), that is, \(t \geqslant t_0 + \frac{1}{\log 2} \log \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon} -1\). This leads to number of iterations to reach a precision \(\varepsilon\)  which is less than $$38[ f(x_0) \ – f(x_\ast)]  +2 \log \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}.$$</p>



<h2>Interior point methods</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Self-concordant functions are also key in the analysis of interior point methods. Consider a function \(f\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\) and the constrained optimization problem $$\min_{ x \in C} f(x),$$ where \(C\) is a convex set. Barrier methods are appending a so-called “barrier function” \(g(x)\) to the objective function. A function \(g\) is a barrier function if \(g\) is convex and with domain containing the relative interior of \(C\), with gradients that explode when reaching the boundary of \(C\). We then solve instead $$\tag{9} \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d}  \varepsilon^{-1} f(x) +  g(x), $$ where \(\varepsilon &gt; 0\). Typically, the minimizer \(x_\varepsilon\) is in the relative interior of \(C\) (hence the name interior point method), and, when \(\varepsilon\) tends to zero, \(x_\varepsilon\) tends to the minimizer of \(f\) on \(C\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When both the original function \(f\) and the barrier function \(g\) are self-concordant, the (damped) Newton method is particularly useful as it ensures feasibility of the iterates. Moreover, the interplay between the progressive reduction of \(\varepsilon\) towards zero and the approximate resolution of Eq. (9) can be completely characterized (see [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611970791">3</a>, <a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/LecIPM.pdf">4</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-91578-4.pdf">5</a>]). This applies directly to linear programming, second-order cone programming and semidefinite programming.</p>



<h2>Applications in machine learning</h2>



<p class="justify-text">If you have reached this point, you are probably a big fan of self-concordance. While this property is crucial in optimization, is it really relevant for machine learning or statistics? The sad truth is that most of the non-quadratic functions within machine learning are <em>not</em> self-concordant in the sense of Eq. (1) or Eq. (2). In particular, log-sum-exp functions, such that the logistic loss \(f(t) = \log( 1 + \exp(-t) )\),  do satisfy a relationship between third and second-order derivatives, but of the form $$| f^{\prime \prime \prime}(t)| \leqslant f^{\prime \prime }(t),$$ without the power \(3/2\). This seemingly small difference leads to several variations [7] which will the topic of next month blog post. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning two applications in machine learning of classical self-concordance.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Maximum likelihood estimation for covariance matrices.</strong> Beyond its use in interior point methods, self-concordant functions arise naturally when estimating the covariance matrix using maximum likelihood estimation with a Gaussian model. Indeed, the negative log-likelihood can be written as $$ – \log p (x| \mu ,\Sigma) =\frac{d}{2} \log(2\pi) +  \frac{1}{2} \log \det \Sigma + \frac{1}{2} ( x -\mu)^\top \Sigma^{-1} ( x – \mu),$$  which leads to a negative log-determinant of the inverse \(\Sigma^{-1}\) of the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\), which is a self-concordant function, on which the guarantees discussed above apply.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Self-concordant losses.</strong> One can also design losses which are self-concordant. For example, a self-concordant version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss">Huber loss</a> is $$f(t) = \sqrt{1+t^2} \ – 1 \ –  \log \frac{ \sqrt{1+t^2} +1 }{2} .$$ It can be seen as the Fenchel-conjugate of \(– \log(1-t^2)\), and the proximity with a quadratic problem can be leveraged to obtain generalization performances using this loss function which are essentially the same as for the square loss. It can also be used for binary classification (see [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ejs/1609902192">8</a>] for details, and the two nice <a href="https://ostrodmit.github.io/blog/2018/11/12/self-concordance-part-1/">blog posts</a> of Dmitrii Ostrovskii).</p>

<p class="justify-text"><strong>One-step-estimation.</strong> Given the focus of this post on Newton method, I cannot resist mentioning a great technique coming from statistics that relies on a single Newton step. We consider a classical empirical risk minimization problem (statisticians would call it an M-estimation problem), with empirical risk \(\displaystyle \widehat{R}(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, f_\theta(x_i) )\). Given an estimator \(\hat{\theta}\), obtained by any means, then if \(\hat{\theta}\) is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\) away from the optimal parameter (with optimal performance on unseen data), then one Newton step on the function \(\widehat{R}\) started from \(\hat{\theta}\) will lead to an estimator achieving asymptotically the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound">Cramer-Rao</a> lower bound. In a nutshell, a single Newton step on the empirical risk transforms a good estimator into a very good estimator. See [9, Section 5.7] for more details.</p>

<h2>Detailed proofs for self-concordance properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We first show Eq. (7), by considering the function \(a(t) = f(x+t\Delta)\), which is a one-dimensional self-concordant function, for which \(a^\prime(t) = \Delta^\top f^\prime(x+t\Delta)\), and \(a^{\prime\prime}(t) = \Delta^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta) \Delta\). Then \(a^{\prime\prime}(0) = \delta^2\), and Eq. (4) for \(x=1\) and \(a\) exactly leads to Eq. (7).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to show Eq. (5), we consider \(h \in \mathbb{R}^d\), and the function \(b(t) = h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta) h\). We have, \(b'(t) = f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[h,h,\Delta]\), which can be bounded using Eq. (2) as $$ |b'(t) | \leqslant 2 f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[h,h] f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[\Delta,\Delta]^{1/2} = 2 b(t) a^{\prime \prime}(t)^{1/2} \leqslant 2 b(t) \frac{\delta}{1-t\delta}, $$ using Eq. (3). This implies that for \(\delta t \in [0,1)\): $$\frac{d}{dt} \big[ (1-\delta t)^2 b(t) \big] = -2\delta (1-\delta t) b(t) + (1-\delta t)^2 b'(t) \leqslant 0, $$  which implies \(b(t) \leqslant \frac{b(0)}{(1-\delta t)^2} = \frac{h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) h}{(1-\delta t)^2}\), which leads to the right-hand side of Eq. (5) since this is true for all \(h \in \mathbb{R}^d\). The left-hand side is proved similarly.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to show Eq. (6), we consider the function \(g(t) = h^\top f^\prime(x+t\Delta)\), for which, \(g^\prime(t) = h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta) \Delta\), and \(g^{\prime\prime}(t) =   f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta) [h,\Delta,\Delta]\), which satisfies: $$|g^{\prime\prime}(t)| \leqslant 2 f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[\Delta,\Delta] f^{\prime\prime}(x+t\Delta)[h,h]^{1/2} \leqslant 2 b(t)^{1/2} a^{\prime \prime}(t). $$ This leads to $$ |g^{\prime\prime}(t)| \leqslant 2 \big( h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) h\big)^{1/2} \frac{\delta^2}{(1-\delta t)^3}.$$ We can then integrate twice, using \(g(0) = h^\top f^\prime(x)\) and \(g^\prime(0) = h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) \Delta\), to get: $$h^\top \big(f^\prime(x+t\Delta)-f^\prime(x) \ – f^{\prime \prime}(x)\Delta \big) \leqslant    \big( h^\top f^{\prime\prime}(x) h\big)^{1/2} \frac{\delta^2}{1-\delta},$$ which leads to Eq. (5) after maximizing with respect to \(h\).</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="has-text-align-center">This is a post about a new paper <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01739">Online Multivalid Learning: Means, Moments, and Prediction Intervals</a></em>, that is joint work with Varun Gupta, Christopher Jung, Georgy Noarov, and Mallesh Pai.  For those that prefer watching to reading, you can also see <a href="https://youtu.be/8Hy09Ot2tDw">a talk I gave about this</a>. </p>



<p>Suppose you go and train the latest, greatest machine learning architecture to predict something important. Say (to pick an example entirely out of thin air) you are in the midst of a pandemic, and want to predict the severity of patients’ symptoms in 2 days time, so as to triage scarce medical resources. Since you will be using these predictions to make decisions, you would like them to be accurate in various ways: for example, at the very least, you will want your predictions to be calibrated, and you may also want to be able to accurately quantify the uncertainty of your predictions (say with 95% prediction intervals). It is a fast moving situation, and data is coming in dynamically — and you need to make decisions as you go. What can you do? </p>



<p>The first thing you might do is <a href="https://twitter.com/Aaroth/status/1272545845603434497">ask on twitter</a>! What you will find is that the standard tool for quantifying uncertainty in settings like this is <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume9/shafer08a/shafer08a.pdf">conformal prediction</a>. The conformal prediction literature has a number of elegant techniques for endowing arbitrary point prediction methods with <em>marginal prediction intervals</em>: i.e intervals <img alt="(\ell(x), u(x))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cell%28x%29%2C+u%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that over the randomness of some data distribution over labelled examples <img alt="(x,y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>: <img alt="\Pr_{(x,y)}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)]\right] \approx 0.95" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr_%7B%28x%2Cy%29%7D%5Cleft%5By+%5Cin+%5B%5Cell%28x%29%2C+u%28x%29%5D%5Cright%5D+%5Capprox+0.95&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> These would be 95% marginal prediction intervals — but in general you could pick your favorite coverage probability <img alt="1-\delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.  </p>



<p>Conformal prediction has a lot going for it — its tools are very general and flexible, and lead to practical algorithms. But it also has two well known shortcomings:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Strong Assumptions</strong>. Like many tools from statistics and machine learning, conformal prediction methods require that the future look like the past. In particular, they require that the data be drawn i.i.d. from some distribution — or at least be <em>exchangable</em> (i.e. their distribution should be invariant to permutation). This is sometimes the case — but it often is not. In our pandemic scenario, the distribution on patient features might quickly change in unexpected ways as the disease moves between different populations, as might the relationship between features and outcomes, as treatments advance. In other settings in which consequential decisions are being made about people — like lending and hiring decisions — people might intentionally manipulate their features in response to the predictive algorithms you deploy, in an attempt to get the outcome they want. Or you might be trying to predict outcomes in time series data, in which there are explicit dependencies across time. In all of these scenarios, exchangeability is violated.</li><li><strong>Weak Guarantees</strong>. Marginal coverage guarantees are <em>averages over people</em>. 95% marginal coverage means that the true label falls within the predicted interval for 95% of people. It need not mean anything for <em>people like you</em>. For example, if you are part of a demographic group that makes up less than 5% of the population, it is entirely consistent with the guarantees of a 95% marginal prediction interval that labels for people from your demographic group fall outside of their intervals 100% of the time. This can be both an accuracy and a <strong><em>fairness</em> </strong>concern — marginal prediction works well for “typical” members of a population, but not necessarily for everyone else. </li></ol>



<p>What kinds of improvements might we hope for? Lets start with how to strengthen the guarantee:</p>



<p><strong>Multivalidity</strong> Ideally, we would want <em>conditional</em> guarantees — i.e. the promise that for every <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, that we would have <img alt="\Pr_{y}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)] | x \right] \approx 0.95" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr_%7By%7D%5Cleft%5By+%5Cin+%5B%5Cell%28x%29%2C+u%28x%29%5D+%7C+x+%5Cright%5D+%5Capprox+0.95&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In other words, that somehow for each individual, the prediction interval was valid for them specifically, over the “unrealized” (or unmeasured) randomness of the world. Of course this is too much to hope for. In a rich feature space, we have likely never seen anyone exactly like you before (i.e. with your feature vector <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>). So strictly speaking, we have no information at all about your conditional label distribution. We still have to average over people. But we don’t have to average over everybody. An important idea that has been investigated in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08513">several </a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05144">different </a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12317">contexts </a>in recent years in the theory literature on fairness is that we might articulate a very rich collection of (generally intersecting) demographic groups <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> corresponding to relevant subsets of the data domain, and ask for things that we care about to hold true as averaged over any group <img alt="S \in G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cin+G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the collection. In the case of prediction intervals, this would correspond to asking for something like that simultaneously for every demographic group <img alt="S \in G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cin+G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="\Pr_{(x,y)}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)] | x \in S \right] \approx 0.95" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr_%7B%28x%2Cy%29%7D%5Cleft%5By+%5Cin+%5B%5Cell%28x%29%2C+u%28x%29%5D+%7C+x+%5Cin+S+%5Cright%5D+%5Capprox+0.95&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Note here that an individual might be a member of many different demographic groups, and can interpret the guarantees of their prediction interval as averages over any of those demographic groups, at their option. This is what we can achieve — at least for any such group that isn’t too small. </p>



<p>And what kinds of assumptions do we need?</p>



<p><strong>Adversarial Data </strong>Actually, its not clear that we need any! Many learning problems which initially appear to require distributional assumptions turn out to be solvable even in the worst case over data sequences — i.e. even if a clever adversary, with full knowledge of your algorithm, and with the intent only to sabotage your learning guarantees, is allowed to adaptively choose data to present to your algorithm. This is the case for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/85/2/379/298827">calibrated weather prediction</a>, as well as <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/syrgkanis16.pdf">general contextual prediction</a>. It turns out to be the case for us as well. Instead of promising coverage probabilities of <img alt="1-\delta + O(1/T)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-%5Cdelta+%2B+O%281%2FT%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> after <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> rounds <em>on the underlying distribution</em>, as<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/conformal.pdf"> conformal prediction is able to</a>, we offer <em>empirical</em> coverage rates of <img alt="1-\delta \pm O(1/\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-%5Cdelta+%5Cpm+O%281%2F%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (since for us there is no underlying distribution). This kind of guarantee is quite similar to what<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/conformal.pdf"> conformal prediction guarantees about empirical coverage</a>. </p>



<p><strong>More Generally </strong>Our techniques are not specific to prediction intervals. We can do the same thing for many other distributional quantities. We work this out in the case of predicting label means, and predicting variances of the residuals of arbitrary prediction methods. For mean prediction, this corresponds to an algorithm for providing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08513">multi-calibrated predictions in the sense of Hebert-Johnson et al</a>, in an online adversarial environment. For variances and other higher moments, it corresponds to an online algorithm for making <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08037">mean-conditioned moment multicalibrated predictions in the sense of Jung et al</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Techniques</strong> At the risk of boring my one stubbornly remaining reader, let me say a few words about how we do it. We generalize an idea that dates back to an argument that<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3203773/fudenberg_calibrate.pdf"> Fudenberg and Levine first made in 1995</a> — and is closely related to <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/hart/papers/calib-minmax.pdf">an earlier, beautiful argument by Sergiu Hart</a> — but that I just learned about this summer, and thought was just amazing. It applies broadly to solving any prediction task that would be easy, if only you were facing a known data distribution. This is the case for us. If, for each arriving patient at our hospital, a wizard <em>told us</em> their “true” distribution over outcome severity, we could easily make calibrated predictions by always predicting the mean of this distribution — and we could similarly read off correct 95% coverage intervals from the CDF of the distribution. So what? That’s not the situation we are in, of course. Absent a wizard, we first need to commit to some learning algorithm, and only then will the adversary decide what data to show us. </p>



<p>But lets put our game theory hats on. Suppose we’ve been making predictions for awhile. We can write down some measure of our error so far — say the maximum, over all demographic groups in <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, of the deviation of our empirical coverage so far from our 95% coverage target.  For the next round, define a zero sum game, in which we (the learner) want to minimize the <em>increase</em> in this measure of error, and the adversary wants to maximize it. The defining feature of zero-sum games is that how well you can do in them is independent of which player has to announce their distribution on play first — this is the celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax_theorem">Minimax Theorem</a>. So to evaluate how well the learner could do in this game, we can think about the situation involving a Wizard above, in which for each arriving person, before we have to make a prediction for them, we get to observe their true label distribution. Of course in this scenario we can do well, because for all of our goals, our measure of success is based on how well our predictions match observed properties of these distributions. The Minimax theorem tells us that (at least in principle — it doesn’t give us the algorithm), there must therefore also be a learning algorithm that can do just as well, but against an adversary. </p>



<p>The minimax argument is slick, but non-constructive. To actually pin down a concrete algorithm, we need to solve for the equilibrium in the corresponding game. That’s what we spend much of the paper doing, for each of the prediction tasks that we study. For multicalibration, we get a simple, elementary algorithm — but for the prediction interval problem, although we get a polynomial time algorithm, it involves solving a linear program with a separation oracle at each round. Finding more efficient and practical ways to do this strikes me as an important problem. </p>



<p>Finally, I had more fun writing this paper — learning about old techniques from the game theoretic calibration literature — than I’ve had in awhile. I hope a few people enjoy reading it!</p>

<p>Dear TCS Students:</p>



<p>SIAM has today reopened the application portal for SODA21 Student Registration Waiver. The new deadline will be this Friday, January 8 at 11:59pm EST.</p>



<p>SODA21 will be held virtually on Jan. 10 – Jan. 13, 2021.</p>



<p>Please note that having paper(s) in SODA and its associated Symposiums is not a requirement. For this year’s application, the letter of recommendation from advisors is not required as well. The goal of the support from Google, Microsoft, and ACM is to increase opportunity for students to attend this premier TCS conference.</p>



<p>Looking forward to seeing you in SODA’21.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>ORIGINAL MESSAGE: Please see below for a message from Shang-Hua Teng, regarding the possibility of waivers for SODA 2021 registration for students.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Dear TCS students:<br/><br/>By now, it is hard to overestimate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic to society. However, like every challenge, it has created some opportunities. For example, essentially all major conferences in TCS this year have been transformed into virtual ones, making them more accessible to scholars/students across the world (of course at the expense of traditional interactions). <br/><br/>ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA21) will be held virtually this year, on Jan. 10 – 13, 2021. As you may know, this is the premier conference on algorithms .<br/><br/>See <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda21" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda21</a><br/><br/>Thanks to our industry partners and ACM SIGACT group, SODA has some funds for covering student registrations. I am writing to informing you this opportunity and encourage you to apply:<br/> See: <br/>1. <a href="https://awards.siam.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://awards.siam.org/</a> <br/>2. <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/lodging-and-support/travel-support/soda21-travel-support" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/lodging-and-support/travel-support/soda21-travel-support</a><br/>That deadline is Dec. 27, 2020. Like before, having papers in SODA is not prerequisite.<br/><br/>Shang-Hua Teng<br/>On Behalf of SODA Steering Committee<br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text"><a href="https://francisbach.com/optimization-is-as-hard-as-approximation/">Last month</a>, I showed how global optimization based only on accessing function values can be hard with no convexity assumption. In a nutshell, with limited smoothness, the number of function evaluations has to grow exponentially fast in dimension, which is a rather negative statement. On the positive side, this number does not grow as fast for highly smooth functions. However, optimal algorithms end up approximating the whole function to minimize, and <em>then</em> minimizing the approximation, which takes exponential time in general. In this post, I will describe very recent work with Alessandro Rudi and Ulysse Marteau-Ferey [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] that essentially <em>jointly</em> approximates the function and minimizes the approximation.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Our task for this post will be to minimize a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), for which we know the global minimizer is already located in a certain bounded set \(\Omega\) (typically a large ball). We can query values of \(f\) at any point in \(\Omega\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out it can be formulated as a convex optimization problem (there has to be a catch in this statement, stay tuned).</p>



<h2>All optimization problems are convex!</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the following minimization problem: $$\tag{1} \sup_{c \in \mathbb{R}} \ c \ \ \mbox{ such that } \ \ \forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) \geqslant c.$$ As illustrated below, this corresponds to finding the largest lower bound \(c\) on the function.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5352" height="203" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/f_above_c-1-1024x670.png" width="310"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Assuming \(f\) attains its global minimizer \(f_\ast\) in \(\Omega\), then the optimal value of the problem above is attained and is clearly \(f_\ast\), that is, the problem in Eq. (1) leads to the minimal value of \(f\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, each constraint in Eq. (1) is a linear constraint in \(c\), and the objective is linear. Hence we obtain a linear programming problem which is a particularly simple instance of a convex optimization problem. Thus, all optimization problems are convex!</p>



<p class="justify-text">The catch here is that the set of inequalities is dense, that is, in general, \(\Omega\) contains infinitely many elements, and thus the number of constraints is infinite.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Duality.</strong> It is worth deriving the convex optimization dual (being loose here in terms of regularity and integrability conditions). We add a Lagrange multiplier \(\mu(x) \geqslant 0\) for each of the constraints \(f(x) \, – c \geqslant 0\), and consider the Lagrangian<br/>$$ \mathcal{L}(c,\mu) = c + \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) \big( f(x) \, – c\big) dx.$$ Maximizing it with respect to \(c\) leads to the constraint \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) dx = 1\), that is, \(\mu\) represents a probability distribution, and the dual problem is $$ \inf_{\mu \in \mathbb{R}^\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) f(x) dx \ \ \mbox{ such that } \int_\Omega\! \mu(x) dx = 1 \mbox{ and } \forall x \in \Omega, \ \mu(x) \geqslant 0.$$ In words, we minimize the expectation of \(f\) with respect to all probability distributions on \(\Omega\) with densities. Here, the infimum is obtained from any probability measure that puts mass only on the minimizer of \(f\) on \(\Omega\). This measure is typically not absolutely continuous, and thus the infimum is not attained (no big deal).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5350" height="202" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/f_and_mu-1024x699.png" width="295"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This is also a convex optimization problem, with a linear objective function on the infinite-dimensional set of probability measures.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Overall, we get convex but (apparently) useless problems. We will first need an efficient way to represent non-negativity of functions (this will be applied to \(f(x) \, – c\)).</p>



<h2>Positivity with “sums of squares”</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now start to make some assumptions on the function \(f\) to be minimized. We will assume that it can be written as $$\forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) = \langle \phi(x), F \phi(x) \rangle,$$ for some feature vector \(\phi(x)\) in some Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\), and \(F\) a symmetric linear operator on \(\mathcal{H}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">We will need infinite dimensions later, but you can safely assume that \(\mathcal{H}\) is a classical Euclidean space (e.g., \(\mathbb{R}^{{\rm dim}(\mathcal{H})}\)), and that we have $$\forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) = \phi(x)^\top F \phi(x) = \sum_{i,j=1}^{{\rm dim}(\mathcal{H})} F_{ij} \phi(x)_i \phi(x)_j.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We will also assume that the constant function on \(\Omega\) can be represented as well, that is, there exists \(u \in \mathcal{H}\) such that \(\forall x \in \Omega, \ \langle u, \phi(x) \rangle = 1.\) This is to ensure that we can represent within the optimization problem above the function \(f(x) \, – c = \langle \phi(x), (F – c \, u \otimes u) \phi(x) \rangle\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical example is the set of polynomials of degree \(2r\) for which we can choose \(\phi(x)\) to be of dimension \(d+r \choose r\) and contain all monomials are degree less than \(r\). We will go infinite-dimensional and link this to kernels later in this post.</p>



<p class="justify-text">You may wonder why we are not simply modeling the function \(f\) with a classical formulation \(f(x) = \langle w, \phi(x) \rangle\). This is precisely to be able to enforce positivity.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Positivity through “sum-of-squares”.</strong> We can assume that the operator \(F\) is positive-semidefinite (which we will denote \(F \succcurlyeq 0\)), that is, all of its eigenvalues are non-negative, or, for all \(h \in \mathcal{H}\), \(\langle h, F h \rangle \geqslant 0\). Then this implies that the function \(f\) is pointwise positive. Thus:  $$ \tag{2} F \succcurlyeq 0 \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ \forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x)  = \langle \phi(x), F \phi(x) \rangle \geqslant 0. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We refer to such functions as “sum-of-squares”. Indeed, given the spectral decomposition of \(F\) as $$ F = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i h_i \otimes h_i, $$ with \(I\) a countable set, and \((h_i)_{i \in I}\) an orthonormal family in \(\mathcal{H}\), we have \(\lambda_i \geqslant 0\) for all \(i \in I\), and thus we can write $$ f(x) = \langle \phi(x), F \phi(x) \rangle = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i \langle \phi(x) , (h_i \otimes h_i) \phi(x) \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n \big( \sqrt{\lambda_i} \langle h_i , \phi(x) \rangle \big)^2.$$ That is, the function \(f\) is a sum of squares of functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A key question is whether the implication in Eq. \((2)\) can be reversed. In other words, <em>can we write all non-negative functions as sum-of-squares?</em> The answer will depend on the chosen feature map \(\phi: \Omega \to \mathcal{H}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Polynomials.</strong> For polynomials, the answer is known to be positive in dimension 1, but negative in higher dimensions (see the nice review in [<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2695736">2</a>]): that is, unless \(d=1\), or \(d=2\) and \(r=2\), there are polynomials of degree \(2r\) in dimension \(d\) that are non-negative but are not the sum of squares of polynomials. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Keeping in mind the difference being non-negative and being a sum of squares, let’s look how this can be used for global optimization of polynomials.</p>



<h2>Polynomial optimization with sums-of-squares</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider that \(f\) is a polynomial of degree \(2r\), and that \(\phi(x)\) is of dimension \(d+r \choose r\) and contain all monomials of degree less than \(r\). We consider representing the constraint \(f(x)\geqslant c\) in Eq. (1), as \(f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle\) for some positive-definite operator (here a matrix) \(A\). With the notations above, this is equivalent to \(F = c u \otimes u + A\) and \(A \succcurlyeq 0\). This leads to the following optimization problem (no localization set \(\Omega\) is used): $$ \tag{3} \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A \succcurlyeq 0} c \ \mbox{ such that } \ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle .$$ This in now a problem in finite dimension, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming">semidefinite programming</a> problem, and can thus a priori be solved in polynomial time in \(d+r \choose r\). See [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1052623400366802">3</a>, 4] for more details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, beyond the potentially large dimension of the convex problem when \(r\) and \(d\) grow, there is a major concern: is the problem in Eq. (3) equivalent to the one in Eq. (1)? This is true if and only if the polynomial \(f(x) \, – f_\ast\) is a a sum-of-squares, which given the discussion above may not happen as soon as \(d \geqslant 2\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to apply to all polynomials, the problem has to be changed. A simple reformulation is possible [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1052623400366802">3</a>] by assuming that the global minimum of \(f\) is attained within the set \(\Omega = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ x^\top x \leqslant R^2\}\) for some \(R &gt; 0\). It turns out (and this is a highly non-trivial fact) that all polynomials \(f(x) \) which are positive on \(\Omega\) can be written as \(f(x) = q(x) + ( R^2 – x^\top x ) p(x)\), where \(q(x)\) and \(p(x) \) are sum-of-squares polynomials. The only issue is that the degrees of \(p\) and \(q\) are not known in advance so a sequence (a so-called “hierarchy”) of problems have to be solved with increasing degrees, each providing a lower bound on \(f_\ast\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">When the degree is large enough so that the sum-of-squares representation exists for \(f – f_\ast\), then the following problem  $$ \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A, B \succcurlyeq 0} c \mbox{ such that } \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle + ( R^2 – x^\top x ) \langle \phi(x), B \phi(x) \rangle$$ is a semi-definite program, whose solution leads to \(c = f_\ast\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This remains a large semi-definite program whose order is not known in advance and for which complicated solvers are needed. I will now present our recent work where we go infinite-dimensional, and some of these issues are alleviated (but some others are created).</p>



<h2>Going infinite-dimensional</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider \(\phi(x)\) to be infinite-dimensional. In order to allow finite-dimensional manipulations of various objects, we consider feature maps which are obtained from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_kernel">positive-definite kernels</a>. More precisely, we consider the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev space</a> \(\mathcal{H}\) of functions on \(\Omega\) with all partial derivatives up to order \(s\) which are square-integrable. When \(s &gt; d/2\), then this is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, that is, there exists a positive-definite kernel \(k: \Omega \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) such that the feature map \(\phi(x) = k(\cdot,x)\) allows to access function values as \(h(x) = \langle h, \phi(x) \rangle\) for all \(h \in \mathcal{H}\). For the algorithm, we will only need access to the kernel; for example, for \(s = d/2+1/2\), we can choose the usual exponential \(k(x,y) = \exp( – \alpha \| x – y \|_2)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider the same problem as for polynomials, but with this new feature map: $$\tag{4} \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A \succcurlyeq 0} c \ \mbox{ such that } \ \forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle .$$ In order to have an exact reformulation, we need that there exists some \(A_\ast\) such that \(\forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x)  \, – f_\ast = \langle \phi(x), A_\ast \phi(x) \rangle\). It turns out to be true [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] with appropriate geometric conditions on \(x\) (such as isolated second-order strict global minimizers within \(\Omega\)) and regularity (at least \(s+3\) derivatives); see [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This is all very nice, but the problem in Eq. (4) is still an infinite-dimensional problem (note that we have gone from a continuum of inequalities to elements of a Hilbert space, but that’s not much of a gain). </p>



<h2>Controlled approximation through sampling</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now leverage classical and more recent techniques from kernel methods. The main idea is to subsample the set of equalities in Eq. (4), that is consider \(n\) points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \Omega\), and solve instead the regularized sampled problem $$\tag{5} \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A \succcurlyeq 0} c \ – \, \lambda \, {\rm tr}(A) \ \mbox{ such that }\  \forall i \in \{1,\dots,n\}, \ f(x_i) = c + \langle \phi(x_i), A \phi(x_i) \rangle , $$ where \(\lambda &gt; 0\) is a regularization parameter.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Approximation guarantees.</strong> Beyond computational considerations, how big does \(n\) need to be to obtain a value of \(c\) which is at most \(\varepsilon\) away from \(f_\ast\)? From <a href="https://francisbach.com/optimization-is-as-hard-as-approximation/">last post</a>, if \(f\) is \(m\)-times differentiable, we cannot have \(n\) smaller than \(\varepsilon^{-d/m}\). As shown in [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>], for points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \Omega\) selected uniformly at random, then \(n\) can be taken to of the order \(\varepsilon^{-d/(m – d/2 – 3)}\) for a well-chosen Sobolev space \(s\) and regularization parameter \(\lambda\). This is not the optimal rate \(\varepsilon^{-d/(m – d/2)}\) , but close when \(m\) and \(d\) are large.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Finite-dimensional algorithm.</strong> The problem in Eq. (5) is still infinite-dimensional. We can leverage a recent work, again with Ulysse Marteau-Ferey and Alessandro Rudi [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03926(opens in a new tab)">5</a>], that shows that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a> exists for this type of problems: the optimization for the operator \(A\) may be restricted to \(A\) of the form $$A = \sum_{i,j} C_{ij} \phi(x_i) \otimes \phi(x_j)$$ for a positive definite <em>matrix</em> \(C \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\). This leads to a semi-definite programming problem of size \(n\), whose running-time complexity is polynomial in \(n\) (e.g, \(O(n^{3.5})\)), with standard general-purpose toolboxes (such as <a href="http://cvxr.com/cvx/">CVX</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to tackle large values \(n\) which are larger than \(1000\), simple iterative algorithms can be designed (see [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] for a damped Newton algorithm which does not require any singular value decompositions, with complexity \(O(n^3)\) per iteration). Classical tools for efficient kernel methods, such as column sampling / Nyström method (see [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Bach13.pdf">6</a>, <a href="http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/5936-less-is-more-nystrom-computational-regularization.pdf">7</a>] and references therein) or random features (see [<a href="http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/6914-generalization-properties-of-learning-with-random-features.pdf">8</a>, <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-178/15-178.pdf">9</a>] and references therein), could also be used to avoid a cubic or quadratic complexity in \(n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Comparison with random search.</strong> Instead of solving the problem in Eq. (5), we could output the minimal value of \(f(x_i)\) for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\), which is exactly random search if the points \(x_i\) are random (this also happens to correspond to using \(\lambda=0\) in Eq. (5)). This can only achieve an error \(\varepsilon\) for \(n\) of order \(\varepsilon^{-d}\); in other words, it cannot leverage smoothness, while our algorithm can. The main technical reason is that subsampling inequalities provide weaker guarantees than subsampling equalities, and thus representing the non-negativity of a function through an equality (which our method essentially does) provides significant benefits.</p>



<h2>Duality</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As always in convex optimization, it is beneficial to look at dual problems. It turns out that iterative algorithms are easier to build for the finite-dimensional dual problem to Eq. (5). We rather look now at the dual of Eq. (4) and make the parallel with the primal original problem in Eq. (1) and its dual.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Introducing a Lagrange multiplier \(\mu(x)\) for the constraint \(f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle\) (this time not constrained to be non-negative because we have an equality constraint), we can form the Lagrangian $$\mathcal{L}(c,A,\mu) = c + \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) \big( f(x) \, – c \, – \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle \big) dx.$$ Maximizing with respect to \(c\) again leads to the constraint \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) dx = 1\), while minimizing with respect to \(A \succcurlyeq 0\) leads to the constraint \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) \phi(x) \otimes \phi(x) dx \succcurlyeq 0 .\) The dual problem thus becomes $$ \inf_{\mu \in \mathbb{R}^\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) f(x) dx \ \ \mbox{ such that } \int_\Omega\! \mu(x) dx = 1 \mbox{ and } \ \int_\Omega \mu(x) \phi(x) \otimes \phi(x)dx \succcurlyeq 0.$$ The impact of the representation of non-negative functions by quadratic forms in \(\phi(x)\) is to replace the non-negativity contraint on all \(\mu(x)\) by the positivity of the matrix \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) \phi(x) \otimes \phi(x)dx\), which is weaker in general, but equivalent if \(\phi(x)\) is “large” enough.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that the dual problem through a signed measure that should concentrate around the minimizers of \(f\) leads to a natural candidate \(\int_\Omega x \mu(x) dx\) for the optimizer (see more details in [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>], and a similar dual formulation for polynomials in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08566.pdf">10</a>]).</p>



<h2>Simulations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to highlight how the optimization method works, I will first present how it minimizes the multi-modal function in dimension \(d=2\) pictured below on \([-1,1]^2\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5384" height="367" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f3d_blog-1024x768.png" width="500"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We consider sampling a sequence of points \(x_1, x_2,\dots \in \mathbb{R}^2\) from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence">quasi-random sequence </a>(so that it fills the space more evenly that purely random). The random points are displayed in purple while the solution of our algorithm is displayed in red, with increasing numbers \(n\) of sampled points. On the right plot, the model \(c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle\) is displayed, showing that the model becomes more accurate as \(n\) grows.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5385" height="434" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gloptikernel_blog.gif" width="1196"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We also consider a problem in dimension \(d=8\), where we compare random sampling and our algorithm (“gloptikernel”), as \(n\) grows (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11978">1</a>] for the experimental set-up).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5383" height="302" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plot_blog_perf.png" width="362"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Clearly, the chosen baseline (random sampling) is rudimentary, though optimal up to logarithmic terms for non-smooth problems where only Lipschitz-continuity is assumed. We can also compare to gradient descent with random restarts (“random+GD” below, with the same overall number of function evaluations). As shown below, when the gradient information is robust, this baseline performs similarly (left plot), while when a high frequency component is added to the function (which makes the gradient information non reliable, right plot), the local descent algorithm needs more function evaluations.</p>

<p class="justify-text">It would be interesting to compare this new algorithms to other global optimization algorithms based on function evaluations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES">CMA-ES</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization">Bayesian optimization</a>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I presented an algorithm for global optimization that can provably leverage smoothness with an algorithm which has a running time which is polynomial in the dimension and the number of function evaluations. For large smoothness factors, the number of such evaluations has a dependence on the precision \(\varepsilon\) which has no exponential dependence in dimension in the exponent (but still in the constants: we cannot optimize multivariate polynomials in polynomial time…).</p>



<p class="justify-text">These ideas can be extended in a number of ways.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>General relaxation tool for dense inequalities. </strong>We can generalize the previous developments to all problems with a continuum of constraints on a variable \(\theta\), such as, $$ \forall x \in \Omega, \ H(\theta,x) \geqslant 0.$$ The corresponding Lagrange multipliers also satisfy $$ \forall x \in \Omega, \ \mu(x) \geqslant 0$$ (there may be other ones like in the problem above). Now the question is: should we use the non-negative modelisation with quadratic forms in the primal or in the dual? Or equivalently, replace the non-negativity constraint by the positivity of the integral of \(\phi(x) \otimes \phi(x)\) in the dual or in the primal?</p>



<p class="justify-text">The answer depends on the expected smoothness of the function which is non-negative. In the optimization problem, we expect \(f(x) \, – c\) to be smooth at the optimum, while \(\mu(x)\) which is approximating a Dirac clearly isn’t; therefore, the choice is clear (at least in retrospect since we originally tried to model \(\mu(x)\) as a quadratic form…).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Constrained optimization.</strong> Following [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1052623400366802">3</a>], we can apply the same algorithmic technique to constrained optimization, by formulating the problem of minimizing \(f(x)\) such that \(g(x) &gt; 0\) as maximizing \(c\) such that \(f(x) = c + p(x) + g(x)q(x)\), and \(p, q\) non-negative functions. We can (at least in principle) then replace the non-negative constraints by \(p(x) = \langle \phi(x),A\phi(x)\rangle\) and \(q(x) =\langle \phi(x),B\phi(x)\rangle\) for positive operators \(A\) and \(B\). All this remains to be explored in more details.</p>

    <title>Optimization is as hard as approximation</title>
    <summary>Optimization is a key tool in machine learning, where the goal is to achieve the best possible objective function value in a minimum amount of time.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Optimization is a key tool in machine learning, where the goal is to achieve the best possible objective function value in a minimum amount of time. Obtaining any form of global guarantees can usually be done with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization">convex</a> objective functions, or with special cases such as risk minimization with one-hidden over-parameterized layer neural networks (see the <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-neural-networks-global-convergence/">June post</a>). In this post, I will consider low-dimensional problems (imagine 10 or 20), with no constraint on running time (thus get ready for some running-times that are exponential in dimension!).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider minimizing a function \(f\) on a bounded subset  \(\mathcal{X}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^d\), based only on function evaluations, a problem often referred to as zero-th order optimization or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization">derivative-free optimization</a>. No convexity is assumed, so we should not expect fast rates, and, again, no efficient algorithms that can provably find a global minimizer. Good references on what I am going to cover in this post are [1, 2, 5].</p>



<p class="justify-text">One may wonder why this is interesting at all. Clearly, such algorithms are not made to be used to find millions of parameters for logistic regression or neural networks, but they are often used for hyperparameter tuning (regularization parameters, size of neural network layer, etc.). See, e.g., [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/05311655a15b75fab86956663e1819cd-Paper.pdf">6</a>] for applications.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are going to assume some regularity for the functions we want to minimize, typically bounded derivatives. We will thus assume that \(f \in \mathcal{F}\), for a space \(\mathcal{F}\) of functions from \(\mathcal{X}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\). We are going to take a worst-case approach, where we characterize convergence over all members of \(\mathcal{F}\).  That is, we want our guarantees to hold for <em>all</em> functions in \(\mathcal{F}\). Note that this worst-case analysis may not predict well what’s happening for a particular function; in particular, it is (by design) pessimistic.</p>



<p class="justify-text">An algorithm \(\mathcal{O}\) will be characterized by (a) the choice of points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathcal{X}\) to query the function, and (b) the algorithm to output a candidate \(\hat{x} \in \mathcal{X}\) such that \(f(\hat{x}) \ – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)  \) is small. The estimate \(\hat{x}\) can only depend on \((x_i,f(x_i))\), for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\). In most of this post, the choice of points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) is made once (without seeing any function values). We show later in this blog post that going <em>adaptive</em>, where the point \(x_{i+1}\) is selected after seeing \((x_j,f(x_j))\) for all \(j \leqslant i\), does not bring much (at least in the worst-case sense).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given a selection of points and the algorithm \(\mathcal{O}\), the rate of convergence is the supremum over all functions \(f \in \mathcal{F}\) of the error \(f(\hat{x}) \ – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\). This is a function \(\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{O})\) of the number \(n\) of sampled points (and of the the class of functions \(\mathcal{F}\)). The optimal algorithm (minimizing \(\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{O})\)) will lead to a rate we denote \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm opt}\), and which we aim to characterize.</p>



<h2>Direct lower/upper bounds for Lipschitz-continuous functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The argument is particularly simple for a bounded metric space \(\mathcal{X}\) with distance \(d\), and \(\mathcal{F}\) the class of \(L\)-Lipschitz-continuous functions, that is, such that for all \(x,x’ \in \mathcal{X}\), \(|f(x) -f(x’)| \leqslant L d(x,x’)\). This is a very large set of functions, so expect weak convergence rates.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Set covers. </strong>We will need to cover the set \(\mathcal{X}\) with balls of a given radius. The minimal radius \(r\) of a cover of \(\mathcal{X}\) by \(n\) balls of radius \(r\) is denoted \(r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\). This corresponds to \(n\) ball centers \(x_1,\dots,x_n\). See example below for the unit cube \(\mathcal{X} = [0,1]^2\) and the metric obtained from the \(\ell_\infty\)-norm, with \(n = 16\), and \(r_n([0,1]^2,\ell_\infty) = 1/8\). See more details on covering numbers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_number">here</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5187" height="269" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cover-1024x1024.png" width="269"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">More generally, for the unit cube \(\mathcal{X} = [0,1]^d\), we have \(r_n([0,1]^d,\ell_\infty) \approx \frac{1}{2} n^{-1/d}\) (which is not an approximation where \(n\) is the \(d\)-th power of an integer). For other normed metrics, (since all norms are equivalent) the scaling as \(r_n \sim {\rm diam} (\mathcal{X}) n^{-1/d}\) is the same on any bounded set in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (with an extra constant that depends on \(d\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Algorithm. </strong>Given the ball centers \(x_1,\dots,x_n\), outputting the minimum of function values \(f(x_i)\) for \(i=1,\dots,n\), leads to an error which is less than \(L r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\), as the optimal \(x_\ast \in \mathcal{X}\) is at most at distance \(r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\) from one of the cluster centers, let’s say \(x_k\), and thus \(f(x_k)\  – f(x_\ast) \leqslant L d(x_k,x_\ast) \leqslant L r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\). This provides an upper-bound on \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm opt}\). The algorithm we just described seems naive, but it turns out to be optimal for this class of problems.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lower-bound.</strong> Consider any optimization algorithm, with its first \(n\) point queries and its estimate \(\hat{x}\). By considering the functions which are zero in these \(n+1\) points, the algorithm outputs zero. We now simply need to construct a function \(f \in \mathcal{F}\) such that \(f\) is zero at these points, but maximally smaller than zero at a different point. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Consider a cover of \(\mathcal{X}\) with \(n+2\) balls of minimal radius  (equal to \(r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\)), there has to exist at least one of the \(n+2\) corresponding ball centers such that the corresponding ball contains no points from the algorithm (denote by \(y\) its center). We can then construct the function $$ f(x)  = \ – L \big( r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) \ – d(x,y) \big)_+ = \ – L \max \big\{  r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) \ – d(x,y) ,0 \big\}, $$ which is zero on all points of the algorithm and the output point \(\hat{x}\), and with minimum value \(– L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\) attained at \(y\). Thus, we must have \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \geqslant 0 \ – (\ – L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) ) = L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\). This difficult function is plotted below in one dimension.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5260" height="73" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lowerbound-1-1024x178.png" width="423"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, the performance of any algorithm from \(n\) function values has to be larger than \(L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\).  Thus, so far, we have shown that $$L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) \leqslant \varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \leqslant L r_{n}(\mathcal{X},d).$$  For \(\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d\), \(r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\) is typically of order \({\rm diam}(\mathcal{X}) n^{-1/d}\), and thus the difference between \(n\) and \(n+2\) above is negligible. Note that the rate in \(n^{-1/d}\) is <strong>very</strong> slow, and symptomatic of the classical curse of dimensionality. The appearance of a covering number is not totally random here, as we will see below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Random search.</strong> We can have a similar bound up to logarithmic terms for random search, that is, after selecting independently \(n\) points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\), uniformly at random in \(\mathcal{X}\), and selecting the points with smallest function value \(f(x_i)\). The performance can be shown to be proportional to \(L {\rm diam}(\mathcal{X}) ( \log n )^{1/d} n^{-1/d}\) in high probability, leading to an extra logarithmic term (the proof can be obtained with a simple covering argument, as shown at the end of the post). Therefore, random search is optimal up to logarithmic terms for this very large class of functions to optimize.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We would like to go beyond Lipschitz-continuous functions, and study if we can leverage smoothness, and hopefully avoid the dependence in \(n^{-1/d}\). This can be done by a somewhat surprising equivalence between worst case guarantees from optimization and worst case guarantees for uniform approximation.</p>



<h2>Optimization is as hard as uniform function approximation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now also consider the problem of outputting a whole function \(\hat{f} \in \mathcal{F}\), such that \(\|f – \hat{f}\|_\infty = \max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} | \hat{f}(x)\ – f(x)|\) is as small as possible. For any approximation algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) that builds an estimate \(\hat{f} \in \mathcal{F}\) from \(n\) function values, we can define its convergence rate in the same way as for optimization algorithm \(\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{A})\), as a function of \(n\). The optimal approximation algorithm has a convergence rate denoted by \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm app}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From approximation to optimization. </strong>Clearly, an approximation algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) leads to an optimization algorithm \(\mathcal{O}\) with at most twice the same rate, that is, $$  \varepsilon_n(\mathcal{O}) \leqslant 2\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{A}),$$ by simply approximating \(f\) by \(\hat{f}\) and outputting any \(\hat{x} \in \arg \min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \hat{f}(x)\), for which $$f(\hat{x})  \leqslant \hat{f}(\hat{x}) + \| \hat{f}\ – f\|_\infty =  \min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \hat{f}(x) + \| \hat{f}\  – f\|_\infty \leqslant \min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} {f}(x) +2  \| \hat{f} \ – f\|_\infty. $$ See an illustration below (with a function estimated from the values at green points), with the candidate minimizer in orange.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5268" height="254" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/optim_approx-1024x553.png" width="470"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Thus in terms of worst-case performance, we get $$ \varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \leqslant 2\varepsilon_n^{\rm app}.$$ Intuitively, it seems that this upper-bound should be very loose, as approximating uniformly a function, in particular far from its minimum, seems useless for minimization. For worst-case performance, this intuition is incorrect… Indeed, the optimal rate for optimization with \(n\) function evaluations happens to be greater than the optimal rate for approximation with \(n+1\) function evaluations, which we will now show.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lower-bound on optimization performance. </strong>We will need an extra assumption, namely that the function space \(\mathcal{F}\) is convex and symmetric (and bounded in uniform norm).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider an optimization algorithm over the class of function \(\mathcal{F}\), that is considering \(n\) observation points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\), and an estimate \(\hat{x}\). The worst-case performance over all functions in \(\mathcal{F}\) is greater than over the (smaller) class of functions for which \(f(x_1) = \cdots = f(x_n) = f(\hat{x}) = 0\). Given that the performance measure is \(f(\hat{x})\  – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\), the performance is greater than the supremum of  \(– \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\) over functions in \(\mathcal{F}\) such that \(f(x_1) = \cdots = f(x_n) = f(\hat{x}) = 0\). For Lipschitz-continuous functions above, we built explicitly a hard function. In the general case, an explicit construction is not that easy, but we will relate the construction of such a function to the general approximation problem.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As we just saw, the optimal rate of the optimization algorithm is greater than $$\inf_{x_1,\dots,\, x_{n+1} \in \, \mathcal{X}} \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}, \ f(x_1)\ =\ \cdots \ = \ f(x_{n+1}) \ =\ 0} – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x) . $$ The quantity above characterizes how small a function can be when equal to zero on \(n+1\) points. When the set of function \(\mathcal{F}\) is centrally symmetric, that is \(f \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow \ – f \in \mathcal{F}\), we can replace \(– \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\) in the expression above by \(\| f\|_\infty\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that for convex and centrally symmetric spaces \(\mathcal{F}\) of functions, this happens to be the optimal rate of approximation with \(n+1\) function evaluations. This is sometimes referred to as Smolyak’s lemma [3], which we state here (see a very nice and short proof in [4]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Smolyak’s lemma. </strong>We consider a space of functions \(\mathcal{F}\) which is convex and centrally symmetric. Then:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>For any \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathcal{X}\), the optimal approximation method, that is the optimal map \(\mathcal{S}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathcal{F}\), i.e., an algorithm that computes \(\hat{f} = \mathcal{S}(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)) \in \mathcal{F}\), is <em>linear</em>, that is, there exist functions \(g_1,\dots,g_n: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) such that $$\mathcal{S}(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) g_i.$$</li><li>The optimal rate of uniform approximation in \(\mathcal{F}\) is equal to $$ \displaystyle \varepsilon_n^{\rm app} = \inf_{x_1,\dots,\, x_{n} \in \, \mathcal{X}} \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}, \ f(x_1)\ =\ \cdots \ = \ f(x_{n}) \ =\ 0} \| f \|_\infty.$$</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, we have “shown” that: $$ \varepsilon_{n+1}^{\rm app} \leqslant \varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \leqslant 2\varepsilon_n^{\rm app}, $$ that is, optimization is at most twice as hard as uniform approximation (still in the worst-case sense). We can now consider examples of uniform approximation algorithms to get optimization algorithms.</p>



<h2>Examples and optimal algorithms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As seen above, we simply need algorithms that approximate the function in uniform norm, and then we minimize the approximation. This is computationally optimal in terms of access to function evaluations (but clearly not in terms of computational complexity).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lipschitz-continuous functions.</strong> One can check that with \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) the centers of the cover above, and a piecewise constant function on each of the ball (with arbitrary values at intersections), then we have $$ \| \hat{f} \, – f \|_\infty \leqslant L   r_n(\mathcal{X},d),$$ which is a standard approximation result using covering numbers. We recover the result above directly from the cover argument (and here the sharper result that the rates of uniform approximation and optimization are asymptotically the same for this class of functions).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Smooth functions in one dimension.</strong> For simplicity, I will focus on the one-dimensional problem, where all concepts are simpler, some of them directly extend to higher dimensions, some of them don’t.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider \(\mathcal{X} = [0,1]\). The simplest interpolation techniques are piecewise constant and piecewise affine interpolations. That is, if we observe \(0 = x_1 \leqslant \cdots \leqslant x_n = 1\), we consider \(\hat{f}\) defined on \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\) as $$\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{2}f(x_i) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_{i+1}) $$ </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5286" height="152" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/interpolation_constant-2-1024x451.png" width="339"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">or $$ \hat{f}(x) = f(x_i) + \frac{ x\  – x_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}\big[ f(x_{i+1})\ – f(x_i) \big].$$</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5287" height="144" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/interpolation_affine-1024x449.png" width="324"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">If we assume that \(f\) is twice differentiable with second-derivative bounded by \(M_2\), then, we can show that on \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\), we have for piecewise affine interpolation: $$ | f(x) \ – \hat{f}(x) | \leqslant \frac{M_2}{8} | x_{i+1} – x_i |^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">If we assume that \(f\) is differentiable with first-derivative bounded by \(M_1\), then, we can show that on \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\), we have for piecewise affine or constant interpolation: $$ | f(x) \ – \hat{f}(x) | \leqslant \frac{M_1}{2} | x_{i+1} – x_i |.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to, when \(x_i = (i-1)/(n-1)\), to uniform error in \(O(1/n)\) for functions with a bound on a single derivative and or \(O(1/n^2)\) for two derivatives. Thus, we see two effects, that are common in approximations problems: (a) the more regular the function to approximate, the better the approximation rate, (b) If we consider a method tailored to smoother functions, it often works well for less smooth functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Explicit piecewise affine interpolation is harder to perform in higher dimensions, where other techniques can be used as presented below, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel methods</a> (again!).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Going high-dimensional with kernel methods.</strong> We assume that we have a positive definite kernel \(k: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), and, given the \(n\) elements \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) of \(\mathcal{X}\) and function values \(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)\), we look for the interpolating function \(f\) in the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space with minimum norm. By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a>, it has to be of the form \(\sum_{i=1}^n  \alpha_i k(x,x_i)\). Since it has to interpolate, we must have \(K\alpha = y\) and thus \(\alpha = K^{-1} y\), where \(y_i = f(x_i)\) for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\), and \(K\) the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix. Thus, interpolation can then be easily done in higher dimensions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev spaces</a> are commonly used in the interpolation context, and for \(s\) square-integrable derivatives, for \(s &gt; d/2\), they are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. See below for examples of interpolations with various Sobolev spaces and increasing number of interpolating points, where the approximation errors (in uniform norm) are computed. With \(s=1\), we recover piecewise affine interpolation, but smoother functions are obtained for \(s=2\).</p>

<p class="justify-text"><strong>Optimal rates of approximation.</strong> With the method defined above, we can obtain the optimal rates of approximation (and hence of optimization) of \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm app} \approx \displaystyle \frac{1}{n^{m/d}}\), for the set of functions with \(m\) bounded derivatives. Thus, for very smooth functions, we can escape the curse of dimensionality (that is, obtain a power of \(n\) that does not decay too slowly). See [1] for more details.</p>



<h2>The powerlessness of adaptivity</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The critical reader may argue that the algorithm set-up described in this post is too simple: the points at which we take function values are decided once and for all, independently of the observed function values. Clearly, some form of adaptivity should beat random search. The sad truth is that the bound for worst-case performance is the same… up to a factor of 2 at most (still in the worst-case sense).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The argument is essentially the same as for non-adaptive algorithms: for the Lipschitz-continuous example, our hard function can also be built for adaptive algorithms, while for the general case, it simply turns out that the rate for adaptive approximation is exactly the same than for adaptive approximation [4].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, adaptive and non-adaptive approximations are just a factor of two of each other. Note that given the practical success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization">Bayesian optimization</a> (which is one instance of adaptive optimization) on some problems, there could be at least two explanations (choose the one you prefer, or find a new one): (1) the worst-case analysis can be too pessimistic, or (2) what is crucial in Bayesian optimization is not the adaptive choice of points to evaluate the function, but the adaptivity to smoothness of the function to optimize (that is, if the function has \(m\) derivatives, then the rate is \(n^{-m/d}\), which can be much better than \(n^{-1/d}\)).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I highlighted the strong links between approximation problems and optimization problems. It turns out that the parallel between worst-case performances goes beyond: computing integrals from function evaluations, a problem typically referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration">quadrature</a>, is also as hard. More on this in a future post.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As warned early in the post, the algorithms presented here all have running time that are exponential in dimension, as they either perform random sampling or need to minimize a model of the function to optimize. </p>



<p class="justify-text">The only good news in this post: optimization is hard as approximation, but the scenario is more varied than expected. Indeed approximation can be fast and avoid the curse of dimensionality, at least in the exponent of the rate, when the function is very smooth (indeed, for \(m\)-times differentiable functions, the constant in front of \(n^{-m/d}\) still depends exponentially in \(d\)). It would be nice to catch this property also in an optimization algorithm, with a running time complexity depending polynomially on \(n\) only, and not exponentially in \(d\). Next month, I will present recent work with Alessandro Rudi and Ulysse Marteau-Ferey [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11978">7</a>] that does exactly this, by combining the tasks of interpolation and optimization in a single convex optimization problem.</p>

<h2>Performance of random search</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider sampling independently and uniformly in \(\mathcal{X}\) \(n\) points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\). For a given \(L\)-Lipschitz-continuous function \(f\), with global minimizer \(x\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), we have $$\min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} f(x_i)\  – f(x) \leqslant L \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(x,x_i).$$ Thus, to obtain an upper-bound on performance over all functions \(f\) (and potentially all locations of the global minimizer \(x\)), we need to bound $$\max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(x,x_i).$$ If we have a cover with \(m\) points \(y_1,\dots,y_m\), and radius \(r = r_m(\mathcal{X},d)\), we have $$\max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(x,x_i) \leqslant r + \max_{j  \in \{1,\dots,m\}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(y_j,x_i) .$$ We can then bound the probability that $$ \max_{j \in \{1,\dots,m\}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(y_j,x_i) \geqslant r$$ by the union bound (and using the independence of the \(x_i\)’s) as \(m\) times the \(n\)-th power of the probability that one of the \(x_i\) is not in a given ball of radius \(r\). By a simple volume argument (and assuming that all balls of a given radius have the same volume), this probability is less than \(( 1 – 1/m)\). Thus with probability greater than \(1 – m(1 – 1/m)^n \geqslant 1 – m e^{ – n /m}\) the worst-case performance is less than \(2Lr\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since for normed metrics in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), \(r  \sim m^{-1/d} {\rm diam}(\mathcal{X})\), by selecting \(m = 2n \log n\), we get an overall performance proportional to \( L \big( \frac{ \log n}{n} \big)^{1/d}\) with probability greater than \(1 – \frac{ \log n}{n}\) (which tends to one when \(n\) grows).</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on <strong>Friday, Dec 04</strong>th at <strong>10:00 AM Pacific Time</strong> (13:00 Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC, 23:30 Indian Time).  <strong>Adam Smith</strong> from <strong>Boston University</strong> will speak about “<strong>When is Memorization of Irrelevant Training Data Necessary for High-Accuracy Learning?</strong>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Modern machine learning models are complex, and frequently encode surprising amounts of information about individual inputs. In extreme cases, complex models appear to memorize entire input examples, including seemingly irrelevant information (social security numbers from text, for example). In this paper, we aim to understand whether this sort of memorization is necessary for accurate learning. We describe natural prediction problems in which every sufficiently accurate training algorithm must encode, in the prediction model, essentially all the information about a large subset of its training examples. This remains true even when the examples are high-dimensional and have entropy much higher than the sample size, and even when most of that information is ultimately irrelevant to the task at hand. Further, our results do not depend on the training algorithm or the class of models used for learning.</p>



<p>Our problems are simple and fairly natural variants of the next-symbol prediction and the cluster labeling tasks. These tasks can be seen as abstractions of image- and text-related prediction problems. To establish our results, we reduce from a family of one-way communication problems for which we prove new information complexity lower bounds.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This post is a follow-up on some somewhat off-hand comments that I made <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/">earlier</a> regarding the notion of truth in a “proof-based” discipline such as pure mathematics or theoretical computer science. Since the former is easier to circumscribe and also has a larger literature available on it, for the purposes of the post I will discuss my emerging take on truth in mathematics; what I say applies to TCS as well. (I wasn’t able to find satisfactory writings on the practice of computer science, even more broadly interpreted than just “theory”; any pointers on this are very welcome.) I obviously don’t claim any originality here; I suspect that to some the points I make might be interesting while to others they could feel passé–in the latter case, please help me make progress in the comments!</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/circle.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1273" height="272" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/circle.jpg?w=762" width="261"/></a>A <em>circle</em> is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the figure equal one another. (Euclid, Elements, Book I, Definition 15.)</figure></div>



<p>The question is more interesting than it may seem. First, let’s set aside the Platonician answer that mathematics is about proving statements that apply to abstract objects. None of this makes sense: there is no such thing as an abstract object (What is an “abstract circle?” Euclid’s <em>definition</em> of an abstract circle exists, but that definition has nothing abstract; it is plain English—or well, Greek, which is no better). Neither is there anything fundamentally “true” about the statements that mathematicians make about these objects. This last point is made clear in Voevodsky’s retelling of the story that brought him to start his research program on univalent foundations: see in particular the paragraph starting with “The primary challenge that needed to be addressed” <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2014/voevodsky-origins">here</a>. While a subset of mathematicians has been carefully examining the logical foundations of mathematics and pursuing a program of formalizing these foundations with the goal of automating verification, two facts are historically evident: (1) this formalization has always come <em>after</em> the fact, i.e. first the theorem is proven, and second only is there some attempt at modifying the format of the “proof” so as to reach some abstract “higher standard”; (2) what the higher standard exactly is is a moving target. In other words, mathematicians do whatever it is that they do <em>first</em>, and only <em>after</em> that does some subset of them look back on what has been done and make an attempt to reformulate it in a way that seems more “rigorous” by the standards of the day. And even once this process has been completed (or rather, iterated over a few times), no absolute truth has been obtained; merely, one has gained higher confidence that some set of formal rules can be applied in a certain order to derive one statement for another. In summary, the logical answer “I define as true any statement that can be derived by said rules starting from said axioms” will not satisfy us. (My point is not to criticize this enterprise; only to point that this is not what mathematics is about. I don’t expect any mathematician would disagree.)</p>



<p>Once this point has been cleared we have opened up the possibility for a much richer interpretation of what mathematics is about, what it is that mathematicians do, and what is so special about the role played by the notion of truth in this enterprise.</p>



<h2>The Greeks</h2>



<p>Mathematicians have been around since Greek antiquity. I highly recommend the wonderful book <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511543296">The Shaping of Deduction in Greek Mathematics</a> by Reviel Netz, a historian at Stanford. The book provides a fantastic historical introduction to the birth of modern mathematics, as practiced in the Western world. In this book Netz gives a detailed account of the practice of Greek mathematics that is based on a sometimes almost comical literal reading of the original texts. Netz is not a mathematician, and he takes the Greek writings at face value, without preconceptions as to any deeper meaning, mathematical or otherwise. To see how fantastic an enterprise this might be I highly recommend taking the time to read through a few paragraphs of Euclid’s elements, see e.g. <a href="https://www.claymath.org/library/historical/euclid/index.html">here</a>. (I wasn’t able to find an online version that has clear figures; Netz’ book contains many reproductions and he spends a great deal of time examining their significance as a companion to the text.) Wait, and they called this a <em>proof</em>? </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/phil-2017-0007_05.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1276" height="241" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/phil-2017-0007_05.jpg?w=1024" width="320"/></a>Netz places a particular emphasis on the role of lettered diagrams such as this one in Greek mathematicians’ proofs. This one is taken from Apollonius, as reproduced in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/phil-2017-0007">this book</a>.</figure></div>



<p>What I find most amazing about Netz’ work is that his book makes it absolutely clear that what Greek mathematics did is invent a very special world, with its own set of rules and specifications as to how things should be presented, what counts as valid and what does not, etc; most importantly this set of rules and specifications is absolutely <em>arbitrary</em>. There is nothing <em>universally</em> true about any of the statements made in Euclid’s book ; what there is however, and which is just as important, is a form of <em>self-consistent</em>, <em>self-perpetuating</em> consistency. This is the Greek mathematician’s most important discovery, and most enduring legacy: a system of thought, based on the use of formal rules, such that users of that system of thought can easily and unequivocally agree on the same statements. Netz contrasts this with the political discourse that the Greeks were so famously fond of; while in rhetoric endless arguments can be made in favor or against any given statement, in mathematics once an argument has been made there is no discussing it; either the argument is correct and accepted by all or it is flawed and all will agree on the presence of a flaw. By saying that mathematics does not establish universal truths we do not take away any of the strength of its evident success as a system of thought. </p>



<p>I insist that in the previous sentence by “mathematics” I mean “Greek mathematics.” There is nothing universal about the formal “proof system” used by the Greeks, and in fact that system is arguably quite different from the one used today (contrast a proof in Euclid’s Elements from one in e.g. Kerodon (see figure below); clearly either school would reject the other’s papers!). There is nothing absolutely perfect or even fool-proof about it either; when I write that “either the argument is correct or it is flawed” I do not dismiss the existence of a substantial grey zone in which there might be, and generally is, discussion. (Netz in his presentation makes it plainly obvious that Greek proofs had many “gaps” and that completely arbitrary choices are made as to what is valid and what is not.) The point is that this grey zone is by orders of magnitude smaller than in other disciplines, and this is what makes mathematics special.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/diagram.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1278" height="118" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/diagram.jpg?w=943" width="470"/></a>A lettered diagram taken from the proof of Lemma 3.5.3.11 in <a href="https://kerodon.net/">Kerodon</a>.</figure></div>



<p>Greek mathematics has its limitations. In particular, it seems like they were not able to expand their explorations much beyond geometry; possibly because they did not have a formal way of re-using proofs. Indeed, only propositions from Euclid’s elements were part of the general corpus of “truths” that could be used without justification; any other proof could only appeal to either a statement from the Elements or a statement proved within the same text (as opposed to a statement made by another mathematician). The current system has a much higher level of re-usability, allowing it to much deeper. It is possible that current attempt at formalization will provide yet another layer to this by enabling re-using statements without the mathematician herself even being cognizant of the statement that is being re-used (e.g. the proof assistant would figure out that there is some theorem somewhere that could be useful). </p>



<h2>The moderns</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/qkd.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1280" height="420" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/qkd.jpg?w=831" width="382"/></a>A lettered diagram taken from the proof of security of quantum key distribution in Renner’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0512258">Ph.D. thesis</a>.</figure></div>



<p>Once one has taken this somewhat distanced look at the practice of Greek mathematicians it becomes clear that there is no reason for contemporary practice to escape similar distanciation. As arbitrary as the rules that govern the former might seem now, just as arbitrary our own rules will seem later. The observation prompts us to re-evaluate the notion of proof and truth as follows: <em>The goal of the mathematical proof is to convince the mathematician; a statement is true whenever the mathematician is convinced.</em> I emphasize that the mathematician in this sentence is a human being, not a machine. <br/><br/>Propositions in Euclid’s elements are true because Euclid’s text convinced all other Greek mathematicians that they were true; the same hold of Voevodsky’s univalent foundations. To speak about my personal experience, the point was carried home vividly about a decade ago at the end of an entire afternoon spent sitting by the sea nearby Marseille in the South of France together with an illustrious French operator algebraist. For the whole afternoon I had been trying to explain, of all things, the Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality formulated as a nonlocal game—an elementary construction on which half of my research is based (see <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/tsirelsons-bound/">this post</a> for example, although we  certainly didn’t get that far). To no avail! Alice, Bob, games, the mathematician would have none of it. How could it be so hard? The message I was trying to carry across is bread and butter to quantum information theorists; moreover the language of functional analysis was not foreign to me either and so I believed I ought to have more than it should take to make the explanations clear; in my mind I had a clear theorem, together with an airtight proof, to communicate. Not so: I ended the afternoon defeated, and the point hammered in: as much as we may think that our language is formal, our reasoning rational, our goals clear, as soon as we step out of our self-referential cocoon we have to face the evidence: not so; there is nothing clear, formal, self-evident, in the mathematical truths we take as such. (If you’re not convinced yet, look at the pictures.)</p>



<p>After having read through the viewpoint of a historian on Greek mathematics, it is interesting to come back to the present and read up on the modern mathematician’s own account of their practice. Having delighted in Hardy’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology">A Mathematician’s Apology</a> in my student years I was naturally attracted to Harris’ explicitly referential book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691154237/mathematics-without-apologies">Mathematics Without Apologies</a>. The book aims to provide a personal answer to precisely the same question as Netz’ (“What do pure mathematicians do, and why do they do it?”—first line on back cover), with the essential difference that Harris’ book is written by a contemporary mathematician about the practice of modern mathematics. The perspective taken is thus very different: Harris does not waste a drop of ink to examine the material products of modern mathematics (e.g. printed articles), which naturally from his point of view do not have the least interest besides their mathematical significance; nor does he question the formal system that enables mathematics (he does discuss foundation issues, but these are themselves part of the formal system). </p>



<p>Harris delights in telling us stories about the practice of mathematics from the inside: the way one acquires prestige (he calls it “charisma”), how mathematicians perceive when a mathematical statement is interesting, what drives a mathematician to work on one problem or another, the influence of large research programs such as the Langlands program, etc. Just as Netz, Harris agrees that the proof itself, while an important product of the mathematician’s practice, is not a goal in itself. The goal is to introduce new objects, find relations between them, and build structures that support this exploration (Harris quotes extensively from Grothendieck, a builder of structures if there is any). Crucially the mathematician’s goal is not at all to find <em>truth</em>: her goal is to find <em>beauty</em>. Harris (un-apologetically!) defends the mathematician’s position as playing a privileged and essential role in our (Western) society: mathematics is the rare, if not unique, discipline where thought is valued <em>for itself</em>: not for its consequences or potential applications, nor even for some kind of universal validity or truth that it might reach — for itself, the sheer beauty of it. No apologies. While one might think that the arts are in a similar position, Harris points out that in contemporary discussions about art the notion of beauty has all but disappeared; instead, one talks of society, ecology, politics—all of this is good and important, but it is not about beauty. Mathematics is about exploring the beauty of human thought. This exploration is carried out within the very special, narrow and arbitrary corner that mathematical practice has delineated for itself since the Greeks got us started. And yet does not matter that it is narrow and arbitrary; what matters is that it is purely and uniquely human.</p>



<p>I don’t have a conclusion to give to this post. I suppose it is the kind of digression that one is naturally inclined to make while on <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/announcing-a-short-course-in-paris/">sabbatical</a>. (I was delighted to see Harris reference his time at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris extensively and spend multiple pages gossiping about Ed Frenkel, then a holder of the same FSMP chair I am now occupying.) Certainly it helps to gain a sense of what it is that one is doing. While these explorations destroyed a number of simple comforting myths about what it is that I do every day, in the end I find the void that lies beneath the surface much more appealing; I feel privileged and comforted in my desire to make use of that privilege.</p>



<h2>Post-scriptum</h2>



<p>In addition to the two books referenced in the post there are a couple articles that I found helpful. I am listing them here because I found such writings non-trivial to come by, and so they might be helpful to anyone interested in the topic. I welcome additional references. </p>



<ul><li>Barton, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11858-999-0009-7">Ethnomathematics and Philosophy</a>. This is Barton’s Ph.D. thesis, in which he studies the social emergence of mathematics not as inevitable, but as cultural, yet without negating what is so special about it. .</li><li>Wallet and Neuwirth, <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01943079/">Enquete sur les modes d’existence des etres mathematiques</a> (unfortunately in French only it seems). The authors build on Netz’ work and others to examine the notion of mathematical proof within Latour’s framework of “modes of existence,” which Latour mostly applied to experimental sciences. </li></ul></div>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: Consider the problem of computing the majority of a stream of <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> i.i.d. uniformly random bits. This problem, known as the coin problem, is central to a number of counting problems in different data stream models. We show that any streaming algorithm for solving this problem with large constant advantage (over the uniform distribution) must use <img alt="\Omega(\log n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> bits of space. Previously, it was known that computing the majority on every input with a constant probability takes <img alt="\Omega(\log n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> space. We extend our lower bound to proving tight lower bounds for solving multiple, randomly interleaved copies of the coin problem, as well as for solving the OR of multiple copies of a variant of the coin problem. Our proofs involve new measures of information complexity that are well-suited for data streams.<br/><br/>We use these lower bounds to obtain a number of new results for data streams. In each case there is an underlying <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-dimensional vector <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with additive updates to its coordinates given in a stream of length <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The input streams arising from our coin lower bound have nice distributional properties, and consequently for many problems for which we only had lower bounds in general turnstile streams, we now obtain the same lower bounds in more natural models, such as the bounded deletion model, in which <img alt="\|x\|_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Cx%5C%7C_2&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> never drops by a constant fraction of what it was earlier, or in the random order model, in which the updates are ordered randomly. <br/><br/>Based on joint work with Mark Braverman and David P. Woodruff.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  We present very general lower bounds for parametric estimation when only limited information per sample is allowed. These limitations can arise, for example, in form of communication constraints, privacy constraints, or linear measurements. Our lower bounds hold for discrete distributions with large alphabet as well as continuous distributions with high-dimensional parameters, apply for any information constraint, and are valid for any $\ell_p$ loss function. Our bounds recover both strong data processing inequality based bounds and Cramér-Rao based bound as special cases.</p>

<p>As announced <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/announcing-a-short-course-in-paris/">earlier</a> I am currently teaching a course on “interactive proofs with quantum devices” in Paris. The course is proceeding apace, even though the recent lockdown order in France means that we had to abandon our beautiful auditorium at the Institut Henri Poincaré and retreat behind the fanciful Zoom backgrounds whose pretension is a sad reminder of what our summers used to be (Banff, anyone?). A possible upshot is that more may be able to attend the now-online course; if you are interested see the <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/">course page</a> for info. (Things are actually fairly good here–in spite of the apparently strict restrictions on daily outings (max 1h, 1km) you can count on the French to bend things their way; most shops are closed but the streets remain quite busy.)</p>



<p>We just finished a sequence of four lectures on the Mahadev “classical verification of quantum computation” protocol. In the process of preparing the lectures I arrived at a presentation of the protocol that is fairly self-contained, so I decided to compile the associated lecture notes as a stand-alone group of 4 lectures that is available <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp_verification.pdf">here</a>. The notes are aimed at beginning graduate students with a first course in quantum computing and in complexity desiring to gain a concrete understanding of the inner workings of the result; the notes are a bit lengthy but this in part because they take the time to introduce related concepts and slowly build up to the main result. Overall, my hope is that these should be relatively easily readable and provide a good technical introduction to the Mahadev result on classical verification, including an almost complete analysis of her protocol (there are a few explicitly declared shortcuts that help simplify the presentation without hiding any important aspects). For additional background you can also consult the full <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp.pdf">10-week notes</a>. Comments on the notes are welcome; I’m afraid they most likely contain numerous typos so if you find any please feel free to correct them directly on the associated <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/9892211158zrwmqnxtvcxm">overleaf document</a>.</p>



<p>The last three lectures of the course will be devoted to the problem of testing under spatial assumptions, building up to an introduction to the proof of MIP* = RE. If all goes well I’ll aim to prepare some stand-alone notes for that part as well.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">In many areas of machine learning, statistics and signal processing, eigenvalue decompositions are commonly used, e.g., in principal component analysis, spectral clustering, convergence analysis of Markov chains, convergence analysis of optimization algorithms, low-rank inducing regularizers, community detection, seriation, etc.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Understanding how the spectral decomposition of a matrix changes as a function of a matrix is thus of primary importance, both algorithmically and theoretically. We thus need a perturbation analysis or more generally some differentiability properties for eigenvalues or eigenvectors [1], or any spectral function [2]. These properties can be obtained from many angles, but a generic tool can be used for all of these: it is a surprising and elegant application of Cauchy’s residue formula, which is due to Kato [3].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Before diving into spectral analysis, I will first present the Cauchy residue theorem and some nice applications in computing integrals that are needed in machine learning and kernel methods.</p>



<h2>Cauchy residue formula </h2>



<p class="justify-text">A function \(f : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}\) is said <em>holomorphic</em> in \(\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\) with derivative \(f'(\lambda) \in \mathbb{C}\), if is differentiable in \(\lambda\), that is if \(\displaystyle \frac{f(z)-f(\lambda)}{z-\lambda}\) tends to \(f'(\lambda)\) when \(z\) tends to \(\lambda\). Many classical functions are holomorphic on \(\mathbb{C}\) or portions thereof, such as the exponential, sines, cosines and their hyperbolic counterparts, rational functions, portions of the logarithm.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a function which is holomorphic in a region of \(\mathbb{C}\) except in \(m\) values \(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_m \in \mathbb{C}\), which are usually referred to as <em>poles</em>. We also consider a simple closed directed contour \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{C}\) that goes strictly around the \(m\) values above. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5002" height="236" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/contour_generic-1-1024x440.png" width="549"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The Cauchy residue formula gives an explicit formula for the contour integral along \(\gamma\):<br/> $$ \oint_\gamma f(z) dz = 2 i \pi \sum_{j=1}^m {\rm Res}(f,\lambda_j), \tag{1}$$<br/> where \({\rm Res}(f,\lambda)\) is called the <em>residue</em> of \(f\) at \(\lambda\) . If around \(\lambda\),  \(f(z)\) has a series expansions in powers of \((z − \lambda)\), that is, \(\displaystyle f(z) =  \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty}a_k (z −\lambda)^k\), then \({\rm Res}(f,\lambda)=a_{-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, if \(\displaystyle f(z) =   \frac{g(z)}{z-\lambda}\) with \(g\) holomorphic around \(\lambda\), then \({\rm Res}(f,\lambda) = g(\lambda)\), and more generally, if \(\displaystyle f(z) = \frac{g(z)}{(z-\lambda)^k}\) for \(k \geqslant  1\), then \(\displaystyle {\rm Res}(f,\lambda) = \frac{g^{(k-1)}(\lambda) }{(k-1)!}\). For more details on complex analysis, see [4].</p>



<p class="justify-text">The result above can be naturally extended to vector-valued functions (and thus to any matrix-valued function), by applying the identity to all components of the vector.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This result is due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy">Cauchy</a> [<a href="https://archive.org/details/mmoiresurlesin00cauc">10</a>] in 1825. The <a href="https://archive.org/details/mmoiresurlesin00cauc">original paper</a> where this is presented is a nice read in French where you can find some pepits like “la fonction s’évanouit pour \(x = \infty\)”.</p>



<p>If you are already familiar with complex residues, you can skip the next section.</p>



<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>



<p class="justify-text">At first, the formula in Eq. (1) seems unsettling. Why doesn’t the result depend more explicitly on the contour \(\gamma\)? Where does the multiplicative term \( {2i\pi}\) come from? Here is a very partial and non rigorous account (go to the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/residue-theorem/">experts</a> for more rigor!).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Complex-valued functions on \(\mathbb{C}\) can be seen as functions from \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to itself, by writing $$ f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y),$$ where \(u\) and \(v\) are real-valued functions. We have thus a function \((x,y) \mapsto (u(x,y),v(x,y))\) from \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\mathbb{R}^2\). Expanding \(f(z+dz) = f(z) + f'(z) dz\), which is the definition of complex differentiability, into real and imaginary parts, we get (using \(i^2 = -1\)): $$\left\{ \begin{array}{l} u(x+dx,y+dy) = u(x,y) + {\rm Re}(f'(z)) dx\ – {\rm Im}(f'(z)) dy \\ v(x+dx,y+dy) = v(x,y) + {\rm Re}(f'(z)) dy + {\rm Im}(f'(z)) dx. \end{array}\right.$$ This leads to $$\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x,y) = {\rm Re}(f'(z)) \\ \displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}(x,y) = \ – {\rm Im}(f'(z)) \\ \displaystyle \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}(x,y) = {\rm Im}(f'(z)) \\ \displaystyle \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}(x,y) = {\rm Re}(f'(z)). \end{array}\right.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This in turn leads to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Riemann_equations">Cauchy-Riemann equations</a> \(\displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\) and \(\displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\), which are essentially necessary and sufficient conditions to be holomorphic. Thus holomorphic functions correspond to differentiable functions on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with some equal partial derivatives. These equations are key to obtaining the Cauchy residue formula.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Contour integral with no poles. </strong>We first consider a contour integral over a contour \(\gamma\) enclosing a region \(\mathcal{D}\) where the function \(f\) is holomorphic everywhere. The contour \(\gamma\) is defined as a differentiable function \(\gamma: [0,1] \to \mathbb{C}\), and the integral is equal to $$\oint_\gamma f(z) dz = \int_0^1 \!\!f(\gamma(t)) \gamma'(t) dt = \int_0^1 \!\![u(x(t),y(t)) +i v(x(t),y(t))] [ x'(t) + i y'(t)] dt,$$ where \(x(t) = {\rm Re}(\gamma(t))\) and \(y(t) = {\rm Im}(\gamma(t))\). By expanding the product of complex numbers, it is thus equal to $$\int_0^1 [ u(x(t),y(t)) x'(t) \ – v(x(t),y(t))y'(t)] dt +i  \int_0^1 [ v(x(t),y(t)) x'(t) +u (x(t),y(t))y'(t)] dt,$$ which we can rewrite in compact form as (with \(dx = x'(t) dt\) and \(dy = y'(t)dt\)): $$\oint_\gamma ( u \, dx\  – v \, dy ) + i \oint_\gamma ( v \, dx + u \, dy ).$$ We can then use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem">Green’s theorem</a> because our functions are differentiable on the entire region \(\mathcal{D}\) (the set “inside” the contour), to get $$\oint_\gamma ( u \, dx\ – v \, dy ) + i \oint_\gamma ( v \, dx + u \, dy ) =\  – \int\!\!\!\!\int_\mathcal{D} \! \Big( \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \Big) dx dy \ – i \!\! \int\!\!\!\!\int_\mathcal{D} \!\Big( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} – \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \Big) dx dy.$$ Thus, because of the Cauchy-Riemann equations, the contour integral is always zero within the domain of differentiability of \(f\). Note that this extends to piecewise smooth contours \(\gamma\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Circle and rational functions.</strong> For a circle contour of center \(\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\) and radius \(r\), we have, with \(\gamma(t) = \lambda + re^{ 2i \pi t}\): $$\oint_{\gamma} \frac{dz}{(z-\lambda)^k} =\int_0^{1} \frac{ 2r i \pi e^{2i\pi t}}{ r^k e^{2i\pi kt}}dt= \int_0^{1} r^{1-k} i e^{2i\pi (1-k)t} dt,$$ which is equal to zero if \(k \neq 1\), and to \(\int_0^{1} 2i\pi dt = 2 i \pi\) for \(k =1\). Thus, for a function with a series expansion, the Cauchy residue formula is true for the circle around a single pole, because only the term in \(\frac{1}{z-\lambda}\) contributes.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>No dependence on the contour.</strong> Now that the Cauchy formula is true for the circle around a single pole, we can “deform” the contour below to a circle.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5021" height="207" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/contour_generic_circle-1024x532.png" width="398"/></figure></div>



<p>This can be done considering two contours \(\gamma_1\) and \(\gamma_2\) below with no poles inside, and thus with zero contour integrals, and for which the integrals along the added lines cancel.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5022" height="205" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/contour_generic_circle_cut-1-1024x537.png" width="391"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This “shows” that the integral does not depend on the contour, and so in applications we can be quite liberal in the choice of contour. Note that similar constructions can be used to take into account several poles.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Before going to the spectral analysis of matrices, let us explore some cool choices of contours and integrands, and (again!) some positive definite kernels.</p>



<h2>Classical examples</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The Cauchy residue theorem can be used to compute integrals, by choosing the appropriate contour, looking for poles and computing the associated residues. Here are classical examples, before I show applications to kernel methods. See more examples in <a href="http://residuetheorem.com/">http://residuetheorem.com/</a>, and many in [11].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Fourier transforms. </strong> For \(\omega&gt;0\), we can compute \( \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^\infty \!\! f(x) e^{ i \omega x} dx\) for holomorphic functions \(f\) by integrating on the real line and a big upper circle as shown below, with \(R\) tending to infinity (so that the contribution of the half-circle goes to zero because of the exponential term). This leads to \(2i \pi\) times the sum of all residues of the function \(z \mapsto f(z) e^{ i \omega z}\) in the upper half plane. See an example below related to kernel methods.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5026" height="214" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/contour_upper-circle-2-1024x570.png" width="385"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Trigonometric integrals</strong>. For holomorphic functions \(Q\), we can compute the integral \(\displaystyle \int_0^{2\pi} \!\!\! Q(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) d\theta\). Indeed, letting \(f(z) = \frac{1}{iz} Q\big( \frac{z+z^{-1}}{2}, \frac{z-z^{-1}}{2i} \big)\), it is exactly equal to the integral on the unit circle. The desired integral is then equal to \(2i\pi\) times the sum of all residues of \(f\) within the unit disk.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, when \(Q(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \frac{1}{2 + \sin \theta}\), we have \(f(z) = \frac{2}{z^2+4iz-1}\), with a single pole inside the unit circle, namely \(\lambda = i ( \sqrt{3}-2)\), and residue equal to \(-i / \sqrt{3}\), leading to \(\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d\theta}{2+\sin \theta} = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Series.</strong> If the function \(f\) is holomorphic and has no poles at integer real values, and satisfies some basic boundedness conditions, then $$\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} f(n) = \ – \!\!\! \sum_{ \lambda \in {\rm poles}(f)} {\rm Res}\big( f(z) \pi \frac{\cos \pi z}{\sin \pi z} ,\lambda\big).$$ This is a simple consequence of the fact that the function \(z \mapsto \pi \frac{\cos \pi z}{\sin \pi z}\) has all integers \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\) as poles, with corresponding residue equal to \(1\). This is obtained from the contour below with \(m\) tending to infinity.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5028" height="250" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/contour_square-1-1024x903.png" width="284"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The same trick can be applied to  \(\displaystyle \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (-1)^n f(n) =\  –  \!\!\! \sum_{ \lambda \in {\rm poles}(f)} {\rm Res}\big( f(z) \pi \frac{1}{\sin \pi z} ,\lambda\big).\) See [7, Section 11.2] for more details. Experts will see an interesting link with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Maclaurin_formula">Euler-MacLaurin formula</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_polynomials">Bernoulli polynomials</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Applications to kernel methods.</strong> In non-parametric estimation, regularization penalties are used to constrain real-values functions to be smooth. One such examples are combinations of squared \(L_2\) norms of derivatives. For functions \(f\) defined on an interval \(I\) of the real line, penalties are typically of the form \(\int_I \sum_{k=0}^s \alpha_k | f^{(k)}(x)|^2 dx\), for non-negative weights \(\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_k\). For these Sobolev space norms, a positive definite kernel \(K\) can be used for estimation (see, e.g., <a href="https://francisbach.com/hermite-polynomials/">last month blog post</a>). </p>



<p class="justify-text">A classical question is: given the norm defined above, how to compute \(K\)? For \(I = \mathbb{R}\), then this can be done using Fourier transforms as: $$K(x,y) =  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_\mathbb{R} \frac{e^{i\omega(x-y)}}{\sum_{k=0}^s \alpha_k \omega^{2k}} d\omega.$$ This is exactly an integral of the form above, for which we can use the contour integration technique. For example, for \(\alpha_0=1\) and \(\alpha_1=a^2\), we get for \(x-y&gt;0\), one pole \(i/a\) in the upper half plane for the function \(\frac{1}{1+a^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{(1+iaz)(1-iaz)}\), with residue \(-\frac{i}{2a} e^{-(x-y)/a}\), leading to the familiar exponential kernel \(K(x,y) = \frac{1}{2a} e^{-|x-y|/a}\). More complex kernels can be considered (see, e.g., [8, page 277], for \(\sum_{k=0}^s \alpha_k \omega^{2k} = 1 + \omega^{2s}\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can also consider the same penalty on the unit interval \([0,1]\) with periodic functions, leading to the kernel (see [9] for more details): $$ K(x,y) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{ e^{2in\pi(x-y)}}{\sum_{k=0}^s \alpha_k( 2n\pi)^s}.$$ For the same example as above, that is, \(\alpha_0=1\) and \(\alpha_1=a^2\), this leads to an infinite series on which we can apply the Cauchy residue formula as explained above. This leads to, for \(x-y \in [0,1]\), \(K(x,y) =  \frac{1}{2a}  \frac{ \cosh (\frac{1-2(x-y)}{2a})}{\sinh (\frac{1}{2a})}\). We can then extend by \(1\)-periodicity to all \(x-y\). See the detailed computation at the end of the post.</p>



<p>Now that you are all experts in residue calculus, we can move on to spectral analysis.</p>



<h2>Spectral analysis of symmetric matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a symmetric matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\), with its \(n\) ordered real eigenvalues \(\lambda_1 \geqslant  \cdots \geqslant \lambda_n\), counted with their orders of multiplicity, and an orthonormal basis of their eigenvectors \(u_j \in \mathbb{R}^n\), \(j=1,\dots,n\). We have \(A = \sum_{j=1}^n \lambda_j u_j u_j^\top\).  When we consider eigenvalues as functions of \(A\), we use the notation \(\lambda_j(A)\), \(j=1,\dots,n\). These functions are always well-defined even when eigenvalues are multiple (this is not the case for eigenvectors because of the invariance by orthogonal transformations).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The key property that we will use below is that we can express the so-called resolvent matrix \((z I – A)^{-1} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}\), for \(z \in \mathbb{C}\), as: $$  (z I- A)^{-1}  = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{z-\lambda_j} u_j u_j^\top. $$ The dependence on \(z\) of the form \( \displaystyle \frac{1}{z- \lambda_j}\)  leads to a nice application of Cauchy residue formula.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Assuming the \(k\)-th eigenvalue \(\lambda_k\) is simple, we consider the contour \(\gamma\) going strictly around \(\lambda_k\) like below (for \(k=5\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5039" height="182" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/contour_single_eigenvalue-1024x433.png" width="431"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We consider integrating the matrix above, which leads to: $$ \oint_\gamma<br/>  (z I- A)^{-1} dz = \sum_{j=1}^m \Big( \oint_\gamma \frac{1}{z – \lambda_j} dz \Big) u_j u_j^\top<br/>  = 2 i \pi \  u_k u_k^\top $$  using the identity \(\displaystyle \oint_\gamma \frac{1}{z – \lambda_j} dz = 1\) if \(j=k\) and \(0\) otherwise (because the pole is outside of \(\gamma\)). We thus obtain an expression for projectors on the one-dimensional eigen-subspace associated with the eigenvalue \(\lambda_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">With simple manipulations, we can also access the eigenvalues. Indeed, we have: $$ \oint_\gamma<br/>   (z I- A)^{-1} z dz = \sum_{j=1}^m \Big( \oint_\gamma \frac{z}{z – \lambda_j} dz \Big) u_j u_j^\top<br/>  = 2 i \pi \lambda_k  u_k u_k^\top, $$ and by taking the trace, we obtain $$ \oint_\gamma<br/>  {\rm tr} \big[ z (z I- A)^{-1} \big]  dz    = \lambda_k. $$ The key benefit of these representations is that when the matrix \(A\) is slightly perturbed, then the same contour \(\gamma\) can be used to enclose the corresponding eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix, and perturbation results are simply obtained by taking gradients within the contour integral. Note that several eigenvalues may be summed up by selecting a contour englobing more than one eigenvalues.</p>



<h2>Gradients of eigenvalues</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The expression with contour integrals allows to derive simple formulas for gradients of eigenvalues. These can be obtained by other means [5], but using contour integrals shows that this is simply done by looking at the differential of \((z I – A)^{-1}\) and integrating it. The central component is the following expansion, which is a classical result in matrix differentiable calculus, with \(\|\Delta\|_2\) the operator norm of \(\Delta\) (i.e., its largest singular value):  $$<br/> (z I- A – \Delta)^{-1} = (z I – A)^{-1} + (z I- A)^{-1} \Delta (z I- A)^{-1} + o(\| \Delta\|_2).  $$ Note here that the asymptotic remainder \(o(\| \Delta\|_2)\) can be made explicit. </p>



<p class="justify-text">By expanding the expression on the basis of eigenvectors of \(A\), we get  $$<br/> z (z I- A – \Delta)^{-1}  – z (z I- A)^{-1}  =  \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{\ell=1}^n u_j u_\ell^\top  \frac{ z \cdot u_j^\top \Delta u_\ell}{(z-\lambda_j)(z-\lambda_\ell)} + o(\| \Delta \|_2).<br/> $$ Taking the trace, the cross-product terms \({\rm tr}(u_j u_\ell^\top) =  u_\ell^\top u_j\) disappear for \(j \neq \ell\), and we get: $$<br/> {\rm tr} \big[ z (z I – A – \Delta)^{-1}  \big] – {\rm tr} \big[ z (z I – A)^{-1}  \big]=  \sum_{j=1}^n   \frac{ z \cdot u_j^\top \Delta u_j}{(z-\lambda_j)^2} + o(\| \Delta \|_2).<br/> $$ This leads to, by contour integration:<br/>$$<br/> \lambda_{k}(A+\Delta) -\lambda_k(A)<br/> =<br/> \frac{1}{2i \pi} \oint_\gamma \Big[ <br/>   \sum_{j=1}^n   \frac{ z \cdot u_j^\top \Delta u_j}{(z-\lambda_j)^2} \Big] dz +  o(\| \Delta \|_2).<br/> $$ By keeping only the pole \(\lambda_k\) which is inside the contour \(\gamma\), we get  $$ \lambda_{k}(A+\Delta) -\lambda_k(A)<br/>  =<br/> \frac{1}{2i \pi} \oint_\gamma \Big[ <br/>    \frac{ z \cdot u_k^\top \Delta u_k}{(z-\lambda_k)^2} \Big] dz +  o(| \Delta |_2) \<br/>    =  u_k^\top \Delta u_k + o(\| \Delta \|_2),<br/> $$ using the identity \(\displaystyle <br/>  \oint_\gamma \frac{z dz}{(z – \lambda_k)^2} dz = <br/>   \oint_\gamma \Big( \frac{\lambda_k}{(z – \lambda_k)^2}  + \frac{1}{z – \lambda_k} \Big) dz = 1\).  </p>



<p class="justify-text">Thus the gradient of \(\lambda_k\) at a matrix \(A\) where the \(k\)-th eigenvalue is simple is simply \( u_k u_k^\top\), where \(u_k\) is a corresponding eigenvector. Note that this result can be simply obtained by the simple (rough) calculation: if \(x\) is a unit eigenvector of \(A\), then \(Ax =\lambda x\), and \(x^\top x = 1\), leading to \(x^\top dx = 0\) and \(dA\ x + A dx = d\lambda \ x + \lambda dx\), and by taking the dot product with \(x\), \(d\lambda = x^\top dA\ x + x^\top A dx = x^\top dA \ x + \lambda x^\top  dx = x^\top dA \ x\), which is the same result. However, this reasoning is more cumbersome, and does not lead to neat approximation guarantees, in particular in the extensions below.</p>



<h2>Other perturbation results</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given the gradient, other more classical perturbation results could de derived, such as Hessians of eigenvalues, or gradient of the projectors \(u_k u_k^\top\).  Here I derive a perturbation result for the projector \(\Pi_k(A)=u_k u_k^\top\), when \(\lambda_k\) is a simple eigenvalue. Using the same technique as above, we get: $$ \Pi_k(A+\Delta )\  – \Pi_k(A) = \frac{1}{2i \pi} \oint_\gamma (z I- A)^{-1} \Delta (z I – A)^{-1}dz  + o(\| \Delta\|_2),$$ which we can expand to the basis of eigenvectors as $$ \frac{1}{2i \pi} \oint_\gamma \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{\ell=1}^n u_j u_j^\top \Delta u_\ell u_\ell^\top \frac{  dz}{(z-\lambda_\ell) (z-\lambda_j)  } + o(\| \Delta\|_2).$$ We can then split in two, with the two terms (all others are equal to zero by lack of poles within \(\gamma\)): $$ \frac{1}{2i \pi} \oint_\gamma \sum_{j \neq k}  u_j^\top \Delta u_k  ( u_j u_k^\top + u_k u_j^\top)   \frac{  dz}{(z-\lambda_k) (z-\lambda_j)  }= \sum_{j \neq k}  u_j^\top \Delta u_k  ( u_j u_k^\top + u_k u_j^\top) \frac{1}{\lambda_k – \lambda_j}  $$ and $$\frac{1}{2i \pi} \oint_\gamma   u_k^\top \Delta u_k   u_k u_k^\top  \frac{  dz}{(z-\lambda_k)^2  } = 0 ,$$ finally leading to $$\Pi_k(A+\Delta ) \ – \Pi_k(A) =  \sum_{j \neq k}  \frac{u_j^\top \Delta u_k}{\lambda_k – \lambda_j}    ( u_j u_k^\top + u_k u_j^\top)    + o(\| \Delta\|_2),$$ from which we can compute the Jacobian of \(\Pi_k\).</p>



<h2>Spectral functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Spectral functions are functions on symmetric matrices defined as \(F(A) = \sum_{k=1}^n f(\lambda_k(A))\), for any real-valued function \(f\). For \(f(x) = x\), we get back the trace, for \(f(x) = \log x\) we get back the log determinant, and so on. The function \(F\) can be represented as $$F(A) = \sum_{k=1}^n f(\lambda_k(A)) = \frac{1}{2i \pi} \oint_\gamma f(z) {\rm tr} \big[ (z I  – A)^{-1} \big] dz,$$ where the contour \(\gamma\) encloses all eigenvalues (as shown below).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5087" height="185" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/contour_all_eigenvalues-1024x433.png" width="438"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This representation can be used to compute derivatives of \(F\), by simple derivations, to obtain the same result as [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S089547980036838X">12</a>].</p>



<h2>Singular values of rectangular matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Singular value decompositions are also often used, for a rectangular matrix \(W \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\). It consists in finding \(r\) pairs \((u_j,v_j) \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \times \mathbb{R}^d\), \(j=1,\dots,r\), of singular vectors and \(r\) positive singular values \(\sigma_1 \geqslant \cdots \geqslant \sigma_r &gt; 0\) such that \(W = \sum_{j=1}^r \sigma_j u_j v_j^\top\) and  \((u_1,\dots,u_r)\) and \((v_1,\dots,v_r)\) are orthonormal families.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are two natural ways to relate the singular value decomposition to the classical eigenvalue decomposition of a symmetric matrix, �first through \(WW^\top\) (or similarly \(W^\top W\)). Here it is more direct to consider the so-called Jordan-Wielandt matrix, defined by blocks as $$<br/> \bar{W} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}<br/>0 &amp; W \\<br/>W^\top &amp; 0 \end{array} \right). $$ The matrix \(\bar{W}\) is symmetric, and its non zero eigenvalues are \(+\sigma_i\) and \(-\sigma_i\), \(i=1,\dots,r\), associated with the eigenvectors \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}  \left( \begin{array}{cc}<br/>u_i \\ v_i \end{array} \right)\) and \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}  \left( \begin{array}{cc}<br/>u_i \\ -v_i \end{array} \right)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">All necessary results (derivatives of singular values \(\sigma_j\), or projectors \(u_j v_j^\top\) can be obtained from there); see more details, in, e.g., the appendix of [6].</p>



<h2>Going beyond</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I have shown various applications of the Cauchy residue formula, for computing integrals and for the spectral analysis of matrices. I have just scratched the surface of spectral analysis, and what I presented extends to many interesting situations, for example, to more general linear operators in infinite-dimensional spaces [3], or to the analysis fo the eigenvalue distribution of random matrices (see a nice and reasonably simple derivation of the semi-circular law from <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/254a-notes-4-the-semi-circular-law/">Terry Tao’s blog</a>).</p>

<h2>Computing the Sobolev kernel</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The goal is to compute the infinite sum $$\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{e^{2i\pi q \cdot n}}{1+(2a \pi n)^2}$$ for \(q \in (0,1)\). We consider the function $$f(z) = \frac{e^{i\pi (2q-1) z}}{1+(2a \pi z)^2} \frac{\pi}{\sin (\pi z)}.$$ It is holomorphic on \(\mathbb{C}\) except at all integers \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\), where it has a simple pole with residue \(\displaystyle \frac{e^{i\pi (2q-1) n}}{1+(2a \pi n)^2} (-1)^n = \frac{e^{i\pi 2q n}}{1+(2a \pi n)^2}\), at \(z = i/(2a\pi)\) where it has a residue equal to \(\displaystyle \frac{e^{ – (2q-1)/(2a)}}{4ia\pi} \frac{\pi}{\sin (i/(2a))} = \ – \frac{e^{ – (2q-1)/(2a)}}{4a} \frac{1}{\sinh (1/(2a))}\), and at \(z = -i/(2a\pi)\) where it has a residue equal to \(\displaystyle \frac{e^{  (2q-1)/(2a)}}{4ia\pi} \frac{\pi}{\sin (i/(2a))} =\ – \frac{e^{ (2q-1)/(2a)}}{4a} \frac{1}{\sinh (1/(2a))}\). With all residues summing to zero (note that this fact requires a precise analysis of limits when \(m\) tends to infinity for the contour defined in the main text), we get: $$\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{e^{2i\pi q \cdot n}}{1+(2a \pi n)^2} =\frac{e^{ – (2q-1)/(2a)}}{4a} \frac{1}{\sinh (1/(2a))}+ \frac{e^{ (2q-1)/(2a)}}{4a} \frac{1}{\sinh (1/(2a))} = \frac{1}{2a} \frac{ \cosh (\frac{2q-1}{2a})}{\sinh (\frac{1}{2a})}.$$</p></div>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: In this talk, we present a complexity dichotomy for Holant problems on the boolean domain with arbitrary sets of real-valued constraint functions. These constraint functions need not be symmetric nor do we assume any auxiliary functions as in previous results. It is proved that for every set <img alt="F" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of real-valued constraint functions, <img alt="\text{Holant}(F)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BHolant%7D%28F%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is either <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-time computable or <img alt="\#P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%23P&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-hard. The classification has an explicit criterion. This is a culmination of much research on a decade-long classification program for Holant problems, and it uses previous results and techniques from many researchers.  However, as it turned out, the journey to the present theorem has been arduous. Some particularly intriguing concrete functions f6, f8 and their associated families with extraordinary closure properties related to Bell states in quantum information theory play an important role in this proof.  <br/><br/>Based on joint work with Jin-Yi Cai.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on Monday, Nov 09th at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC).  <strong>Tal Rabin </strong>from UPenn will speak about “<strong>You Only Speak Once — Secure MPC with Stateless Ephemeral Roles</strong>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The inherent difficulty of maintaining stateful environments over long periods of time gave rise to the paradigm of serverless computing, where mostly-stateless components are deployed on demand to handle computation tasks, and are teared down once their task is complete. Serverless architecture could offer the added benefit of improved resistance to targeted denial-of-service attacks. Realizing such protection,<br/>requires that the protocol only uses stateless parties. Perhaps the most famous example of this style of protocols is the Nakamoto consensus protocol used in Bitcoin. We refer to this stateless property as the You-Only-Speak-Once (YOSO) property, and initiate the formal study of it within a new YOSO model. Our model is centered around the notion of roles, which are stateless parties that can only send a single message. Furthermore, we describe several techniques for achieving YOSO MPC; both computational and information theoretic.</p>
