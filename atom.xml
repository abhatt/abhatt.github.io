<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: In this talk I’ll show how to revise the classical hardness-vs-randomness framework, so that it can work in a non-black-box fashion. Specifically, we will construct derandomization algorithms that don’t rely on classical PRGs, and instead “extract pseudorandomness” from the given input on which we want to simulate the probabilistic machine.</p>
<p>Using a non-black-box approach allows us to deduce stronger conclusions (or alternatively rely on weaker hypotheses), compared to classical approaches. In one instantiation of the new framework, we reveal a close connection between the promiseBPP = promiseP conjecture and a new type of uniform lower bounds. In another instantiation, we simulate probabilistic algorithms with essentially no observable runtime overhead, under plausible hypotheses.</p>
<p>Based on a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/080/">joint work</a> with <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~lijieche/">Lijie Chen</a>.</p></blockquote></div>

computers, and we need to compute the product of two $n \times n$ matrices.
Initially computer $i$ knows row $i$ of each input matrix. In one communication
round each computer can send and receive one $O(\log n)$-bit message.
Eventually computer $i$ has to output row $i$ of the product matrix.
</p>
<p>We seek to understand the complexity of this problem in the uniformly sparse
case: each row and column of each input matrix has at most $d$ non-zeros and in
the product matrix we only need to know the values of at most $d$ elements in
each row or column. This is exactly the setting that we have, e.g., when we
apply matrix multiplication for triangle detection in graphs of maximum degree
$d$. We focus on the supported setting: the structure of the matrices is known
in advance; only the numerical values of nonzero elements are unknown.
</p>
<p>There is a trivial algorithm that solves the problem in $O(d^2)$ rounds, but
for a large $d$, better algorithms are known to exist; in the moderately dense
regime the problem can be solved in $O(dn^{1/3})$ communication rounds, and for
very large $d$, the dominant solution is the fast matrix multiplication
algorithm using $O(n^{1.158})$ communication rounds (for matrix multiplication
over rings).
</p>
<p>In this work we show that it is possible to overcome quadratic barrier for
all values of $d$: we present an algorithm that solves the problem in
$O(d^{1.907})$ rounds for rings and $O(d^{1.927})$ rounds for semirings,
independent of $n$.

to be a powerful and versatile concept with implications far beyond its
original intent. This stringent notion -- that predictions be well-calibrated
across a rich class of intersecting subpopulations -- provides its strong
guarantees at a cost: the computational and sample complexity of learning
multicalibrated predictors are high, and grow exponentially with the number of
class labels. In contrast, the relaxed notion of multiaccuracy can be achieved
more efficiently, yet many of the most desirable properties of multicalibration
cannot be guaranteed assuming multiaccuracy alone. This tension raises a key
question: Can we learn predictors with multicalibration-style guarantees at a
cost commensurate with multiaccuracy?
</p>
<p>In this work, we define and initiate the study of Low-Degree
Multicalibration. Low-Degree Multicalibration defines a hierarchy of
increasingly-powerful multi-group fairness notions that spans multiaccuracy and
the original formulation of multicalibration at the extremes. Our main
technical contribution demonstrates that key properties of multicalibration,
related to fairness and accuracy, actually manifest as low-degree properties.
Importantly, we show that low-degree multicalibration can be significantly more
efficient than full multicalibration. In the multi-class setting, the sample
complexity to achieve low-degree multicalibration improves exponentially (in
the number of classes) over full multicalibration. Our work presents compelling
evidence that low-degree multicalibration represents a sweet spot, pairing
computational and sample efficiency with strong fairness and accuracy
guarantees.

for submodular optimization, which have been motivated by the wide
applicability of submodular functions in real-world data-science problems. In
this paper, we contribute to this line of work by considering the problem of
robust submodular maximization against unexpected deletions, which may occur
due to privacy issues or user preferences. Specifically, we study and derive
bounds for the minimum number of items a streaming algorithm has to remember,
in order to achieve a non-trivial approximation guarantee against adversarial
deletions up to $d$ items. We call the set of items that are kept by the
algorithm before adversarial deletions a deletion-robust coreset. We propose a
single-pass streaming algorithm that yields a $(1-\epsilon)/(4p)$-approximation
for maximizing a non-decreasing submodular function under a general $p$-matroid
constraint and requires a coreset size $k + d/\epsilon$, where $k$ is the
maximum size of a feasible solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to achieve an (asymptotically) optimal coreset size, as no constant
approximation is possible with a coreset of size sublinear in $d$.

pipelines on \emph{approximately} regular schedules, with arrival and running
times that exhibit variance. This pattern, typical of training tasks in machine
learning, allows customers to partially predict future job requirements. We
develop a model of cloud computing platforms that receive statements of work
(SoWs) in an online fashion. The SoWs describe future jobs whose arrival times
and durations are probabilistic, and whose utility to the submitting agents
declines with completion time. The arrival and duration distributions, as well
as the utility functions, are considered private customer information and are
reported by strategic agents to a scheduler that is optimizing for social
welfare.
</p>
<p>We design pricing, scheduling, and eviction mechanisms that incentivize
truthful reporting of SoWs. An important challenge is maintaining incentives
despite the possibility of the platform becoming saturated. We introduce a
framework to reduce scheduling under uncertainty to a relaxed scheduling
problem without uncertainty. Using this framework, we tackle both adversarial
and stochastic submissions of statements of work, and obtain logarithmic and
constant competitive mechanisms, respectively.

evaluates the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of two
K-dimensional discrete random vectors. The best known algorithms for this
problem run in polynomial time in the maximum of the number of atoms of the two
distributions. However, if the components of either random vector are
independent, then this number can be exponential in K even though the size of
the problem description scales linearly with K. We prove that the described
optimal transport problem is #P-hard even if all components of the first random
vector are independent uniform Bernoulli random variables, while the second
random vector has merely two atoms, and even if only approximate solutions are
sought. We also develop a dynamic programming-type algorithm that approximates
the Wasserstein distance in pseudo-polynomial time when the components of the
first random vector follow arbitrary independent discrete distributions, and we
identify special problem instances that can be solved exactly in strongly
polynomial time.

that there is a unique non-orientable 2-cell embedding of $K_{3,3}$, 14

several new polygonal representations of the double torus are presented.

constant-depth circuit <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309163">arXiv:quant-ph/0309163</a>. However, the coupling

hence, equivalently in constant depth an $(n+1)$-qubit fanout gate, using a
similar Hamiltonian but with unequal couplings, and we give an exact

However, data streams are often challenging to handle owing to their rapid pace
and limited information lifetime. It is difficult to collect and communicate
stream samples while storing, transmitting and computing a function across the
whole stream or even a large segment of it. In answer to this research issue,
many streaming-specific solutions were developed. Stream techniques imply a
limited capacity of one or more resources such as computing power and memory,
as well as time or accuracy limits. Reservoir sampling algorithms choose and
store results that are probabilistically significant. A weighted random
sampling approach using a generalised sampling algorithmic framework to detect
unique events is the key research goal of this work. Briefly, a gradually
developed estimate of the joint stream distribution across all feasible
components keeps k stream elements judged representative for the full stream.
Once estimate confidence is high, k samples are chosen evenly. The complexity
is O(min(k,n-k)), where n is the number of items inspected. Due to the fact
that events are usually considered outliers, it is sufficient to extract
element patterns and push them to an alternate version of k-means as proposed
here. The suggested technique calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) for
each cluster, and this is utilised not only as a measure of convergence, but
also as a quantification and an indirect assessment of the element
distribution's approximation accuracy. This clustering enables for the
detection of outliers in the stream based on their distance from the usual
event centroids. The findings reveal that weighted sampling and res-means
outperform typical approaches for stream event identification. Detected events
are shown as knowledge graphs, along with typical clusters of events.

\cite{beniamini2020approximate,beniamini2020bipartite}, we show that,
surprisingly, the dual description is \textit{sparse} and has \textit{low
$\ell_1$-norm} -- only exponential in $\Theta(n \log n)$, and this result
extends even to other families of matching-related functions. Our approach
relies on the matching-covered lattice and on properties of upper-sums of its
M\"obius numbers, and a key ingredient in our proof is M\"obius inversion
formula.

<p>These polynomial representations yield complexity-theoretic results. We show
that unique bipartite matching is evasive for classical decision trees, and
nearly evasive for generalized query models. We also obtain a tight $\Theta(n

merges given ranked list of items from different sensitive demographic groups
while satisfying given lower and upper bounds on the representation of each
group in the top ranks. Our randomized group fair ranking formulation works
even when there is implicit bias, incomplete relevance information, or when
only ordinal ranking is available instead of relevance scores or utility
values.
</p>
<p>We take an axiomatic approach and show that there is a unique distribution
$\mathcal{D}$ to sample a random group fair ranking that satisfies a natural
set of consistency and fairness axioms. Moreover, $\mathcal{D}$ satisfies
representation constraints for every group at every rank, a characteristic that
cannot be satisfied by any deterministic ranking. We propose three algorithms
to sample a random group fair ranking from $\mathcal{D}$. Our first algorithm
samples rankings from $\mathcal{D}$ exactly, in time exponential in the number
of groups. Our second algorithm samples random group fair rankings from
$\mathcal{D}$ exactly and is faster than the first algorithm when the gap
between upper and lower bounds on the representation for each group is small.
Our third algorithm samples rankings from a distribution $\epsilon$-close to
$\mathcal{D}$ in total variation distance, and has expected running time
polynomial in all input parameters and $1/\epsilon$ when there is a large gap
between upper and lower bound representation constraints for all the groups. We
experimentally validate the above guarantees of our algorithms for group
fairness in top ranks and representation in every rank on real-world data sets.

    <title>Centralized Fairness for Redistricting</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1646265600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/e/Esmaeili:Seyed_A=.html">Seyed A. Esmaeili</a>, Hayley Grape, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Brubach:Brian.html">Brian Brubach</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00872">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In representative democracy, the electorate is often partitioned into
districts with each district electing a representative. However, these systems
have proven vulnerable to the practice of partisan gerrymandering which
involves drawing districts that elect more representatives from a given
political party. Additionally, computer-based methods have dramatically
enhanced the ability to draw districts that drastically favor one party over
others. On the positive side, researchers have recently developed tools for
measuring how gerrymandered a redistricting map is by comparing it to a large
set of randomly-generated district maps.
</p>
<p>While these efforts to test whether a district map is "gerrymandered" have
achieved real-world impact, the question of how best to draw districts remains
very open. Many attempts to automate the redistricting process have been
proposed, but not adopted into practice. Typically, they have focused on
optimizing certain properties (e.g., geographical compactness or partisan
competitiveness of districts) and argued that the properties are desirable.
</p>
<p>In this work, we take an alternative approach which seeks to find the most
"typical" redistricting map. More precisely, we introduce a family of
well-motivated distance measures over redistricting maps. Then, by generating a
large collection of maps using sampling techniques, we select the map which
minimizes the sum of the distances from the collection, i.e., the most
"central" map. We produce scalable, linear-time algorithms and derive sample
complexity guarantees. Empirically, we show the validity of our algorithms over
real world redistricting problems.

chain of integral segments whose turns at its bends are the same as the turn
sequence. The chain starts from the origin and ends at some point which we call
a reachable point of the turn sequence. We investigate the combinatorial and
geometric properties of the set of reachable points of a given turn sequence
such as the shape, connectedness, and sufficient and necessary conditions on
the reachability to the four signed axes. We also prove the upper and lower
bounds on the maximum distance from the origin to the closest reachable point
on signed axes for a turn sequence. The bounds are expressed in terms of the
difference between the number of left and right turns in the sequence as well
as, in certain cases, the length of the maximal monotone prefix or suffix of
the turn sequence. The bounds are exactly matched or tight within additive
constants for some signed axes.

    <title>An Accelerated Stochastic Algorithm for Solving the Optimal Transport Problem</title>

accelerated stochastic gradient descent with variance reduction (PDASGD) -- for
solving the optimal transport (OT) problem between two discrete distributions.
PDASGD can also be utilized to compute for the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) of
multiple discrete distributions. In both the OT and WB cases, the proposed
algorithm enjoys the best-known convergence rate (in the form of order of
computational complexity) in the literature. PDASGD is easy to implement in
nature, due to its stochastic property: computation per iteration can be much
faster than other non-stochastic counterparts. We carry out numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real data; they demonstrate the improved
efficiency of PDASGD.

$(s, t)$-mincuts in undirected graphs where every cut edge can be
simultaneously saturated (in the same direction) to a $\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}$
fraction by an $(s, t)$-flow. We call these $(1+\epsilon)$-fair cuts. Unlike
arbitrary approximate $(s, t)$-mincuts, fair cuts can be uncrossed, which is a
key property of $(s, t)$-mincuts used in many algorithms. We also give a
near-linear $\tilde O(m/\epsilon^3)$-time algorithm for computing an $(s,
t)$-fair cut. This offers a general tool for trading off a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for near-linear running time in mincut based
algorithms.
</p>
<p>As an application of this new concept, we obtain a near-linear time algorithm
for constructing a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate Gomory-Hu tree, thereby giving a
nearly optimal algorithm for the $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate all-pairs max-flows
(APMF) problem in undirected graphs. Our result is obtained via another
intermediate tool of independent interest. We obtain a near-linear time
algorithm for finding $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate isolating cuts in undirected
graphs, a concept that has gained wide traction over the past year.

    <title>Bounds on quantum evolution complexity via lattice cryptography</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1646265600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Ben Craps, Marine De Clerck, Oleg Evnin, Philip Hacker, Maxim Pavlov <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13924">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We address the difference between integrable and chaotic motion in quantum
theory as manifested by the complexity of the corresponding evolution
operators. Complexity is understood here as the shortest geodesic distance
between the time-dependent evolution operator and the origin within the group
of unitaries. (An appropriate `complexity metric' must be used that takes into
account the relative difficulty of performing `nonlocal' operations that act on
many degrees of freedom at once.) While simply formulated and geometrically
attractive, this notion of complexity is numerically intractable save for toy
models with Hilbert spaces of very low dimensions. To bypass this difficulty,
we trade the exact definition in terms of geodesics for an upper bound on
complexity, obtained by minimizing the distance over an explicitly prescribed
infinite set of curves, rather than over all possible curves. Identifying this
upper bound turns out equivalent to the closest vector problem (CVP) previously
studied in integer optimization theory, in particular, in relation to
lattice-based cryptography. Effective approximate algorithms are hence provided
by the existing mathematical considerations, and they can be utilized in our
analysis of the upper bounds on quantum evolution complexity. The resulting
algorithmically implemented complexity bound systematically assigns lower
values to integrable than to chaotic systems, as we demonstrate by explicit
numerical work for Hilbert spaces of dimensions up to ~10^4.

    <title>REU programs in general, and two at Univ of MD this summer.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>REU stands for Research Experience for Undergraduates. </p><p>REU programs are funded by the NSF. The NSF website of REU programs is <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp">here</a>. </p><p>Univ if MD at College Park dept of Comp Sci is running two REU programs this summer:</p><p>I (William Gasarch) am running  REU-CAAR (Combinatorics and AI Applied to Real problems) whose theme is applying theory to practice. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/">here</a>.</p><p> Jacquelyn Michaelis and Mihai Pop are running REU-BRIDGe (Bioinformatics Research In Data science for Genomics) which, as you can probably tell from the name, is in bio-comp. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cbcb.umd.edu/summer-internships">here</a>.</p><p>Most REU programs have the following: </p><p>1) There is an admissions period where many people apply (I had around 200 applicants last year) of which only about 10 get in. Some have money for a few extra students. This year both REU-CAAR and REU-BRIDGe have applications due March 22; however, in the past I have admitted students before then, so students who apply March 21 may be at a severe disadvantage. </p><p>2) Students apply from across the United states and these programs are competitive, so good to apply to several that you would definitely goto. Students ask me how many- I'll say 10 though temper that with only applying to those you REALLY would goto, and if there are MORE THAN 10 that look awesome, you could apply to more. </p><p>3) Students stay in the dorms (the last two years some programs cancelled, and some were virtual- mine was virtual) and get stipend of $6000, and a meal card. The program is 10 weeks.</p><p>4) Students work on projects in teams of 2-5. Some programs have the students pick what projects they would be happy to work on when they apply (mine does that) while others assign projects once students arrive (REU-BRIDGe will do that). The later makes sense if the program is very focused so the projects do not differ that much. </p><p>5) These programs are excellent for giving ugrads a chance to do research (NSF wants at least half of the students to come from non-research schools) and a sense of what grad school is like. So I recommend students thinking of grad school, or just want to do research, to apply to these programs. </p><p>6) Some students get papers out of the research. In these cases the research usually continues after the program is over. </p><p>7) It is healthy for a student to go to an REU program that is at a DIFFERENT school then where they are an ugrad for broadening. There may be mitigating circumstances where this is not possible. </p><p><br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Yesterday, Bocconi’s Rector signed the decree that created the new Computing Sciences department. This is only the ninth department to be created in our 120 year old university, and the first, I believe, in a couple of decades. It is the first department with an engineering and science mission (the other eight department are, in random order, Accounting, Marketing, Finance, Economics, Managements, Social Sciences, Law, and Decision Sciences).</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, we were joined by <a href="https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/team/francesca-buffa">Francesca Buffa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_M%C3%A9zard">Marc Mezard</a>. </p>



<p>Francesca, a computational biologist formerly at Oxford medical school, is now the fourth out of four computer science tenured faculty in our new department to have an active ERC grant.</p>



<p>Marc’s work has spanned theoretical physics, information theory and computation, including his collaboration with Giorgio Parisi’s Nobel Prize winning work, and he has been most recently the president of the Ecole National Superieure in Paris. When we asked for letters for his tenure case, one of the reviewers wrote, more or less in so many words, “you would be lucky to have Marc in your university, though it’s very unlikely that he will accept your offer”. At that point Marc had already accepted.</p>

    <title>TR22-032 |  Incompressiblity and Next-Block Pseudoentropy | 

	Noam Mazor, 

	Iftach Haitner, 

	Jad Silbak</title>
    <summary>A distribution is k-incompressible, Yao [FOCS ’82], if no efficient compression scheme compresses it to less than k bits. While being a natural measure, its relation to other computational analogs of entropy such as pseudoentropy, Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [SICOMP 99], and to other cryptographic hardness assumptions, was unclear.

We advance towards a better understating of this notion, showing that a k-incompressible distribution has (k?2) bits of next-block pseudoentropy, a refinement of pseudoentropy introduced by Haitner, Reingold, and Vadhan [SICOMP ’13]. We deduce that a samplable distribution X that is (H(X) + 2)-incompressible, implies the existence of one-way functions.</summary>

<p><img alt="" src="https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/news/theory_at_the_institute_and_beyond-february_2022.png" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 328px; height: 219px;"/>It has been only a few months since the last time this column appeared. Yet there is so much to write about that it feels like a year has passed. For one area in particular, a decade’s worth of developments seems to have emerged in a few months’ time. I am talking of course about the phenomenal developments on error-correcting codes that we witnessed in the past few months.</p>



<p><strong>Error-correcting codes</strong><br/>
	Error-correcting codes encode a message into a longer codeword so that the original message can be recovered even if many of the bits of the codeword are corrupted. Clearly, there is a trade-off between the amount of redundancy introduced by the error-correcting code and the number of errors it can recover from. A gold standard for error-correcting codes is being “constant rate, constant distance,” also referred to as being “asymptotically good.” An asymptotically good code can recover from a constant fraction of bit errors in the codeword, and the codeword is only a constant factor longer than the original message.</p>



<p>Error-correcting codes can be described using a family of “parity checks,” where a parity check on a subset \(S\) of bits is a constraint that there are an even number of \(1\)s within the subset \(S\). A codeword is then a sequence of bits that satisfy all of the parity check constraints. In a low-density parity check (LDPC) code, there is a family of parity checks on constantly many bits each, that together define the code.</p>



<p>Introduced by Gallager in 1960, LDPC codes are central objects in both the theory and the practice of error correction. In 1996, Sipser and Spielman showed how to use expander graphs to construct LDPCs with constant distance and constant rate. Their construction is a thing of beauty. Pick an expander graph and associate one bit on each edge of the graph. For each vertex of the expander graph, the parity of the sum of bits on its edges is even. This construction also admits linear time encoding and decoding algorithms for the same.</p>



<p><strong>Asymptotically good locally testable codes and quantum LDPCs</strong><br/>
	A locally testable code is one that admits a highly efficient procedure to detect the presence of errors. More precisely, it admits a testing procedure that queries a small number of randomly selected bits in the codeword, and will reject a corrupted codeword with, say, 1% of errors with constant probability. The gold standard would be a constant-query locally testable code, where the testing procedure queries only a constantly many (say, 100) bits of the corrupted codeword.</p>



<p>Locally testable codes have been central to many of the developments in complexity theory for close to three decades now. Linearity testing, aka locally testing the Hadamard code, is still the prime example for property testing and lies at the gateway to the world of probabilistically checkable proofs.</p>



<p>Intuitively for a code to be locally testable, it needs to admit a large number of constant-size parity checks. In other words, locally testability seemingly necessitates the code to have a lot of redundancy. In fact, the classic examples of locally testable codes, such as Hadamard codes or Reed-Muller codes, have codewords that are superpolynomially larger than the message.</p>



<p>Irit Dinur’s ingenious proof of the PCP theorem yielded as a by-product the first locally testable codes where the codewords were only slightly superlinear in size. It was then that one would dare to ask: can locally testability be achieved for “free”? That is, can one have the best of all worlds: a constant-rate, constant-distance code that also admits a constant-query local-tester?</p>



<p>This long-standing open question always seemed out of reach until late last year, when it was resolved affirmatively by two independent groups of researchers simultaneously!</p>



<span id="more-627"/>



<p/>



<p>Irit Dinur, Shai Evra, Ron Livne, Alexander Lubotzky, and Shahar Mozes start their journey with the idea that analogous to how Sipser and Spielman use expander graphs to construct codes, one could potentially use high-dimensional expanders to construct codes that are also locally testable. Starting with this idea, they undertake a long and intensive journey through a terrain of Ramanujan complexes, Bruhat-Tits buildings, <em>p</em>-adic uniformization, and other advanced mathematics to eventually land on an elementary and elegant <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04808" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construction</u></a> (see Irit Dinur’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjc6GCRFnpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>talk</u></a> on this work in the <em>Breakthroughs</em> talk series).</p>



<p>In an independent work, Pavel Panteleev and Gleb Kalachev not only <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03654?context=quant-ph" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construct</u></a> asymptotically good locally testable codes, but also resolve yet another long-standing open question! They exhibit a construction of asymptotically good quantum LDPCs. Regular readers of this column might recall that we earlier <u><a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/theory-institute-and-beyond-january-2021" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">featured</a></u> a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03921" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breakthrough</u></a> by Hastings, Haah, and O’Donnell, who constructed quantum LDPCs on \(n\) qubits with distance \(n^{3/5}\), significantly beating \(\sqrt{n}\) for the first time. Panteleev and Kalachev essentially achieve the holy grail in this context — quantum LDPCs on \(n\) qubits with constant rate and distance \(\Omega(n)\).</p>



<p>It is uncanny how often a question that has remained open for years gets resolved by independent sets of researchers simultaneously. At first, one might remark that these results were really in the air. Yet on a closer look, one can only wonder how the authors masterfully pulled these results out of thin air.</p>



<p>These works are a treasure trove of ideas that are elementary, elegant, and ingenious. To leave you with a taste of things that lie inside, let me briefly describe a new combinatorial object, the “left-right Cayley complex,” that seems to underlie both these works. We are all familiar with Cayley graphs — objects studied for more than a hundred years. These are graphs where the vertices are elements of a group, and edges are of the form \((g,ag)\) — corresponding to left multiplication by a fixed set of group elements \(a\) called generators.</p>



<p>A left-right Cayley complex is a higher-dimensional object that has vertices, edges, and squares (\(4\)-tuples). The vertices are still elements of a group, and the squares are of the form \(\{g, ag, gb, agb\}\), corresponding to left and right multiplication of a group element \(g\) by generators \(a,b\). This simple and easily constructed combinatorial object (left-right Cayley complex) plays a central role in both these code constructions. Yet this object seems to have eluded study in more than a century of work on Cayley graphs.</p>



<p><strong>Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity</strong><br/>
	Reed-Muller codes are among the oldest of error-correcting codes and are probably the simplest to describe. Reed-Muller codewords of degree \(d\) are just the truth tables of degree \(d\) polynomials over the finite field \({0,1}\). Yet almost 70 years after their discovery, there are still fundamental questions about Reed-Muller codes that remain open.</p>



<p>Given the noise characteristics of a channel, Shannon’s theory establishes the fundamental upper bound on the rate of communication possible. An error-correcting code is said to “achieve capacity” if the rate of communication (aka, the number of message bits per codeword bit) matches Shannon’s upper bound.</p>



<p>A fundamental question on Reed-Muller codes is whether they do achieve capacity for a broad family of channels. In 2016, a beautiful <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7862912" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>work</u></a> by Shrinivas Kudekar, Santhosh Kumar, Marco Mondelli, Henry D. Pfister, Eren Şaşoğlu, and Rüdiger Urbanke showed that indeed, Reed-Muller codes do achieve capacity for erasure channels, namely channels that only erase bits instead of corrupting bits. Using one of the most ingenious applications of Boolean function analysis, they show a very general result that any code with a certain family of symmetries achieves capacity against erasures.</p>



<p>In a remarkable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14631" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breakthrough</u></a>, Galen Reeves and Henry D. Pfister show that Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity even against the broad family of binary memoryless channels. In particular, they achieve capacity for the most classic channel, namely the binary symmetric channel (BSC), where each bit is flipped with a fixed probability \(\epsilon\).</p>



<p><strong>An algorithmic surprise</strong><br/>
	Given a graph with weights on the edges, the best-known algorithm to compute shortest paths between all pairs of vertices takes \(O(n^3)\) time. In fact, it is hypothesized that the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem requires \(n^{3-o(1)}\) time, and this hypothesis is the starting point for a web of reductions in fine-grained complexity.</p>



<p>Now consider the problem of computing max-flow values between every pair of vertices in the graph, also known as the all-pairs max-flow (APMF) problem. It would seem that the APMF problem must be harder than APSP — after all, shortest paths are arguably much simpler to compute than maximum flows.</p>



<p>Yet, a phenomenal new result by Amir Abboud, Robert Krauthgamer, Jason Li, Debmalya Panigrahi, Thatchaphol Saranurak, and Ohad Trabelsi shatters this intuition. In particular, they exhibit a nearly quadratic-time algorithm for APMF!</p>



<p>Perhaps the first hint that max-flow values are arguably simpler objects than shortest paths lies in Gomory-Hu trees. In 1961, Gomory and Hu showed that the max-flow values between every pair of vertices in a graph can be succinctly represented using a weighted tree. More precisely, the Gomory-Hu tree is a weighted tree that one can construct for any given graph so that the maximum flow between every pair of vertices in the graph is equal to the same quantity on the Gomory-Hu tree.</p>



<p>Six decades after its introduction, this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04958" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>work</u></a> produces the first near-quadratic-time algorithm to compute the Gomory-Hu tree. Moreover, this work also shows that one can compute Gomory-Hu trees in unweighted graphs by using polylogarithmically many max-flow computations.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-031 |  Transparency Beyond VNP in the Monotone Setting | 

	Prerona Chatterjee, 

	Kshitij Gajjar, 

	Anamay Tengse</title>
    <summary>Recently Hrubes and Yehudayoff (2021) showed a connection between the monotone algebraic circuit complexity of \emph{transparent} polynomials and a geometric complexity measure of their Newton polytope. They then used this connection to prove lower bounds against monotone VP (mVP). We extend their work by showing that their technique can be used to prove lower bounds against classes that are seemingly more powerful than monotone VNP (mVNP).
	
In the process, we define a natural monotone analogue of VPSPACE --- a well-studied class in the non-monotone setting (Poizat (2008), Koiran Perifel (2009), Malod (2011), Mahajan Rao (2013) --- and prove an exponential separation between the computational powers of this class and mVNP. 
	
To show this separation, we define a new polynomial family with an interesting combinatorial structure which we use heavily in our lower bound. Both the polynomial and the combinatorial nature of our proof might be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>TR22-029 |  Quantum Tanner codes | 

	Anthony Leverrier, 

	Gilles Zémor</title>
    <summary>Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes.

In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a $c^3$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.</summary>

<i>Age is strictly a case of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter—Jack Benny</i></p>
<p>
Jennifer Chayes, Francine Berman, Susan Dumais, Deborah Estrin, James Hendler, Michael Jordan, Butler Lampson, Valerie Taylor are the members of a <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2022/february/75th-anniversary">special committee</a>. This committee is charged with helping organize the 75th anniversary of the ACM. The ACM was founded on September 15, 1947; hence the 75 year celebration. During 2022 special events are planned, leading up to a memorable day in June of panels on topics central to the future of computing. The committee has members from both universities and companies: </p>
<ul>
<li> Jennifer Chayes (Chair), University of California, Berkeley
</li><li> Francine Berman, University of Massachusetts Amherst
</li><li> Susan Dumais, Microsoft Research
</li><li> Deborah Estrin, Cornell University
</li><li> James Hendler, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
</li><li> Michael Jordan, University of California, Berkeley
</li><li> Butler Lampson, Microsoft Corporation and MIT
</li><li> Valerie Taylor, Argonne National Laboratory and CMD-IT
</li></ul>
<p>
In random order:</p>

<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/02/26/acm-celebrating-75-years/all-11/" rel="attachment wp-att-19692"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19692" height="215" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/all.png?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> 75 Years </b></p>
<p/><p>
I am 75 years old too. I do not have a committee for special events—maybe I should. I do recall what computers were in the beginning and what they have become now. I can only imagine what they might become in the next 75 years. I am thus quite interested in what the committee will do and how it might help celebrate the 75th anniversary. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
I started doing some research into the history of computers. I had the idea to look at old magazines that were monthly publications on all aspects of computers. Especially ones that were important in the early days: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datamation">Datamation</a> is one and another was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">Byte</a>. The later opened in 1975 and closed in 2013. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/02/26/acm-celebrating-75-years/teeth/" rel="attachment wp-att-19694"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19694" height="225" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/teeth.png?resize=225%2C225&amp;ssl=1" width="225"/></a></p>
<p>
As of 2022, the domain for Byte redirects to an unrelated website selling <a href="https://www.byteme.com/pages/why-byte">teeth aligners</a>. That says something, no?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I just spent an hour giving Lily, my 9-year-old, a crash course on geopolitics, including WWII, the Cold War, the formation of NATO, Article 5, nuclear deterrence, economic sanctions, the breakup of the USSR, Ukraine, the Baltic Republics, and the prospects now for WWIII.

    <title>I will be on instagram/If you have two reals in a box- Answer (Guest Post by David Marcus)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I will be on instragram:</p><p>We,  Prof. Mohammad Hajiaghayi and Prof. William Gasarch plan to have an Instagram Live at @mhajiaghayi this SAT FEB 26, 1:30PM EDT (in English).</p><p> We talk about our lives as well as blogging, research, and how to inspire young minds. Please join if you can.</p><p>#PvsNP #blogging #youngminds #instagram</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>This is the answer to the problem posted in the last post which was a guest post by David Marcus. This post is also a guest post by him. </p><p>We restate the problem:</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>PICK THE LARGEST NUMBER:</p><p>There are two distinct reals in a box (how do they fit! aren't reals infinite!). They are called the first and second number. </p><p>You want to pick the larger one. You can pick one of the numbers at random and look at it</p><p>before deciding which one you want. </p><p>Is there a strategy that will win with probability &gt; 1/2.</p><p>CLARIFICATIONS:</p><p>1) We do not want a strategy that does well on average or in the long run. Even if the games is played just once, we want the probability of winning to be &gt; 1/2.</p><p>2) It must have prob of winning &gt; 1/2 for EVERY pair of reals.</p><p>3) Here is an example of a strategy that does NOT work: Pick the first number with prob 1/2. If its positive then keep it, else dump it. If the numbers are{1,2} this only works half the time.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>There is a strategy. In fact, we give two.</p><p><br/></p><p>STRATEGY ONE</p><p>Before looking at any number, pick a number x on your own from the reals according to a distribution with full support (every open interval has prob greater than 0). Then pick a number from the box (prob 1/2-1/2), which we call y. If x&lt;y then keep y. If y\le x then take the other number.</p><p>If x is between the two numbers, then the strategy works. If not then the strategy does not hurt, so the prob in that case is 1/2. Hence you do better than 1/2. </p><p>STRATEGY TWO</p><p>Let f: R--&gt; (0,1) be strictly increasing. Pick a number from the box, call it y. Keep it with prob f(y).</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>
