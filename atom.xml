    <title>Dynamic size counting in population protocols</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1646006400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Doty:David.html">David Doty</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/e/Eftekhari:Mahsa.html">Mahsa Eftekhari</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12864">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The population protocol model describes a network of anonymous agents that
interact asynchronously in pairs chosen at random. Each agent starts in the
same initial state $s$. We introduce the *dynamic size counting* problem:
approximately counting the number of agents in the presence of an adversary who
at any time can remove any number of agents or add any number of new agents in
state $s$. A valid solution requires that after each addition/removal event,
resulting in population size $n$, with high probability each agent "quickly"
computes the same constant-factor estimate of the value $\log_2 n$ (how quickly
is called the *convergence* time), which remains the output of every agent for
as long as possible (the *holding* time). Since the adversary can remove
agents, the holding time is necessarily finite: even after the adversary stops
altering the population, it is impossible to *stabilize* to an output that
never again changes.
</p>
<p>We first show that a protocol solves the dynamic size counting problem if and
only if it solves the *loosely-stabilizing counting* problem: that of
estimating $\log n$ in a *fixed-size* population, but where the adversary can
initialize each agent in an arbitrary state, with the same convergence time and
holding time. We then show a protocol solving the loosely-stabilizing counting
problem with the following guarantees: if the population size is $n$, $M$ is
the largest initial estimate of $\log n$, and s is the maximum integer
initially stored in any field of the agents' memory, we have expected
convergence time $O(\log n + \log M)$, expected polynomial holding time, and
expected memory usage of $O(\log^2 (s) + (\log \log n)^2)$ bits. Interpreted as
a dynamic size counting protocol, when changing from population size $n_{prev}$
to $n_{next}$, the convergence time is $O(\log n_{next} + \log \log n_{prev})$.

consists of finding a set of $k$ points called centers, such that the sum of
distances raised to the power of $z$ of every data point to its closest center
is minimized. Special cases include the famous k-median problem ($z = 1$) and
k-means problem ($z = 2$). The $k$-median and $k$-means problems are at the
heart of modern data analysis and massive data applications have given raise to
the notion of coreset: a small (weighted) subset of the input point set
preserving the cost of any solution to the problem up to a multiplicative $(1
\pm \varepsilon)$ factor, hence reducing from large to small scale the input to
the problem.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present improved lower bounds for coresets in various
metric spaces. In finite metrics consisting of $n$ points and doubling metrics
with doubling constant $D$, we show that any coreset for $(k,z)$ clustering
must consist of at least $\Omega(k \varepsilon^{-2} \log n)$ and $\Omega(k
\varepsilon^{-2} D)$ points, respectively. Both bounds match previous upper
bounds up to polylog factors. In Euclidean spaces, we show that any coreset for
$(k,z)$ clustering must consists of at least $\Omega(k\varepsilon^{-2})$
points. We complement these lower bounds with a coreset construction consisting
of at most $\tilde{O}(k\varepsilon^{-2}\cdot \min(\varepsilon^{-z},k))$ points.

    <title>Making Life More Confusing for Firefighters</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1646006400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Samuel Hand, Jessica Enright, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Meeks:Kitty.html">Kitty Meeks</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12599">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>It is well known that fighting a fire is a hard task. The Firefighter problem
asks how to optimally deploy firefighters to defend the vertices of a graph
from a fire. This problem is NP-Complete on all but a few classes of graphs.
Thankfully, firefighters do not have to work alone, and are often aided by the
efforts of good natured civilians who slow the spread of a fire by maintaining
firebreaks when they are able. We will show that this help, although
well-intentioned, unfortunately makes the optimal deployment of firefighters an
even harder problem. To model this scenario we introduce the Temporal
Firefighter problem, an extension of Firefighter to temporal graphs. We show
that Temporal Firefighter is also NP-Complete, and remains so on all but one of
the underlying classes of graphs on which Firefighter is known to have
polynomial time solutions. This motivates us to explore making use of the
temporal structure of the graph in our search for tractability, and we conclude
by presenting an FPT algorithm for Temporal Firefighter with respect to the
temporal graph parameter vertex-interval-membership-width.

    <title>List Locally Surjective Homomorphisms in Hereditary Graph Classes</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1646006400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Pavel Dvořák, Monika Krawczyk, Tomáš Masařík, Jana Novotná, Paweł Rzążewski, Aneta Żuk <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12438">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A locally surjective homomorphism from a graph $G$ to a graph $H$ is an
edge-preserving mapping from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$ that is surjective in the
neighborhood of each vertex in $G$. In the list locally surjective homomorphism
problem, denoted by LLSHom($H$), the graph $H$ is fixed and the instance
consists of a graph $G$ whose every vertex is equipped with a subset of $V(H)$,
called list. We ask for the existence of a locally surjective homomorphism from
$G$ to $H$, where every vertex of $G$ is mapped to a vertex from its list. In
this paper, we study the complexity of the LLSHom($H$) problem in $F$-free
graphs, i.e., graphs that exclude a fixed graph $F$ as an induced subgraph. We
aim to understand for which pairs $(H,F)$ the problem can be solved in
subexponential time.
</p>
<p>We show that for all graphs $H$, for which the problem is NP-hard in general
graphs, it cannot be solved in subexponential time in $F$-free graphs unless
$F$ is a bounded-degree forest or the ETH fails. The initial study reveals that
a natural subfamily of bounded-degree forests $F$ that might lead to some
tractability results is the family $\mathcal S$ consisting of forests whose
every component has at most three leaves. In this case, we exhibit the
following dichotomy theorem: besides the cases that are polynomial-time
solvable in general graphs, the graphs $H \in \{P_3,C_4\}$ are the only
connected ones that allow for a subexponential-time algorithm in $F$-free
graphs for every $F \in \mathcal S$ (unless the ETH fails).

    <title>A Dynamic Fast Gaussian Transform</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1646006400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Huang:Baihe.html">Baihe Huang</a>, Zhao Song, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Weinstein:Omri.html">Omri Weinstein</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/z/Zhang:Hengjie.html">Hengjie Zhang</a>, Ruizhe Zhang <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12329">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The Fast Gaussian Transform (FGT) enables subquadratic-time multiplication of
an $n\times n$ Gaussian kernel matrix $\mathsf{K}_{i,j}= \exp ( - \| x_i - x_j
\|_2^2 ) $ with an arbitrary vector $h \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where $x_1,\dots, x_n
\in \mathbb{R}^d$ are a set of fixed source points. This kernel plays a central
role in machine learning and random feature maps. Nevertheless, in most modern
ML and data analysis applications, datasets are dynamically changing, and
recomputing the FGT from scratch in (kernel-based) algorithms, incurs a major
computational overhead ($\gtrsim n$ time for a single source update $\in
\mathbb{R}^d$). These applications motivate the development of a dynamic FGT
algorithm, which maintains a dynamic set of sources under kernel-density
estimation (KDE) queries in sublinear time, while retaining Mat-Vec
multiplication accuracy and speed.
</p>
<p>Our main result is an efficient dynamic FGT algorithm, supporting the
following operations in $\log^{O(d)}(n/\epsilon)$ time: (1) Adding or deleting
a source point, and (2) Estimating the "kernel-density" of a query point with
respect to sources with $\epsilon$ additive accuracy. The core of the algorithm
is a dynamic data structure for maintaining the "interaction rank" between
source and target boxes, which we decouple into finite truncation of Taylor
series and Hermite expansions.

    <title>TR22-031 |  Transparency Beyond VNP in the Monotone Setting | 

	Prerona Chatterjee, 

	Kshitij Gajjar, 

	Anamay Tengse</title>
    <summary>Recently Hrubes and Yehudayoff (2021) showed a connection between the monotone algebraic circuit complexity of \emph{transparent} polynomials and a geometric complexity measure of their Newton polytope. They then used this connection to prove lower bounds against monotone VP (mVP). We extend their work by showing that their technique can be used to prove lower bounds against classes that are seemingly more powerful than monotone VNP (mVNP).
	
In the process, we define a natural monotone analogue of VPSPACE --- a well-studied class in the non-monotone setting (Poizat (2008), Koiran Perifel (2009), Malod (2011), Mahajan Rao (2013) --- and prove an exponential separation between the computational powers of this class and mVNP. 
	
To show this separation, we define a new polynomial family with an interesting combinatorial structure which we use heavily in our lower bound. Both the polynomial and the combinatorial nature of our proof might be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>TR22-029 |  Quantum Tanner codes | 

	Anthony Leverrier, 

	Gilles Zémor</title>
    <summary>Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes.

In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a $c^3$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.</summary>

<i>Age is strictly a case of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter—Jack Benny</i></p>
<p>
Jennifer Chayes, Francine Berman, Susan Dumais, Deborah Estrin, James Hendler, Michael Jordan, Butler Lampson, Valerie Taylor are the members of a <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2022/february/75th-anniversary">special committee</a>. This committee is charged with helping organize the 75th anniversary of the ACM. The ACM was founded on September 15, 1947; hence the 75 year celebration. During 2022 special events are planned, leading up to a memorable day in June of panels on topics central to the future of computing. The committee has members from both universities and companies: </p>
<ul>
<li> Jennifer Chayes (Chair), University of California, Berkeley
</li><li> Francine Berman, University of Massachusetts Amherst
</li><li> Susan Dumais, Microsoft Research
</li><li> Deborah Estrin, Cornell University
</li><li> James Hendler, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
</li><li> Michael Jordan, University of California, Berkeley
</li><li> Butler Lampson, Microsoft Corporation and MIT
</li><li> Valerie Taylor, Argonne National Laboratory and CMD-IT
</li></ul>
<p>
In random order:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/02/26/acm-celebrating-75-years/all-11/" rel="attachment wp-att-19692"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19692" height="215" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/all.png?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> 75 Years </b></p>
<p/><p>
I am 75 years old too. I do not have a committee for special events—maybe I should. I do recall what computers were in the beginning and what they have become now. I can only imagine what they might become in the next 75 years. I am thus quite interested in what the committee will do and how it might help celebrate the 75th anniversary. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
I started doing some research into the history of computers. I had the idea to look at old magazines that were monthly publications on all aspects of computers. Especially ones that were important in the early days: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datamation">Datamation</a> is one and another was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">Byte</a>. The later opened in 1975 and closed in 2013. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/02/26/acm-celebrating-75-years/teeth/" rel="attachment wp-att-19694"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19694" height="225" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/teeth.png?resize=225%2C225&amp;ssl=1" width="225"/></a></p>
<p>
As of 2022, the domain for Byte redirects to an unrelated website selling <a href="https://www.byteme.com/pages/why-byte">teeth aligners</a>. That says something, no?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I just spent an hour giving Lily, my 9-year-old, a crash course on geopolitics, including WWII, the Cold War, the formation of NATO, Article 5, nuclear deterrence, economic sanctions, the breakup of the USSR, Ukraine, the Baltic Republics, and the prospects now for WWIII. Her comment at the end was that from now on she’s going to refer to Putin as “Poopin,” in the hope that that shames him into changing course.</p></div>

    <title>I will be on instagram/If you have two reals in a box- Answer (Guest Post by David Marcus)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I will be on instragram:</p><p>We,  Prof. Mohammad Hajiaghayi and Prof. William Gasarch plan to have an Instagram Live at @mhajiaghayi this SAT FEB 26, 1:30PM EDT (in English).</p><p> We talk about our lives as well as blogging, research, and how to inspire young minds. Please join if you can.</p><p>#PvsNP #blogging #youngminds #instagram</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>This is the answer to the problem posted in the last post which was a guest post by David Marcus. This post is also a guest post by him. </p><p>We restate the problem:</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>PICK THE LARGEST NUMBER:</p><p>There are two distinct reals in a box (how do they fit! aren't reals infinite!). They are called the first and second number. </p><p>You want to pick the larger one. You can pick one of the numbers at random and look at it</p><p>before deciding which one you want. </p><p>Is there a strategy that will win with probability &gt; 1/2.</p><p>CLARIFICATIONS:</p><p>1) We do not want a strategy that does well on average or in the long run. Even if the games is played just once, we want the probability of winning to be &gt; 1/2.</p><p>2) It must have prob of winning &gt; 1/2 for EVERY pair of reals.</p><p>3) Here is an example of a strategy that does NOT work: Pick the first number with prob 1/2. If its positive then keep it, else dump it. If the numbers are{1,2} this only works half the time.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>There is a strategy. In fact, we give two.</p><p><br/></p><p>STRATEGY ONE</p><p>Before looking at any number, pick a number x on your own from the reals according to a distribution with full support (every open interval has prob greater than 0). Then pick a number from the box (prob 1/2-1/2), which we call y. If x&lt;y then keep y. If y\le x then take the other number.</p><p>If x is between the two numbers, then the strategy works. If not then the strategy does not hurt, so the prob in that case is 1/2. Hence you do better than 1/2. </p><p>STRATEGY TWO</p><p>Let f: R--&gt; (0,1) be strictly increasing. Pick a number from the box, call it y. Keep it with prob f(y).</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR22-028 |  The plane test is a local tester for  Multiplicity Codes | 

	Dan Karliner, 

	Amnon Ta-Shma, 

	Roie Salama</title>
    <summary>Multiplicity codes are a generalization of RS and RM codes where for each evaluation point we output the evaluation of a low-degree polynomial  and all of its directional derivatives up  to order $s$. Multi-variate multiplicity codes are locally decodable with the natural local decoding algorithm that reads values on a random line and corrects to the closest uni-variate multiplicity code. However, it was not known whether multiplicity codes are locally testable, and this question has been posed since the introduction of these codes with no progress up to date. In fact, it has been also open whether multiplicity codes can be characterized by local constraints, i.e., if there exists a subset $B$ such that $c$ is in the code iff $c \cdot z=0$ for any $z\in B$, and,
every $z \in B$ has small Hamming weight, i.e., few non-zero symbols.

We begin by giving a simple example showing the line test does not give local characterization when $d&gt;q$. Surprisingly, 
we then show the plane test is a local characterization when $s&lt;q$ and $d&lt;qs-1$ for prime $q$. 
In addition, we show the $k$-dimensional test is a local tester for multiplicity codes, when $s &lt; q$ and $k$ is at least $\lceil \frac{d+1}{q-1} \rceil$.
Combining the two results, we show that the plane test is a local tester for multiplicity codes, with constant rejection probability for constant $s$.

Our technique is new. We represent the given input as a possibly very high-degree polynomial,  and we show that for some choice of plane,  the restriction of the polynomial to the plane is a high-degree bi-variate polynomial. The argument has to work modulo the appropriate kernels, and for that we use Grobner theory, the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz theorem and its generalization to multiplicities. Even given that, the argument is delicate and requires choosing a non-standard monomial order for the argument to work.</summary>

    <title>TR22-027 |  New Near-Linear Time Decodable Codes Closer to the GV Bound | 

	Dean Doron, 

	Guy Blanc</title>
    <summary>We construct a family of binary codes of relative distance $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ and rate $\varepsilon^{2} \cdot 2^{-\log^{\alpha}(1/\varepsilon)}$ for $\alpha \approx \frac{1}{2}$ that are decodable, probabilistically, in near linear time. This improves upon the rate of the state-of-the-art near-linear time decoding near the GV bound due to Jeronimo, Srivastava, and Tulsiani, who gave a randomized decoding of Ta-Shma codes with $\alpha \approx \frac{5}{6}$ [T17,JST21].
Each code in our family can be constructed in probabilistic polynomial time, or deterministic polynomial time given sufficiently good explicit $3$-uniform hypergraphs. 
     
Our construction is based on a new graph-based bias amplification method. While previous works start with some base code of relative distance $\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0$ for $\varepsilon_0 \gg \varepsilon$ and amplify the distance to $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ by walking on an expander, or on a carefully tailored product of expanders, we walk over very sparse, highly mixing, hypergraphs. 
Study of such hypergraphs further offers an avenue toward achieving rate $\widetilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^2)$.
For our unique- and list-decoding algorithms, we employ the framework developed in [JST21].</summary>

    <title>Let us never speak of these values again.</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1493428796539772937">Twitter quiz</a> asked “what is a powerful concept from your field that, if more people understood it, their lives would be better?” Unambiguously, the answer from my field is statistical significance. Significance testing is a confusing, obscure statistical practice. It is hard to explain and usually impossible to justify. But papers can only be published if they are “statistically significant.” Here, I’ll explain in as plain terms as I can what statistical significance means in almost every published scientific study. I’ll do this without ever defining a p-value, as p-values have nothing to do with the way significance testing is used. Instead, significance testing amounts to hand wavy arguments about precision and variability. Laying it out this way shows why the authority granted to significance testing is so suspect and unearned.</p>

<p>Let’s suppose we’re trying to evaluate the benefit of some intervention. We test the intervention on a bunch of individuals and compute the average benefit which we call the effect size. The effect size could be the number of years of life a person gains with some cancer treatment or the amount of money gained with an investment strategy.</p>

<p>Since the effect size is the <em>average</em> of all the individuals in a study some individuals will have received less benefit than average and some more than average. Combining this varied benefit with the reality that experiments are always noisy and complicated, it may very well be that even if we measure a positive benefit on average, the intervention may actually be mostly harmful to the general population.</p>

<p>Think about the hypothetical situation where on half the population the benefit is equal to 1 and on the other half it’s negative 1. In this case, the average benefit is zero. If we collected a random set of people and computed the average effect size, we’d see a positive effect size about half of the time. In other words, if your experiment was “flip a coin ten times,” you’ll see 5 or more heads about half of the times you run this experiment.</p>

<p>The experimenter’s goal is to distinguish whether the benefit is large, small, or if the intervention is actually harmful. What the paradigm of statistical significance aims to do is to find a way to determine if an intervention is “mostly good.” It goes forth like this: using statistics, you estimate the standard error (SE) of the measured effect size. Roughly speaking, the standard error measures how spread out the effect size is over a population. When the standard error is small, everyone in the population experiences the same effect from a treatment. When the standard error is large, even if the effect size is positive, some may experience negative effects and some positive.</p>

<p>If the measured effect size is greater than twice the standard error, you declare that you have discovered your intervention is statistically significant at the “p&lt;0.05” level. If the effect size is bigger than 2.6 times the standard error you declare statistical significance at the
“p&lt;0.01” level. If effect size is even bigger than three times the standard error you declare statistical significance at the “p&lt;0.003” level! Wow! There’s a Nobel Prize in your future. But if the effect size is only 1.9 times bigger than the standard error, you unfortunately have not found a statistically significant result and have to throw all your work in the trash. Unless, of course, you are an economist. In this case, you are allowed the special “p&lt;0.1” level, which occurs when the effect size is 1.7 times the standard error.</p>

<p>The following figure, adapted from a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/TAH_Sci/status/1490701257769734145">Thomas House</a>, nicely illustrates the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="Only one of these droids is signficant" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/significant.png" width="100%"/></p>

<p>Here, there are four hypothetical distributions of benefit. All but (a) are “statistically significant.” The interventions we are always striving for are ones with clear benefit, like (d) in the bottom right. Interventions like this do exist: In the Pfizer trial, the effect size was 12 times larger than the standard error. Vaccines work! But most interventions are not vaccines (or parachutes for that matter).</p>

<p>The other panels show why statistical significance alone is so problematic. Figures (a) and (b) are nearly indistinguishable plots, but one is significant and the other is not. Moreover, statistical significance also misses the forest for the trees. You can have a miniscule effect size and still have a significant effect. Do we always prefer the (c) to the (a)? Is a meager, but mostly positive benefit necessarily better than a treatment potentially of large benefit to some but harmful to others necessarily? Wouldn’t it be in our interest to understand this spread of outcomes so we could isolate the group of individuals who benefit from the treatment?</p>

<p>The fact that a mere factor of 1.5 separates the difference between “not publishable” and “undoubtedly real” is deeply concerning. And every statistician knows how estimates of standard error can be <em>very</em> sensitive. Simple approximations can make the standard error appear 1.4 times smaller, which is enough to transform an insignificant result into a significant one. This is what is commonly known as “data dredging” or “p-hacking”: trying to find the appropriate set of assumptions under which your experiment has small standard error and is hence statistically significant.</p>

<p>The precise definitions of standard error and p-value don’t illuminate the situation. Since p-values lead you to pedantry and quibbling about tiny effects, their actual definition, which is complicated and hard to even explain to other statisticians, just confuses people and doesn’t fix science. Most practicing scientists would be better off not knowing what a p-value is.</p>

<p>And a lot of the other fixes also don’t help. For example, the <a href="https://clincalc.com/Stats/FragilityIndex.aspx">fragility index</a> is often used in medicine to describe how many “non-events” have to become events for the significance to vanish. But this is just a way to conflate sample size and p-values, and isn’t getting away from the core problem that statistical significance testing is a mass waste of time.</p>

<p>I am by no means the first person to complain about the absurdity of significance testing. Some examples from the last 50 years include <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.200.7648&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Meehl</a> (1978), <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1803924">Leamer</a> (1983), <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/270939">Freedman</a> (1991), <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/308/6924/283">Altman</a> (1994), <a href="http://www.principlesofeconometrics.com/poe5/writing/kennedy.pdf">Kennedy</a> (2002), <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Ioannidis</a> (2005), <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/Instruments_of_Development.pdf">Deaton</a> (2009), <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/186351/cult_of_statistical_significance">Ziliak and McCloskey</a> (2008), and <a href="https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/asa_pvalues.pdf">Gelman</a> (2016). The significance testing framework is barely 100 years old. And people have been rightfully attacking it for nearly as long. Why do we remain so stuck?</p>

<p>The aforementioned list of grumpy people have a deeper criticism of contemporary science beyond significance testing, and this critique is one I hope to take up in future blogs. When can we trust scientific consensus and what structures and methods are necessary to build such consensus? One of the core questions is that of experimental validity. Statistical validity is a small part of the big picture that establishes the trustworthiness of a study. The study must be <em>construct valid</em>, measuring the right quantities. It must be <em>internally valid</em>, avoiding bias and confounding. And it must be <em>externally valid</em>, generalizable to other contexts. The next few blogs will try to unpack some thoughts on validity, and why validity and design remain the most pressing challenges in contemporary scientific inquiry.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-026 |  Trading Time and Space in Catalytic Branching Programs | 

	Ian Mertz, 

	James  Cook</title>
    <summary>An $m$-catalytic branching program (Girard, Koucky, McKenzie 2015) is a set of $m$ distinct branching programs for $f$ which are permitted to share internal (i.e. non-source non-sink) nodes. While originally introduced as a non-uniform analogue to catalytic space, this also gives a natural notion of amortized non-uniform space complexity for $f$, namely the smallest value $|G|/m$ for an $m$-catalytic branching program $G$ for $f$ (Potechin 2017).

Potechin (2017) showed that every function $f$ has amortized size $O(n)$, witnessed by an $m$-catalytic branching program where $m = 2^{2^n-1}$. We recreate this result by defining a catalytic algorithm for evaluating polynomials using a large amount of space but $O(n)$ time. This allows us to balance this with previously known algorithms which are efficient with respect to space at the cost of time (Cook, Mertz 2020, 2021). We show that for any $\epsilon \geq 2n^{-1}$, every function $f$ has an $m$-catalytic branching program of size $O_\epsilon(mn)$, where $m = 2^{2^{\epsilon n}}$. We similarly recreate an improved result due to Robere and Zuiddam (2021), and show that for $d \leq n$ and $\epsilon \geq 2d^{-1}$, the same result holds for $m = 2^{n \choose \leq \epsilon d}$ as long as $f$ is a degree-$d$ polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_2$. We also show that for certain classes of functions, $m$ can be reduced to $2^{poly(n)}$ while still maintaining linear or quasi-linear amortized size.

In the other direction, we bound the necessary length, and by extension the amortized size, of any permutation branching program for an arbitrary function between $3n$ and $4n-4$.</summary>

    <title>TR22-025 |  Efficient Low-Space Simulations From the Failure of the Weak Pigeonhole Principle | 

	Oliver Korten</title>
    <summary>A recurring challenge in the theory of pseudorandomness and circuit complexity is the explicit construction of ``incompressible strings,'' i.e. finite objects which lack a specific type of structure or simplicity. In most cases, there is an associated NP search problem which we call the ``compression problem,'' where we are given a candidate object and must either find a compressed/structured representation of it or determine that none exist. For a particular notion of compressibility, a natural question is whether an efficient algorithm for the compression problem would aide us in the construction of incompressible objects. Consider the following two instances of this question:

(1) Does an efficient algorithm for circuit minimization imply efficient constructions of hard truth tables?

(2) Does an efficient algorithm for factoring integers imply efficient constructions of large prime numbers?
 
In this work, we connect these kinds of questions to the long-standing challenge of proving space/time tradeoffs for Turing machines, and proving stronger separations between the RAM and 1-tape computation models. In particular, one of our main theorems shows that modest space/time tradeoffs for deterministic exponential time, or separations between basic Turing machine memory models, would imply a positive answer to both (1) and (2). 
These results apply to a more general class of explicit construction problems, where we have some efficient compression scheme that encodes $n$-bit strings using $&lt;n$ bits, and we aim to construct an $n$-bit string which cannot be recovered from its encoding.</summary>

    <title>TR22-024 |  Pseudorandomness of Expander Random Walks for Symmetric Functions and Permutation Branching Programs | 

	Louis Golowich, 

	Salil Vadhan</title>
    <summary>We study the pseudorandomness of random walks on expander graphs against tests computed by symmetric functions and permutation branching programs. These questions are motivated by applications of expander walks in the coding theory and derandomization literatures. We show that expander walks fool symmetric functions up to a $O(\lambda)$ error in total variation distance. This bound improves upon a line of prior work, which gave bounds that were weaker or applied only in more restricted cases. We extend our analysis to unify it with and strengthen the expander walk Chernoff bound. We then show that expander walks fool permutation branching programs up to a $O(\lambda)$ error in $\ell_2$-distance, and we prove that much tighter bounds hold for programs with a certain structure. We also prove lower bounds to show that our results are tight. To prove our results for symmetric functions, we analyze the Fourier coefficients of the relevant distributions using linear-algebraic techniques. Our analysis for permutation branching programs is likewise linear-algebraic in nature, but also makes use of the recently introduced singular-value approximation notion for matrices (Ahmadinejad et al. 2021).</summary>

    <title>TR22-023 |  Nisan--Wigderson generators in Proof Complexity: New lower bounds | 

	Erfan Khaniki</title>
    <summary>A map $g:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^m$ ($m&gt;n$) is a hard proof complexity generator for a proof system $P$ iff for every string $b\in\{0,1\}^m\setminus Rng(g)$, formula $\tau_b(g)$ naturally expressing $b\not\in Rng(g)$ requires superpolynomial size $P$-proofs. One of the well-studied maps in the theory of proof complexity generators is Nisan--Wigderson generator. Razborov (Annals of Mathematics 2015) conjectured that if $A$ is a suitable matrix and $f$ is a $NP\cap CoNP$ function hard-on-average for $P/poly$, then $NW_{f, A}$ is a hard proof complexity generator for Extended Frege.
 In this paper, we prove a form of Razborov's conjecture for $AC^0$-Frege. We show that for any symmetric $NP\cap CoNP$ function $f$ that is exponentially hard for depth two $AC^0$ circuits, $NW_{f,A}$ is a hard proof complexity generator for $AC^0$-Frege in a natural setting. As direct applications of this theorem, we show that:

1. For any $f$ with the specified properties, $\tau_b(NW_{f,A})$ based on a random $b$ and a random matrix $A$ with probability $1-o(1)$ is a tautology and requires superpolynomial (or even exponential) $AC^0$-Frege proofs.

2. Certain formalizations of the principle $f_n\not\in(NP\cap CoNP)/poly$ requires superpolynomial $AC^0$-Frege proofs.
        
These applications relate to two questions that were asked by Krajícek (Cambridge University Press 2019).</summary>

    <title>TR22-022 |  On Efficient Noncommutative Polynomial Factorization via Higman Linearization | 

	Vikraman Arvind, 

	Pushkar Joglekar</title>
    <summary>In this paper we study the problem of efficiently factorizing polynomials in the free noncommutative ring F  of polynomials in noncommuting variables x_1,x_2,…,x_n over the field F. We obtain the following result:

Given a noncommutative arithmetic formula of   size s computing a noncommutative polynomial f in F as input, where F=F_q is a finite field, we give a randomized algorithm that runs in time polynomial in s, n and log q that computes a factorization of the polynomial f as a product f=f_1f_2… f_r, where each f_i is an irreducible polynomial that is output as a noncommutative algebraic branching program. 

The algorithm works by first transforming f into a linear matrix L using Higman's linearization of polynomials. We then factorize the linear matrix L and recover the factorization of the polynomial f. We use basic elements from Cohn's theory of free ideals rings combined with Ronyai's randomized polynomial-time algorithm for computing invariant subspaces of a collection of matrices over finite fields.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">In a series of a few blog posts, I will present classical and non-classical results on symmetric positive definite matrices. Beyond being mathematically exciting, they arise naturally a lot in machine learning and optimization, as Hessians of twice continuously differentiable convex functions and through kernel methods. In this post, I will focus on the benefits and perils of using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loewner_order">Löwner order</a> between symmetric matrices as a tool for proving inequalities.</p>



<p class="justify-text">I will consider symmetric matrices \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) of size \(d \times d\), denoting by \(\mathcal{S}_d\) the set all such matrices. There are many characterizations of symmetric positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices: (a) non-negative eigenvalues, (b) \(x^\top A x \geqslant 0\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\), or (c) expression as a square as \(A = BB^\top\). Let’s denote this set by \(\mathcal{S}_d^+\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">A very useful tool in matrix analysis is the use of the Löwner order. It is defined as follows on \(\mathcal{S}_d\): $$ A \preccurlyeq B \Leftrightarrow B-A \in \mathcal{S}_d^+.$$ In other words, \(A\) is smaller than \(B\) if and only if \(B\, – A\) is positive semi-definite (PSD). The notation \(B \succcurlyeq A\) is defined as equivalent to \(A \preccurlyeq B\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This defines a classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory">order relation</a> which is reflexive (\(A \preccurlyeq A\) for all \(A\)), antisymmetric (for all \(A, B \in \mathcal{S}_d\), \(A \preccurlyeq B\) and \(B \preccurlyeq A\) imply \(A=B\)), and transitive (\(A \preccurlyeq B\) and \(B \preccurlyeq C\) imply \(A \preccurlyeq C\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Using operations on the Löwner order can make proofs much simpler, but it can also lead to atrocious mistakes. The main reason ends up being the lack of commutativity of the matrix product, that is, <em>in general </em>\(AB \neq BA\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Representing positive matrices through ellipsoids.</strong> Any strictly PSD matrix \(A\) defines an ellipsoid $$ \mathcal{E}_A = \big\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ x^\top A^{-1} x \leqslant 1 \big\}$$ centered at zero. The eigenvectors are the traditional principal axes of the ellipsoid and the eigenvalues the lengths of these axes. See an illustration below with \(d = 2\), and the two eigenvectors \(u_1\) and \(u_2\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6580" height="151" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ellipsoid-1.png" width="246"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The key property here is that \(\mathcal{E}_A \subset \mathcal{E}_B\) if and only if \(A \preccurlyeq B\). This representation immediately highlights that the order is partial. See examples below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6581" height="280" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ellipsoids_notaligned-1024x571.png" width="503"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, if two matrices commute, then they are jointly diagonalizable, that is, the principal axes are aligned, and once expressed in the common eigenbasis, we obtain diagonal matrices, and we then have \({\rm Diag}(\lambda)  \preccurlyeq {\rm Diag}(\mu)\) if and only if for all \(i\), \(\lambda_i \leqslant \mu_i\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Several good books are available and reading them is both enjoyable and fruitful [1, 4, 10]. Let’s now look at some properties of this Löwner order.</p>



<h2 id="fun-and-useful-facts-and-common-mistakes">Fun (and useful) facts and common mistakes</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Here I list classical properties that are constantly used in proofs using positive matrices. This is crucially used in the analysis of gradient methods for least-squares [<a href="http://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/7fe1f8abaad094e0b5cb1b01d712f708-Paper.pdf">6</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-335/16-335.pdf">7</a>], as well as in analyzing linear dynamical systems, with control or not [<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/lmibook/lmibook.pdf">8</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Direct consequence of the definition.</strong> For any \(d \times n\) matrix \(X\), and \(A,B \in \mathcal{S}_d\) such that \( A \preccurlyeq B\), $$ X^\top A X \preccurlyeq X^\top B X, $$ with the simple proof \(y^\top X^\top A X y = ( X y)^\top A ( X y) \leqslant ( X y)^\top B ( X y)  =  y^\top X^\top B X y \) for all \(y \in \mathbb{R}^n\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Another similar formulation is $$ A \preccurlyeq B \Rightarrow {\rm tr}(AM) \leqslant {\rm tr} (BM) \mbox{ for all } M \succcurlyeq 0.$$ However this <em>not</em> true if \(M\) is <em>not</em> PSD. In particular, if \(A \preccurlyeq B\) we do <em>not</em> have in general for all \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d\), \(x^\top A y \leqslant x^\top B y \), which is a common mistake.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another consequence, with \(X = B^{\, -1/2}\) the inverse of the square root of \(B\) (assuming that \(B\) is invertible), is \(A \preccurlyeq B \Rightarrow B^{\, -1/2} A B^{\, -1/2} \preccurlyeq I\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Schur complements.</strong> A very useful identity is, for any rectangular matrix \(C\): $$ CC^\top \preccurlyeq I \Leftrightarrow  C^\top C \preccurlyeq I.$$ This can be extended to (with matrices of proper sizes): $$ C B^{\, -1} C^\top \preccurlyeq A \Leftrightarrow  C^\top A^{-1} C \preccurlyeq B$$ for PSD invertible matrices \(A, B\), both properties being equivalent to $$ \bigg( \begin{array}{cc} A &amp; C \\ C^\top &amp; B \end{array} \bigg) \succcurlyeq 0.$$ This is the usual characterization of positive-definiteness of block matrices through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement">Schur complements</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Trace inequalities.</strong> If \(A \succcurlyeq 0 \) and \(B \succcurlyeq 0 \), then we have $$ 0 \leqslant {\rm tr}(AB)  \leqslant {\rm tr(A)} \lambda_{\max}(B) \leqslant {\rm tr(A)} {\rm tr}(B).$$ Moreover, still if  \(A \succcurlyeq 0 \) and \(B \succcurlyeq 0 \), $$ {\rm tr} (AB) \geqslant 0 \mbox{ with equality if and only if } AB=0.$$ This is used a lot in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming">semi-definite programming</a>, in particular for optimality conditions (see [<a href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/semidef_prog.pdf">9</a>] for details), and can be shown (for the non-trivial direction) by using an eigenvalue decomposition of \(A\) as \(A = \sum_{i=1}^d \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), writing \({\rm tr}(AB) = \sum_{i=1}^d \lambda_i u_i^\top B_i u_i\), which is a sum of non-negative terms and thus if \({\rm tr}(AB)=0\), all terms have to be equal to zero, leading exactly to the result (since \(u^\top B u =0\) is equivalent to \(Bu=0\) when \(B \succcurlyeq 0\)).</p>



<h2 id="matrix-functions">Matrix functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">One particularly elegant and efficient way of using symmetric matrices is through matrix functions. Some are based on classical linear algebra such as the matrix inverse \(A^{\, -1}\), the matrix square root \(A^{1/2}\), or any polynomial or rational functions. Many others are defined as spectral functions. That is, given a function \(f:I \to \mathbb{R}\), defined on some interval \(I\) we can define for any symmetric matrix latex \(A \in \mathbb{S}_d\) with eigenvalue decomposition \(A = \sum_{i=1}^d \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), and all eigenvalues in \(I\): $$f(A) = \sum_{i=1}^d f(\lambda_i) u_i u_i^\top.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We get the usual definition of matrix powers \(A^p\), inverse \(A^{-1}\), but also logarithm \(\log A\) for PSD matrices, exponential \(\exp(A)\), etc. When the matrix is diagonal, then we apply the function on diagonal elements $$f({\rm Diag}(\lambda)) = {\rm Diag}(f(\lambda)).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">For real numbers, a function \(f\) is non-decreasing if and only if for all \(\lambda,\mu\), $$ \lambda \leqslant \mu \Rightarrow f(\lambda) \leqslant f(\mu).$$ When \(f\) is non-decreasing, then for \(d=1\), we do have \(f(A)  \preccurlyeq  f(B)\) as soon as \(A \preccurlyeq B\). Moreover, when \(A\) and \(B\) commute, then can be <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/linmultialg/minpolyandappns.pdf">jointly diagonalized</a>, and then the property above is true for all non-decreasing functions. This is the same if we just want \({\rm tr} [ f(A) ] \leqslant {\rm tr}[f(B)]\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When does it extend to \(d&gt;1\), beyond taking the trace, and for non-commuting matrices? Functions for which $$ \forall A, B \in \mathcal{S}_d, \  A \preccurlyeq B \Rightarrow  f(A) \preccurlyeq f(B)$$ for all dimensions \(d\) are called <em>matrix-monotone</em>. Let us start with a few positive examples with simple direct proofs.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Matrix inverse.</strong> If \( A \preccurlyeq B\) and \(A\)  is invertible, then, \(B\) is invertible, and \(B^{\, -1/2} A B^{\, -1/2} \preccurlyeq I\), which is equivalent to \((A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2})^\top A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2} \preccurlyeq I\) and thus \(A^{1/2} B^{\, -1} A^{1/2} = A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2} (A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2})^\top  \preccurlyeq I\), and then \(A^{\:\! -1} \succcurlyeq B^{\, -1} \). The function \(\lambda \mapsto -\lambda^{-1}\) is thus matrix-monotone.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Matrix square root.</strong> From the paragraph above, if \( A \preccurlyeq B\) and \(A\)  is invertible, then \(\|A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2} \|_{\rm op} \leqslant 1\), thus all (potentially complex) eigenvalues of \(A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2}\) have magnitude less than one, and thus this is the same for all eigenvalues of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_similarity">similar</a> matrix \(B^{\, -1/4} ( A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2} ) B^{1/4}= B^{\, -1/4}   A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/4}\), which finally implies \(B^{\, -1/4}   A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/4} \preccurlyeq  I\), and thus \(A^{1/2} \preccurlyeq B^{1/2}\). The function \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda^{1/2}\) is thus matrix-monotone.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Matrix square.</strong> “Unfortunately” \(A \succcurlyeq B \succcurlyeq 0\) does not imply \(A^2 \succcurlyeq B^2\). This is a very common mistake! (I have made it at several occasions). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In fact, this is rarely true, indeed, if \(B = A + \Delta\), we have \(B^2 – A^2 = \Delta^2 + A \Delta + \Delta A,\) and as soon as the column space of \(\Delta\) does not contain the one of \(A\), the equality between squares is impossible. See an illustration below in two dimensions.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6602" height="294" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ellipsoid-1.gif" width="298"/>For  \(A = \frac{1}{5} \Big(\begin{array}{cc}\!  2 \! \!&amp;  \! \! 1 \! \\[-.25cm] \! 1\!\! &amp;\!\! 1 \!\end{array} \Big)\) and \(B = \frac{1}{5} \Big(\begin{array}{cc} \! 4 \!\!&amp; \!\! 1 \! \\[-.25cm] \! 1 \! \!&amp; \! \! 1 \! \end{array} \Big)\) which are such that \(0 \preccurlyeq A \preccurlyeq B\), represented by their ellipsoid, we represent \(A^p\) and \(B^p\) for various powers \(p \in [0,4]\). We have \(A^p \preccurlyeq B^p\) only for \(p \in [0,1]\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Luckily, as mentioned by my colleague <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/">Alessandro Rudi</a>, for any incorrect matrix inequality, there is a close by true inequality. Here, for example, we have that \(A \succcurlyeq  B \succcurlyeq 0\) does imply \({\rm tr}(A^2) \geqslant {\rm tr}(B^2)\) (as can be seen by from the positivity of the trace of products of PSD matrices). Moreover, there are the so-called <em>Furuta</em> <em>inequalities</em>, (see Corollary 1.18 in [4]): $$ A \succcurlyeq B \succcurlyeq 0 \Rightarrow A^2 \succcurlyeq ( AB^2A)^{1/2} \mbox{ and } (BA^2B)^{1/2} \succcurlyeq B^2, $$ which can prove useful.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Towards a characterization of matrix-monotone functions.</strong> We have seen that \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda^2\) is not matrix-monotone, while \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda^{1/2}\) and \(\lambda \mapsto -1/\lambda\) are. So what functions are matrix monotone? It turns out that there is a general answer, which is an amazing result from Löwner: he gives a precise characterization of matrix-monotone functions [<a href="http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN266833020_0038?tify={">2</a>], with a whole book [3] about it with 11 different proofs!</p>



<h2 id="positivity-of-lowner-matrices">Positivity of Löwner matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We start with a first characterization that will please the kernel enthusiasts. The question here is as follows. Given a differentiable function \(f: I \to \mathbb{R}\), and \(n\) real numbers \(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n \in I\) the domain of \(f\), when is the \(n \times n\) matrix \(L\) with values $$L_{ij} = \frac{f(\lambda_i)-f(\lambda_j)}{\lambda_i – \lambda_j} \mbox{ for } i \neq j,$$ and \(L_{ii} = f'(\lambda_i)\), always positive semi-definite? These matrices are called Löwner matrices and it turns out that the differentiable functions \(f\) for which all Löwner matrices are PSD are exactly the matrix-monotone functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To see this, we simply need to compute the derivative at \(t=0\) of the matrix-valued function \(g: [0,1] \to \mathcal{S}_d\) defined as  $$g(t) =  f(A + t(B-A)).$$ Using a former <a href="https://francisbach.com/cauchy-residue-formula/">blog post</a>, we have with the eigenvalue decomposition \(A=\sum_{i=1}^d \! \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), $$g'(0) = \sum_{i,j=1}^d \frac{f(\lambda_i)-f(\lambda_j)}{\lambda_i – \lambda_j} u_i^\top (B-A)u_j,$$ with the convention that for \(i=j\), \(\frac{f(\lambda_i)-f(\lambda_j)}{\lambda_i – \lambda_j}  = f'(\lambda_i)\). Therefore, \(g'(0) = \sum_{i,j=1}^d L_{ij}  u_i^\top (B-A)u_j\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, if \(f\) is matrix-monotone, we have \(g'(0) \geqslant 0\), and by choosing \(A = {\rm Diag}(\lambda)\) diagonal and \(B\, – A = zz^\top\) rank-one, we get \(g'(0) = \sum_{i,j=1}^d L_{ij}  z_i z_j \geqslant 0\), which leads to the positivity of \(L\) since this is true for any vector \(z \in \mathbb{R}^n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In the other direction, if \(L \succcurlyeq 0\) all Löwner matrices are PSD, then as soon as \(B-A \succcurlyeq 0\), we can then get with a similar reasoning \(g'(t) \geqslant 0\) for \(t \in [0,1]\), and thus \(f(B) = g(1) \geqslant g(0) = f(A)\), which shows monotonicity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that, like all generic results on positive-definiteness of matrices (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochner%27s_theorem">Bochner theorem</a>), this is an infinite source of “<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colle_(pr%C3%A9pa)">problèmes de colle</a>” (oral mathematical exams which are common in France).</p>



<h2 id="characterizing-all-matrix-monotone-functions">Characterizing all matrix-monotone functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">There are many different characterizations of matrix monotonicity (see [3]). I will only mention a simple intuitive result for \(I = (0,+\infty)\), with a sketch of a particularly elegant proof coming from [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0098.pdf">5</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>A family of non-negative monotone functions.</strong> As seen above, the function \(\lambda \mapsto -1/\lambda\) is matrix-monotone on \(\mathbb{R}_+^\ast\). So is \(\lambda \mapsto \frac{\lambda}{(1-t)\lambda+t}\) for any \(t \in [0,1]\). Moreover, for all \(t \in [0,1]\), these functions are non-negative on \(\mathbb{R}_+^\ast\) and the value at 1 is 1. Note that with \(t=1\), we recover \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda\), while for \(t=0\), we recover \(\lambda \mapsto 1\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Since matrix-monotonicity is a property which is invariant by taking convex combinations of functions, all functions of the form $$ \lambda \mapsto \int_{0}^{1}\frac{\lambda}{(1-t)\lambda+t}d\mu(t)$$ for a probability measure \(\mu\) on \([ 0 , 1 ]\), are also matrix-monotone, non-negative and with value 1 at 1. It turns out we cover them all! The argument is based on showing that the functions \(\lambda \mapsto \frac{\lambda}{(1-t)\lambda+t}\) are the extreme points of the of functions defined above. See details in [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0098.pdf">5</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then recover all matrix-monotone functions on \( (0,+\infty)\) by adding a constant and letting the mass of \(\mu\) be different from one (and potentially infinite). By making the change of variable \(u = t / (1-t)\), we get the representation as $$f(\lambda) = \alpha + \beta (\lambda-1) + (\lambda-1) \int_0^\infty \!\!\frac{ 1  }{\lambda + u} d\nu(u)$$ for some positive measure \(\nu\) and \(\beta&gt;0\). For example, we have: $$ \log \lambda = (\lambda-1) \int_0^{+\infty} \!\!\frac{1}{\lambda +u} \frac{du}{1+u},$$ and for \(p \in (0,1]\), $$ \lambda^p = 1 + (\lambda-1) \frac{ \sin p \pi}{\pi} \int_0^{+\infty} \!\!\frac{1}{\lambda+u} u^{p-1} du,$$ showing the matrix-monotonicity of the logarithm and of certain powers. Note that the exponential function is <em>not</em> matrix-monotone, and that the only powers \(p \neq 0\) such that \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda^p\) or \(\lambda \mapsto -\lambda^p\) are matrix-monotone are \(p \in (0,1]\) and \(p \in [-1, 0)\).</p>



<h2 id="matrix-convex-functions">Matrix-convex functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Similarly to matrix-monotone functions, matrix-convex functions are functions for which $$ \forall A, B \in \mathcal{S}_d, \forall \lambda \in [0,1], \ f( \lambda A + (1-\lambda) B) \preccurlyeq \lambda f(A) + ( 1-\lambda) f(B).$$ Like for real-valued functions, there is an intimate link between monotonicity and convexity here. Indeed, one can show that \(f\) is matrix-convex on the interval \(I\) if and only if for all \(\mu \in I\), the function \(\lambda \mapsto \frac{f(\lambda)-f(\mu)}{\lambda-\mu}\) is matrix-monotone (this is one of these cases where a natural property extends to the matrix case). Using similar arguments than for matrix-monotone functions, all functions of the form $$f(\lambda) = \gamma + \alpha (\lambda-1) + \beta (\lambda-1)^2 + (\lambda-1)^2 \int_0^\infty \!\!\frac{ 1  }{\lambda + u} d\nu(u)$$ for some positive measure \(\nu\) on \([0,+\infty)\) with finite mass, and \(\beta&gt;0\) are matrix-convex on \((0,\infty)\). They also happen to be the only ones (see, e.g., [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/9808016">11</a>]). </p>



<p class="justify-text">The classical examples are then \(f(\lambda) = \, – \log \lambda\), \(f(\lambda) = \lambda \log \lambda\), \(f(\lambda) = \lambda^p\) for \(p \in [1,2]\) and \(p \in [-1,0)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that like for monotonicity, if we just want the <em>real-valued</em> function \(A \mapsto {\rm tr} [ f(A)]\) to be convex, this is equivalent to \(f\) being convex.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond spectral functions. </strong>There are many nice matrix convex functions beyond spectral functions: for example (see [<a href="http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024379579901794/pdf?md5=45d3cff8e7f727933ea9aef11cae997c&amp;pid=1-s2.0-0024379579901794-main.pdf">12</a>]) \(A \mapsto A^{-1} \) or \(A \mapsto A^2 \). Among ones that come up naturally: $$ (A,B) \mapsto A B^{\, -1} A$$ $$ (A,B) \mapsto\  – (A^{-1} + B^{\, -1})^{-1} $$ $$ (A,B) \mapsto\  – A^{1/2} ( A^{-1/2}  B A^{-1/2} )^{1/2} A^{1/2} .$$ Add your favorite one!</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <title>Triangulation thickens grids</title>
    <summary>If you zigzag back and forth through the columns (or rows) of an ordinary two-dimensional grid graph, following a pattern dignified with the fancy name “boustrophedon”, you get a one-dimensional ordering of the vertices that can be used as the basis of a nice planar arc diagram of this graph.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If you zigzag back and forth through the columns (or rows) of an ordinary two-dimensional grid graph, following a pattern dignified with the fancy name “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon">boustrophedon</a>”, you get a one-dimensional ordering of the vertices that can be used as the basis of a nice planar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_diagram">arc diagram</a> of this graph.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Boustrophedon layout of a 2d grid" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/boustrophedon.svg" width="80%"/></p>

<p>The same idea works in 3d. You can divide a 3d grid graph into 2d layers, zigzag within each layer, and then reverse the same zigzagging order in alternating layers, to get another nice one-dimensional ordering of the vertices. It doesn’t give a planar drawing (this graph is not planar), but it does allow it to be drawn without crossings on the four half-planes of a four-page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_embedding">book embedding</a>. More generally, any \(d\)-dimensional grid graph can be drawn in the same way as a book embedding with \(2(d-1)\) pages.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Double boustrophedon layout of a 3d grid" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/double-boustrophedon.svg" width="80%"/></p>

<p>I’m a coauthor on a new preprint showing that this one-dimensional layout is very sensitive to the way you connect nearby vertices in the 3d grid. If you modify the grid just a little bit, triangulating it by adding a diagonal to each grid square, then the resulting graph no longer has a book embedding with a constant number of pages. Instead, for a triangulated \(n\times n\times n\) grid, \(\Theta(n^{1/3})\) pages are necessary (and sufficient). The preprint is “Three-dimensional graph products with unbounded stack-number”, with Robert Hickingbotham, Laura Merker, Sergey Norin, Michał T. Seweryn, and David R. Wood, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05327">arXiv:2202.05327</a>; the long coauthor list is because it comes from a collaboration that began at the Banff workshop on Graph Product Structure Theory last November.</p>

<p>There are many other related results packed into the same preprint, but rather than summarizing them all I’d rather take a step back and look at the big picture. The result that triangulated grids have high book thickness turns out to follow from a sequence of connections that is closely analogous to results about the high width of 2d grids, and I think the analogies between these connections are very interesting. For 2d grids:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two standard measures of one-dimensionality of graphs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutwidth">cutwidth</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathwidth">pathwidth</a>. Both can be defined in terms of continuous maps from the graph (considered as a one-dimensional topological space) to a line. A graph has cutwidth at most \(c\) if it has a map in which every point of the line belongs to the images of at most \(c\) edges, and pathwidth at most \(p\) if it has a map in which every point of the line belongs to the images of edges that have at most \(p\) distinct vertices as their left endpoints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a graph of maximum degree \(d\), at most \(d\) edges can share a left endpoint, so if the graph has cutwidth \(c\) it has pathwidth at least \(c/d\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A complete graph with \(n\) vertices and \(\tbinom{n}{2}\) edges, mapped continuously to a line, always has a point covered by \(\Omega(n^2)\) edges, at the median vertex of the mapping.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a 2d grid graph, we can associate each vertex with a subgraph consisting of the union of the row and column of the grid containing that vertex.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Bramble associating each grid vertex with the union of its row and column" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/grid-bramble.svg" width="50%"/></p>

    <p>This family of subgraphs is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramble_(graph_theory)">bramble</a>, meaning that all of the subgraphs are connected and touch each other. In this case, they all touch at shared vertices, but brambles also allow subgraphs to touch across edges. In the bramble for an \(n\times n\) grid graph, each graph vertex or edge belongs to \(O(n)\) subgraphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can map \(K_{n^2}\) continuously onto the grid, vertex-to-vertex, by mapping each edge of \(K_{n^2}\) onto a path through the two touching subgraphs for its endpoints. This map has low congestion: each grid vertex or edge is in the image of \(O(n)\) vertices or edges of \(K_{n^2}\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any map of the grid to a line can be composed with the map from \(K_{n^2}\) to the grid, giving a map of \(K_{n^2}\) onto the line. Because of the low congestion of the map to the grid, a point of the line that is covered by \(\Omega(n^2)\) edges of the complete graph must also be covered by \(\Omega(n)\) edges of the grid. Since this is true for all maps to a line, the grid has pathwidth and cutwidth \(\Omega(n)\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s do the same thing, stepped up a dimension!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of graphs, let’s consider 2-dimensional simplicial complexes, systems of points, edges, and triangles. And instead of mapping them to a one-dimensional line, let’s map them (topologically, not necessarily linearly) to a two-dimensional plane. We’ll say that the mapping has high thickness if some point is covered by many triangles (corresponding to cutwidth), or by many vertex-disjoint triangles (corresponding to pathwidth).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a graph of maximum  degree \(d\), at most \(\tbinom{d}{2}\) triangles can share a vertex, so a point covered by many triangles will be covered by many vertex-disjoint triangles. More importantly, this is where the book thickness comes in: an argument related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Szekeres_theorem">Erdős–Szekeres theorem</a> proves that, when a graph has a \(\theta\)-page book embedding, drawn with its vertices on a circle and its edges as chords of the circle, then at most \(\theta^3\) vertex-disjoint triangles in the graph can contain any point within the circle. So if every mapping into the plane produces a system of triangles of thickness \(t\), you also get book thickness \(\Omega(t^{1/3})\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A complete simplicial complex with \(n\) vertices, \(\tbinom{n}{2}\) edges, and \(\tbinom{n}{3}\) triangles, mapped to the plane, always leads to a point covered by \(\Omega(n^3)\) triangles, by a result of Gromov. (This is closely related to the earlier work of Regina Liu on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_depth">simplicial depth</a> but we want to allow any continuous mapping to the plane, whereas simplicial depth involves mappings that are linear on each edge and triangle.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For an \(n\times n\times n\) grid graph, with its squares triangulated to form a 2d complex \(C\), we can associate each vertex with a subcomplex of \(C\) consisting of the union of the 2d grid planes containing that vertex. This family of subcomplexes has connected pairwise unions and simply connected triplewise unions, analogous to the properties of a bramble for a graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can map the complete simplicial complex onto the grid, vertex-to-vertex, by mapping each edge onto a path through the union of two subgraphs and each triangle onto a triangulated surface within the union of three subgraphs. This map has low congestion: each grid vertex, edge, or triangle is in the image of \(O(n^2)\) vertices, edges, or triangles of the complete complex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any map of the triangulated 3d grid onto the plane can be composed with the map from the complete 2-complex to the grid, giving a map of the complete complex onto the plane. Because of the low congestion of the map to the grid, a point of the plane that is covered by \(\Omega(n^3)\) triangles of the complete complex must also be covered by \(\Omega(n)\) triangles of the triangulated grid. Since this is true for all maps to a plane, the triangulated grid has book thickness \(\Omega(n^{1/3})\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For details, generalizations to triangulated products of trees and non-grid tessellations of space, matching upper bounds on book thickness, and more, please see the preprint.</p>

Josh Allen is not appearing in today’s Super Bowl. He led the Buffalo Bills to not just one but two go-ahead touchdowns in the final 2:00 of the game at Kansas City three weeks ago, but the Bills lost both leads and KC won in overtime.</p>
<p>
Today we note an inequality that treats the real numbers like a football gridiron.</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurry-up_offense#Two-minute_drill">two-minute drill</a> is the hallmark of quarterback heroism. KC’s Patrick Mahomes, however, demonstrated the <a href="https://dailystatuss.com/13-seconds-meme-13-seconds-chief-nfl-2022/">13-second drill</a> in two plays plus a tying field goal. That is, the Bills were good for 3 quarters plus 14:47. But Mahomes is not in the Super Bowl either. Two weeks ago, he lost the magic touch in both the closing minute of the fourth quarter and the beginning of overtime as KC squandered a big lead and lost to the Cincinnati Bengals. Whose quarterback, Joe Burrow, <i>is</i> playing in today’s Super Bowl, opposite Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.</p>
<p>
The American football field is divided into 100 yards, but rarely subdivided beyond that. The announcers may refer to “a long two yards” or “a short 3,” but never 2.5 yards. It is not just the announcers. Official statistics are kept in units of whole yards, more often rounded up than down. A fourth-down quarterback plunge with 3 inches to go still counts as a 1-yard gain. Perhaps it is essential to the yard that it not be divided into dyadic or decimal units, the way the meter is. As the US celebrates an event still enjoyed by “one nation indivisible,” we note the indivisible.</p>
<p>

Godfrey Hardy, John Littlewood, George Polya are famous for many things separately and together. All three lent their names to the timeless book <a href="https://mathematicalolympiads.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/inequalities-hardy-littlewood-polya.pdf">Inequalities</a>. It codifies the theory of real inequalities. </p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> An Inequality </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We recently had reason to look at the following inequality: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If <img alt="{a^2 - b^2 = c&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E2+-+b%5E2+%3D+c%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  c \ge a+b. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++c+%5Cge+a%2Bb.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We noted that this fails in general: Let <img alt="{a=1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{b=1/4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%3D1%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then <img alt="{c=3/16}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%3D3%2F16%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  3/16 &lt; 1/2 + 1/4. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%2F16+%3C+1%2F2+%2B+1%2F4.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>This is not even close. But wait—the following lemma is true:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 1</b> <em> If <img alt="{a^2 - b^2 = c&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E2+-+b%5E2+%3D+c%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  c \ge a+b " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++c+%5Cge+a%2Bb+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
</em><p><em>provided <img alt="{a,b,c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%2Cc%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are integers. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The proof is quite simple. We note that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  c = (a-b)(a+b). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++c+%3D+%28a-b%29%28a%2Bb%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>But this shows that <img alt="{a+b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a non-zero divisor of <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. But then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  a+b \le c. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a%2Bb+%5Cle+c.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>This proves the inequality. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is this interesting at all? We have an application of the above lemma, which we will discuss in the future. Are there other good examples of inequalities that are general and natural and only hold over the integers? Or is seeking them like trying to “outsmart math itself”?</p>

<p>When, before covid, I used to travel the world giving quantum computing talks, every once in a while I’d meet an older person who asked whether I had any relation to a 1970s science writer by the name of Steve Aaronson.  So, yeah, Steve Aaronson is my dad.  He majored in English in Penn State, where he was lucky enough to study under the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tenn">Phil Klass</a>, who wrote under the pen name William Tenn and who basically created the genre of science-fiction comedy, half a century before there were any such things as <em>Futurama</em>.  After graduating, my dad became a popular physics and cosmology writer, who interviewed greats like Steven Weinberg and John Archibald Wheeler and Arno Penzias (discoverer of the cosmic microwave background radiation).  He published not only in science magazines but in <em>Playboy</em> and <em>Penthouse</em>, which (as he explained to my mom) paid better than the science magazines.  When I was growing up, my dad had a <em>Playboy</em> on his office shelf, which I might take down if for example I wanted to show a friend a 2-page article, with an Aaronson byline, about the latest thinking on the preponderance of matter over antimatter in the visible universe.</p>



<p>Eventually, partly motivated by the need to make money to support … well, me, and then my brother, my dad left freelancing to become a corporate science writer at AT&amp;T Bell Labs.  There, my dad wrote speeches, delivered on the floor of Congress, about how breaking up AT&amp;T’s monopoly would devastate Bell Labs, a place that stood with ancient Alexandria and Cambridge University among the human species’ most irreplaceable engines of scientific creativity.  (Being a good writer, my dad didn’t put it in <em>quite</em> those words.)  Eventually, of course, AT&amp;T <em>was</em> broken up, and my dad’s dire warning about Bell Labs turned out to be 100% vindicated … although on the positive side, Americans got much cheaper long distance.</p>



<p>After a decade at Bell Labs, my dad was promoted to be a public relations executive at AT&amp;T itself, where when I was a teenager, he was centrally involved in the launch of the AT&amp;T spinoff <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent">Lucent Technologies</a> (motto: “Bell Labs Innovations”), and then later the Lucent spinoff <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaya">Avaya</a>—developments that AT&amp;T’s original breakup had caused as downstream effects.</p>



<p>In the 1970s, somewhere between his magazine stage and his Bell Labs stage, my dad also worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Garfield">Eugene Garfield</a>, the pioneer of bibliometrics for scientific papers and founder of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Scientific_Information">Institute for Scientific Information</a>, or ISI.  (Sergey Brin and Larry Page would later cite Garfield’s work, on the statistics of the scientific-citation graph, as one of the precedents for the PageRank algorithm at the core of Google.)</p>



<p>My dad’s job at ISI was to supply Eugene Garfield with “raw material” for essays, which the latter would then write and publish in ISI’s journal <em>Current Contents</em> under the byline Eugene Garfield.  Once, though, my dad supplied some “raw material” for a planned essay about “Style in Scientific Writing”—and, well, I’ll let Garfield <a href="http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v3p004y1977-78.pdf">tell</a> the rest:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This topic of style in scientific writing was first proposed as something I should undertake myself, with some research and drafting help from Steve.  I couldn’t, with a clear conscience, have put my name to the “draft” he submitted.  And, though I don’t disagree with much of it, I didn’t want to modify or edit it in order to justify claiming it as my own.  So here is Aaronson’s “draft,” as it was submitted for “review.”  You can say I got a week’s vacation.  After reading what he wrote it required little work to write this introduction.</p></blockquote>



<p>Interested yet?  You can <a href="http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v3p004y1977-78.pdf">read “Style in Scientific Writing” here</a>.  You can, if we’re being honest, tell that this piece was originally intended as “raw material”—but only because of the way it calls forth such a fierce armada of all of history’s awesomest quotations about what makes scientific writing good or bad, like Ben Franklin and William James and the whole gang, which would make it worth the read regardless.  I <em>love</em> eating raw dough, I confess, and I love my dad’s essay.  (My dad, ironically enough, likes everything he eats to be thoroughly cooked.)</p>



<p>When I read that essay, I hear my dad’s voice from my childhood.  “Omit needless words.”  There were countless revisions and pieces of advice on every single thing I wrote, but usually, “omit needless words” was the core of it.  And as terrible as you all know me to be on that count, imagine <em>how much worse</em> it would’ve been if not for my dad!  And I know that as soon as he reads this post, he’ll find needless words to omit.</p>



<p>But hopefully he won’t omit these:</p>



<p>Happy 70th birthday Pops, congrats on beating the cancer, and here’s to many more!</p></div>

Taher Elgamal and Anna Karlin are among 111 <a href="https://www.nae.edu/270224/National-Academy-of-Engineering-Elects-111-Members-and-22-International-Members">new US members</a> of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE). That’s one-hundred-and-eleven, not seven in binary.</p>
<p>
Today we congratulate them and all the new members.<br/>
<span id="more-19636"/></p>
<p>
Elgamal and Karlin are the two closest to theory, by my reckoning. Elgamal developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption">ElGamal</a> encryption scheme. Elgamal spelled his name with a capital G at the time of his famous 1985 <a href="https://caislab.kaist.ac.kr/lecture/2010/spring/cs548/basic/B02.pdf">paper</a> but it is lowercased on his own LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taherelgamal/">page</a>, on Wikipedia, on his RSA conference <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/experts/dr-taherelgamal">page</a>, and by the NAE. Wikipedia explains that he spells it more simply so that “it is less likely to be mangled in English.” Yet his invention keeps the capital G. Ken and I think a good reason for this is that it uses a large cyclic group <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The citation also hails his work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0,_2.0,_and_3.0">SSL</a> and other internet protocols.</p>
<p>
We featured Karlin’s nifty joint paper on the metric TSP problem recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/10/26/a-vast-and-tiny-breakthrough/">here</a>. She is also on the editorial board of the new TheoretiCS <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/01/the-new-journal/">journal</a>. I was glad to serve with her on an NSF committee to promote <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/07/12/time-chunks-and-theory-nuggets/">nuggets</a> of theory. She holds the Bill and Melinda Gates Chair at the Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>
The new members bring the total US membership in the NAE to 2,388. Joining them are 22 new international members. They include Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata Sons for advancing the Indian software industry and Hongjiang Zhang of The Carlyle Group in Beijing for multimedia computing. </p>

<p/><p>
We count 8 women of the 20 above: Bergeron, Croak, Czerwinski, Karlin, Nahrstedt, Veloso, Whitney, and Willcox. That’s quite a lot better than other rations we’ve observed. How can awareness of this success be filtered through? We also note Anna’s <a href="https://medium.com/@karlin_41004/why-women-and-everyone-else-should-code-18e4a0a46a47">essay</a>, “Why Women (and Everyone Else) Should Code.”</p>
