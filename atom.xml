sequencing of billions of short DNA fragments at high throughput, paving the
way for population-scale genomics. Genomics data analytics at this scale
requires overcoming performance bottlenecks, such as searching for short DNA
sequences over long reference sequences. In this paper, we introduce LISA
(Learned Indexes for Sequence Analysis), a novel learning-based approach to DNA
sequence search. As a first proof of concept, we focus on accelerating one of
the most essential flavors of the problem, called exact search. LISA builds on
and extends FM-index, which is the state-of-the-art technique widely deployed
in genomics tool-chains. Initial experiments with human genome datasets
indicate that LISA achieves up to a factor of 4X performance speedup against
its traditional counterpart.

high-throughput technologies are giving rise to an exponential growth in the
size of nucleotide sequence databases. Moreover, many emerging applications of
nucleotide datasets -- as those related to personalized medicine -- require the
compliance with regulations about the storage and processing of sensitive data.
We have designed and carefully engineered E2FM-index, a new full-text index in
minute space which was optimized for compressing and encrypting nucleotide
sequence collections in FASTA format and for performing fast pattern-search
queries. E2FM-index allows to build self-indexes which occupy till to 1/20 of
the storage required by the input FASTA file, thus permitting to save about 95%
of storage when indexing collections of highly similar sequences; moreover, it
can exactly search the built indexes for patterns in times ranging from few
milliseconds to a few hundreds milliseconds, depending on pattern length.

Bioinformatics Online and https://figshare.com/s/6246ee9c1bd730a8bf6e.

    <title>Succinct Population Protocols for Presburger Arithmetic</title>

predicates definable in Presburger arithmetic (PA), the first-order theory of
addition. As part of this result, they presented a procedure that translates
any formula $\varphi$ of quantifier-free PA with remainder predicates (which
has the same expressive power as full PA) into a population protocol with
$2^{O(\text{poly}(|\varphi|))}$ states that computes $\varphi$. More precisely,
the number of states of the protocol is exponential in both the bit length of
the largest coefficient in the formula, and the number of nodes of its syntax
tree.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove that every formula $\varphi$ of quantifier-free PA
with remainder predicates is computable by a leaderless population protocol
with $O(\text{poly}(|\varphi|))$ states. Our result shows that, contrary to the
case of time complexity, where protocols with leaders can be exponentially
faster than leaderless protocols, protocols with and without leaders have both
polynomial state complexity.
</p>
<p>Our proof is based on several new constructions, which may be of independent
interest. Given a formula $\varphi$ of quantifier-free PA with remainder
predicates, a first construction produces a succinct protocol (with
$O(|\varphi|^3)$ leaders) that computes $\varphi$; this completes the work
initiated in [STACS'18], where we constructed such protocols for a fragment of
PA. For large enough inputs, we can get rid of these leaders. If the input is
not large enough, then it is small, and we design another construction
producing a succinct protocol with one leader that computes $\varphi$. Our last
construction gets rid of this leader for small inputs.

are in $k (k\geq 2)$ different groups, or communities, and edges are only
allowed between vertices in distinct groups. The observation is the weighted
adjacency matrix, perturbed by a Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), or
Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) matrix. Different from the standard symmetric
$\ZZ_2$-synchronization in which there are 2 communities with equal number of
vertices, we do not assume that the number of vertices in each group is the
same. For the exact recovery of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with
various weighted adjacency matrix, we prove a sharp phase transition result
with respect to the intensity $\sigma$ of the Gaussian perturbation. These
weighted adjacency matrices may be considered as natural models for the
electric network. Surprisingly, the threshold, or critical value, of $\sigma$
does not depend on whether or not the sample space for MLE is restricted to the
classifications such that the number of vertices in each group is the same as
the true value. In contrast to the well-studied $\ZZ_2$-sychronization, a new
complex version of the semi-definite programming (SDP) is designed to
efficiently implement the community detection problem when the number of
communities $k$ is greater than 2, and a common region for $\sigma$ such that
SDP exactly recovers the true classification is obtained, which is independent
of $k$.

minimum cuts of undirected surface-embedded graphs. Given an edge-weighted
undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices embedded on an orientable surface of
genus $g$, our algorithms can solve either problem in $g^{O(g)} n \log \log n$
or $2^{O(g)} n \log n$ time, whichever is better. When $g$ is a constant, our
$g^{O(g)} n \log \log n$ time algorithms match the best running times known for
computing minimum cuts in planar graphs.
</p>
<p>Our algorithms for minimum cuts rely on reductions to the problem of finding
a minimum-weight subgraph in a given $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology class, and we give
efficient algorithms for this latter problem as well. If $G$ is embedded on a
surface with $b$ boundary components, these algorithms run in $(g + b)^{O(g +
b)} n \log \log n$ and $2^{O(g + b)} n \log n$ time. We also prove that finding
a minimum-weight subgraph homologous to a single input cycle is NP-hard,
showing it is likely impossible to improve upon the exponential dependencies on
$g$ for this latter problem.

$p(u)+p(v)$ is at least $w(uv)$ contain some $s$-$t$-path, and minimize the sum
of assigned powers. In the Minimum Barrier Shrinkage problem, we are given a
family of disks in the plane and two points $x$ and $y$ lying outside the

networks where the sensors receive information continuously and can store an
infinite amount of information. Their paper proposed two models---the
combinatorial mobile sensor network (CMSN) where each time exactly two sensors
communicate, and the geometric mobile sensor network (GMSN) where the sensors
move in constant velocities on a line---and a way to measure the capacity of a
network to diffuse information. We found the maximum and minimum capacities of
GMSNs, a restricted form of CMSN (RCMSN) where every two sensors communicate
exactly once, and restricted GMSNs (RGMSNs) where there is only a limited
number of distinct speeds of sensors. We also found the expected capacity of
GMSNs and RGMSNs with no more than three different velocities. Finally, we
found that the problem of determining if an RCMSN is equivalent to a GMSN is
NP-Hard, but whether a CMSN is equivalent to an RGMSN with a given number of
distinct velocities can be determined in polynomial time.

    <title>William Kruskal's 100th birthday</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today, Oct 10, 2019 is William Kruskal's 100th birthday (he's dead, so no cake. Oh well.) William Kruskal was a great statistician. To honor him we have a guest post by his nephew Clyde Kruskal. We also note that the Kruskal Family is one of the top two math families of all time (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/02/baseball-families-and-math-families.html">here</a>). William is a reason why the other two Kruskal brothers went into mathematics: As a much older sibling (6 years older than Martin and 8 years older than Joseph), he encouraged their early mathematical development. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some pictures of William Kruskal and of the Kruskal Family: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/billk1.pdf">here</a><br/>
<br/>
<b>Guest Post by Clyde Kruskal<br/>
</b><br/>
<br/>
I was asked to blog about my uncle, the statistician, William H. Kruskal, on the centennial of his birth. We called him Uncle Bill. He is best known for co-inventing the Kruskal-Wallis test.<br/>
<br/>
There are two stories that I know about Bill's childhood, which must have been family lore:<br/>
<br/>
(1) As a young child, Bill was a prolific reader. His reading comprehension outstripped his conversational English. One morning, having just read the word ``schedule'' in a book, and obviously having never heard it pronounced, he sat down to breakfast and asked:<br/>
"What is the ske·D<span style="text-decoration: overline;">U</span>·l<span style="text-decoration: overline;">e</span> for today?"<br/>
<br/>
(2) My grandparents once had Bill take an occupational assessment test. The tester said that Bill was a very bright child, and should become a traffic engineer to solve  the problems with traffic congestion. (This would have been the 1920s!)  As you probably know, Uncle Bill did not succeed in ending traffic congestion. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Recently there has been a controversy over whether to ask about citizenship in the 2020 census.  In the late 1900s there was a different  controversy: whether to adjust the known undercount statistically.  In general, Democrats wanted to adjust the count and Republicans did not (presumably because Democratic states tended to have a larger undercount). A national committee was set up to study the issue, with four statisticians in favor and four against.  I was surprised  to learn that Uncle Bill was on the commission as one of those against adjustment, since, I thought his political views were more closely aligned with those of the Democrats.  He was very principled, basing his views only on statistical arguments.  I saw him give a talk on the subject, which seemed quite convincing  (but, then again, I did not see the other side).  They ended up not adjusting. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For more on William Kruskal, in general, and his view on adjusting the census, in particular, see the pointers at the end of this post.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have more to say. I just hope that I am on the  ske·D<span style="text-decoration: overline;">U</span>·l<span style="text-decoration: overline;">e</span> to blog about Uncle Bill at the bicentennial of his birth.<br/>

Maximization (IM), has received a lot of attentions recently due to its
commercial values. Previous approximation algorithms for this problem required
a large number of samples to ensure approximate guarantee. In this paper, we
propose an efficient approximation algorithm which uses fewer samples but
provides the same theoretical guarantees based on generating and using
important samples in its operation. Experiments on real social networks show
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm which
provides the same approximation ratio in terms of the number of required
samples and running time.

    <title>Scalable Nearest Neighbor Search for Optimal Transport</title>

Wasserstein) distance is an increasingly
popular similarity measure for rich data domains, such as images or text
documents. This raises the necessity for fast nearest neighbor search with
respect to this distance, a problem that poses a substantial computational
bottleneck for various tasks on massive datasets.
</p>
<p>In this work, we study fast tree-based approximation algorithms for searching
nearest neighbors w.r.t. the Wasserstein-1 distance. A standard tree-based
technique, known as Quadtree, has been previously shown to obtain good results.
We introduce a variant of this algorithm, called Flowtree, and formally prove
it achieves asymptotically better accuracy. Our extensive experiments, on
real-world text and image datasets, show that Flowtree improves over various
baselines and existing methods in either running time or accuracy. In
particular, its quality of approximation is in line with previous high-accuracy
methods, while its running time is much faster.

    <title>The Impacts of Dimensionality, Diffusion, and Directedness on Intrinsic Universality in the abstract Tile Assembly Model</title>

self-assembling tiles and the impacts that three diverse properties have on
their dynamics. We expand upon a series of prior results which showed that (1)
the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) is intrinsically universal (IU) [FOCS
2012], and (2) the class of directed aTAM systems is not IU [FOCS 2016]. IU for
a model (or class of systems within a model) means that there is a universal
tile set which can be used to simulate an arbitrary system within that model
(or class). Furthermore, the simulation must not only produce the same
resultant structures, it must also maintain the full dynamics of the systems
being simulated modulo only a scale factor. While the FOCS 2012 result showed
the standard, two-dimensional (2D) aTAM is IU, here we show this is also the
case for the 3D version. Conversely, the FOCS 2016 result showed the class of
aTAM systems which are directed (a.k.a. deterministic, or confluent) is not IU,
implying that nondeterminism is fundamentally required for such simulations.
Here, however, we show that in 3D the class of directed aTAM systems is
actually IU, i.e. there is a universal directed simulator for them. We then
consider the influence of more rigid notions of dimensionality. Namely, we
introduce the Planar aTAM, where tiles are not only restricted to binding in
the plane, but also to traveling in the plane, and prove that the Planar aTAM
is not IU, and that the class of directed systems within the Planar aTAM also
is not IU. Finally, analogous to the Planar aTAM, we introduce the Spatial
aTAM, its 3D counterpart, and prove that it is IU.
</p>
<p>To prove our positive results we have not only designed, but also implemented
what we believe to be the first IU tile set ever implemented and simulated in
any tile assembly model. We've made it and a simulator which can demonstrate it
freely available.

geodesic triangles defining overall eighteen interior angles. In general, the
interior angles of geodesic triangles can sum up to $\pi$ like in
Euclidean/Mahalanobis geometry, or exhibit either angle excesses or angle
defects. In this paper, we initiate the study of geodesic triangles in dually
flat spaces where a generalized Pythagorean theorem holds. First, we show when
it is possible how to construct geodesic triangles which either have one, two,
or three interior right angles. Then we report a construction of triples of
points for which the dual Pythagorean theorems hold simultaneously at a point,
yielding two dual pairs of dual geodesic triangles with doubly right angles.

for airfare or a product sold by a large online retailer. Given distributional
information about what price they might face each day, how should they choose
when to purchase in order to maximize the likelihood of getting the best price
in retrospect? This is related to the classical secretary problem, but with
values drawn from known distributions. In their pioneering work, Gilbert and
Mosteller [\textit{J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 1966}] showed that when the values
are drawn i.i.d., there is a thresholding algorithm that selects the best value
with probability approximately $0.5801$. However, the more general problem with
non-identical distributions has remained unsolved.
</p>
<p>In this paper we provide an algorithm for the case of non-identical
distributions that selects the maximum element with probability $1/e$, and we
show that this is tight. We further show that if the observations arrive in a
random order, this barrier of $1/e$ can be broken using a static threshold
algorithm, and we show that our success probability is the best possible for
any single-threshold algorithm under random observation order. Moreover, we
prove that one can achieve a strictly better success probability using more
general multi-threshold algorithms, unlike the non-random-order case. Along the
way, we show that the best achievable success probability for the random-order
case matches that of the i.i.d.\ case, which is approximately $0.5801$, under a
"no-superstars" condition that no single distribution is very likely ex ante to
generate the maximum value. We also extend our results to the problem of
selecting one of the $k$ best values.

For these class of schemes, the best known lower bound is m^{1/2} due to Alon
and Feige [SODA 2009]. Recently, it was proved by Kesh [FSTTCS 2018] that
two-bitprobe adaptive schemes storing three elements will take at least m^{2/3}
space, which also puts a lower bound on schemes storing five elements. In this
work, we have improved the lower bound to m^{3/4}. We also present a scheme for
the same that takes O(m^{5/6}) space. This improves upon the
O(m^{18/19})-scheme due to Garg [Ph.D. Thesis] and the O(m^{10/11})-scheme due
to Baig et al. [WALCOM 2019].

dense structures (i.e., groups of vertices that exhibit a large number of
links), together with their temporal span (i.e., the period of time for which
the high density holds). In this paper we tackle this task by introducing a
notion of temporal core decomposition where each core is associated with two
quantities, its coreness, which quantifies how densely it is connected, and its
span, which is a temporal interval: we call such cores span-cores. For a
temporal network defined on a discrete temporal domain $T$, the total number of
time intervals included in $T$ is quadratic in $|T|$, so that the total number
of span-cores is potentially quadratic in $|T|$ as well. Our first main
contribution is an algorithm that, by exploiting containment properties among
span-cores, computes all the span-cores efficiently. Then, we focus on the
problem of finding only the maximal span-cores, i.e., span-cores that are not
dominated by any other span-core by both their coreness property and their
span. We devise a very efficient algorithm that exploits theoretical findings
on the maximality condition to directly extract the maximal ones without
computing all span-cores. Finally, we introduce the problem of temporal
community search, where a set of query vertices is given as input, and the goal
is to find a set of densely-connected subgraphs containing the query vertices
and covering the whole underlying temporal domain $T$. We derive a connection
between this problem and the problem of finding (maximal) span-cores. Based on
this connection, we show how temporal community search can be solved in
polynomial-time via dynamic programming, and how the maximal span-cores can be
profitably exploited to significantly speed-up the basic algorithm.

solve single-query shortest path planning problems. Each agent first builds a
representation of its own search space of the common environment as a
multi-resolution graph, it communicates with the other agents the result of its
local search, and it uses received information from other agents to refine its
own graph and update the local inconsistency conditions. As a result, all
agents attain a common subgraph that includes a provably optimal path in the
most informative graph available among all agents, if one exists, without
necessarily communicating the entire graph. We prove the completeness and
optimality of the proposed algorithm, and present numerical results supporting
the advantages of the proposed approach.

first $k$ stacks can only contain elements in decreasing order from top to
bottom, while the last one has the opposite restriction. This device
generalizes \cite{SM}, which studies the case $k=1$. Here we show that, for
$k=2$, the set of sortable permutations is a class with infinite basis, by
explicitly finding an antichain of minimal nonsortable permutations. This
construction can easily be adapted to each $k \ge 3$. Next we describe an
optimal sorting algorithm, again for the case $k=2$. We then analyze two types
of left-greedy sorting procedures, obtaining complete results in one case and
only some partial results in the other one. We close the paper by discussing a
few open questions.

    <title>TR19-139 |  Direct sum testing - the general case | 

	Irit Dinur, 

	Konstantin Golubev</title>
    <summary>A function f:[n_1] x ... x [n_d]--&gt;F  is a direct sum if it is of the form f(a_1,...,a_d) = f_1(a_1) + ... + f_d (a_d)  (mod 2) for some d functions f_i:[n_i]--&gt;F_i for all i=1,...,d. We present a 4-query test which distinguishes between direct sums and functions that are far from them. The test relies on the BLR linearity test (Blum, Luby, Rubinfeld, 1993) and on an agreement test which slightly generalizes the direct product test.

In multiplicative {+1,-1} notation, our result reads as follows. A d-dimensional tensor with {+1,-1} entries is called a tensor product if it is a tensor product of d vectors with {+1,-1} entries, or equivalently, if it is of rank 1. The presented tests can be read as tests for distinguishing between tensor products and tensors that are far from being tensor products.

We also present a different test, which queries the function at most (d+2) times, but is easier to analyze.</summary>

    <title>Drawing clustered graphs of bounded width</title>
    <summary>In a paper from last year on clustered planarity, with Giordano Da Lozzo, Mike Goodrich, and Sid Gupta, we provided subexponential-time algorithms for arbitrary instances, and fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for instances whose embedded width and number of clusters are both bounded.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/03/16/drawing-clustered-graphs.html">a paper from last year</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustered_planarity">clustered planarity</a>, with Giordano Da Lozzo, Mike Goodrich, and Sid Gupta, we provided subexponential-time algorithms for arbitrary instances, and fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for instances whose embedded width and number of clusters are both bounded.</p>

<p>Now, in my newest preprint, “C-planarity testing of embedded clustered graphs with bounded dual carving-width” (with the same authors, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02057">arXiv:1910.02057</a>), we’ve eliminated the dependence on the number of clusters (using a different width parameter) and found a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with just a single parameter.</p>

<p>It was just in time: while our paper was in submission, last July, Rado Fulek and Csaba Tóth put up their own preprint, “Atomic embeddability, clustered planarity, and thickenability” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13086">arXiv:1907.13086</a>) announcing a solution to the clustered planarity problem in polynomial time without dependence on parameters. I <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102537368093048271">posted about it briefly at the time</a>, and can’t find much else more recent about it, but I assume it’s in submission to somewhere good. So our results may be only of historic value…</p>

<p>Our paper was presented at IPEC 2019 (part of the <a href="http://algo2019.ak.in.tum.de/">ALGO 2019 conference in Munich</a>) last month, and won IPEC best paper award. The late timing of the preprint is because (somewhat unusually for a CS conference) IPEC makes their proceedings versions due after the conference rather than before, so they can take into account feedback from the conference.
The arXiv version is more complete than the proceedings version will be, because of page limits in the proceedings, but we prepared it at the same time.</p>

    <title>What comes first theory or practice? Its Complicated!</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having majored in pure math I had the impression that usually the theory comes first and then someone works out something to work in practice. While this is true sometimes it is often NOT true and this will not surprise any of my blog readers.  Even so, I want to tell you about some times it surprised me. This says more about my ignorance than about math or applications or whatnot.<br/>
<br/>
1) Quantum<br/>
<br/>
a) Factoring was proven to be in BQP way before actual quantum computers could do this in reasonable time (we're still waiting).<br/>
<br/>
b) Quantum Crypto- This really is out there. I do not know what came first, the theory or the practice. Or if they were in tandem.<br/>
<br/>
c) (this one is the inspiration for the post)  When I first heard the term <i>Quantum Supremacy</i> I thought it meant the desire for a THEOREM that problem A is in BQP but is provably not in P.  For example, if someone proved factoring is not in P (unlikely this will be proven, and hey- maybe  factoring is in P). Perhaps some contrived problem like those constructed by diagonalization (my spell checker thinks that's not a word. Having worked in computability theory, I think it is. Darn- my spellchecker thinks computability is not word.) Hence when I heard that Google had a paper proving Quantum Supremacy (I do not recall if I actually heard the word  <i>proven) </i>I assumed that there was some <i>theoretical </i>breakthrough. I was surprised and not in the slightest disappointed to find out it involved actual quantum computers.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Question</b>: When the term <i>Quantum Supremacy</i> was first coined, did they mean theoretical, or IRL, or both?<br/>
<br/>
2) Ramsey Theory<br/>
<br/>
a) For Ramsey's Theorem and Van Der waerden's theorem and Rado's theorem and others I could name, first a theorem showed a upper bound on a number, then later computers and perhaps some math got better bounds on that number.<br/>
<br/>
b) Consider the following statement:<br/>
<br/>
For all c there exists P such that for all c-colorings of {1,...,P} there exists x,y,z the same color such that x<sup>2</sup> +y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>2</sup>.<br/>
<br/>
Ronald Graham conjectured the c=2 case and offered $100 in the 1980's. (I do not know if he had any comment on the general case.)  I assumed that it would be proven with ginormous bounds on the P(c) function, and then perhaps some reasonable bound would be found by clever programming and some math. (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem">here</a> for the Wikipedia Entry about the problem, which also has pointers to other material).<br/>
<br/>
Instead the c=2 case was proven with an exact bound, P(2)=7825, by a computer program, in 2016. The proof is 200 terabytes. So my prediction was incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
As for the result<br/>
<br/>
PRO: We know the result is true for c=2 and we even know the exact bound. Wow! and for Ramsey Theory its unusual to have exact bounds!<br/>
<br/>
CON: It would be good to have a human-readable proof. This is NOT an anti-technology statement. For one thing, a human-readable proof might help us get the result for c=3 and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
3) This item is a cheat in that I knew the empirical results first. However, I will tell you what I am sure I would have thought (and been wrong) had I not know them.<br/>
<br/>
Given k, does the equation<br/>

for which k it has a solution (with a proof that does not give the actual solutions)  and for then a computer programs would try to find the solutions. Instead (1) some values of k are ruled out by simple mod considerations, and (2) as for the rest, computers have found solutions for some of them.

Lipton-Regan also comment on the more recent k=42 case.<br/>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A couple weeks ago I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rationalists-Artificial-Intelligence-Geeks-World/dp/1474608779/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">The AI Does Not Hate You: Superintelligence, Rationality, and the Race to Save the World</a>, the first-ever book-length examination of the modern <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement">rationalist community</a>, by British journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/TomChivers?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Tom Chivers</a>.  I was planning to review it here, before it got preempted by the news of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">quantum supremacy</a> (and subsequent news of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342">classical non-supremacy</a>).  Now I can get back to rationalists.</p>



<p>Briefly, I think the book is a triumph.  It’s based around in-person conversations with many of the notable figures in and around the rationalist community, in its Bay Area epicenter and beyond (although apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> only agreed to answer technical questions by Skype), together of course with the voluminous material available online.  There’s a good deal about the 1990s origins of the community that I hadn’t previously known.</p>



<p>The title is taken from Eliezer’s aphorism, “The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made of atoms which it can use for something else.”  In other words: as soon as anyone succeeds in building a superhuman AI, if we don’t take extreme care that the AI’s values are “aligned” with human ones, the AI might be expected to obliterate humans almost instantly as a byproduct of pursuing whatever it <em>does</em> value, more-or-less as we humans did with woolly mammoths, moas, and now gorillas, rhinos, and thousands of other species.</p>



<p>Much of the book relates Chivers’s personal quest to figure out how seriously he should take this scenario.  Are the rationalists just an unusually nerdy doomsday cult?  Is there some non-negligible chance that they’re actually right about the AI thing?  If so, how much more time do we have—and is there even anything meaningful that can be done today?  Do the dramatic advances in machine learning over the past decade change the outlook?  Should Chivers be worried about his own two children?  How does this risk compare to the more “prosaic” civilizational risks, like climate change or nuclear war?  I suspect that Chivers’s exploration will be most interesting to readers who, like me, regard the answers to <em>none</em> of these questions as obvious.</p>



<p>While it sounds extremely basic, what makes <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> so valuable to my mind is that, as far as I know, it’s nearly the only examination of the rationalists ever written by an outsider that tries to assess the ideas on a scale from true to false, rather than from quirky to offensive.  Chivers’s own training in academic philosophy seems to have been crucial here.  He’s not put off by people who act weirdly around him, even needlessly cold or aloof, nor by utilitarian thought experiments involving death or torture or weighing the value of human lives.  He just cares, relentlessly, about the ideas—and about remaining a basically grounded and decent person while engaging them.  Most strikingly, Chivers clearly feels a need—anachronistic though it seems in 2019—actually to <em>understand</em> complicated arguments, be able to repeat them back correctly, before he attacks them.</p>



<p>Indeed, far from failing to understand the rationalists, it occurs to me that the central criticism of Chivers’s book is likely to be just the opposite: he understands the rationalists so well, extends them so much sympathy, and ends up endorsing so many aspects of their worldview, that he must simply <em>be</em> a closet rationalist himself, and therefore can’t write about them with any pretense of journalistic or anthropological detachment.  For my part, I’d say: it’s true that <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> is what you get if you treat rationalists as extremely smart (if unusual) people from whom you might learn something of consequence, rather than as monkeys in a zoo.  On the other hand, Chivers does perform the journalist’s task of constantly challenging the rationalists he meets, often with points that (if upheld) would be fatal to their worldview.  One of the rationalists’ best features—and this precisely matches my own experience—is that, far from clamming up or storming off when faced with such challenges (“lo! the visitor is not one of us!”), the rationalists positively relish them.</p>



<p>It occurred to me the other day that we’ll never know how the rationalists’ ideas would’ve developed, had they continued to do so in a cultural background like that of the late 20th century.  As Chivers points out, the rationalists today are effectively caught in the crossfire of a much larger cultural war—between, to their right, the recrudescent know-nothing authoritarians, and to their left, what one could variously describe as woke culture, call-out culture, or sneer culture.  On its face, it might seem laughable to conflate the rationalists with today’s resurgent fascists: many rationalists are driven by their utilitarianism to advocate open borders and massive aid to the Third World; the rationalist community is about as welcoming of alternative genders and sexualities as it’s humanly possible to be; and leading rationalists like Scott Alexander and Eliezer Yudkowsky strongly condemned Trump for the obvious reasons. </p>



<p>Chivers, however, explains how the problem started.  On rationalist Internet forums, many misogynists and white nationalists and so forth encountered nerds willing to <em>debate their ideas politely</em>, rather than immediately banning them as more mainstream venues would.  As a result, many of those forces of darkness (and they probably don’t mind being called that) predictably congregated on the rationalist forums, and their stench predictably wore off on the rationalists themselves.  Furthermore, this isn’t an easy-to-fix problem, because debating ideas on their merits, extending charity to ideological opponents, etc. is sort of the rationalists’ <em>entire shtick</em>, whereas denouncing and no-platforming anyone who can be connected to an ideological enemy (in the modern parlance, “punching Nazis”) is the entire shtick of those condemning the rationalists.</p>



<p>Compounding the problem is that, as anyone who’s ever hung out with STEM nerds might’ve guessed, the rationalist community tends to skew WASP, Asian, or Jewish, non-impoverished, and male.  Worse yet, while many rationalists live their lives in progressive enclaves and strongly support progressive values, they’ll also undergo extreme anguish if they feel forced to subordinate truth to those values.</p>



<p>Chivers writes that all of these issues “blew up in spectacular style at the end of 2014,” right here on this blog.  Oh, what the hell, I’ll just quote him:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Scott Aaronson is, I think it’s fair to say, a member of the Rationalist community.  He’s a prominent theoretical computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, and writes a very interesting, maths-heavy blog called Shtetl-Optimised.</p><p>People in the comments under his blog were discussing feminism and sexual harassment.  And Aaronson, in a comment in which he described himself as a fan of Andrea Dworkin, described having been terrified of speaking to women as a teenager and young man.  This fear was, he said, partly that of being thought of as a sexual abuser or creep if any woman ever became aware that he sexually desired them, a fear that he picked up from sexual-harassment-prevention workshops at his university and from reading feminist literature.  This fear became so overwhelming, he said in the comment that came to be known as Comment #171, that he had ‘constant suicidal thoughts’ and at one point ‘actually begged a psychiatrist to prescribe drugs that would chemically castrate me (I had researched which ones), because a life of mathematical asceticism was the only future that I could imagine for myself.’  So when he read feminist articles talking about the ‘male privilege’ of nerds like him, he didn’t recognise the description, and so felt himself able to declare himself ‘only’ 97 per cent on board with the programme of feminism.</p><p>It struck me as a thoughtful and rather sweet remark, in the midst of a long and courteous discussion with a female commenter.  But it got picked up, weirdly, by some feminist bloggers, including one who described it as ‘a yalp of entitlement combined with an aggressive unwillingness to accept that women are human beings just like men’ and that Aaronson was complaining that ‘having to explain my suffering to women when they should already be there, mopping my brow and offering me beers and blow jobs, is so tiresome.’</p><p>Scott Alexander (<em>not</em> Scott Aaronson) then wrote a furious 10,000-word defence of his friend… (p. 214-215)</p></blockquote>



<p>And then Chivers goes on to explain Scott Alexander’s central thesis, in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/">Untitled</a>, that privilege is not a one-dimensional axis, so that (to take one example) society can make many women in STEM miserable while <em>also</em> making shy male nerds miserable in different ways.</p>



<p>For nerds, perhaps an alternative title for Chivers’s book could be “The Normal People Do Not Hate You (Not All of Them, Anyway).”  It’s as though Chivers is demonstrating, through understated example, that taking delight in nerds’ suffering, wanting them to be miserable and alone, mocking their weird ideas, is not simply the default, well-adjusted human reaction, with any other reaction being ‘creepy’ and ‘problematic.’  Some might even go so far as to apply the latter adjectives to the sneerers’ attitude, the one that dresses up schoolyard bullying in a social-justice wig.</p>



<p>Reading Chivers’s book prompted me to reflect on my own relationship to the rationalist community.  For years, I interacted often with the community—I’ve known Robin Hanson since ~2004 and Eliezer Yudkowsky since ~2006, and our blogs bounced off each other—but I never considered myself a member.  I never ranked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip-maximizing AIs</a> among humanity’s more urgent threats—indeed, I saw them as a distraction from an all-too-likely climate catastrophe that will leave its survivors lucky to have stone tools, let alone AIs.  I was also repelled by what I saw as the rationalists’ cultier aspects.  I even once toyed with the idea of changing the name of this blog to “More Wrong” or “Wallowing in Bias,” as a play on the rationalists’ <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> and <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/">OvercomingBias</a>.</p>



<p>But I’ve drawn much closer to the community over the last few years, because of a combination of factors:</p>



<ol><li>The comment-171 affair.  This was not the sort of thing that could provide any new information about the likelihood of a dangerous AI being built, but <em>was</em> (to put it mildly) the sort of thing that can tell you who your friends are.  I learned that empathy works a lot like intelligence, in that those who boast of it most loudly are often the ones who lack it.</li><li>The astounding progress in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GANs</a>, which caused me (like everyone else, perhaps) to update in the direction of human-level AI in our lifetimes being an actual live possibility,</li><li>The rise of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Scott Alexander</a>.  To the charge that the rationalists are a cult, there’s now the reply that Scott, with his constant equivocations and doubts, his deep dives into data, his clarity and self-deprecating humor, is perhaps the least culty cult leader in human history.  Likewise, to the charge that the rationalists are basement-dwelling kibitzers who accomplish nothing of note in the real world, there’s now the reply that Scott has attracted a huge mainstream following (Steven Pinker, Paul Graham, presidential candidate Andrew Yang…), purely by offering up what’s self-evidently some of the best writing of our time.</li><li>Research.  The AI-risk folks started publishing some research papers that I found interesting—some with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565">relatively approachable problems</a> that I could see myself trying to think about if quantum computing ever got boring.  This shift seems to have happened at roughly around the same time my former student, <a href="https://paulfchristiano.com/">Paul Christiano</a>, “defected” from quantum computing to AI-risk research. </li></ol>



<p>Anyway, if you’ve spent years steeped in the rationalist blogosphere, read Eliezer’s <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences">“Sequences,”</a> and so on, <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> will probably have little that’s new, although it might still be interesting to revisit ideas and episodes that you know through a newcomer’s eyes.  To anyone else … well, reading the book would be a lot faster than spending all those years reading blogs!  I’ve heard of some rationalists now giving out copies of the book to their relatives, by way of explaining how they’ve chosen to spend their lives.</p>



<p>I <em>still</em> don’t know whether there’s a risk worth worrying about that a misaligned AI will threaten human civilization in my lifetime, or my children’s lifetimes, or even 500 years—or whether everyone will look back and laugh at how silly some people once were to think that (except, silly in which way?).  But I do feel fairly confident that <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> will make a positive difference—possibly for the world, but at any rate for a little well-meaning community of sneered-at nerds obsessed with the future and with following ideas wherever they lead.</p></div>

    <title>TR19-138 |  On the Probabilistic Degrees of Symmetric Boolean functions | 

	Srikanth Srinivasan, 

	Utkarsh Tripathi, 

	S Venkitesh</title>
    <summary>The probabilistic degree of a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is defined to be the smallest $d$ such that there is a random polynomial $\mathbf{P}$ of degree at most $d$ that agrees with $f$ at each point with high probability. Introduced by Razborov (1987), upper and lower bounds on probabilistic degrees of Boolean functions --- specifically symmetric Boolean functions --- have been used to prove explicit lower bounds, design pseudorandom generators, and devise algorithms for combinatorial problems. 
		
In this paper, we characterize the probabilistic degrees of all symmetric Boolean functions up to polylogarithmic factors over all fields of fixed characteristic (positive or zero).</summary>

    <title>TR19-137 |  Decision list compression by mild random restrictions | 

	Shachar Lovett, 

	Kewen Wu, 

	Jiapeng Zhang</title>
    <summary>A decision list is an ordered list of rules. Each rule is specified by a term, which is a conjunction of literals, and a value. Given an input, the output of a decision list is the value corresponding to the first rule whole term is satisfied by the input. Decision lists generalize both CNFs and DNFs, and have been studied both in complexity theory and in learning theory.

The size of a decision list is the number of rules, and its width is the maximal number of variables in a term. We prove that decision lists of small width can always be approximated by decision lists of small size, where we obtain sharp bounds (up to constants). This in particular resolves a conjecture of Gopalan, Meka and Reingold (Computational Complexity, 2013) on DNF sparsification.

An ingredient in our proof is a new random restriction lemma, which allows to analyze how DNFs (and more generally, decision lists) simplify if a small fraction of the variables are fixed. This is in contrast to the more commonly used switching lemma, which requires most of the variables to be fixed.</summary>

    <title>TR19-136 |  Quantum Query-to-Communication Simulation Needs a Logarithmic Overhead | 

	Sourav Chakraborty, 

	Arkadev Chattopadhyay, 

	Nikhil Mande, 

	Manaswi Paraashar</title>
    <summary>Buhrman, Cleve and Wigderson (STOC'98) observed that for every Boolean function $f : \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ and $\bullet : \{-1, 1\}^2 \to \{-1, 1\}$ the two-party bounded-error quantum communication complexity of $(f \circ \bullet)$ is $O(Q(f) \log n)$, where $Q(f)$ is the bounded-error quantum query complexity of $f$. Note that the bounded-error randomized communication complexity of $(f \circ \bullet)$ is bounded by $O(R(f))$, where $R(f)$ denotes the bounded-error randomized query complexity of $f$. Thus, the BCW simulation has an extra $O(\log n)$ factor appearing that is absent in classical simulation. A natural question is if this factor can be avoided. H{\o}yer and de Wolf (STACS'02) showed that for the Set-Disjointness function, this can be reduced to $c^{\log^* n}$ for some constant $c$, and subsequently Aaronson and Ambainis (FOCS'03) showed that this factor can be made a constant. That is, the quantum communication complexity of the Set-Disjointness function (which is $NOR_n \circ \wedge$) is $O(Q(NOR_n))$.

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we show that when $ \bullet = \oplus$, then the extra $\log n$ factor in the BCW simulation is unavoidable. In other words, we exhibit a total function $F : \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ such that $Q^{cc}(F \circ \oplus) = \Theta(Q(F) \log n)$.

To the best of our knowledge, it was not even known prior to this work whether there existed a total function $F$ and 2-bit function $\bullet$, such that $Q^{cc}(F \circ \bullet) = \omega(Q(F))$.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>One of my favorite parables ever since childhood was that of the four blind men and the elephant, with each man announcing the local image evoked in his mind’s eye on touching a different part of the elephant. This parable has provided an interesting metaphor even for serious scientific matters, a well-known one being wave-particle duality in physics.</p>
<p>But when it comes to matching markets, the parable has taken an unusual twist, with the proverbial elephant undergoing a metamorphosis of its own! The “blind men’’ in this case are entire disciplines which can lay claim to the field of matching markets. Of course, the obvious one is economics – the founders of this field, namely Gale and Shapley, were mathematical economists and <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2012/summary/">the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics</a> was awarded to Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley for work on these markets.</p>
<p>A key enabler was researchers in systems and networking. Their scientific revolutions of the Internet and mobile computing put matching markets on an exciting, new journey and their systems run these centralized markets on powerful computers.</p>
<p>The discipline of algorithm design has had an umbilical connection to matching markets: At the birth of this field lies the highly sophisticated <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.05.386?journalCode=uamm20">Gale-Shapley</a> stable matching algorithm (1962), whose pivotal game-theoretic property of incentive compatibility follows as a free gift from polynomial time solvability — it was established <a href="http://pareto.uab.es/jmasso/pdf/DubinsFreedmanAMM1981.pdf">two decades</a> after the discovery of the algorithm! Yet most researchers, including those in theoretical computer science, are not aware that algorithm design is also a legitimate claimant to this field. Indeed, the very “engine’’ that runs almost each one of these markets is a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/rmklectures2019-fall-1">sophisticated algorithm</a> chosen from the “gold mine’’ of matching theory! Besides stable matching, this includes maximum matching and online matching and their numerous variants.</p>
<p>Looking back at the huge expansion of matching markets over the last decade-and-a-half, one can see that all three disciplines were faced with numerous challenges: understanding the incentive structure of a new market; finding ways of dealing with terra-bytes of data, and choosing and delivering within milli-seconds the “right’’ ads to show with a user query; and designing an algorithm for the latest variant of online matching. And they all delivered!</p>
<p>The rich and diverse set of research talks given at the recent <a href="https://agtb.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/matching-markets-simons-driven-by-theory-driving-the-economy/">Simons program</a> on matching markets is proof enough that the elephant is still evolving!</p></div>

<div align="center"><img alt="CAML" src="http://grigory.github.io/blog/pics/summer.png" width="400"></div>
-->

<p>I get a lot of questions about how I spent last summer. Normally I just take off to the Bay Area the day my last Spring class is over and fly back the day before my Fall class begins.
However, last summer I decided I’ve been in the US long enough to learn everything it has to offer and it was time to explore life across the pond and spend three months at the Alan Turing Institute in London. Then I had two interns coming over to Bloomington so I spent my first ever summer month here. 
Since it is that time of year, a quick reminder to <a href="https://cs.indiana.edu/apply/graduate-application.html">apply by Dec 15</a> if you are interested in doing a Ph.D. and stay tuned for the internship call announcement (probably similar deadline).</p>

<h1 id="summer-interns-in-bloomington">Summer Interns in Bloomington</h1>

<p>IU has started a <a href="https://sice.indiana.edu/research/student-research/fellowship.html">Global Talent Attraction Program (GTAP)</a> – fantastic program for international summer interns. The program gives you a $4000 stipend and you spend 2 months here at IU. There were a lot of strong applicants so it took me a while to interview all candidates. In the end, the two interns I got were <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Chameleon2460">Jakub Boguta</a> (U. Warsaw, ACM ICPC gold this year, must be tough to be in the lead for 4 hours and not win) and <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/josdas">Stanislav Naumov</a> (SPb ITMO, ACM ICPC finalist, who spent summer at Google and just arrived on campus). Also, <a href="https://www.eleves.ens.fr/home/farthaud/">Farid Arthaud</a> joined us from ENS Paris, Ulm with a short recommendation of being “probably the best third-year CS student in France”. If you think you are the best in your country, have U.S. citizenship and don’t need to get paid, shoot me an email ;) Despite it being hot and humid here in Bloomington during the summer, we had a great time.</p>

<div align="center"><img alt="interns" src="http://grigory.github.io/blog/pics/interns.jpg" width="400"/></div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>We decided to dive into deep learning for image classification and figured out how to get more mileage out of standard pretrained neural nets by using them to produce hierarchical clusterings (with guarantees). If this sounds fun, you can apply for GTAP next year (picture by Farid).</p>

<h1 id="london-and-the-alan-turing-institute">London and the Alan Turing Institute</h1>

<p>Overall, this was a great experience as it quickly became clear that my neural net is overfit to the US lifestyle. I think of UK as throwing in some perturbations to your visual and verbal input (some may seem adversarial, but mostly just random) which, as we know, is good for robustness, generalization and what not.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Q</b>: Is grass greener there? <b>A</b>: Yes, of course. Especially, if you live next to the Regent’s Park.</li>
  <li><b>Q</b>: Is it your cup of tea? <b>A</b>: No, I still only function on Redbull, but the afternoon teas are a great experience. Proximity to cutting-edge tech, CS research and startups still matters most to me. However, if you are into math or finance, your mileage will almost certainly vary. Also, London seems perfect for a short-term visit/sabbatical, especially if you want to take a break from the tech hype, write a book, explore Europe, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Q</b>: What’s up with the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> and DeepMind? <b>A</b>: These two are probably the most happening places in the UK right now in academia and industry respectively. They are within a 5-minute walk from each other in King’s Cross. I was staying right across the road and it was perfect except for no AC. ATI serves as a meeting hub for researchers from all of the top UK schools (Cambridge, Oxford, Warwick, UCL, Edinburgh, etc.).
ATI is based inside the British library, which was the largest public building constructed in the UK in the 20th century. ATI has its own space inside the library which is equipped similarly to Google/FB offices. Except no free food, only drinks – would you want to have free British food anyway?</li>

  <li><b>Q</b>: Did you meet the King? <b>A</b>: Yes, in Heathrow I ran into a 250-pound dude from Atlanta who made it quite clear that’s him by wearing one of these (except in a larger font and in dirty red color).</li>

K and I took a 2-hour train down there directly from King’s Cross (St. Pancras station, another reason to stay in King’s Cross). We’ve enjoyed our time greatly, especially in Versailles and ENS Paris, Ulm. The Salvador Dali Museum in Montmartre was another highlight of this trip.</li>

    <title>TR19-135 |  Doubly-Efficient Pseudo-Deterministic Proofs | 

	Dhiraj Holden, 

	Shafi Goldwasser, 

	Michel Goemans</title>
    <summary>In [20] Goldwasser, Grossman and Holden  introduced pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs for search problems where a powerful prover can convince a probabilistic polynomial time verifier that a solution to a search problem is canonical.  They studied  search problems for which polynomial time algorithms are not known and for which many solutions are possible. They showed that whereas there exists a constant round pseudo deterministic proof for graph isomorphism where the canonical solution is the lexicographically smallest isomorphism, the existence of pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs for NP-hard problems would imply the collapse of the polynomial time hierarchy.

In this paper, we turn our attention to studying  doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proofs for polynomial time search problems:  pseudo-deterministic proofs with the extra requirement that the prover runtime is polynomial  and the verifier runtime to verify that a solution is canonical is significantly lower  than the complexity of finding any solution, canonical or otherwise. Naturally this question is particularly interesting for search problems for which a lower bound on its worst case complexity  is known or has been widely conjectured. 

We show doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic algorithms for a host of natural problems whose complexity has long been conjectured. In particular:

We show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for linear programming where the canonical solution which the prover will provide is  the lexicographically greatest optimal solution for the LP. To this end, we show how through perturbing the linear program and strong duality this solution can be both  computed efficiently by the prover, and verified by the verifier.  
The time of the verifier is $O(d^2 )$ for a linear program with integer data and at most $d$ variables and constraints, whereas the time to solve such linear program is $\tilde{O}(d^{\omega} )$ by randomized algorithms [11] for $\omega$  the exponent for fast matrix multiplication .


We show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for 3-SUM and problems reducible to 3-SUM where the prover is a $O(n^2)$ time algorithm and the verifier takes time $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$. 


We show a doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for the hitting set problem} where the verifier runs in time $\tilde{O}(m)$ and the prover runs in time $\tilde{O}(m^2)$ where $ m = \sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} |S| + \sum_{T \in \mathcal{T}} |T|$ for inputs  collections of sets $\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}$.

We show a doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for the Zero Weight Triangle problem where the verifier runs in time $\tilde{O}(n^{2 + \omega/3})$ and the prover runs in randomized time $\tilde{O}(n^3)$. The Zero Weight Triangle problem is equivalent to the All-Pairs Shortest Path problem, a well-studied problem that is the foundation of many hardness results in graph algorithms [39,38], under sub-cubic reductions.</summary>

    <title>TR19-134 |  Finding monotone patterns in sublinear time |

    <summary>We study the problem of finding monotone subsequences in an array from the viewpoint of sublinear algorithms. For fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show that the non-adaptive query complexity of finding a length-$k$ monotone subsequence of $f \colon [n] \to \mathbb{R}$, assuming that $f$ is $\varepsilon$-far from free of such subsequences, is $\Theta((\log n)^{\lfloor \log_2 k \rfloor})$. Prior to our work, the best algorithm for this problem, due to Newman, Rabinovich, Rajendraprasad, and Sohler (2017), made $(\log n)^{O(k^2)}$ non-adaptive queries; and the only lower bound known, of $\Omega(\log n)$ queries for the case $k = 2$, followed from that on testing monotonicity due to Erg\"un, Kannan, Kumar, Rubinfeld, and Viswanathan (2000) and Fischer (2004).</summary>
