<p>This is the fourth post in the series, an interview with ALT 2021 PC Chairs <a href="http://vtaly.net/">Vitaly Feldman</a> and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/">Katrina Ligett</a>, written by <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sutanu/">Sutanu Gayen</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/michal-moshkovitz">Michal Moshkovitz</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>We had the great opportunity to attend <em>The 32nd International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory</em>, held online between March 16-19, 2021, and co-chaired by Vitaly Feldman and Katrina Ligett. Vitaly is a research scientist at Apple AI Research and has done foundational works in machine learning and privacy-preserving data analysis. Katrina is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and has done pivotal works in data privacy, algorithmic fairness, algorithmic game theory, and online algorithms. We asked for an interview with them about their experiences and perspectives as co-chairs, to which they kindly agreed. We are happy to share with the readers the excerpts of this interview.</p>

<p><strong>How it started</strong></p>



<p>How are chairs and program committees chosen? </p>



<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;">Katrina: The chairs are selected by the Association for Algorithmic Learning Theory (AALT) Steering Committee (<a href="http://algorithmiclearningtheory.org/alt-steering-committee/">http://algorithmiclearningtheory.org/alt-steering-committee/</a>), and the chairs then select the program committee members. Vitaly and I brainstormed potential PC member names, solicited additional suggestions, and also considered the lists of people who have served on recent ALT and COLT PCs. In building the PC, we had many considerations in mind, including coverage of research areas, and various metrics of diversity.</p>



<p><strong>The chairs’ role</strong></p>



<p>What are the different tasks a chair has? What is the most difficult task?</p>



<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;">Katrina: At a high level, the roles of the PC chairs are to build the PC, oversee the reviewing process and create the conference program. Practically, though, there are a lot of decisions that need to be discussed, emails to be sent, and a lot of organizational aspects to tend to—configuring the reviewing platform, sending reminders, chasing down late reviews, and so on. Vitaly and I have a very, very long joint “to do” list—and luckily, it’s now almost all crossed off! We also had additional responsibilities this year because of the move to the virtual conference format, including selecting the technologies, overseeing the pre-recording process, and much more.</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Vitaly: I think the hardest and probably the most time-consuming is making the accept/reject decisions on papers.  For a large fraction of the papers arriving at the decision requires getting a sense of the results; understanding the main points in reviews, author responses and discussion (while calibrating them to the PC members and reviewers); ensuring that each paper is properly discussed by chasing reviewers, asking questions and often soliciting additional opinions. We also needed to come up with a set of criteria for deciding on borderline cases and make sure that these criteria are applied as consistently as possible. At the end it is a rather long and iterative process that luckily for us has converged to a program we are happy with.</p>



<p>How much time do you spend doing chair tasks? How do you balance chairing a conference (a massive amount of work) with all your other commitments? Do you turn down other service items you would generally accept, etc.?</p>



<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;">Katrina: It’s difficult to estimate the number of hours, but I think we have been meeting regularly since early June 2020, and we’re only wrapping up our work now, in late March 2021. It’s a much longer-timeframe commitment than serving as a PC member. I actually am chairing a second conference this year, FORC, and together it makes for a pretty serious load. As a result, I have been declining all other conference-related service. I also have a couple of other pretty substantial service commitments, as well, so I just don’t have bandwidth this year for additional PC and Area Chair-type roles.</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Vitaly: I agree that it’s hard to tell how much time we spent in total. My rough estimate is that it’s about a month of full-time work. I also had to decline most other service commitments during that period some of which I’d normally accept. Naturally, it also slows down other work so I definitely had to lean more on my collaborators in some of the ongoing projects <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>



<p>Can chairs bring their own personality into the conference? How? </p>



<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;">Katrina: One area where the chairs enjoy freedom is in selecting the keynote and tutorial speakers. I’m biased, of course, but I think we chose very well, and all of these speakers (Joelle Pineau, Shay Moran, and Costis Daskalakis) gave excellent talks (they were recorded—check them out if you missed them)! We also were fortunate to be able to work with amazing partners who organized the mentoring workshop (Surbhi Goel, Nika Hagtalab, and Ellen Vitercik) and the Women in ML Theory event (Tosca Lechner and Ruth Urner). These aspects of the conference beyond the papers are a way for the chairs to express their priorities.</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Vitaly: The chairs have a lot of freedom in choosing how to run the review process, design the conference program and who else will be involved. So, inevitably, the chairs’ personalities and tastes end up being reflected in the final results. </p>



<p>Does the online conference impact the chair job? How? </p>



<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;">Katrina: Typically, the PC chairs build the program, and then many details of organizing and running the conference get handed off to local organization chairs. But this year, since ALT was held virtually, there were many unusual tasks that fell to the PC chairs—not just the obvious ones like choosing the technologies and format and negotiating those contracts, but smaller things like chasing down authors who failed to upload their recordings, and developing instructions for people in various roles to interact with the conference platform.</p>



<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;">In addition, COVID times placed strains on many people, which made it more challenging to recruit PC members, and resulted in a higher than usual rate of late reviews and PC drop-outs, which of course left us scrambling.</p>



<p>What motivates you to spend time on a conference service?</p>



<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;">Katrina: We all rely on the conference system for our personal professional advancement, and for the advancement of our field as a whole. So we all owe that system our service, of course, according to our abilities, availability, and seniority. Also, it’s fun to get this different perspective on the conference review process and on the field. And it’s an honor to be entrusted with shepherding a conference for a year and hopefully nurturing its growth.</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Vitaly: I agree that it’s a mix of (1) contribution to the community I’m a member of and, perhaps, an opportunity to improve some of its processes (2) a learning experience that gives one a higher-level view of the research that is happening and people who do it (3) honor and recognition that come with the job.</p>



<p><strong>Awards </strong></p>



<p>How do you decide which papers were chosen as awards? </p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Vitaly: A necessary condition for a paper to receive an award is that at least one of the PC members/reviewers assigned to the paper is excited about the results.  So we start by looking at papers with the highest scores (typically all papers that received at least one “strong accept”) and reading their reviews. This allowed us to narrow down the list to a set of 5-6 candidates. From those we selected the winners by learning more about the results and selecting those, we found the most significant and interesting for the community.</p>



<p><strong>The review process</strong></p>



<p>What are your thoughts about the current peer review process in ALT? What are the downsides and advantages? Do you have suggestions for improvement?</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Vitaly: It is common that confidence in correctness of the results in a conference submission is based on higher-level sanity checks and general intuition of the reviewers. Naturally, the more interesting and important result the more likely it is to be scrutinized. At this ALT we did not run into a situation where the authors’ reputation affected our confidence in the correctness of the results. In case of concerns about correctness of an interesting result we would ask either an expert on the PC or an external expert to try to verify the result.</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">ALT currently relies on a traditional theory conference model of reviewing and for a typical submission has several PC members who are experts in the subarea. The reviewing load is also relatively light (8 papers per PC member). So I think that the overall reviewing quality is pretty much as good as it gets in ML (and is similar to COLT). Naturally, the model is not perfect and there is still variation in the quality of individual reviews. This year many more reviewers and PC members were under unusual time pressure due to the pandemic so perhaps the variation was higher than usual.</p>



<p><strong>The future</strong></p>



<p>What are your suggestions for the next chair? </p>



<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;">Katrina: Make sure you have a good co-chair. <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> Vitaly has been a great partner for this process—fun to work with, reliable, always willing to pitch in even on the less-fun tasks, and I have great respect for his technical perspective.</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Vitaly: I agree that diversity of perspectives and expertise is useful in several ways. Most notably, it gives the chairs a wider network of people to select the PC from. But I completely agree with Katrina, that the most important thing is the ability of co-chairs to work well together: after all, it’s a lot of work and complicated decisions that need to be made jointly. Here, I couldn’t have asked for more: Katrina is amazing both professionally and personally. Working with her was definitely the highlight of being the ALT co-chair and learned a lot from her in the process as well.</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: A maximum constraint satisfaction problem, Max-CSP(F), is specified by a finite family of constraints F, where each constraint is of arity k. An instance of the problem on n variables is given by m applications of constraints from F to length-k subsequences of the n variables, and the goal is to find an assignment to the n variables that satisfies the maximum number of constraints. The class of Max-CSP(F) includes optimization problems such as Max-CUT, Max-DICUT, Max-3SAT, Max-q-Coloring, Unique Games, etc.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present our recent dichotomy theorem on the approximability of Max-CSP(F) for every finite family F, in the single-pass dynamic streaming setting. In this setting, at each time step, a constraint is either added to or deleted from the stream. In the end, the streaming algorithm must estimate the maximum number of constraints that can be satisfied using space that is only polylogarithmic in n. No background in streaming algorithms or constraint satisfaction problems will be needed to enjoy this talk!</p>

    <title>TR21-063 |  Approximability of all finite CSPs in the dynamic streaming setting |

    <summary>A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), Max-CSP$({\cal F})$, is specified by a finite set of constraints ${\cal F} \subseteq \{[q]^k \to \{0,1\}\}$ for positive integers $q$ and $k$. An instance of the problem on $n$ variables is given by $m$ applications of constraints from ${\cal F}$ to subsequences of the $n$ variables, and the goal is to find an assignment to the variables that satisfies the maximum number of constraints. In the $(\gamma,\beta)$-approximation version of the problem for parameters $0 \leq \beta &lt; \gamma \leq 1$, the goal is to distinguish instances where at least $\gamma$ fraction of the constraints can be satisfied from instances where at most $\beta$ fraction of the constraints can be satisfied. 

In this work we consider the approximability of this problem in the context of streaming algorithms and give a dichotomy result in the dynamic setting, where constraints can be inserted or deleted. Specifically,  for every family ${\cal F}$ and every $\beta &lt; \gamma$,  we show that either the approximation problem is solvable with polylogarithmic space in the dynamic setting, or not solvable with $o(\sqrt{n})$ space. We also establish tight inapproximability results for a broad subclass in the streaming insertion-only setting. Our work builds on, and significantly extends previous work by the authors who consider the special case of Boolean variables ($q=2$), singleton families ($|{\cal F}| = 1$) and where constraints may be placed on variables or their negations. Our framework extends non-trivially the previous work allowing us to appeal to richer norm estimation algorithms to get our algorithmic results. For our negative results we introduce new variants of the communication problems studied in the previous work, build new reductions for these problems, and extend the technical parts of previous works. In particular, previous works used Fourier analysis over the Boolean cube to prove their results and the results seemed particularly tailored to functions on Boolean literals (i.e., with negations). Our techniques surprisingly allow us to get to general $q$-ary CSPs without negations by appealing to the same Fourier analytic starting point over Boolean hypercubes.</summary>

    <title>Participatory Budgeting with Donations and Diversity Constraints</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1620000000</feedworld_mtime>

decide on how to allocate public funds to indivisible projects. This paper
focuses on PB processes where citizens may give additional money to projects
they want to see funded. We introduce a formal framework for this kind of PB
with donations. Our framework also allows for diversity constraints, meaning
that each project belongs to one or more types, and there are lower and upper
bounds on the number of projects of the same type that can be funded. We
propose three general classes of methods for aggregating the citizens'
preferences in the presence of donations and analyze their axiomatic
properties. Furthermore, we investigate the computational complexity of
determining the outcome of a PB process with donations and of finding a
citizen's optimal donation strategy.

and extracted as long as the number of stored elements does not exceed the
predefined capacity. We consider the concurrent implementations of a bounded
container more or less memory-friendly depending on how much memory they use in
addition to storing the elements. This way, memory-optimal implementation
employs the minimal possible memory overhead and ensures that data and metadata
are stored most compactly, reducing cache misses and unnecessary memory
reclamation.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that non-blocking implementations of a large class of
element-independent bounded containers, including queues, stacks, and pools,
must incur linear in the number of concurrent processes memory overhead. In the
special cases when the ABA problem is excluded, e.g., by assuming that the
hardware supports LL/SC instructions or by storing distinct elements, we show
that the lower bound can be circumvented, by presenting lock-free bounded
queues with constant memory overhead. For the general case, we present a
CAS-based bounded queue implementation that asymptotically matches our lower
bound. We believe that these results open a new research avenue devoted to the
memory-optimality phenomenon.

    <title>PSEUDo: Interactive Pattern Search in Multivariate Time Series with Locality-Sensitive Hashing and Relevance Feedback</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Yuncong Yu, Dylan Kruyff, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Becker:Tim.html">Tim Becker</a>, Michael Behrisch <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14962">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present PSEUDo, an adaptive feature learning technique for exploring
visual patterns in multi-track sequential data. Our approach is designed with
the primary focus to overcome the uneconomic retraining requirements and
inflexible representation learning in current deep learning-based systems.
Multi-track time series data are generated on an unprecedented scale due to
increased sensors and data storage. These datasets hold valuable patterns, like
in neuromarketing, where researchers try to link patterns in multivariate
sequential data from physiological sensors to the purchase behavior of products
and services. But a lack of ground truth and high variance make automatic
pattern detection unreliable. Our advancements are based on a novel query-aware
locality-sensitive hashing technique to create a feature-based representation
of multivariate time series windows. Most importantly, our algorithm features
sub-linear training and inference time. We can even accomplish both the
modeling and comparison of 10,000 different 64-track time series, each with 100
time steps (a typical EEG dataset) under 0.8 seconds. This performance gain
allows for a rapid relevance feedback-driven adaption of the underlying pattern
similarity model and enables the user to modify the speed-vs-accuracy trade-off
gradually. We demonstrate superiority of PSEUDo in terms of efficiency,
accuracy, and steerability through a quantitative performance comparison and a
qualitative visual quality comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms in the
field. Moreover, we showcase the usability of PSEUDo through a case study
demonstrating our visual pattern retrieval concepts in a large meteorological
dataset. We find that our adaptive models can accurately capture the user's
notion of similarity and allow for an understandable exploratory visual pattern
retrieval in large multivariate time series datasets.

    <title>Traceability Technology Adoption in Supply Chain Networks</title>

by simplifying recalls, increasing demand visibility, or ascertaining
sustainable supplier practices. Managers in the traceability initiatives
developing such technologies face a difficult question: which companies should
they target as early adopters to ensure that their technology is broadly
employed? To answer this question, managers must consider that supply chains
are interlinked in complex networks and that a supply chain effect is inherent
to traceability technologies. More specifically, the benefits obtained from
traceability are conditional on technology adoption throughout a product's
supply chain.
</p>
<p>We introduce a model of the dynamics of traceability technology adoption in
supply chain networks to tackle the problem of selecting the smallest set of
early adopters guaranteeing broad dissemination. Our model builds on extant
diffusion models while incorporating that a firm's adoption decision depends on
previous adoption decisions throughout its supply chains. We show that the
problem is NP-hard and that no approximation within a polylogarithmic factor
can be guaranteed for any polynomial-time algorithm. Nevertheless, we introduce
an algorithm that identifies an exact solution in polynomial time under certain
assumptions on the network structure and provide evidence that it is tractable
for real-world supply chain networks. We further propose a random generative
model that outputs networks consistent with real-world supply chain networks.
The networks obtained display, whp, structures that allow us to find the
optimal seed set in subexponential time using our algorithm. Our generative
model also provides approximate seed sets when information on the network is
limited.

plane, the disk coverage problem asks for a subset of disks of minimum total
weight that cover all points of $P$. The problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we
consider a line-constrained version in which all disks are centered on a line
$L$ (while points of $P$ can be anywhere in the plane). We present an
$O((m+n)\log(m+n)+\kappa\log m)$ time algorithm for the problem, where $\kappa$
is the number of pairs of disks that intersect. Alternatively, we can also
solve the problem in $O(nm\log(m+n))$ time. For the unit-disk case where all
disks have the same radius, the running time can be reduced to
$O((n+m)\log(m+n))$. In addition, we solve in $O((m+n)\log(m+n))$ time the
$L_{\infty}$ and $L_1$ cases of the problem, in which the disks are squares and
diamonds, respectively. As a by-product, the 1D version of the problem where
all points of $P$ are on $L$ and the disks are line segments on $L$ is also
solved in $O((m+n)\log(m+n))$ time. We also show that the problem has an
$\Omega((m+n)\log (m+n))$ time lower bound even for the 1D case.
</p>
<p>We further demonstrate that our techniques can also be used to solve other
geometric coverage problems. For example, given in the plane a set $P$ of $n$
points and a set $S$ of $n$ weighted half-planes, we solve in $O(n^4\log n)$
time the problem of finding a subset of half-planes to cover $P$ so that their
total weight is minimized. This improves the previous best algorithm of
$O(n^5)$ time by almost a linear factor. If all half-planes are lower ones,
then our algorithm runs in $O(n^2\log n)$ time, which improves the previous
best algorithm of $O(n^4)$ time by almost a quadratic factor.

subgraphs satisfying a given graph property $\Phi$ in a large host graph $G$.
Building upon the breakthrough result of Curticapean, Dell and Marx (STOC 17),
we express the number of such subgraphs as a finite linear combination of graph
homomorphism counts and derive the complexity of computing this number by
studying its coefficients.
</p>
<p>Our approach relies on novel constructions of low-degree Cayley graph
expanders of $p$-groups, which might be of independent interest. The properties
of those expanders allow us to analyse the coefficients in the aforementioned
linear combinations over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ which gives us significantly
more control over the cancellation behaviour of the coefficients. Our main
result is an exhaustive and fine-grained complexity classification of
$\#\mathrm{EdgeSub}(\Phi)$ for minor-closed properties $\Phi$, closing the
missing gap in previous work by Roth, Schmitt and Wellnitz (ICALP 21).
</p>
<p>Additionally, we observe that our methods also apply to modular counting.
Among others, we investigate the problems of modular counting of paths, cycles,
forests and matroid bases. In the course of our investigations we also provide
an exhaustive parameterized complexity classification for the problem of
counting graph homomorphisms modulo a prime $p$.

1880 and is reprinted in _The_Magic_of_Lewis_Carroll_, edited by John
Fisher, Bramhall House, 1973.


   If 6 cats kill 6 rats in 6 minutes, how many will be needed to kill
   100 rats in 50 minutes?

   This is a good example of a phenomenon that often occurs in working
   problems in double proportion; the answer looks all right at first, but,
   when we come to test it, we find that, owing to peculiar circumstances in
   the case, the solution is either impossible or else indefinite, and needing
   further data.  The 'peculiar circumstance' here is that fractional cats or
   rats are excluded from consideration, and in consequence of this the
   solution is, as we shall see, indefinite.

   The solution, by the ordinary rules of Double Proportion, is 12 cats.
   [Steps of Carroll's solution, in the notation of his time, omitted.]

   But when we come to trace the history of this sanguinary scene through all
   its horrid details, we find that at the end of 48 minutes 96 rats are dead,
   and that there remain 4 live rats and 2 minutes to kill them in: the
   question is, can this be done?

   Now there are at least *four* different ways in which the original feat,
   of 6 cats killing 6 rats in 6 minutes, may be achieved.  For the sake of
   clearness let us tabulate them:
      A.  All 6 cats are needed to kill a rat; and this they do in one minute,
          the other rats standing meekly by, waiting for their turn.
      B.  3 cats are needed to kill a rat, and they do it in 2 minutes.
      C.  2 cats are needed, and do it in 3 minutes.
      D.  Each cat kills a rat all by itself, and takes 6 minutes to do it.

   In cases A and B it is clear that the 12 cats (who are assumed to come
   quite fresh from their 48 minutes of slaughter) can finish the affair in
   the required time; but, in case C, it can only be done by supposing that 2
   cats could kill two-thirds of a rat in 2 minutes; and in case D, by
   supposing that a cat could kill one-third of a rat in two minutes.  Neither
   supposition is warranted by the data; nor could the fractional rats (even
   if endowed with equal vitality) be fairly assigned to the different cats.
   For my part, if I were a cat in case D, and did not find my claws in good
   working order, I should certainly prefer to have my one-third-rat cut off
   from the tail end.

   In cases C and D, then, it is clear that we must provide extra cat-power.
   In case C *less* than 2 extra cats would be of no use.  If 2 were supplied,
   and if they began killing their 4 rats at the beginning of the time, they
   would finish them in 12 minutes, and have 36 minutes to spare, during which
   they might weep, like Alexander, because there were not 12 more rats to
   kill.  In case D, one extra cat would suffice; it would kill its 4 rats in
   24 minutes, and have 26 minutes to spare, during which it could have killed
   another 4.  But in neither case could any use be made of the last 2
   minutes, except to half-kill rats---a barbarity we need not take into
   consideration.

   To sum up our results.  If the 6 cats kill the 6 rats by method A or B,
   the answer is 12; if by method C, 14; if by method D, 13.

   This, then, is an instance of a solution made `indefinite' by the
   circumstances of the case.  If an instance of the `impossible' be desired,
   take the following: `If a cat can kill a rat in a minute, how many would be
   needed to kill it in the thousandth part of a second?'  The *mathematical*
   answer, of course, is `60,000,' and no doubt less than this would *not*
   suffice; but would 60,000 suffice?  I doubt it very much.  I fancy that at
   least 50,000 of the cats would never even see the rat, or have any idea of
   what was going on.

   Or take this: `If a cat can kill a rat in a minute, how long would it be
   killing 60,000 rats?'  Ah, how long, indeed!  My private opinion is that
   the rats would kill the cat.

    <title>TR21-062 |  Improved Hitting Set for Orbit of ROABPs | 

	Vishwas Bhargava, 

	Sumanta Ghosh</title>
    <summary>The orbit of an $n$-variate polynomial $f(\mathbf{x})$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is the set $\{f(A \mathbf{x} +  b)\,\mid\, A\in \mathrm{GL}({n,\mathbb{F}})\mbox{ and }\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{F}^n\}$, and the orbit of a polynomial class is the union of orbits of all the polynomials in it. In this paper, we give improved constructions of hitting-sets for the orbit of read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs (ROABPs) and a related model. Over field with characteristic zero or greater than $d$, we construct a hitting set of size  $(ndw)^{O(w^2\log n\cdot \min\{w^2, d\log w\})}$  for the orbit of ROABPs in unknown variable order where $d$ is the individual degree and $w$ is the width of ROABPs. We also give hitting set of size $(ndw)^{O(\min\{w^2,d\log w\})}$ for the orbit of polynomials  computed by $w$-width ROABPs in any variable order. Our hitting sets improve upon the results of Saha and Thankey \cite{Saha-Thankey'21} who gave an $(ndw)^{O(d\log w)}$ size hitting set for the orbit of commutative ROABPs (a subclass of \textit{any-order} ROABPs) and $(nw)^{O(w^6\log n)}$ size hitting set for the orbit of multilinear ROABPs. Designing better hitting sets in large individual degree regime, for instance $d&gt;n$, was asked as an open problem by \cite{Saha-Thankey'21} and this work solves it in  small width setting. 

We prove some new rank concentration results by establishing \emph{low-cone concentration} for the polynomials over vector spaces, and they strengthen some previously known \emph{low-support} based rank concentrations shown in \cite{FSS14}. These new low-cone concentration results are crucial in our hitting set construction, and may be of independent interest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time when low-cone rank concentration has been used for designing hitting sets.</summary>

<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/04/30/test-of-time/bk/" rel="attachment wp-att-18676"><img alt="" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18676" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bk-150x150.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>
Bobby Kleinberg just reached out to those of us who post from time to time. He wanted some help in announcing a new STOC Test of Time Award. </p>
<p>
So today, Ken and I put this together. </p>
<p>Bobby said: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> As with FOCS, three awards will be given: one for papers from approximately 10 years ago, one for approximately 20 years ago, and one for approximately 30 years ago. The selection committee for this year’s award will be Joe Halpern, Mihalis Yannakakis, and Salil Vadhan. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I would suggest that one of Bobby’s papers could fit this award: </p>
<p>Group-theoretic algorithms for matrix multiplication <br/>
Henry Cohn, Robert Kleinberg, Balazs Szegedy, Christopher Umans </p>
<p>
Well, I can say that without being out of order <em>here</em> because that paper was in FOCS, not STOC.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Criteria </h2><p/>
<p>
</p><li>
<i>Area</i>: Opening up a new area of research <p/>
</li><li>
<i>Proof</i>: Introducing new proof techniques <p/>
</li><li>
<i>Use</i>: Solving a problem of lasting importance <p/>
</li><li>
<i>Else</i>: Stimulating advances in other areas of computer science or in other disciplines. <p/>
<p>
Go here for details on how to <a href="https://sigact.org/prizes/stoc_tot.html">nominate</a>. By the way: Another test of Time is that the nominations are due relatively soon—May 24. So if you wish to nominate some paper please act soon. </p>
<p>
Ken notes that the first criterion could also be called <i>Leadership</i>, the second always comes with an element of <i>Surprise</i>, and the last two have aspects of <i>Applicability</i> and <i>Practicality</i>.  Adding those to my terms makes a double acronym <i>APPLAUSE</i>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Early Early Years </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I have been around long enough to fit the a 30++ years category, and Ken almost <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/04/22/ken-turns-40/">ditto</a>. Here are some opinions on the early days. Those papers with<br/>

<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken thinks that one way not to be asked here about my own papers is to mention one, so here goes:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://dblp.org/db/conf/stoc/stoc80.html">1980</a></p>
<p>
Ravindran Kannan, Richard Lipton <br/>
The Orbit Problem is Decidable <br/>
<i>Proof</i>.  Ken adds: Could also be <i>Surprise</i> because we not only showed decidable but in polynomial time.  But the real test of time here may be whether (despite some technical limitations) it proves useful to the great recent interest in adjacent kinds of orbit problems in <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">invariant</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/07/12/the-long-reach-of-reachability/">reachability</a> theory.</p></li></font></font></div>

    <title>PolyConc: Online collaboration to improve on a result on the equational theory of CCS modulo bisimilarity</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The aim of this post is to try and start an online collaboration to improve the solution to a problem in the equational logic of processes that I posed in a <a href="https://www.brics.dk/NS/03/2/BRICS-NS-03-2.pdf" target="_blank">survey paper in 2003</a>, namely    </p><blockquote>  Can one obtain a finite axiomatisation of the parallel composition operator in bisimulation semantics by adding only one binary operator to the signature of (recursion, restriction, and relabelling free) CCS? </blockquote><p>     Valentina Castiglioni, Wan Fokkink, Anna Ingólfsdóttir, Bas Luttik and I published a partial, negative answer to the above question in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2021.8" target="_blank">paper at CSL 2021</a>. (See the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01943.pdf" target="_blank">arXiv version</a> for details and for the historical context for the above question.) Our solution is based on three simplifying assumptions that are described in detail in Section 3 of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01943.pdf" target="_blank">above-mentioned paper</a>. We'd be very interested in hearing whether any member of the research community in process algebra, universal algebra and equational logic can relax or remove any of our simplifying assumptions. In particular, one can start with assumptions 3 and 2. </p><p>We would also welcome any comments and suggestions on whether some version of that problem can be solved using existing results from equational logic and universal algebra. In particular, are there any general results guaranteeing that, under certain conditions, the reduct of a finitely based algebra is also finitely based? Or, conversely, that if some algebra is not finitely based, then so its expansion with a new operator?</p><p>To start with, add any contributions you might have as comments to this post. If ever we make substantial enough progress on the above question, anyone who has played a positive role in extending our results will be a co-author of the resulting paper. </p><p>Let PolyConc begin!<br/></p><p/></div>

<p>To make a decision for ourselves, we need to think about the impact of our actions to our objectives. But, when our actions affect other people and their actions affect our objectives, we also need to consider their incentives, and choose our actions in anticipation of theirs. This increase in complexity also occurs in situations involving multiple decision-making machines (e.g., self-driving cars), automated systems (e.g., algorithmic stock trading), or living organisms (e.g., groups of cells).</p>



<p>Studying decision-making in so-called multi-agent environments has been a question of interest to mathematicians and economists for centuries. In the 1830s, Antoine Augustin Cournot developed a theory of competition to model oligopolies, inspired by observing competition in a spring water duopoly. Jumping forward to the 20th century, researchers converged that a fruitful approach to analyzing multi-agent systems is studying them at “equilibrium”, that is, in situations where the system is stable in the sense that all parties are satisfied with their actions. A fundamental concept of equilibrium, studied by John von Neumann, and later by von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern is a collection of actions, one per agent, such that no agent has an incentive to deviate from their choice given the actions of the other agents. While a nice proposal, they could only show that such equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in situations conforming to what is called a “two-player zero-sum game”. In such games, two agents are in exact competition with each other; whatever one player wins the other loses.<sup><a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#fn1">1</a></sup> In 1950, John F. Nash showed that this notion of equilibrium, named Nash equilibrium in his honor, indeed exists for most naturally occurring multi-agent problems.<sup><a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#fn2">2</a></sup></p>



<p>While Nash established the existence of equilibrium, one question bothered economists and computer scientists alike: “<em>Is it possible to efficiently find the Nash equilibrium of a game</em>?”</p>



<p>Throughout the rest of the 20th century, many people proposed algorithms for computing Nash equilibrium, but none of them succeeded in showing that it can be done efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time in the size of the game). During his early graduate school days at UC Berkeley, Constantinos (a.k.a. Costis) Daskalakis obsessed over this question. Then, in 2006, Costis, along with co-authors Paul Goldberg and Christos Papadimitriou, who was also his PhD advisor, showed a surprising result: finding a Nash equilibrium is computationally intractable!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-311" src="https://kamathematics.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/fig1-1.png?w=643"/><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Utility functions encode the value an agent gets from a particular decision. (a) In classical Economics and Game Theory literature, these trade off benefits and costs of actions. For e.g., consider an agent deciding on the quantity <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of basic material to procure while the other agent sets the price <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> per unit of this material. If we let <img alt="g(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28x%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> denote the revenue from selling the product produced using <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> units of basic material, where <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a concave function of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (capturing diminishing returns), then the overall utility of the agent choosing <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="f(x,y) = g(x) - x \cdot y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+g%28x%29+-+x+%5Ccdot+y&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, an overall concave function. (b) Modern multi-agent problems involve agents choosing parameters of deep neural networks. This quickly leads to non-concave agent utilities.</figure>



<p>A central concept in analyzing multi-agent systems is the <em>utility function</em> of each interacting agent. This is  a function that captures the value that the agent derives as a function of their own action as well as those of the other agents. A common assumption is that the utility function of each agent is a concave function of their own action for any collection of actions committed by the others. Concavity often arises when agents trade off benefits and costs from their actions taking into account properties like diminishing returns and risk-aversion (see Figure 1 for an illustration). It is also crucial in guaranteeing that equilibria exist.</p>



<h3>From Game Theory and Economics to Deep Learning</h3>



<p>Recently, Costis has shifted his attention to the more general setting where the underlying utilities can be arbitrary non-concave functions of the agents’ actions. “Earlier, I was interested in the problem of equilibrium computation for its fundamental applications in Game Theory and Economics and its intimate connections to duality theory, topology and complexity theory. As Machine Learning is now moving towards multi-agent learning, studying more general setups arising from nonconcave agent utilities becomes increasingly relevant,” says Costis. He elaborates that the recent success of deep learning methods has largely been in single-agent setups and that the next frontier is to replicate this success in multi-agent settings. It is at this intersection of deep learning and multi-agent learning that non-concave utility functions arise — when actions correspond to setting the parameters of deep neural networks, agent utilities quickly become non-concave in the space of these parameters(see Figure 1).</p>



<p>The focus of Costis’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpaCWKlOMig" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">keynote talk</a>, on joint work with Stratis Skoulakis and Manolis Zampetakis [<a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#DSZ21">DSZ21</a>] was on the simplest multi-agent problem: two-player zero-sum games. In these games, two players, the <em>min</em> and the <em>max</em> player, choose actions <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> respectively, which are constrained to lie in some compact and convex set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, i.e., <img alt="(x,y) \in S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cin+S&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The agents share some objective function <img alt="f(x,y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that <em>min</em> wants to minimize and <em>max</em> wants to maximize. Classical studies, going back to von Neumann’s celebrated work [<a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#vN28">vN28</a>] focus on when this objective is a convex function of the <em>min</em> player’s action and a concave function of the <em>max</em> player’s action, the so-called “convex-concave setting”. For any function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> which is convex-concave, there exists a Nash equilibrium, i.e., a point <img alt="(x^*, y^*)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%5E%2A%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> satisfying</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" id="eq-nash"><img alt="f(x^*, y) \leq f(x^*, y^*) \leq f(x, y^*) \quad \text{for all}\; x, y \text{ such that } (x, y^*), (x^*, y) \in S.\qquad (1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%29+%5Cleq+f%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%5E%2A%29+%5Cleq+f%28x%2C+y%5E%2A%29+%5Cquad+%5Ctext%7Bfor+all%7D%5C%3B+x%2C+y+%5Ctext%7B+such+that+%7D+%28x%2C+y%5E%2A%29%2C+%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%29+%5Cin+S.%5Cqquad+%281%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Thus the <em>min</em> (<em>max</em>) player has no incentive to deviate from <img alt="x^* (y^*)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E%2A+%28y%5E%2A%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as long as the other player remains fixed. The existence of such <img alt="(x^*, y^*)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%5E%2A%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> follows from von Neumann’s minimax theorem and Rosen’s generalization of this theorem to the case that agents actions are jointly constrained [<a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#Ros65">Ros65</a>]. However, when <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is not convex-concave, the minimax theorem fails, and we lose the existence of Nash equilibrium. For a simple example, consider <img alt="f(x,y) = (x-y)^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%28x-y%29%5E2&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> over the space <img alt="S=[0,1]^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%3D%5B0%2C1%5D%5E2&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Given any decision choice <img alt="(x, y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if <img alt="x\neq y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cneq+y&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the <em>min</em> player should move <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> towards <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Otherwise, if <img alt="x = y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+y&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the <em>max</em> player wants to move away from <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Thus, no pair <img alt="(x^*, y^*)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%5E%2A%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> satisfies equation <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#eq-nash">(1)</a>.</p>



<p>Nonconvex-nonconcave utility functions naturally arise in adversarial training applications, such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training, where the goal is to learn how to generate new data, such as images, from the same distribution that generated a collection of given data. Specifically, GANs are trained by trying to identify the equilibrium of a two-player zero-sum game between a generator model (the <em>min</em> player) and a discriminator model (the <em>max</em> player). Each of these models are viewed as agents, choosing parameters in deep neural networks, and the objective, capturing how close the generated distribution is to the target distribution, amounts to a nonconvex-nonconcave function of the underlying network parameters, which the <em>min</em> player aims to minimize and the <em>max</em> player aims to maximize.</p>



<p>Given that Nash equilibria may not exist when the objective is not convex-concave, what type of solutions should we target when studying two player zero-sum games with such objectives? “One property that we would like our target solutions to possess is that they are universal, i.e. they are guaranteed to exist for any objective function. We can take them to a practitioner and tell them that they are always plausible targets for their computations,” says Costis. With this in mind, Costis and his co-authors consider a relaxed equilibrium concept, called <img alt="(\epsilon, \delta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cepsilon%2C+%5Cdelta%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-Nash equilibrium. This is a pair <img alt="(x^*, y^*)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%5E%2A%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> satisfying</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="f(x^*, y^*) &lt; f(x, y^*) + \epsilon \quad \text{for all}\; x \text{ such that } \|x - x^*\| \leq \delta \text{ and } (x,y^*)\in S;" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%5E%2A%29+%3C+f%28x%2C+y%5E%2A%29+%2B+%5Cepsilon+%5Cquad+%5Ctext%7Bfor+all%7D%5C%3B+x+%5Ctext%7B+such+that+%7D+%5C%7Cx+-+x%5E%2A%5C%7C+%5Cleq+%5Cdelta+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%28x%2Cy%5E%2A%29%5Cin+S%3B&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/><img alt="f(x^*, y^*) &gt; f(x^*, y) - \epsilon \quad \text{for all}\; y \text{ such that } \|y - y^*\| \leq \delta \text{ and } (x^*,y)\in S." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%5E%2A%29+%3E+f%28x%5E%2A%2C+y%29+-+%5Cepsilon+%5Cquad+%5Ctext%7Bfor+all%7D%5C%3B+y+%5Ctext%7B+such+that+%7D+%5C%7Cy+-+y%5E%2A%5C%7C+%5Cleq+%5Cdelta+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%28x%5E%2A%2Cy%29%5Cin+S.&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>This relaxes Nash equilibrium: given strategy <img alt="y^*" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E%2A&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for the <em>max</em> player, the <em>min</em> player can improve by at most <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by changing their action in a ball of radius <img alt="\delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> around <img alt="x^*" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E%2A&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and a symmetric condition holds for the <em>max</em> player, given strategy <img alt="x^*" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E%2A&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for the <em>min</em> player. One of the main insights of their paper is that such local Nash equilibria <em>are guaranteed to</em> exist as long as <img alt="\delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a small enough function of <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>’s smoothness, namely whenever <img alt="\delta \le \sqrt{2\epsilon \over L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%5Cle+%5Csqrt%7B2%5Cepsilon+%5Cover+L%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>’s smoothness. This non-trivial result is established via an application of Brouwer’s fixed point theorem.</p>



<h3>Can algorithms find a local Nash equilibrium?</h3>



<p>The next question, pertaining to computational complexity, is to determine whether finding an <img alt="(\epsilon, \delta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cepsilon%2C+%5Cdelta%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-Nash equilibrium is algorithmically tractable in the regime of parameters (small enough <img alt="\delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) where it is guaranteed to exist. As a first step, Costis and his co-authors focus on first-order algorithms, which have access to the gradient of the objective function. Examples include gradient descent and variants thereof, which have been the main computational engine behind the success of deep learning in single-agent problems. A classical result known for these methods in minimization settings is that they are efficient in computing <img alt="(\epsilon,\delta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cepsilon%2C%5Cdelta%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-minima of non-convex, smooth objectives <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

In contrast to minimization, a main contribution of Costis’ work is to establish an intractability result for min-maximization, showing that the number of gradient queries for any first-order algorithm to compute <img alt="(\epsilon,\delta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cepsilon%2C%5Cdelta%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-Nash equilibria must be exponential in at least one of <img alt="1/\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the dimension <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, or the smoothness <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the objective.</p>

<p>This theorem tells us that there exist objective functions for which the min-maximization problem can be computationally intractable for any first-order algorithm. Requiring many queries is one way to say that the problem is hard in practice. Indeed, practitioners have found it notoriously hard to get the discriminator-generator neural networks to converge to good solutions for generative modelling problems using gradient-based methods.</p>



<p>From a technical perspective, this work represents a new approach for proving lower bounds in optimization. Classical lower bounds in the optimization literature, going back to Nemirovsky and Yudin [<a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#NY83">NY83</a>] target the black-box setting: an algorithm is given access to an oracle which outputs some desired information about a function when presented with a query. For example, a first-order oracle outputs the gradient of a function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at a given input. Costis shared that he and his co-authors first tried to construct a black-box lower bound for local Nash equilibria directly. However, they were unsuccessful. Any direct construction they tried ended up introducing spurious local Nash equilibria, which first-order algorithms might find in polynomial time. Their direct attempts at a lower bound failed to capture the computational hardness of the problem. They quickly realized that they needed a deeper understanding of the problem at hand, better insight on what made it harder than minimization.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-310" height="331" src="https://kamathematics.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/fig2.png?w=1011" width="581"/><strong>Figure 2. </strong>(a) Black-box models work with an oracle which an algorithm queries to obtain information. White-box models provide algorithms access to functions which can compute the desired information. (b) Architecture of black-box intractability results (focus of the optimization literature): first show computational hardness results in the white-box model (focus of computational complexity); then compose those with black-box lower bounds for any problem in the class for which hardness results were established.</figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>That insight came when they switched to studying the complexity of the white-box version of the problem, wherein the optimization algorithm can look inside the oracle that computes <img alt="\nabla f(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28x%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and possibly <img alt="f(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as well. One might wonder why one would want to consider such white-box models over black-box ones if their goal is to prove intractability results for methods that have limited access to <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Indeed, proving an intractability result in the white-box model is much harder because the set of algorithms that use white-box access to the objective is strictly bigger than those using only black-box access. However, the key difference is that we are not looking for the same kind of hardness in the two models. In the black-box model, we are looking for unconditional computational hardness, that is, showing that any algorithm will require exponentially many queries to the gradient oracle. On the other hand, in the white-box model, we would like to show complexity-theoretic hardness, i.e., show that solving the problem at hand is at least as hard (or exactly as hard) as solving the hardest problems in some complexity class. Such a complexity-theoretic hardness result is conditional; it says that solving this problem will be computationally intractable as long as some computational complexity conjecture, such as P <img alt="\neq" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cneq&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> NP, holds. Importantly, showing hardness (or completeness) of a problem in some complexity class typically entails a fine-grained understanding of the nature of the problem and how that enables it to encode other problems in the target complexity class.</p>
</div></div>



<p>In the white-box model, the authors show that the problem of computing local Nash equilibria is PPAD-complete. In other words, computing this local equilibrium concept in zero-sum games with nonconvex-nonconcave objectives is exactly as hard as computing Nash equilibria in general-sum games with concave agent utilities.<sup><a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#fn3">3</a></sup> This result is established by exhibiting a reduction from a variant of the Sperner coloring problem,<sup><a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#fn4">4</a></sup> which is a PPAD-complete problem, to a discrete nonconvex-nonconcave min-maximization problem, where the two agents choose points on a hypergrid.</p>



<h3>Unexpected challenges in high dimensions</h3>



<p>Having established this result, Costis and his coauthors presumed that the hardest part of the problem was behind them. However, another challenge awaited them. They still had to construct a continuous interpolation of their discrete function to satisfy the desired Lipschitz and smoothness properties in a computationally efficient manner. To understand the challenge with this, consider a simple two-dimensional example with two actions per agent. Suppose we are given prescribed values for <img alt="f(x,y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on all four vertices of <img alt="\{0,1\}^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E2&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and our goal is to construct a continuous and smooth function on <img alt="[0,1]^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D%5E2&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which matches the prescribed function values at the corners. A simple approach is to define <img alt="f(x,y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at any point <img alt="(x,y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> using a smooth interpolation of all four corners of <img alt="\{0,1\}^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E2&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This works, but does not scale to high dimensions. An approach that would scale computationally in high dimensions is to first triangulate <img alt="[0,1]^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D%5E2&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by chopping it along its main diagonal and then interpolate the function on each triangle separately. However, this simple approach fails since the gradient of the interpolated function can be discontinuous when crossing the diagonal. “This part turned out to be more technically challenging than we had thought in high dimensions,” says Costis. He and his coauthors overcame the issue by proposing a new <em>smooth and computationally efficient interpolation</em> scheme, which they expect will have more applications in transferring hardness results from discrete problems to continuous problems.</p>



<p>To obtain Theorem 1, the authors show that one can translate their complexity-theoretic hardness in the white-box model to an unconditional intractability result in the black-box model. This follows immediately from their reduction from Sperner to local Nash equilibrium. Indeed, finding local Nash equilibria in the min-max instance at the output of their reduction provides solutions to the Sperner instance at its input. Moreover, a single query (function value or gradient value) to the min-max objective requires <img alt="O(d)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28d%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> queries to the Sperner coloring circuit in order to be computed. Finally, it is known that, with black-box queries to the Sperner coloring circuit, exponentially many queries are necessary to compute a solution [<a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#HPV89">HPV89</a>, <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/feed/#Pap94">Pap94</a>]. An exponential black-box lower bound for local Nash equilibrium thus follows.</p>



<p>This proof architecture can be used more generally to prove intractability results for optimization problems involving smooth objectives. First, ignore the black-box model and focus on identifying the complexity class that captures the complexity of the problem in the white-box model. Then, focus on obtaining a hardness result for a discrete version of the problem. Once this is established, one can use the techniques presented in this work to lift this intractability from the discrete to the continuous problem. If there are black-box lower bounds for any problem residing in the complexity class for which the white-box version of the problem is hard, then these lower bounds can be composed with hardness reductions to establish lower bounds for the black-box version of the problem. As an aside, Costis mentions that it would be interesting if one could establish the lower bound of Theorem 1 in the black-box model directly, i.e., without going through the PPAD machinery.</p>



<h3>Looking forward</h3>



<p>Costis ends on an optimistic note: “While this might appear as a negative result, it really is a positive one.” Explaining further, he says that a philosophical consequence of his intractability results is that the multi-agent future of deep learning is going to have a lot of interesting “texture” — it will involve a large breadth of communities and motivate a plethora of problems at the interface of theoretical computer science, game theory, economics and machine learning. Costis envisions a change in balance in the multi-agent world: while recent successes of deep learning in single-agent problems capitalize on access to large data, unprecedented computational power, and effective inductive biases, multi-agent problems will demand much stronger inductive biases, invoking domain expertise in order to develop effective models and useful learning targets, as well as to discover algorithms that attain those targets.</p>



<p>Indeed, domain expertise has been crucial in some recent high-profile machine learning achievements in multi-agent settings: the AlphaGo agent for playing the game of Go and the Libratus agent for playing Texas Hold’em. For these, a game-theoretic understanding has been infused into the structure and training of the learning algorithm. In addition to using deep neural networks, AlphaGo uses a Monte Carlo tree search procedure to determine the best next move as well as to collect data for the training of the neural networks during self play, while Libratus uses counterfactual regret minimization to approximate the equilibrium of the game. The success of both algorithms required combining machine learning expertise with game-theoretic expertise about how to solve the games at hand.</p>



<p>More broadly, Costis urges young researchers to move beyond the classical statistical paradigm which assumes independent and identically distributed observations, and embrace learning challenges that are motivated from learning problems with state, incomplete or biased data, data with dependencies, and multi-agent learning applications. In particular, he would like to see more activity in obtaining new models and algorithms for reinforcement and multi-agent learning, better tools for high-dimensional learning problems with data bias and dependencies, as well as deeper connections to causal inference and econometrics. <em>“There is a lot of beautiful mathematics to be done and new continents to explore motivated by these challenges.”</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this talk, we will focus on the emerging field of (adversarially) robust machine learning. The talk will be self-contained and no particular background on robust learning will be needed. Recent progress in this field has been accelerated by the observation that despite unprecedented performance on clean data, modern learning models remain fragile to seemingly innocuous changes such as small, norm-bounded additive perturbations.  Moreover, recent work in this field has looked beyond norm-bounded perturbations and has revealed that various other types of distributional shifts in the data can significantly degrade performance.  However, in general our understanding of such shifts is in its infancy and several key questions remain unaddressed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The goal of this talk is to explain why robust learning paradigms have to be designed — and sometimes rethought — based on the geometry of the input perturbations.  We will cover a wide range of perturbation geometries from simple norm-bounded perturbations, to sparse, natural, and more general distribution shifts.  As we will show, the geometry of the perturbations necessitates fundamental modifications to the learning procedure as well as the architecture in order to ensure robustness. In the first part of the talk, we will discuss our recent theoretical results on robust learning with respect to various geometries, along with fundamental tradeoffs between robustness and accuracy, phase transitions, etc.  The remaining portion of the talk will be about developing practical robust training algorithms and evaluating the resulting (robust) deep networks against state-of-the-art methods on naturally-varying, real-world datasets.</p>

    <title>TR21-061 |  Reflections on Proof Complexity and Counting Principles | 

	Noah Fleming, 

	Toniann Pitassi</title>
    <summary>This paper surveys the development of propositional proof complexity and the seminal contributions of Alasdair Urquhart. We focus on the central role of counting principles, and in particular Tseitin's graph tautologies, to most of the key advances in lower bounds in proof complexity. We reflect on a couple of key ideas that Urquhart pioneered: (i) graph expansion as a tool for distinguishing between easy and hard principles, and (ii) ``reductive" lower bound arguments, proving via a simulation theorem that an optimal proof cannot bypass the obvious (inefficient) one.</summary>

    <title>How good is greed for the no-three-in-line problem?</title>
    <summary>The 37th European Workshop on Computational Geometry (EuroCG 2021) was earlier this month, but its book of abstracts remains online. This has an odd position in the world of academic publishing: the “abstracts” are really short papers, so it looks a lot like a published conference proceedings. However, it declares that you should really pretend that it’s not a proceedings, in order to allow the same work to go on to another conference with a published proceedings, getting around the usual prohibitions on double publication. Instead, its papers “should be considered a preprint rather than a formally reviewed paper”. But I think that doesn’t preclude citing them, with care, just as you might occasionally cite arXiv preprints. The workshop’s lack of peer review and selectivity is actually a useful feature, allowing it to act as an outlet for works that are too small or preliminary for publication elsewhere. In North America, the Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry performs much the same role, but does publish a proceedings; its submission deadline is rapidly approaching.</summary>

In North America, the <a href="http://cccg.ca/">Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry</a> performs much the same role, but does publish a proceedings; its <a href="https://projects.cs.dal.ca/cccg2021/the-call-for-papers-is-out/">submission deadline</a> is rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the EuroCG not-really-a-published-paper things is mine: “Geometric dominating sets – A minimum version of the no-three-in-line problem”, with Oswin Aichholzer and Eva-Maria Hainzl. As the title suggests, it’s related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-three-in-line_problem">no-three-in-line problem</a>, in which one must place as many points as possible in a grid so that no three are collinear. I’ve written about the same problem here <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/11/10/random-no-three.html">several</a> <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/11/12/gurobi-vs-no.html">times</a> <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/12/08/general-position-hypercube.html">already</a>. On an \(n\times n\) grid, there’s an easy upper bound of \(2n\) on the number of points, but it’s widely conjectured that the actual number is a smaller linear function of \(n\). It was a big step forward when Erdős showed that \(n\bigl(1-o(1)\bigr)\) points can be placed, and this was later improved to \(\tfrac{3}{2}n\bigl(1-o(1)\bigr)\).</p>

<p>These big no-three-in-line sets are constructed algebraically, but what if we try something simpler, a greedy algorithm that just adds points one by one (in a random or systematic order) until getting stuck? This question was already asked in the 1970s by Martin Gardner, and studied by several other authors since. But it is, if anything, even more frustratingly unknown than the no-three-in-line problem itself. We don’t know whether, in general, it’s possible to get stuck with fewer points than the maximum solution to the no-three-in-line problem, or even whether it’s possible to get stuck with fewer than \(2n\) points for infinitely many values of \(n\). For some values of \(n\) we do know smaller stuck solutions, though: for instance, here’s one with \(28\) points on a \(36\times 36\) grid.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A 28-point greedy solution to the no-three-in-line problem on a 36x36 grid" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/greedy-no3-36x36.svg"/></p>

<p>It was known that greedy solutions always have \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) points, and one of our main results is to improve this bound to \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\). The known \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) lower bound is easy to see: A single line through two selected points can cover at most \(n\) other grid points, so you need \(n\) lines to cover the whole grid, and you need \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) points to determine this many lines. With fewer points, there won’t be enough lines through your points to cover the whole grid, and your greedy solution won’t be stuck. Our new \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\) bound looks more carefully at the tradeoff between numbers of lines and numbers of points per line. It can be divided into two cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose, first, that the selected point set has the property that, for any selected point \(p\), the lines through \(p\) cover fewer than \(n^{4/3}\) grid points. Because each selected point covers few grid points, we need to select many points to cover the whole grid: at least \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\) points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose on the other hand that the lines through some point \(p\) cover at least  \(n^{4/3}\) grid points. Parameterize these lines by the \(L_\infty\) distance to the closest grid point (regardless of whether that point is one of the selected ones). Then there are \(O(k)\) lines with parameter \(k\), each of which covers \(O(n/k)\) grid points. Summing over small values of \(k\) shows that, even if we use lines that cover as many grid points as possible, we need  \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\) lines through \(p\) to cover this many grid points. Each of these lines is determined by another selected point, so we need \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\) selected points.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The actual proof in the paper takes into account that not all the grid points near \(p\) are the nearest on their line, and does the summation over small values of \(k\) more carefully, to get more precise constant factors in the bounds. Our paper also includes another variation of the problem in which we allow our selected points to be collinear but require the lines through them to cover all unselected points. There, we can make a little progress: we show that \(n\) points, or in some cases slightly fewer than \(n\) points, are sufficient. The same \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\) lower bound is still valid for this case, but there’s still a big gap between the lower bound and the upper bound.</p>

Just kidding. Of course they all are terrific choices. Here are some choices in previous years—going back a little while: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The new class joins Academy members elected before them, including Benjamin Franklin (elected 1781) and Alexander Hamilton (1791) in the eighteenth century; Ralph Waldo Emerson (1864), Maria Mitchell (1848), and Charles Darwin (1874) in the nineteenth; Albert Einstein (1924), Robert Frost (1931), Margaret Mead (1948), Groucho Marx (1951), Milton Friedman (1959), Martin Luther King, Jr. (1966), and Anthony Fauci (1991) in the twentieth. </em>

<p>Please join us for a virtual Google workshop on “<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/conceptualdlworkshop/home" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Conceptual Understanding of Deep Learning</a>” </p>



<p>When: May 17th 9am-4pm. Where: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5DGBWjiULQ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Live over Youtube</a>,</p>



<p><strong>Goal: </strong>How does the Brain/Mind (perhaps even an artificial one) work at an algorithmic level? While deep learning has produced tremendous technological strides in recent decades, there is an unsettling feeling of a lack of “conceptual” understanding of why it works and to what extent it will work in the current form. The goal of the workshop is to bring together theorists and practitioners to develop an understanding of the right algorithmic view of deep learning, characterizing the class of functions that can be learned, coming up with the right learning architecture that may (provably) learn multiple functions, concepts and remember them over time as humans do, theoretical understanding of language, logic, RL, meta learning and lifelong learning.</p>



<p>The speakers and panelists include Turing award winners Geoffrey Hinton, Leslie Valiant, and Godel Prize winner Christos Papadimitriou (<a href="https://sites.google.com/corp/view/conceptualdlworkshop/home" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">full-details</a>).   </p>



<p><strong>Panel Discussion: </strong>There will also be a panel discussion on the fundamental question of “Is there a mathematical model for the Mind?”. We will explore basic questions such as “Is there a provable algorithm that captures the essential capabilities of the mind?”, “How do we remember complex phenomena?”, “How is a knowledge graph created automatically?”, “How do we learn new concepts, function and action hierarchies over time?” and “Why do human decisions seem so interpretable?”<br/><br/>Twitter:<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ConceptualDLWorkshop&amp;src=recent_search_click" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> #ConceptualDLWorkshop</a>.

<hr/>

<p>The tutorial at ALT was given by <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shaymrn/">Shay Moran</a>, an assistant professor at the Technion in Haifa.
His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk910Aj559A">talk</a> focused on recent results showing a deep connection between two important areas in learning theory: online learning and differentially private learning. 
While online learning is a well-established area that has been studied since the invention of the Perceptron algorithm in 1954, differential privacy (DP) - introduced in the seminal work of Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith in 2006 <a href="https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/article/view/405"><strong>[DMNS06]</strong></a> - has received increasing attention in recent years from both theoretical and applied research communities along with industry and the government. 
This recent interest in differential privacy comes from a need to protect the privacy rights of the individuals, while still allowing one to derive useful conclusions from the dataset.
Shay, in a sequence of papers with co-authors Noga Alon, Mark Bun, Roi Livni, and Maryanthe Malliaris, revealed a surprising qualitative connection between these two models of learning: a concept class can be learned in an online fashion if and only if this concept class can be learned in an offline fashion by a differentially private algorithm.</p>

<p>The main objectives of this tutorial were to give an in-depth foray into this recent work, and present an opportunity to young researchers to identify interesting research problems at the intersection of these two fields. This line of work (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00949"><strong>[ALMM19]</strong></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00563"><strong>[BLM20]</strong></a>) - which has been primarily featured in general CS Theory conferences, including recently winning a best paper award at FOCS -  introduced several new techniques which could be of use to the machine learning theory community. The first part of this article focuses on the technical challenges of characterizing DP learnability and the solutions used in Shay’s work, which originate from combinatorics and model theory. In the rest of this article, we highlight some of the exciting open directions Shay sees more broadly in learning theory.</p>

<h2 id="background-pac-learning-online-learning-and-dp-pac-learning">Background: PAC Learning, Online Learning, and DP PAC Learning</h2>

<p>We begin by reviewing the classical setting of PAC learning. 
The goal of PAC learning is to learn some function from a <em>concept class</em> \(\mathcal{H} \), a set of functions from some domain \( \mathcal{X} \) to \( \{0, 1\} \). 
<img align="right" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/PACLearning.png" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"/> 
In the realizable setting of PAC learning, which we will focus on here, the learner is presented with \( n \) labeled training samples \( \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n} \) where \( x_i \in \mathcal{X} \) and \( y_i = h(x_i) \) for some function \( h \in \mathcal{H} \). While the learner knows the concept class \( \mathcal{H} \), the function \( h \) is unknown, and after seeing the \( n \) samples, the learner algorithm \( A \) must output some function \( \hat{h}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \{0, 1\} \). A concept class is <em>PAC-learnable</em> if there exists an algorithm \( A \) such that for any distribution over samples, as the number of labeled training samples goes to infinity, the probability that \( \hat{h} \) incorrectly labels a new random sample goes to 0. We will say that \( A \) is a <em>proper</em> learner if \( A \) outputs a function in \(\mathcal{H}\), while \( A \) is <em>improper</em> if it may output a function outside of \( \mathcal{H} \). More quantitative measures of learnability concern the exact number of samples \( n \) needed for the learner to correctly predict future labels with nontrivial probability.</p>

<p>DP PAC learning imposes an additional restriction on PAC learning: the learner must output a function which does not reveal too much about any one sample in the input. Formally, we say an algorithm \( A \) is \( (\varepsilon, \delta) \)-DP if for any two neighboring inputs \( X = (X_1, \cdots,  X_i, \cdots, X_n) \) and \( X’ = (X_1, \cdots, X_i’,\cdots, X_n) \) which differ at exactly one sample, for any set \( S \), \( \Pr[A(X) \in S] \leq e^\varepsilon Pr[A(X’) \in S] + \delta \) . A concept class is <em>DP PAC learnable</em> if it can be PAC-learned by a \( (0.1, o(1/n)) \)-DP algorithm \( A \). That is, changing any one training sample \( (x_i, y_i) \) should not affect the distribution over concepts output by \( A \) by too much.</p>

<p>Online learning considers a setting where the samples arrive one-by-one, and the learner must make predictions as this process unfolds. <img align="right" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/OnlineLearning.png" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"/>Formally, in realizable online learning, at each round \( i = 1,\dots,T \), the learner is presented with a sample \( x_i\). The learner must predict the label, and then the true label \( y_i \) is revealed to the learner. The sequence of examples \( x_i \) and the labels \( y_i \) may be chosen adversarially, but they must be consistent with some function \( h \in \mathcal{H} \). The goal of the learner is to minimize the total number of mistakes made by round \( T \), also called the <em>mistake bound</em>. If there is a learner such that at \( T \rightarrow \infty \), the number of mistakes is \( o(T) \), we say that the class of functions \( \mathcal{H} \) is <em>online learnable</em>. Because of the adversarial nature of the examples, online learning is well known to be much harder than PAC learning, and is possible precisely when the <em>Littlestone Dimension</em> of the concept class is finite. Figure 1 below illustrates the definition of the Littlestone Dimension. One important PAC-learnable concept class which is not online learnable is the infinite class of thresholds on \( \mathbb{R} \): The set of functions \(\{h_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}} \) where \( h_t(x) = \textbf{1}(x &gt; t) \).</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 1: Littlestone Dimension" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/LD.png" title="Figure 1: Littlestone Dimension"/></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: The Littlestone dimension is the maximum depth of a tree shattered by \( \mathcal{H} \), where each node may contain a unique element from \(\mathcal{X}\). The tree is shattered if each leaf can be labeled by a function in \(\mathcal{H} \) that labels each element on the path to the root according to the value of the edge entering it. In this figure, we show how the set of thresholds on \( [0, 1] \) shatters this tree of depth 3.</p>

<p>It’s worth taking a moment to understand intuitively why learning thresholds might be hard for both an online learner and a DP learner. In an online setting, suppose the adversary chooses the next example to be any value of \( x \) in between all previously 0-labeled examples and all 1-labeled examples. Then no matter what label \( A \) chooses, the adversary can say \( A \) was incorrect. In a DP setting, a simple proper learner that outputs a threshold that makes no errors on the training data will reveal too much information about the samples at the boundary of 0-labeled samples and 1-labeled samples.</p>

<h2 id="a-challenging-question">A Challenging Question</h2>

<p>The journey to characterizing DP PAC learnability started soon after the introduction of DP, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0924"><strong>[KLNRS08]</strong></a>, where the concept of DP PAC learning was introduced. This work primarily considered the more stringent <em>pure</em> DP-learning, where \( \delta = 0\). This work established that any finite concept class could be learned privately by applying the <em>exponential mechanism</em> (a standard technique in DP) to the empirical error of each candidate concept. Using the exponential mechanism, the learner could output each function \( h \in \mathcal{H}\) with probability proportional to \( \exp(- \varepsilon(\# \text{ of errors h on the training data})) \). This was sufficiently private because the empirical error is not too sensitive to a change of one training sample. Later works <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2224"><strong>[BNS14]</strong></a> combinatorially characterized the complexity of pure DP PAC learning in terms of a measure called <em>representation dimension</em>, showing that in some cases where PAC learning was possible, pure DP PAC learning was not. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07553"><strong>[BNSV15]</strong></a> further yielded lower bounds on the limits of proper DP PAC learning.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br/>
Both pure and proper DP learning though are significantly more stringent than improper DP learning, and proving lower bounds against an improper DP learner posed a serious challenge. Even the following simple-sounding question was unsolved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can an improper DP algorithm learn the infinite class of thresholds over [0, 1]? (*)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question stands at the center of Shay’s work, which unfolded while Shay was residing at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) at Princeton from 2017 to 2019.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> At the time, Shay was working on understanding the expressivity of limited mutual-information algorithms, that is, algorithms which expose little information about the total input. “If we were to have directly worked on this problem, I believe we wouldn’t have solved it,” Shay says. Instead, they came from the angle of mutual-information, a concept qualitatively similar to DP, but armed with a rich toolkit from 70 years of information theory. One of Shay’s prior works with Raef Bassily, Ido Nachum, Jonathan Shafer, and Amir Yehudayof established lower bounds on the mutual information of any proper algorithm that learns thresholds <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05233"><strong>[BMNSY18]</strong></a>, though this didn’t yet address the challenge presented by improper learners.</p>

<p>Unlike most lower bounds in theoretical computer science, proving hardness of learning the infinite class of thresholds on the line against an improper DP algorithm would require coming up with algorithm-specific distributions over samples. That is, instead of showing that one distribution over samples would be impossible to learn for all algorithms — in the way the a uniform distribution over the set in \(\mathcal{X}\) shattered by the concept class is hard to PAC-learn for any algorithm — they would have to come up with a distribution on \(\mathcal{X}\) specific to each candidate learning algorithm. Indeed, if the distribution was known to the learner, it was possible to devise a DP algorithm using the exponential mechanism (again!) which could learn any PAC-learnable concept class. Similar to the case of finite concept classes, here we can apply the exponential mechanism to some finite set of representative functions forming a cover of the concept class.</p>

<h2 id="uncovering-a-solution">Uncovering a Solution</h2>

<p>At the IAS, Shay met his initial team to tackle this obstacle: Noga Alon, a combinatorialist, Roi Livni, a learning theorist, and Maryanthe Malliaris, a model theorist. Shay and Maryanthe would walk together from IAS to their combinatorics class at Princeton taught by Noga and discuss mathematics. While Marayathe studied the abstract mathematical field of model theory, Shay and Maryanthe soon noticed a connection between model theory and machine learning: the Littlestone dimension. “There is applied math, then pure math, and then model theory is way over there,” Shay elaborates. “If theoretical machine learning is between applied math and pure math, model theory is on the other extreme.” This surprising interdisciplinary connection led them to use a result from model theory: a concept class had finite Littlestone Dimension precisely when the concept class had finite threshold dimension (formally, the maximum number of threshold functions that could be embedded in the class). This meant that answering (*) negatively was enough to show that DP PAC learning was as hard as online learning.</p>

<p>The idea for showing a lower bound for improper DP learning of thresholds came from Ramsey Theory, a famous area in combinatorics. Ramsey theory guarantees the existence of structured subsets among large, but arbitrary, combinatorial objects. A toy example of Ramsey Theory is that in any graph on 6 or more nodes, there must be a group of 3 nodes which form either a clique or an independent set. In the case of DP learning thresholds, the learning algorithm \( A \) is the arbitrary (and unstructured) combinatorial object. Ramsey Theory guarantees that for any PAC learner \( A \), there exists some large subset \( \mathcal{X}’ \) of the domain \(\mathcal{X}=[0, 1]\) on which \( A \) is close to behaving “normally”. The next step is to show that behaving normally contradicts differentially privacy. We’ll dig more technically into this argument in the next couple paragraphs. Note that we invent a couple definitions for the sake of exposition (“proper-normal” and “improper-normal”) that don’t appear in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07553"><strong>[BNSV15]</strong></a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00949"><strong>[ALMM19]</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start by seeing how a simpler version of this argument from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07553"><strong>[BNSV15]</strong></a> works to show that proper DP algorithms cannot learn thresholds. Recall that in a proper algorithm, after seeing \( n \) labeled samples, \( A \) must output a threshold. To be a PAC learner, if exactly half of the \( n \) samples are labeled \( 1 \) (which we will call a <em>balanced</em> sample), \( A \) must output a threshold between the smallest and largest sample with constant probability. Indeed, otherwise the empirical error of \( A \) will be too large to even hope to generalize. This implies that for a balanced list of samples \( S = [(x_1, 0), \ldots ,(x_{n/2}, 0), (x_{n/2+1}, 1), \ldots ,(x_n, 1)] \) (ordered by \(x\)-value), there must exist an integer \( k \in [n] \) for which with probability \( \Omega(1/n) \), \(A \) outputs a threshold in between 
\( x_k \) and \( x_{k+1} \). We’ll say that \( A \) is <em>\(k\)-proper-normal</em> on a set \( \mathcal{X}’ \) if for any balanced sample \( S \) of \( n \) points in \( \mathcal{X}’ \), \( A \) outputs a threshold in between the \(k\)th and \(k+1\)th ordered samples with probability \( \Omega(1/n) \). For example, the naive algorithm that always outputs a threshold between the 0-labeled samples and 1-labeled samples is \(n/2\)-normal on the entire domain \([0, 1]\). Ramsey theory guarantees that there is an arbitrary large subset of the domain \([0, 1]\) on which \(A \) is \(k\)-proper-normal for some \(k\). (See Figure 2).</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 2: Ramsey's Theorem" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/RamseyTheorem.png" title="Figure 2: Ramsey's Theorem"/>
<strong>Figure 2</strong>: Ramsey’s Theorem guarantees a large subset \( \mathcal{X}’ \) on which \( A \) is \( k \)-proper-normal for some \( k \).</p>

<p>The second part of the argument shows that being \( k \)-proper-normal on a large set is in direct conflict with differential privacy. We show this argument in Figure 3 by constructing a set of \( n \) samples \( S^* \) on which \( A \) must output a threshold in many distinct regions with substantial probability.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 3: A Hard Distribution" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/DP_Construction.png" title="Figure 2: Ramsey's Theorem"/></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A distribution showing the conflict between \(A \) being DP and \(k\)-proper normal. By DP, the behaviour of \(A\) on \(S^* \) must be similar to its behaviour on \(S_i\) for \(i = 1 \ldots \Omega(n).\) Namely, since \(S^* \) and \( S_i \) differ by at most two points, \( A(S^*) \) must output a threshold in \( I_i \) with probability \( p \geq (q - 2\delta)e^{-(2\varepsilon)} \) for each \( i \), where \( q \) is a lower bound on the probability that \( A(S_i) \) outputs a threshold in \( I_i \). Because \( A \) is \(k\)-proper-normal, \( q &gt; c/n \), so \( p = \Omega(1/n) \). This yields a contradiction for \( m &gt;1/p \) because \( A \) cannot simultaneously output a threshold in two of the intervals \( I_i \).</p>

<p>For the case of improper algorithms, Shay and his coauthors considered an alternative notion of normality, which we will term <em>improper-normal</em>. Recall that in this case the output \( A(S) \) of the learner on a sample \( S \) is <em>any function</em> from \( [0, 1] \) to \( \{0, 1\} \) and not necessarly a threshold. We’ll say that \( A \) is \(k\)-improper-normal on a set \( \mathcal{X}’ \) if for any balanced sample \( S = [(x_1, 0), \ldots, (x_{n/2}, 0), (x_{n/2 +1}, 1), \ldots,  (x_n, 1)] \) of \( n \) points in \( \mathcal{X}’, \Pr[A(S)(w) = 1] - \Pr[A(S)(v) = 1] &gt; \Omega(1/n) \) for any \( w \in (x_{k - 1}, x_k) \) and \( v \in  (x_k, x_{k + 1}) \) in \( \mathcal{X}’ \setminus \{x_1, … x_n\} \). To PAC learn, A must be \(k\)-improper-normal for some \(k\) on any set of \(n + 1\) points. Applying the same Ramsey Theorem to a graph with colored hyperedges of size \(n + 1\) shows that there must exist an arbitrarily large set \( \mathcal{X}’ \) on which \( A \) is \(k\)-improper normal for some \( k \). A similar (but more nuanced) argument as before shows that a learner cannot be simultaneously private and \(k\)-improper-normal on some distribution over \( \mathcal{X}’ \).</p>

<p>For the last piece of the puzzle, showing the upper bound converse, Mark Bun, an expert in differential privacy at Princeton at the time, joined in. Beginning in the fall of 2019, Mark, Shay, and Roi worked out an upper bound that showed that any class with finite Littlestone dimension could be learned privately. Their technique introduced a new notion of stability, called <em>global stability</em>, which is a property of algorithms that frequently output the same hypothesis. Given a globally stable PAC learner \( A \), to obtain a DP PAC learner, one can run \( A \) many times and produce a histogram of the output hypotheses, add noise to this histogram for the sake of privacy, and then select the most frequent output hypothesis. The construction for the globally stable learner uses the Standard Optimal Algorithm for online learning as a black box - though the reduction is very computationally intensive and results in a sample complexity depending exponentially on the Littlestone Dimension. This reduction was improved in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03893"><strong>[GGKM20]</strong></a>, where the authors gave a reduction requiring only polynomially many samples in the Littlestone dimension.</p>

<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>

<p>Shay mentions that these results are only a first step towards understanding differentially private PAC learning. This work establishes a deep connection between online learning and DP learning, qualitatively showing that these two problems have similar underlying complexity. Recent works <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11311"><strong>[GHM19]</strong></a> have gone a step further and established polynomial time reductions from DP learning to online learning under certain conditions. At the same time, Bun <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05665"><strong>[B20]</strong></a> demonstrates a computational gap between the two problems: they exhibit a concept class which is DP PAC learnable in polynomial time, but no algorithm can learn it online in polynomial time and sample complexity.</p>

<p>An interesting question here is whether a polynomial time online learning algorithm implies a polynomial time DP learning algorithm? With regards to sample complexity, tighter quantitative bounds relating the sample complexity of DP learning to the Threshold dimension and the Littlestone Dimension, along with constructive reductions from DP learning to online learning are wide open. An interesting conjecture, also highlighted in the talk, is whether DP PAC learning and PAC learning are actually equivalent up to a \(log*\) factor of the Littlestone dimension? Solving this would mean that for most natural function classes, one need not pay a very high price for private learning as compared to PAC learning.</p>

<p>From a more practical perspective, studying such qualitative equivalences can lay the groundwork allowing one to use the vast existing knowledge in the field of online learning to design better algorithms for DP learning, and vice versa. Despite its abstractness, Shay believes this result still has significance for engineers: “If they want to do something differentially privately, if they already have a good online learning algorithm for this, maybe they can modify it,” Shay says. “It gives some kind of inspiration.”</p>

<p>From a broader perspective, Shay believes that discovering clean, beautiful mathematical models that are more realistic than the PAC learning model and understanding the price one pays for privacy in those models are important directions for future research. One model, highlighted in the tutorial by Shay is that of <em>Universal Learning</em>, introduced in a recent work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04483"><strong>[BHMVY21]</strong></a> with Olivier Bousquet, Steve Hanneke, Ramon van Handel and Amir Yehudayoff. This model considers a learning task with a fixed distribution of samples and studies the hardness of the problem as the number of samples \( n \to \infty \). This setup better captures the practical aspects of modern machine learning and overcomes the limitations of the PAC model, which studies worst-case distributions for each sample size.</p>

<p>And how should one go about identifying such better mathematical models? “Pick the simplest problem that you don’t know how to solve and see where that leads you”, says Shay. One should begin by trying to understand the deficiencies of existing learning models, by identifying simple examples which go beyond these existing models. For example, Livni and Moran <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13508"><strong>[LM20]</strong></a> exhibit the limitations of PAC-Bayes framework through a simple 1D linear classification problem. Fixing such limitations can often lead one to discover better learning models.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Peter Singer, in the parable that came to represent his whole worldview and that of the effective altruism movement more generally, asked us to imagine that we could save a drowning child at the cost of jumping into a lake and ruining an expensive new suit.  Assuming we’d do that, he argued that we do in fact face an ethically equivalent choice; if we don’t donate most of our income to save children in the Third World, then we need to answer for why, as surely as the person who walked past the kid thrashing in the water.</p>



<p>In this post, I don’t want to take a position on Singer’s difficult but important hypothetical.  I merely want to say: suppose that to save the child, you didn’t even have to jump in the water.  Suppose you just had to toss a life preserver, one you weren’t using.  Or suppose you just had to assure the child that it was OK to grab your life raft that was already in the water.</p>



<p>That, it seems, is the situation that the US and other rich countries will increasingly face with covid vaccines.  What’s happening in India right now looks on track to become a humanitarian tragedy, if it isn’t already.  Even if, as Indian friends tell me, this was a staggering failure of the Modi government, people shouldn’t pay for it with their lives.  And we in the US now have tens of millions of vaccine doses sitting in warehouses unused, for regulatory and vaccine hesitancy reasons—stupidly, but we do.  We’re past the time, in my opinion, when it’s morally obligatory either to use the doses or to give them away.  Anyone in a position to manufacture more vaccines for distribution to poor countries, should also immediately get the intellectual property rights to do so.</p>



<p>I was glad to read, just this weekend, that the US is finally starting to move in the right direction.  I hope it moves faster.</p>



<p>And I’m sorry that this brief post doesn’t contain any information or insight that you can’t find elsewhere.  It just made me feel better to write it, is all.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-060 |  Optimal Error Resilience of Adaptive Message Exchange | 

	Raghuvansh Saxena, 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Gillat Kol</title>
    <summary>We study the error resilience of the message exchange task: Two parties, each holding a private input, want to exchange their inputs. However, the channel connecting them is governed by an adversary that may corrupt a constant fraction of the transmissions. What is the maximum fraction of corruptions that still allows the parties to exchange their inputs? 

For the non-adaptive channel, where the parties must agree in advance on the order in which they communicate, the maximum error resilience was shown to be $\frac{1}{4}$ (see Braverman and Rao, STOC 2011).
The problem was also studied over the adaptive channel, where the order in which the parties communicate may not be predetermined (Ghaffari, Haeupler, and Sudan, STOC 2014; Efremenko, Kol, and Saxena, STOC 2020). These works show that the adaptive channel admits much richer set of protocols but leave open the question of finding its maximum error resilience.

In this work, we show that the maximum error resilience of a protocol for message exchange over the adaptive channel is $\frac{5}{16}$, thereby settling the above question. Our result requires improving both the known upper bounds and the known lower bounds for the problem.</summary>

    <title>TR21-059 |  On One-way Functions from NP-Complete Problems | 

	Yanyi Liu, 

	Rafael Pass</title>
    <summary>We present the first natural $\NP$-complete problem whose average-case hardness w.r.t. the uniform distribution over instances implies the existence of one-way functions (OWF). In fact, we prove that the existence of OWFs is \emph{equivalent} to mild average-case hardness of this $\NP$-complete problem. The problem, which originated in the 1960s, is the \emph{Conditional Time-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity Problem}: let $K^t(x \mid z)$ be the length of the shortest ``program'' that, given the ``auxiliary input'' $z$, outputs the string $x$ within time $t(|x|)$, and let $\mcktp[t,\zeta]$ be the set of strings $(x,z,k)$ where $|z| = \zeta(|x|)$, $|k| = \log |x|$ and $K^t(x \mid z)&lt; k$, where, for our purposes, a ``program'' is defined as a RAM machine.

Our main results shows that for every polynomial $t(n)\geq n^2$, there exists some polynomial $\zeta$ such that $\mcktp[t,\zeta]$ is $\NP$-complete. We additionally observe that the result of Liu-Pass (FOCS'20) extends to show that for every polynomial $t(n)\geq 1.1n$, and every polynomial $\zeta(\cdot)$, mild average-case hardness of $\mcktp[t,\zeta]$ is equivalent to the existence of OWFs.</summary>

    <title>TR21-058 |  Average-Case Hardness of NP from Exponential Worst-Case Hardness Assumptions | 

	Shuichi Hirahara</title>
    <summary>A long-standing and central open question in the theory of average-case complexity is to base average-case hardness of NP on worst-case hardness of NP.  A frontier question along this line is to prove that PH is hard on average if UP requires (sub-)exponential worst-case complexity.  The difficulty of resolving this question has been discussed from various perspectives based on technical barrier results, such as the limits of black-box reductions and the non-existence of worst-case hardness amplification procedures in PH.

In this paper, we overcome these barriers and resolve the open question by presenting the following main results:

1.  $UP \not\subseteq DTIME(2^{O(n / \log n)})$ implies $DistNP \not\subseteq AvgP$.

2.  $PH \not\subseteq DTIME(2^{O(n / \log n)})$ implies $DistPH \not\subseteq AvgP$.

3.  $NP \not\subseteq DTIME(2^{O(n / \log n)})$ implies $DistNP \not\subseteq Avg_P P$.
Here, $Avg_P P$ denotes P-computable average-case polynomial time, which interpolates average-case polynomial-time and worst-case polynomial-time.  We complement this result by showing that $DistPH \not\subseteq AvgP$ if and only if $DistPH \not\subseteq Avg_P P$.

At the core of all of our results is a new notion of universal heuristic scheme, whose running time is P-computable average-case polynomial time under every polynomial-time samplable distribution.  Our proofs are based on the meta-complexity of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity: We analyze average-case complexity through the lens of worst-case meta-complexity using a new "algorithmic" proof of language compression and weak symmetry of information for time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity.</summary>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>



<p>Reinforcement learning has found success in a great number of fields because it is a very “natural framework” for interactive learning. It is based around the notion of experimenting with different behaviors in one’s environment and learning from mistakes to identify the optimal strategy. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding how to best optimize reinforcement learning algorithms when there is uncertainty about the agent’s environment and potential rewards. Therefore, it is important to develop a theoretical foundation about this to study generalization in reinforcement learning. The primary question these notes will address is as follows:</p>



<p><strong>What are necessary representational and distributional conditions that enable provably sample-efficient reinforcement learning?</strong></p>



<p>We will answer this question in the following parts.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Part I: Bandits &amp; Linear Bandits</strong> “Bandit problems” correspond to RL where the environment is reset in each step (horizon H=1). This captures the aspect of having an unknown reward function of RL, but does not capture the aspect of a changing environment based on agent’s actions. This part will be based on the papers <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/papers/ml/bandit_rates.pdf">Dani-Hayes-Kakade 08</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3995">Srinivas-Kakade-Krause-Seeger 10</a></li><li><strong>Part II: Lower Bounds</strong> RL is very much <em>not</em> a solved problem in neither theory nor practice. Even the RL analog of linear regression, when the expected reward is a linear function of the actions, is not solved. We will see that this is for a good reason: there is an exponential lower bound on the number of steps it takes to find a nearly-optimal policy in this case. This part is based on the recent paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01374">Weisz-Amortila-Szepesvári 20</a> and the follow-up <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12690">Wang-Wang-Kakade 21</a></li><li><strong>Interlude:</strong> Do these lower bounds matter in practice?</li><li><strong>Part III: Upper Bounds</strong> Given the lower bound, we see that to get positive results (aka <em>upper bounds</em> on the number of steps) we need to make strong assumptions on the structure of reqards. There have been a number of incomparable such assumptions used, and we will see that there is a way to unify them. This part is based on the recent paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10897">Du-Kakade-Lee-Lovett-Mahajan-Sun-Wang 21</a></li></ul>



<p>Before all of these parts, we will start by introducing the general framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and do a quick tour of generalization for static learning and RL.</p>



<h3>Markov Decision Processes: A Framework for Reinforcement Learning</h3>



<p>We have an agent in an environment at state <img alt="s_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that takes some action <img alt="a_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> which will observe some reward <img alt="r_{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and update the environment to state <img alt="s_{t+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_%7Bt%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>

<p><strong>We will deal with these problems by framing them in terms of generalization.</strong></p>



<h2>Part 0: A Whirlwind Tour of Generalization</h2>



<h3>Provable Generalization in Supervised Learning</h3>



<p>As we have seen in <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/01/31/a-blitz-through-classical-statistical-learning-theory/">the first lecture of this course</a>, generalization is possible in the supervised learning setting, when the data follows an i.i.d distribution.<br/>Specifically we have the following bound</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Occam’s Razor Bound (Finite Hypothesis Class):</strong> To learn a policy that is <img alt="\epsilon-" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>close to the best policy in a hypothesis class <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we need a number of samples that is <img alt="\mathcal{O} (\log(|\mathcal{F}|) / \epsilon^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D+%28%5Clog%28%7C%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%7C%29+%2F+%5Cepsilon%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p></blockquote>



<p>This means we can try lots of things on our data to see which hypotheses are <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-best. To handle infinite hypothesis classes, we can replace <img alt="\log |\mathcal{F}|" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+%7C%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%7C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with various other “complexity measures” to obtain generalization bounds such as:</p>



<ul><li>VC Dimension: <img alt="\mathcal{O} (\text{VC}(\mathcal{F}) / \epsilon^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D+%28%5Ctext%7BVC%7D%28%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%29+%2F+%5Cepsilon%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></li><li>Classification (Margin Bounds): <img alt="\mathcal{O} (\text{margin} / \epsilon^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D+%28%5Ctext%7Bmargin%7D+%2F+%5Cepsilon%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></li><li>Linear Regression: <img alt="\mathcal{O}(\text{dimension}/\epsilon^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%28%5Ctext%7Bdimension%7D%2F%5Cepsilon%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></li><li>Deep Learning: Algorithm also determines the complexity control</li></ul>



<p>Another way to say this is that in all of these cases, we can bound the generalization gap <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by a quantity of the form <img alt="O(\sqrt{d/n})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7Bd%2Fn%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is some “complexity measure” of the class <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the number of samples.</p>



<p>One reference for these generalization results in the supervised learning setting is the following <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall19/cos597B/lecnotes/bookdraft.pdf">book</a> by Sanjeev Arora and collaborators.</p>



<p>The key enabler of generalization in supervised learning is <em>data reuse</em>. For a given training set, we can in principle simultaneously evaluate the loss of all hypotheses in our class. For example, given the fixed ImageNet dataset, we can evaluate performance on any classifier. As we will see, this is not a property that will always hold in RL (when it does hold, sample-efficient generalization is likely to follow).</p>



<h3>Sample Efficient RL in the Tabular Case with few states and actions (No Generalization involved):</h3>



<p>Consider a tabular MDP setting where <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> , <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> denote the number of states, number of actions and length of the horizon respectively. Suppose we are operating in a setup where <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are both small. Suppose also that the MDP is <strong>unknown</strong>.</p>



<p>Our goal in such a setting is to find a <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-optimal policy <img alt="\pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that <img alt="V_{1}^{\pi}(s_1) \geq V_1^{\pi^\star}(s_1) - \epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_%7B1%7D%5E%7B%5Cpi%7D%28s_1%29+%5Cgeq+V_1%5E%7B%5Cpi%5E%5Cstar%7D%28s_1%29+-+%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="s_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the initial state (for concreteness let’s assume it is deterministic), and <img alt="\pi^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <strong>truly</strong> an optimal policy for this MDP. Since we assume the number of states and actions to be small, it is possible to explore the entire world, and finding such an <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-optimal policy is in principle possible. We thus do not have to consider any hypothesis class here (so no generalization involved), and can instead seek to be optimal under all possible mappings from states to actions.</p>



<p>Think for example of the following maze MDP, where the state of the world is the cell the agent is in and the action it can take at each state is a move to each of say 4 neighboring cells. Then, if we are able to get to every state and try every action there, we would have learned the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/BxUuayQ.png"/></figure>



<p>In this particular scenario, randomly exploring the world will allow us to learn the world. However, if we consider a modified random exploration strategy, where the probability of going left is significantly larger (say 5 times larger) than the probability of going right, then it will take exponential time to hit the goal state. In general, even for MDPs with small state and action spaces, a purely random exploration approach may be insufficient, as we may not be exploring the world enough. What alternative approach might we then adopt in order to achieve a sample-efficient learning algorithm?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/KearnsSinghE3.pdf"><strong>Theorem: (Kearns &amp; Singh ’98)</strong></a>. In the episodic setting, <img alt="poly(S,A,H,1/\epsilon)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=poly%28S%2CA%2CH%2C1%2F%5Cepsilon%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples suffice to find an <img alt="\epsilon-" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>opt policy, where <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the number of states, <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the number of actions, and <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the length of the horizon.</p></blockquote>



<p>The above breakthrough result was the first to demonstrate that learning an <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-opt policy is possible using just polynomially many samples. The key idea behind this is optimism and dynamic programming. In proving the result, the authors designed an algorithm called the E<img alt="^3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5E3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> algorithm (Explicit Explore or Exploit). The E<img alt="^3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5E3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> algorithm adopts a model-based approach, and relies on a “plan-to-explore” mechanism. As we act randomly, we will learn some part of the state space, and having learned this region well, we can thus accurately plan to escape it. This is where optimism comes in, since we give ourselves a bonus for escaping a region we know well.</p>



<p>Based on the Kearns and Singh result, there has been a number of followup works on the tabular MDP setting. One line of work seeks to improve on the precise factors in the sample complexity.</p>



<p><strong>Improvements on the sample complexity:</strong></p>

<p>Another line of work seeks to show that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning">Q-learning</a>, a model-free approach, can also achieve similar polynomial complexity, if an appropriate optimism bonus is incorporated.</p>

<p>As the range and technical depth of the above results demonstrate, even in the relatively simple tabular case, the problem is already challenging, and a precise sharp characterization of sample complexity is even more difficult. The chief source of difficulty is the unknown nature of the world (if the world was known, then we can just run dynamic programming).</p>



<h3>Provable Generalization in RL:</h3>



<p>Ultimately, we want to move beyond small tabular MDPs, where a polynomial dependence in the sample complexity on <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is acceptable, and achieve sample-efficient learning in big problems where the space space could be massive. Think for instance of the game of Go.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/DNHJgnJ.jpg"/></figure>



<p>In such a setting, requiring polynomially (in <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) many samples is clearly unacceptable. This gives rise to the following question.</p>



<p><strong>Question 1: Can we find an <img alt="\epsilon-" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>opt policy with no <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> dependence?</strong></p>



<p>In order to do so, it is necessary to reutilize data in some way since we will not be able to see all the possible states in the world. How then might we reuse data to estimate the value of all policies in a policy class <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? A naive approach is the following:</p>



<ul><li>Idea: Trajectory tree algorithm</li><li>Dataset Collection: Choose actions uniformly at random for all H steps in an episode.</li><li>Estimation: Uses importance sampling to evaluate every <img alt="f \in \mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/traj.pdf"><strong>Theorem: (Kearns, Mansour, &amp; Ng ’00)</strong></a> To find an <img alt="\epsilon-" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>best in class policy, the trajectory tree algorithm uses <img alt="O(A^H\log(|\mathcal{F}|)/\epsilon^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28A%5EH%5Clog%28%7C%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%7C%29%2F%5Cepsilon%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples.</p></blockquote>



<p>Observe that when <img alt="H = 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%3D+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (i.e. a contextual bandit) this is exactly the kind of generalization bound we saw in the Occam Razor’s bound for supervised learning. Since there may be stochasticity in the MDP, such that <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> could be infinite or even uncountable, this dependence on <img alt="A^H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5EH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a genuine improvement on the results for the tabular MDP setting which depended polynomially on <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In this sense, this really is a generalization result, since we are learning an <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-best in class policy without having seen the entire world (i.e. all the states in the world).<br/>We note that the result only has <img alt="\log(\mathcal{F}|)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%7C%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> dependence on hypothesis class size and similar to the supervised learning setting, there are VC analogues as well. However, we can not avoid the <img alt="A^H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5EH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> dependence to find an <img alt="\epsilon-" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>best-in-class policy agnostically (without assumptions on the MDP). To see why, consider a binary tree with <img alt="2^H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5EH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-policies and a sparse reward at a leaf node.</p>



<p>This <img alt="A^H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5EH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> dependence, while unavoidable without further assumptions, is clearly undesirable. This brings us to the following question.</p>



<p><strong>Question 2: Can we find an <img alt="\epsilon-" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>opt policy with no <img alt="S,A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%2CA&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> dependence and <img alt="poly(H,1/ \epsilon, \text{&quot;complexity measure&quot;})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=poly%28H%2C1%2F+%5Cepsilon%2C+%5Ctext%7B%22complexity+measure%22%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples?</strong></p>



<p>As we just saw, agnostically we cannot learn an <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-best-in-class policy without an <img alt="A^H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5EH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> dependence. However, as we will see it is possible when appropriate assumptions are made. But what is the nature of the assumptions under which this kind of sample-efficient RL generalization is possible (when there is no (or mild) dependence on <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>)? What assumptions are necessary? What assumptions are sufficient? We will seek to address these questions.</p>



<p>To do so, we start simple, and first look at the bandits and linear bandits problem, where the horizon <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is just 1. Note that this is still an interactive learning problem, just that we reset the episode after one time-step, and that it is an example of a problem with a potentially large action space.</p>



<h2>Part 1: Bandits and Linear Bandits</h2>



<h3>Multi-Armed Bandits:</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/LHEqOwn.png"/></figure>



<p>The multi-armed bandits algorithm is intimately interwoven with the theory of reinforcement learning. It is based around the question of how to allocate T tokens to A “arms” to maximize one’s return:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1952-58-05/S0002-9904-1952-09620-8/S0002-9904-1952-09620-8.pdf">Some Aspects of the Sequential Design of Experiments</a> – Robbins 1952</li><li><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/classes/cs294/s11/readings/Gittins:1979.pdf">Bandit Processes and Dynamic Allocations Indices</a> – Gittins 1979</li><li><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.674.1620&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Asymptotically Efficient Adaptive Allocation Rules</a> – Lai and Robbins 1985</li></ul>



<p>It is a very successful algorithm when <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is small. What can we do when <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is large?</p>



<h4>Large-Action Case:</h4>



<p>The bandits have to make a decision regarding which arm to pull. There is a widely used linear formulation of this problem that will assist us in understanding generalization. The <a href="http://phillong.info/publications/peval.pdf">linear bandit model</a> is successful in many applications (scheduling, ads, etc.)</p>



<p><strong>Linear (RKHS) Bandits:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Decision: <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; Reward: <img alt="r_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; Reward model:<br/><img alt="r_t = f(x_t) + \text{noise}; f(x) = w^\star \cdot \phi(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_t+%3D+f%28x_t%29+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bnoise%7D%3B+f%28x%29+%3D+w%5E%5Cstar+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></li><li>The hypothesis class <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a set of linear/RKHS functions (an overview of RKHS, which stands for Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space">here</a>).</li></ul>



<h4>Linear/Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB):</h4>



<p>The principle underlying the Linear Bandits algorithm is <strong>optimism in the face of uncertainty</strong>:<br/>Pick an input that maximizes the upper confidence bound:</p>



<p><img alt="x_t = \text{arg}\max_{x \in D} \mu_{t-1}(x) + \beta_t \sigma_{t-1}(x)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t+%3D+%5Ctext%7Barg%7D%5Cmax_%7Bx+%5Cin+D%7D+%5Cmu_%7Bt-1%7D%28x%29+%2B+%5Cbeta_t+%5Csigma_%7Bt-1%7D%28x%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Note that <img alt="\mu_{t-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu_%7Bt-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the best estimate of the ground-truth and <img alt="\sigma_{t-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma_%7Bt-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a standard deviation that we have to estimate. In choosing the term <img alt="\beta_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we have to navigate a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. As we can see, this algorithm will only pick plausible maximizers.</p>

<p>To prove the regret theorem above, we will require the following two lemmas.</p>

<p>We note that Lemma 2 actually depends on Lemma 1, since it assumes that <img alt="\mu^\star \in \text{BALL}_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu%5E%5Cstar+%5Cin+%5Ctext%7BBALL%7D_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for each <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, a property that Lemma 1 tells us happens with probability at least <img alt="1-\delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

<p>We now proceed to sketch out the proofs of Lemma 1 (confidence bound) and Lemma 2 (sum of squares regret bound). We begin with showing why Lemma 2 holds.</p>



<h4>Analysis and proof of Lemma 2 (sum of squares regret bound)</h4>



<p>Our first auxilliary result bounds the pointwise width of the confidence ball.</p>

<p><em><strong>Proof</strong></em>. The basic idea is to use “optimism”.

<p>This wraps up our discussion of Lemma 2.</p>



<h4>Analysis of Lemma 1 (Confidence bound)</h4>

<p>Equipped with the lemma above, we are now ready to prove Lemma 1, which we will restate here again.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Lemma 1 (Confidence):</strong> Let <img alt="\delta &gt; 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%3E+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

<p>We move on now to more challenging RL problems where the horizon <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is larger than 1, and explore lower bounds in this regime.</p>



<h2>Part 2: What are necessary assumptions for generalization in RL?</h2>



<h3>Approximate dynamic programming with linear function approximation</h3>



<p>We begin by considering generalization with a very natural assumption: suppose that the value function <img alt="Q(s,a)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%28s%2Ca%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be approximated by linear basis functions</p>



<p><img alt="\phi(s,a) = (\phi_1(s,a),\dots,\phi_d(s,a)), \quad \phi(s,a) \in \mathbb{R}^d." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29+%3D+%28%5Cphi_1%28s%2Ca%29%2C%5Cdots%2C%5Cphi_d%28s%2Ca%29%29%2C+%5Cquad+%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>We assume that the dimension of the representation, <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, is low compared the state and action dimensions. The idea of using a linear function approximation in RL and dynamic programming is not new, and had been explored in early works by Shannon (<a href="https://vision.unipv.it/IA1/ProgrammingaComputerforPlayingChess.pdf">“Programming a digital computer for playing chess.”, Philosophical Magazine, 1950</a>) as well as Bellman and Dreyfus (<a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2006/P1176.pdf">“Functional approximations and dynamic programming”, 1959</a>). There has also since been significant work on this approach, see e.g. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/203330.203343">Tesauro 1995</a>, <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~pucci/discountedLP.pdf">de Farias and Van Roy 2003</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4847">Wen and Van Roy 2013</a>.</p>



<p>One natural question that arises is this: <strong>what conditions must the representation <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> satisfy in order for this approach to work?</strong></p>



<p>We proceed by studying the simplest possible case: assuming that the optimal <img alt="Q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-function <img alt="Q_h^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_h%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is linearly realizable.</p>



<h4>RL with linearly realizable <img alt="Q_h^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_h%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> function approximation: does there exist a sample efficient algorithm?</h4>



<p>Suppose we have access to a feature map <img alt="\phi(s,a) \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Concretely, the assumption we consider is the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Assumption 1 (Linearly realizable <img alt="Q_h^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_h%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>)</strong>: Assume for all <img alt="s,a,h \in [H]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2Ca%2Ch+%5Cin+%5BH%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that there exists <img alt="w_1^\star,\dots,w_H^\star \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_1%5E%5Cstar%2C%5Cdots%2Cw_H%5E%5Cstar+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that<br/><img alt="Q_h^\star(s,a) = w_h^\star \cdot \phi(s,a)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_h%5E%5Cstar%28s%2Ca%29+%3D+w_h%5E%5Cstar+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p></blockquote>



<p>As an aside, with Assumption 1, we can consider the problem from a linear programming viewpoint. Note that:</p>



<ul><li>We have an underlying LP with <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> variables and <img alt="O(SA)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28SA%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> constraints.</li><li>The LP is specific to the dynamic programming problem at hand (and hence not general) because it encodes the Bellman optimality constraints.</li><li>We have sampling access (in the episodic setting).</li></ul>



<p>It may be tempting to think that Assumption 1 is sufficient to enable a sample-efficient algorithm for RL (if we assume we already know the representation <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>). However, that is <strong>not</strong> true, as the following theorem from a very recent work demonstrates:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01374"><strong>Theorem 1 (Weisz, Amortila, Szepesvári 2021):</strong></a> There exists an MDP and a representation <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> satisfying Assumption 1, such that any online RL algorithm (with knowledge of <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) requires <img alt="\Omega(\min(2^d,2^H))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28%5Cmin%282%5Ed%2C2%5EH%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples to output the value <img alt="V_1^\star(s_1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1%5E%5Cstar%28s_1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> up to constant additive error, with probability at least 0.9.</p></blockquote>



<p>While linear realizability alone is insufficient for sample efficiency in online RL, one might consider imposing further assumptions that could suffice for sample-efficient RL. One candidate assumption is to assume that at each state, the optimal action yields significantly more value than the next-best action:</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the following theorem shows that an exponential lower bound for online RL remains under <strong>both</strong> Assumption 1 and Assumption 2.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12690"><strong>Theorem 2 (Wang, Wang, Kakade 2021):</strong></a> There exists an MDP and a representation <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> satisfying both Assumption 1 and Assumption 2, such that any online RL algorithm (with knowledge of <img alt="\phi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) requires <img alt="\Omega(\min(2^d,2^H))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28%5Cmin%282%5Ed%2C2%5EH%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples to output the value <img alt="V_1^\star(s_1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1%5E%5Cstar%28s_1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> up to constant additive error, with probability at least 0.9.</p></blockquote>



<p><em><strong>Remark</strong></em>: We note a subtle distinction between the online RL setting and the simulator access setting. In the online RL setting, during each episode, we start at some state <img alt="s_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and the subsequent states we see are entirely dependent on the policy we choose and the environment dynamics. Meanwhile, in the simulator access setting, at each time-step, we are free to input <strong>any</strong> <img alt="(s,a)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28s%2Ca%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> pair, and the simulator will return the next state <img alt="s' \sim P(\cdot \mid s,a)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%27+%5Csim+P%28%5Ccdot+%5Cmid+s%2Ca%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, as well as the reward <img alt="r(s,a)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28s%2Ca%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. While Theorem 1 (when only Assumption 1 is satisfied) holds for both online RL and simulator access, Theorem 2 (when both Assumption 1 and Assumption 2 hold) is valid only in the online RL setting. In the simulator access setting, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03016">Du et al. 2019</a> proved that there exists a sample-efficient approach (i.e. polynomial in all relevant problem parameters) to find an <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-optimal policy, when both Assumption 1 and Assumption 2 hold. This demonstrates an <em>exponential separation</em> between the online RL and simulator access settings.</p>



<p>We next introduce the counterexample used to prove Theorem 2 in detail.</p>

<p>Above, we have a pictorial representation of the MDP family in the counterexample. We first describe its state and action spaces.</p>

<p>Before we proceed, we first recall the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which states that a set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension in such a way that the distances between the points are nearly preserved.</p>

<p>Equipped with the lemma above, we can now describe the transitions, features and rewards of the constructed MDP family.

The transition probabilities are set as follows:</p>

<p>After taking action <img alt="a_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the next state is either <img alt="\overline{a_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7Ba_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

<p>This means that proving (1) suffices to show that <img alt="a^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is always the optimal action.

<p><em><strong>Remark</strong></em>.

<p><strong>Proof sketch</strong>. We take an information-theoretic perspective.

The transition probabilities are also independent of <img alt="a^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, unless the action <img alt="a^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is taken, and the reward at state <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is always 0.

<p>A natural question to ask is this: are these exponential lower bounds in Part 2 (when we only assume linear realizability) actually relevant for practice?</p>



<p>To answer this, we take a brief detour into <em>offline RL</em>. In offline RL (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01643">Levine et al. 2020</a> for a survey), we assume that the agent has no direct access to the MDP, and is instead provided with a static dataset of transitions, <img alt="\mathcal{D} = {{s_h^i,a_h^i,r_h^i,s_{h+1}^i}_{h=1}^{H}}_{i=1}^m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D+%3D+%7B%7Bs_h%5Ei%2Ca_h%5Ei%2Cr_h%5Ei%2Cs_%7Bh%2B1%7D%5Ei%7D_%7Bh%3D1%7D%5E%7BH%7D%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Em&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (<img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> denotes number of independent episodes in the offline data). The goal here could be to learn a policy <img alt="\pi(a\mid s)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%28a%5Cmid+s%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (based on the static dataset <img alt="\mathcal{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) that attains the largest possible cumulative reward when applied to the MDP, or to evaluate the performance of some target policy <img alt="\pi(a \mid s)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%28a+%5Cmid+s%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> based on the offline data. We use <img alt="\pi_{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to denote the distribution over states and actions in <img alt="\mathcal{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, such that we assume the state-action tuples <img alt="(s,a) \in \mathcal{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28s%2Ca%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are sampled according to <img alt="s \sim d^{\pi_{\beta}}(s)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%5Csim+d%5E%7B%5Cpi_%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D%28s%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and the actions are sampled according to the behaviour policy, such that <img alt="a \sim \pi_{\beta}(a \mid s)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Csim+%5Cpi_%7B%5Cbeta%7D%28a+%5Cmid+s%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>Analogous to the online RL lower bound, the following theorem shows that linear realizability is also insufficient for sample-efficient evaluation of a target policy using offline data.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Theorem (informal, from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11895.pdf">Wang, Foster, Kakade 2020</a>))</strong>. In the offline RL setting, suppose the data distributions have (polynomially) lower bounded eigenvalues, and the <img alt="Q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-functions of every policy are linear with respect to a given feature mapping. Then, any algorithm requires an exponential number of samples in the horizon <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to output a non-trivially accurate estimate of the value of any given policy <img alt="\pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, with constant probability.</p></blockquote>



<p>Some remarks are in order. First, note that the above hardness result for policy evaluation also holds for finding near-optimal policies using offline data. For a simple reduction, consider an example where at the initial state, one action <img alt="a_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> leads to a fixed reward and another action <img alt="a_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> transits us to an instance which is hard to evaluate using offline data. Then, in order to find a good policy, it is necessary for the agent to approximately evaluate the value of the optimal policy in the hard instance. Second, an appropriate eigenvalue lower bound on the offline data distribution ensures that there is sufficient feature coverage in the dataset, without which linear realizability alone is clearly insufficient for sample-efficient estimation. Third, note that the representation condition in the theorem is significantly stronger than assuming than assuming realizability with regards to only a single target policy, and so the result carries over to the latter setting as well. Fourth, the key idea to prove the result is the error amplification (exponential in the horizon <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) induced by the <em>distribution shift</em> from the offline policy to the target policy we wish to evaluate.</p>



<p>Empirical work performed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04947.pdf">Wang et al. 2021</a> show that the these negative results do manifest themselves in experimental examples. The methology considered by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04947.pdf">Wang et al. 2021</a> is as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Decide on a target policy to be evaluated, along with a good feature mapping for this policy (could be the last layer of a deep neural network trained to evaluate the policy).</li><li>Collect offline data using trajectories that are a mixture of the target policy and another distribution (perhaps generated by a random policy).</li><li>Run offline RL methods to evaluate the target policy using feature mapping found in Step 1 and the offline data obtained in Step 2.</li></ol>



<p>We note that features extracted from pre-trained deep neural networks should be able to satisfy the linear realizibility assumption approximately (for the target policy). Moreover, the offline dataset is relatively favorable for evaluation of the target policy, since we would not expect realistic offline datasets to have a large number of trajectories from the target policy itself.</p>



<p>However, numerical results show substantial degradation in the accuracy of policy evaluation, even for a relatively mild distribution shift (e.g. where there is a 50/50 split in target policy and random policy in the offline data). As an example, consider the following plot.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/WUpg5nW.png"/></figure>



<p>The figure above depicts the performance of Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI) on Walker2d-v2, an environment from the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym">OpenAI gym benchmark suite</a> which has continuous action space. Here, the <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-axis is the number of rounds of FQI used, and the <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-axis is the square root of the mean squared error of the predicted values (smaller is better). The blue line corresponds to performance when the dataset is generated by the target policy itself with 1 million samples, and other lines correspond to the performance when adding more offline data induced by random trajectories. As we can see, adding more random trajectories lead to significant degradation of FQI. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04947.pdf">Wang et al. 2021</a> for more such experiments.</p>



<p>These empirical results seem to affirm the hardness results in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04947.pdf">Wang et al. 2021</a> (offline RL) and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12690.pdf">Wang, Wang, Kakade 2021</a> (online RL), in that the definition of a good representation in RL is more subtle than in supervised learning, and certainly goes beyond just linear realizibility.</p>



<h2>Part 3: Sufficient conditions for provable generalization in RL</h2>



<p>We have seen from Part 1 and Part 2 that finding an <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-optimal policy with mild (e.g. logarithmic) dependence on <img alt="S,A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%2CA&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="poly(H,1/\epsilon,\mbox{&quot;complexity measure&quot;})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=poly%28H%2C1%2F%5Cepsilon%2C%5Cmbox%7B%22complexity+measure%22%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples is <strong>NOT</strong> possible agnostically, or even with linearly realizable <img alt="Q^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This leads us to the following question.</p>



<p><strong>Q: What kind of assumptions enable provable generalization in RL?</strong></p>



<p>In fact, under various stronger assumptions, sample-efficient generalization <strong>is</strong> possible in many special cases. Amongst others, these include</p>

<p>What structural commonalities are shared between these underlying assumptions and models? To answer this question, we go back to the start, and revisit the case of linear bandits (<img alt="H=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> RL problem) for intuition.</p>



<h3>Intuition from properties satisfied by linear bandits</h3>



<p>We consider linear contextual bandits, where the context is <img alt="s \in\mathcal{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%5Cin%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the action is <img alt="a \in \mathcal{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D%2C+%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> denote the state (or context) and action space respectively. We assume as before that associated with each state-action pair is a representation <img alt="\phi(s,a) \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The observed reward is <img alt="r(s,a) = w^\star \cdot \phi(s,a) + \epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28s%2Ca%29+%3D+w%5E%5Cstar+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29+%2B+%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a mean-zero stochastic noise term. The hypothesis class is</p>



<p><img alt="\mathcal{F} = {f(s,a) = w(f) \cdot \phi(s,a), w(f) \in \mathcal{W}}," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D+%3D+%7Bf%28s%2Ca%29+%3D+w%28f%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29%2C+w%28f%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BW%7D%7D%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>where <img alt="\mathcal{W}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BW%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a subset of <img alt="\mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We let <img alt="\pi_f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> denote the greedy policy for <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, i.e.</p>



<p><img alt="\pi_f(s) = \mathrm{argmax}_{a} f(s,a)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_f%28s%29+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7Bargmax%7D_%7Ba%7D+f%28s%2Ca%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>An important structural property satisfied by linear contextual bandits is the following: <em>data reuse</em>. Indeed, the difference between any <img alt="f \in \mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and the observed reward <img alt="r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is estimable when we had in fact played <img alt="\pi_g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for some hypothesis <img alt="g \neq f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g+%5Cneq+f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Via direct calculation, we see that</p>



<p><img alt="\mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim \pi_g} [f(s,a) - r(s,a)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%28s%2Ca%29+%5Csim+%5Cpi_g%7D+%5Bf%28s%2Ca%29+-+r%28s%2Ca%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p><img alt="= \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim \pi_g} [w(f) \cdot \phi(s,a) - (w^\star \cdot \phi(s,a) + \epsilon)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%28s%2Ca%29+%5Csim+%5Cpi_g%7D+%5Bw%28f%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29+-+%28w%5E%5Cstar+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29+%2B+%5Cepsilon%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p><img alt="= \left\langle w(f) - w^\star, \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim \pi_g} [\phi(s,a)] \right\rangle." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D+%5Cleft%5Clangle+w%28f%29+-+w%5E%5Cstar%2C+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%28s%2Ca%29+%5Csim+%5Cpi_g%7D+%5B%5Cphi%28s%2Ca%29%5D+%5Cright%5Crangle.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Intuitively, assuming that <img alt="\pi_g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> induces “sufficient exploration” of the <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-dimensional representation space, this implies that we can evaluate the quality of any policy/hypothesis <img alt="f \in \mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> using just the one set of data collected by <img alt="\pi_g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This is <strong>precisely</strong> the kind of data reuse property we saw for supervised learning, which enables sample-efficient generalization there. This suggests that to ensure sample-efficient generalization in general RL, it may be fruitful to look for assumptions that enable data reuse. One special case where such data reuse is possible is the class of linear Bellman complete models.</p>



<h3>Special case: linear Bellman complete class</h3>



<p>Let <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be the length of each episode as before. We recall that a hypothesis class <img alt="\mathcal{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <strong>realizable</strong> for an MDP <img alt="\mathcal{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if there exists a hypothesis <img alt="f^\star \in \mathcal{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5E%5Cstar+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that</p>

<p>where <img alt="Q_h^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_h%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the optimal state-action value at time step <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

<p>This shows that data reuse is possible for any linear Bellman complete class <img alt="\mathcal{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, since any <img alt="f \in \mathcal{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be evaluated using offline data collected by some fixed policy <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>As an aside, note that linear Bellman completeness is a very strong condition that can break when new features are added. This is because adding new features expands the hypothesis space (of linear functions), and there is no guarantee that the new hypothesis class will again satisfy linear Bellman completeness.</p>



<p>It turns out that linear Bellman complete classes are just one example of Bilinear Classes (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10897.pdf">Du et al. 2021</a>), which encompass many RL models in which sample-efficient generalization has been shown to be possible.</p>

<p>Bilinear classes can be seen as a generalization of Bellman rank (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09512">Jiang et al. 2017</a>) and Witness rank (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08540">Wen et al. 2019</a>), which were previous works that sought to identify strucural commonalities between different RL models that enable sample-efficient generalization. That being said, there are still models (with known provable generalization) which Bilinear Classes does not cover. Two such exceptions are the deterministic linear <img alt="Q^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4847">Wen and Van Roy 2013</a>) model and the <img alt="Q^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-state aggregation model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06366">Dong et al. 2020</a>). On a heuristic level, the structural commonalities identified by the Bilinear Classes show that to a large extent, most RL models known to enable sample-efficient generalization resemble linear bandits, in that data reuse is possible. In this sense, understanding why generalization is possible in the linear bandit case gives one intuition for why generalization is possible in these other cases as well. On some level, this may be disappointing since we might hope to capture richer phenomenon than just linear bandits, but promisingly, there is a rich class of RL models which share these structural commonalities that enable generalization in RL (as the examples encompassed by the Bilinear Classes demonstrate).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>From the discussion above, we see that a generalization theory for RL, while significantly distinct from that for supervised learning, is still possible. However, natural assumptions that might seem adequate, such as linear realizability, are in fact insufficient, and much stronger assumptions are required. One such example of sufficient assumptions is the Bilinear Class, which covers a rich set of models. Moreover, as the empirical results we saw in the interlude show, these representational issues identified by theory are relevant for practice. For more on the theory of RL, see the following <a href="https://rltheorybook.github.io">forthcoming book</a>.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-057 |  Hardness of KT Characterizes Parallel Cryptography | 

	Hanlin Ren, 

	Rahul Santhanam</title>
    <summary>A recent breakthrough of Liu and Pass (FOCS'20) shows that one-way functions exist if and only if the (polynomial-)time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity K^t is bounded-error hard on average to compute. In this paper, we strengthen this result and extend it to other complexity measures:

1. We show, perhaps surprisingly, that the KT complexity is bounded-error average-case hard if and only if there exist one-way functions in constant parallel time (i.e. NC^0). This result crucially relies on the idea of randomized encodings. Previously, a seminal work of Applebaum, Ishai and Kushilevitz (FOCS'04; SICOMP'06) used the same idea to show that NC^0-computable one-way functions exist if and only if logspace-computable one-way functions exist.
	
2. Inspired by the above result, we present randomized average-case reductions among the NC^1-versions and logspace-versions of K^t complexity, and KT complexity. Our reductions preserve both bounded-error average-case hardness and zero-error average-case hardness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reduction between KT complexity and a variant of K^t complexity.

3. We prove tight connections between the hardness of K^t complexity and the hardness of (the hardest) one-way functions. In analogy with the Exponential-Time Hypothesis and its variants, we define and motivate the Perebor Hypotheses for complexity measures such as K^t and KT. We show that a Strong Perebor Hypothesis for K^t implies the existence of (weak) one-way functions of near-optimal hardness 2^{n-o(n)}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of one-way functions of near-optimal hardness based on a natural complexity assumption about a search problem.

4. We show that a Weak Perebor Hypothesis for MCSP implies the existence of one-way functions, and establish a partial converse. This is the first unconditional construction of one-way functions from hardness of MCSP over a natural distribution.

5. Finally, we study the average-case hardness of MKtP. We show that it characterizes cryptographic pseudorandomness in one natural regime of parameters, and complexity-theoretic pseudorandomness in another natural regime.</summary>

    <title>TR21-056 |  On the Possibility of Basing Cryptography on $\EXP \neq \BPP$ | 

	Yanyi Liu, 

	Rafael Pass</title>
    <summary>Liu and Pass (FOCS'20) recently demonstrated an equivalence between the existence of one-way functions (OWFs) and mild average-case hardness of the time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity problem. In this work, we establish a similar equivalence but to a different form of time-bounded Kolmogorov Complexity---namely, Levin's notion of Kolmogorov Complexity---whose hardness is closely related to the problem of whether $\EXP \neq \BPP$. In more detail, let $Kt(x)$ denote the Levin-Kolmogorov Complexity of the string $x$; that is, $Kt(x) = \min_{\desc \in \bitset^*, t \in \N}\{|\desc| + \lceil \log t \rceil: U(\desc, 1^t) = x\}$, where $U$ is a universal Turing machine, and $U(\desc,1^t)$ denotes the output of the program $\Pi$ after $t$ steps, and let $\mktp$ denote the language of pairs $(x,k)$ having the property that $Kt(x) \leq k$.
We demonstrate that:
- $\mktp \notin \HeurpBPP$ (i.e., $\mktp$ is infinitely-often \emph{two-sided error} mildly average-case hard) iff infinititely-often OWFs exist.
- $\mktp \notin \AvgpBPP$ (i.e., $\mktp$ is infinitely-often \emph{errorless} mildly average-case hard) iff $\EXP \neq \BPP$.
Thus, the only ``gap'' towards getting (infinitely-often) OWFs from the assumption that $\EXP \neq \BPP$ is the seemingly ``minor'' technical gap between two-sided error and errorless average-case hardness of the $\mktp$ problem. As a corollary of this result, we additionally demonstrate that any reduction from errorless to two-sided error average-case hardness for $\mktp$ implies (unconditionally) that $\NP \neq \P$. 

We finally consider other alternative notions of Kolmogorov complexity---including space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and conditional Kolmogorov complexity---and show how average-case hardness of problems related to them characterize log-space computable OWFs, or OWFs in $\NC^0$.</summary>

    <title>The Million Dollar Sermon</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Illinois Tech has one of the greatest origin stories for a university. In 1890 Frank Gunsaulus, a pastor on the south side of Chicago, gave a sermon where he said "If I had a million dollars I would build a school to provide students from all backgrounds meaningful roles in a changing industrial society". Philip Armour, a wealthy industrialist in the congregation, went up to Gunsaulus after the sermon and said, "if you give me five years for this school, I'll give you the million dollars". Thus started the Armour Institute of Technology which after some mergers became the Illinois Institute of Technology.</p><p>The "million dollar sermon" really happened, though the exact wording and even the exact year are lost to posterity or, as speculated, hidden in a cornerstone of one of the original campus buildings. </p><p>In 1890 we were in the beginnings of the second industrial revolution, a revolution of communication, transportation, electrification and soon the assembly line. The first revolution happened a century earlier with mechanization and the steam engine. The third revolution was computers and automation, and we are now in the early parts of the fourth industrial revolution, one based on data and information. </p><p>There are many parallels between 1890 and today. Like 1890, the private economy is dominated by a small number of large companies that have an outsized influence in our society. Like 1890, technology is changing faster than we can manage it. Like 1890, many workers are finding their skills quickly outdated.</p><p>Today Gunsaulus's words ring truer than ever. We more than ever need to provide students of all backgrounds meaningful roles in a changing technological society. </p></div>

Ken Regan started his Ph.D. 40 years ago from Oxford, in complexity theory, advised by Dominic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Welsh">Welsh</a>. Ken continues to be a researcher in complexity theory, a teacher of computer science, a mentor of graduate students, a writer of books and more. He has long been on the faculty of the <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/">Department of Computer Science</a> and Engineering at Buffalo. </p>
<p>
Today I thought I would thank Ken for his many wonderful accomplishments.<br/>
<span id="more-18622"/></p>
<p>
Ken is a great friend and long time co-author of mine. We also write this blog together. He has done many things—one colorful thing is the <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/papers/ComplexityPoster.jpg">poster</a>. Ken is a strong chess player—a chess International Master just below the grandmaster level and rated at 2372—roughly. </p>
<p>
We will highlight his continued work in complexity theory and his work in detecting chess cheating.</p>
<p/><h2> Complexity Theory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken and I have just released a second edition of our book on quantum algorithms: <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/introduction-to-quantum-algorithms-via-linear-algebra-second-edition_kenneth-w-regan_richard-j-lipton/26771326/item/44480377/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1PSDBhDbARIsAPeTqrd5GXdcE5MG1a_Ue1T4vDhz4_adZNPdNAslCRxsyFUroKj6AgxRGlkaAulSEALw_wcB#idiq=44480377&amp;edition=41576984"> Introduction to Quantum Algorithms Via Linear Algebra, Second Edition</a> </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Quantum computing explained in terms of elementary linear algebra, emphasizing computation and algorithms and requiring no background in physics. This introduction to quantum algorithms is concise but comprehensive, covering many key algorithms. It is mathematically rigorous but requires minimal background and assumes no knowledge of quantum theory or quantum mechanics. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I must add that Ken did the lion share of the work on writing this second edition.</p>

<p>Please note a special offer: Buy one, get another for full price. </p>
<p>
In another part of complexity theory, Ken has just had a paper accepted: <i>Multi-Structural Games and Number of Quantifiers</i> with Ronald Fagin, Jonathan Lenchner, and Nikhil Vyas. This will appear at <a href="http://easyconferences.eu/lics2021/">LICS 2021</a> this summer.</p>
<p>
The paper defines a new type of game that captures the number of quantifies needed for certain properties. This is neat—see the paper for details.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Chess Cheating—How? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The area of detecting chess cheating is one that Ken works in. Moreover he is perhaps the leader in the world. That is the leader in detecting when a player cheated at playing chess. </p>
<p>
What is this? In games like poker, games that rely on cards, it is long been an issue that people can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_poker">cheat</a>. Cards can be marked for example. The dealer can try and control what cards a player gets. These are ancient issues for card games. </p>
<p/><p/>

<p>
What is this for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_chess">chess</a>? The pieces cannot be marked to any advantage: a king is king, a pawn is a pawn and so on. But a player can cheat in a simple manner. They can use the moves of a computer program instead of their own. The problem in chess is that computer programs currently play at a level vastly higher than even a strong player. Stockfish, a top program, plays at around <a href="https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/">3551</a>. </p>
<p>
Recall Ken is around 2372. That places him via the Elo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_rating_system">rating</a> at IM: </p>
<ul>
<li>
2500-2700	most Grandmasters (GM) <p/>
</li><li>
2400-2500	most International Masters (IM) and some Grandmasters (GM) <p/>
</li><li>
2300-2400	most FIDE Masters (FM) and some International Masters (IM) <p/>
</li><li>
2200-2300	FIDE Candidate Masters (CM), most national masters
</li></ul>
<p>Note: the computer therefore plays much better than all known GM’s. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Chess Cheating—Detecting? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Enter Ken. He has been studying how to detect whether or not a player is using a computer’s moves rather than their own moves. He has worked on this for many years, with good success. Note: this is a real <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/16/chesss-cheating-crisis-paranoia-has-become-the-culture">problem</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In one chess tournament, five of the top six were disqualified for cheating. In another, the doting parents of 10-year-old competitors furiously rejected evidence that their darlings were playing at the level of the world No 1. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
An obvious idea is to not let a player have access to any computer. This is naive for several reasons: </p>
<ol>
<li>
A player can use their cellphone secretly—in the toilet? <p/>
</li><li>
A player could conceal the computer on themselves—computers are small? <p/>
</li><li>
A player could be playing chess online—impossible to stop them?
</li></ol>
<p/><p/>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Chess Cheating—How to Detect </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This led Ken to consider the following problem: Suppose that some player makes a series of moves during a game. Check how well their moves agree with Stockfish or some other computer program. Then claim the player cheated provided they agree too often with the program. </p>
<p>
This sounds simple. Compare the computer’s move and the player’s moves. If these agree too often then say the player has cheated.</p>
<p>
Simple. Unfortunately not. There are many complications: </p>
<ol>
<li>
In chess sometimes moves are “in book”. Especially at the beginning the best move may be well known. <p/>
</li><li>
In chess sometimes moves are “forced”. There may be a unique legal move. <p/>
</li><li>
A player may only use the computer when the position is “hard”. <p/>
</li><li>
The computer may suggest several moves. These moves may all be about the same quality.
</li></ol>
<p>Clearly all these make the problem—did the player cheat—complex. Difficult. A further complicating factor is that even a weak player will sometimes randomly agree with the computer. That is even a weaker player can make a great move. </p>
<p>
Perhaps the shock is that Ken has been able to build software that is able to correctly decide when a player cheated or not. His method is good enough that it is used in practice on real players. It has led to actual penalties on players, and has saved others from false claims. </p>
<p>
I must add that his software is quite impressive. The test to see if a player cheated involves the running of chess computer programs. These programs like <a href="https://stockfishchess.org">Stockfish</a> were made to be used by one player. They were not designed to be used as a subroutine in an automated search. Perhaps for a complexity theorist Ken might have a top ranking for writing the most real programs. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
Correction: Ken is 40th from Princeton as an undergrad. Ken is 35th from Oxford for Ph.D. See Ken on a 40th Reunion for Princeton Class of ’81 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1LDJZglNUg">panel</a>   [<b>Ken:</b> A one-word fix did the trick, changing “obtained” to “started” in the first sentence.  It’s a Trans-Pond-er difference: I count as ’81 both at Princeton and Oxford (Merton College) because the latter goes by the starting year.  The photo is from Glenveagh Castle, Ireland, on a June 2019 trip with my family.]</p>
<p>
Ken <a href="https://www.newser.com/story/297646/pandemic-has-caused-cheating-crisis-in-chess.html">says</a>: “The pandemic has brought me as much work in a single day as I have had in a year previously,” said Prof Kenneth Regan, an international chess master and computer scientist whose model is relied on by the sport’s governing body, FIDE, to detect suspicious patterns of play. “It has ruined my sabbatical.”</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: The Kannan-Lovasz and Simonovits (KLS) conjecture considers the following isoperimetric problem on high-dimensional convex bodies: Given a convex body <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, consider the optimal way to partition it into two pieces of equal volume so as to minimize their interface. Is it true that up to a universal constant, the minimal partition is attained via a hyperplane cut? Roughly speaking, this question can be thought of as asking “to what extent is a convex set a good expander”?</p>
<p>In analogy to expander graphs, such lower bounds on the capacity would imply bounds on mixing times of Markov chains associated with the convex set, and so this question has direct implications on the complexity of many computational problems on convex sets. Moreover, it was shown that a positive answer would imply Bourgain’s slicing conjecture.</p>
<p>Very recently, Yuansi Chen obtained a striking breakthrough, nearly solving this conjecture. In this talk, we will overview some of the central ideas used in the proof. We will start with the classical concept of “localization” (a very useful tool to prove concentration inequalities) and its extension, stochastic localization – the main technique used in the proof.</p></blockquote></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Borcherds">Richard Borcherds</a> is a British mathematician at Berkeley, who won the 1998 Fields Medal for the proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine">monstrous moonshine conjecture</a> among many other contributions.  A couple months ago, Borcherds posted on YouTube a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFhhQRxWTIM"><strong>self-described “rant” about quantum computing</strong></a>, which was recently making the rounds on Facebook and which I found highly entertaining.</p>



<p>Borcherds points out that the term “quantum supremacy” means only that quantum computers can outperform existing classical computers on <em>some</em> benchmark, which can be chosen to show maximum advantage for the quantum computer.  He allows that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson_sampling">BosonSampling</a> could have some value, for example in calibrating quantum computers or in comparing one quantum computer to another, but he decries the popular conflation of quantum supremacy with the actual construction of a scalable quantum computer able (for example) to run Shor’s algorithm to break RSA.</p>



<p>Borcherds also proposes a “teapot test,” according to which any claim about quantum computers can be dismissed if an analogous claim would hold for a teapot (which he brandishes for the camera).  For example, there are many claims to solve practical optimization and machine learning problems by “quantum/classical hybrid algorithms,” wherein a classical computer does most of the work but a quantum computer is somehow involved.  Borcherds points out that, at least as things stand in early 2021, in most or all such cases, the classical computer could’ve probably done as well entirely on its own.  So then if you put a teapot on top of your classical computer while it ran, you could equally say you used a “classical/teapot hybrid approach.”</p>



<p>Needless to say, Borcherds is correct about all of this.  I’ve made similar points on this blog for 15 years, although less Britishly.  I’m delighted to have such serious new firepower on the scoffing-at-QC-hype team.</p>



<p>I do, however, have one substantive disagreement.  At one point, Borcherds argues that sampling-based quantum supremacy itself fails his teapot test.  For consider the computational problem of predicting how many pieces a teapot will break into if it’s dropped on the ground.  Clearly, he says, the teapot itself will outperform any simulation running on any existing classical computer at that task, and will therefore achieve “teapot supremacy.”  But who cares??</p>



<p>I’m glad that Borcherds has set out, rather crisply, an objection that’s been put to me many times over the past decade.  The response is simple: <em>I don’t believe the teapot really does achieve teapot supremacy on the stated task!  At the least, I’d need to be shown why.  You can’t just assert it without serious argument.</em></p>



<p>If we want to mirror the existing quantum supremacy experiments, then the teapot computational problem, properly formulated, should be: given as input a description of a teapot’s construction, the height from which it’s dropped, etc., <em>output a sample from the probability distribution</em> over the number of shards that the teapot will break into when it hits the floor.</p>



<p>If so, though, then clearly a classical computer can easily sample from the same distribution!  Why?  Because presumably we agree that there’s a negligible probability of more than (say) 1000 shards.  So the distribution is characterized by a list of at most 1000 probabilities, which can be estimated empirically (at the cost of a small warehouse of smashed teapots) and thereafter used to generate samples.  In the plausible event that the distribution is (say) a Gaussian, it’s even easier: just estimate the mean and variance.</p>



<p>A couple days ago, I was curious what the distribution looked like, so I decided to order some teapots from Amazon and check.  Unfortunately, real porcelain teapots are <em>expensive</em>, and it seemed vaguely horrific to order dozens (as would be needed to get reasonable data) for the sole purpose of smashing them on my driveway.  So I hit on what seemed like a perfect solution: I ordered <em>toy</em> teapots, which were much smaller and cheaper.  Alas, when my toy “porcelain” teapots arrived yesterday, they turned out (unsurprisingly in retrospect for a children’s toy) to be some sort of plastic or composite material, meaning that they <em>didn’t</em> break unless one propelled them downward forcefully.  So, while I can report that they tended to break into one or two large pieces along with two or three smaller shards, I found it impossible to get better data.  (There’s a reason why I became a <em>theoretical</em> computer scientist…)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/teapot.jpg"/></figure>



<p>The good news is that my 4-year-old son had an absolute <em>blast</em> smashing toy teapots with me on our driveway, while my 8-year-old daughter was thrilled to take the remaining, unbroken teapots for her dollhouse.  I apologize if this fails to defy gender stereotypes.</p>



<p>Anyway, it might be retorted that it’s not good enough to sample from a probability distribution: what’s wanted, rather, is to calculate how many pieces this <em>specific</em> teapot will break into, given all the microscopic details of it and its environment.  Aha, this brings us to a crucial conceptual point: in order for something to count as an “input” to a computer, <em>you need to be able to set it freely</em>.  Certainly, at the least, you need to be able to measure and record the input in its entirety, so that someone trying to reproduce your computation on a standard silicon computer would know exactly which computation to do.  You don’t get to claim computational supremacy based on a problem with secret inputs: that’s like failing someone on a math test without having fully told them the problems.</p>



<p>Ability to set and know the inputs is <em>the</em> key property that’s satisfied by Google’s quantum supremacy experiment, and to a lesser extent by the USTC BosonSampling experiment, but that’s not satisfied at all by the “smash a teapot on the floor” experiment.  Or perhaps it’s better to say: influences on a computation that vary uncontrollably and chaotically, like gusts of air hitting the teapot as it falls to the floor, shouldn’t be called “inputs” at all; they’re simply <em>noise sources</em>.  And what one does with noise sources is to try to estimate their distribution and average over them—but in that case, as I said, there’s no teapot supremacy.</p>



<p>A Facebook friend said to me: that’s well and good, but surely we could change Borcherds’s teapot experiment to address this worry?  For example: add a computer-controlled lathe (or even a 3D printer), with which you can build a teapot in an arbitrary shape of your choice.  Then consider the problem of sampling from the probability distribution over how many pieces <em>that</em> teapot will smash into, when it’s dropped from some standard height onto some standard surface.  I replied that this is indeed more interesting—in fact, it already seems more like what engineers do in practice (still, sometimes!) when building wind tunnels, than like a silly reductio ad absurdum of quantum supremacy experiments.  On the other hand, <em>if</em> you believe the <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs191/fa08/lectures/lecture17.pdf">Extended Church-Turing Thesis</a>, then as long as your analog computer is governed by classical physics, it’s presumably inherently limited to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant">Avogadro’s number</a> type speedup over a standard digital computer, whereas with a quantum computer, you’re limited only by the exponential dimensionality of Hilbert space, which seems more interesting.</p>



<p>Or maybe I’m wrong—in which case, I look forward to the first practical demonstration of teapot supremacy!  Just like with quantum supremacy, though, it’s not enough to <em>assert</em> it; you need to … put the tea where your mouth is.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> On the suggestion of <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/">Ernest Davis</a>, who I can now reveal as the Facebook friend mentioned above, I just ordered some <a href="https://www.ssww.com/item/terra-cotta-pots-3-1-8-PL807/index.php?cid=3358&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw9_mDBhCGARIsAN3PaFOKHOxEAHqA-WjzGS5lFgass_iNz27V88AZdGe5e26GTsrJUX0ZNL4aAqOzEALw_wcB&amp;fbclid=IwAR1eBc9xXODJ3a15ukebh1loN9XNpl7aD2Xiihsb2H7JvZVBKLKC10OwIys">terra cotta flower pots</a>, which look cheap, easily smashable, and environmentally friendly, and which will hopefully be acceptable substitutes for porcelain teapots in a new experiment.  (Not that my main arguments in this post hinge on the results of such an experiment!  That’s the power of theory.)</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Another Update:</span></strong> Some of you might enjoy <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-quantum-computing-ever-live-up-to-its-hype/">John Horgan’s <em>Scientific American</em> column</a> on reality vs. hype in quantum computing, based on conversations with me and with Terry Rudolph of PsiQuantum.</p></div>
