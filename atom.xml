    <summary>One of the major open problems in complexity theory is proving super-logarithmic lower bounds on the depth of circuits (i.e., $\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^1$). Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson (Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995) suggested to approach this problem by proving that depth complexity behaves “as expected” with respect to the composition of functions $f \diamond g$. They showed that the validity of this conjecture would imply that $\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^1$.

Several works have made progress toward resolving this conjecture by proving special cases. In particular, these works proved the KRW conjecture for every outer function $f$, but only for few inner functions $g$. Thus, it is an important challenge to prove the KRW conjecture for a wider range of inner functions.

In this work, we extend significantly the range of inner functions that can be handled. First, we consider the $\textit{monotone}$ version of the KRW conjecture. We prove it for every monotone inner function $g$ whose depth complexity can be lower bounded via a query-to-communication lifting theorem. This allows us to handle several new and well-studied functions such as the $s\textbf{-}t$-connectivity, clique, and generation functions.

In order to carry this progress back to the $\textit{non-monotone}$ setting, we introduce a new notion of $\textit{semi-monotone}$ composition, which combines the non-monotone complexity of the outer function $f$ with the monotone complexity of the inner function $g$. In this setting, we prove the KRW conjecture for a similar selection of inner functions $g$, but only for a specific choice of the outer function $f$.</summary>

    <title>A table for Matrix Mortality- what I wanted for Hilbert's 10th problem</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/05/why-is-there-no-dn-grid-for-hilberts.html">this post</a> I speculated on why I could not find anywhere a table of which cases of Hilbert's 10th problem were solvable, unsolvable, and unknown. (I then made such a table. It was very clunky,  which may answer the question.)<br/>
<br/>
I told my formal lang theory class about Hilbert's 10th problem as a natural example of an undecidable question- that is, an example that had nothing to do with Turing Machines. On the final I asked<br/>
<br/>
<i>Give an example of an undecidable problem that has nothing to do with Turing Machines.</i><br/>
<br/>
Because of the pandemic this was a 2-day take home final which was open-book, open-notes, open-web. So they could have looked at my slides.<br/>
<br/>
And indeed, most of them did give Hilbert's 10 problem (more formally, the set of all polynomials in many vars over Z which have a Diophantine solution).<br/>
<br/>
But some did not. Some said there could never be such a problem (this is an incorrect answer), Some were incoherent. One just wrote ``Kruskal Trees''  (not sure if he was referring to MSTs or WQOs or to something that Clyde Kruskal did in class one day).<br/>
<br/>
One student said that the problem of, given a CFG G, is the complement of L(G) also CFG.<br/>
This is indeed undecidable and does not have to do with TMs. I doubt the student could have proven that. I doubt I could have proven that. I do not doubt that my advisor Harry Lewis could have proven that, and indeed I emailed him asking for a proof and he emailed me a sketch, which I wrote out in more detail <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/COURSES/452/S20/notes/undcfg.pdf">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The most interesting answer was given by some students who apparently looked at the web (rather than at my slides) for lists of problems and found the following called Matrix Mortality:<br/>
<br/>
{ (M_1,...,M_L) : such that some product of these matrices (you are allowed to use a matrix many times) is the 0 matrix}<br/>
<br/>
Why was this the most interesting? The TA did not know this problem was undecidable until he saw it on the exams and looked it up. I did not know it was undecidable until my TA told me.<br/>
<br/>
I then raised the question: How many matrices to you need and how big do their dimensions have to be?<br/>
<br/>
Unlike H10, there IS a table of this. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0644">this paper</a> they have such a table. I state some results:<br/>
<br/>
Undecidable:<br/>
6 matrices, 3x3<br/>
4 matrices, 5x5<br/>
3 matrices 9x9<br/>
2 matrices 15x15<br/>
<br/>
Decidable<br/>
2 matrices 2x2<br/>
<br/>
So there are some gaps to fill, but there is not the vast gulf that exists between dec and undec for Hilberts 10th problem. I also note that the paper was about UNDEC but mentioned the DEC results, where as the papers on H10 about UNDEC seem to never mention the DEC.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad to know another natural Undec problem and I will likely tell my students about it next spring. And much like H10, I won't be proving it.<br/>
<br/>
An open problem in education: how come some of my students got it wrong? gave an answer that was not in my notes or slides? One student told me it was easier to google<br/>
<br/>
<i>Natural Undecidable Questions</i><br/>
<br/>
then look through my slides. Another one said:<br/>
<br/>
<i>In class you said `this is a natural undecidable problem'.</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
<i>On the exam you said `a problem that does not mention Turing Machines'</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
<i>I did not know they were the same. </i><br/>
<br/>
That student submitted the Matrix problem stated above. It IS a fair point that `natural' is an<br/>
undefined term.  But the problem on the final used the well defined concept `does not mention Turing Machines'<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Mouawad</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01673">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the Token Jumping problem we are given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and two
independent sets $S$ and $T$ of $G$, each of size $k \geq 1$. The goal is to
determine whether there exists a sequence of $k$-sized independent sets in $G$,
$\langle S_0, S_1, \ldots, S_\ell \rangle$, such that for every $i$, $|S_i| =
k$, $S_i$ is an independent set, $S = S_0$, $S_\ell = T$, and $|S_i \Delta
S_{i+1}| = 2$. In other words, if we view each independent set as a collection
of tokens placed on a subset of the vertices of $G$, then the problem asks for
a sequence of independent sets which transforms $S$ to $T$ by individual token
jumps which maintain the independence of the sets. This problem is known to be
PSPACE-complete on very restricted graph classes, e.g., planar bounded degree
graphs and graphs of bounded bandwidth. A closely related problem is the Token
Sliding problem, where instead of allowing a token to jump to any vertex of the
graph we instead require that a token slides along an edge of the graph. Token
Sliding is also known to be PSPACE-complete on the aforementioned graph
classes. We investigate the parameterized complexity of both problems on
several graph classes, focusing on the effect of excluding certain cycles from
the input graph. In particular, we show that both Token Sliding and Token
Jumping are fixed-parameter tractable on $C_4$-free bipartite graphs when
parameterized by $k$. For Token Jumping, we in fact show that the problem
admits a polynomial kernel on $\{C_3,C_4\}$-free graphs. In the case of Token
Sliding, we also show that the problem admits a polynomial kernel on bipartite
graphs of bounded degree. We complement these positive results by showing that,
for any constant $p \geq 4$, both problems are W[1]-hard on $C_\ell$-free
graphs, where $4 \leq \ell \leq p$, and Token Sliding remains W[1]-hard even on
bipartite graphs.

variety of real-world applications. One of the most well-studied optimization
problems for dense subgraph discovery is the densest subgraph problem, where
given an edge-weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E,w)$, we are asked to find
$S\subseteq V$ that maximizes the density $d(S)$, i.e., half the weighted
average degree of the induced subgraph $G[S]$. This problem can be solved
exactly in polynomial time and well-approximately in almost linear time.
However, a densest subgraph has a structural drawback, namely, the subgraph may
not be robust to vertex/edge failure. Indeed, a densest subgraph may not be
well-connected, which implies that the subgraph may be disconnected by removing
only a few vertices/edges within it. In this paper, we provide an algorithmic
framework to find a dense subgraph that is well-connected in terms of
vertex/edge connectivity. Specifically, we introduce the following problems:
given a graph $G=(V,E,w)$ and a positive integer/real $k$, we are asked to find
$S\subseteq V$ that maximizes the density $d(S)$ under the constraint that
$G[S]$ is $k$-vertex/edge-connected. For both problems, we propose
polynomial-time (bicriteria and ordinary) approximation algorithms, using
classic Mader's theorem in graph theory and its extensions.

    <title>Minimizing Convex Functions with Integral Minimizers</title>

integral minimizer inside a box with radius $R$, we show how to efficiently
find a minimizer of $f$ using at most $O(n (n + \log(R)))$ calls to
$\mathsf{SO}$. When the set of minimizers of $f$ has integral extreme points,
our algorithm outputs an integral minimizer of $f$. This improves upon the
previously best oracle complexity of $O(n^2 (n + \log(R)))$ obtained by an
elegant application of [Frank and Tardos, Combinatorica 1987] due to Dadush. We
conjecture that our oracle complexity is tight up to constant factors.
</p>
<p>Our result immediately implies a strongly polynomial algorithm for the
Submodular Function Minimization problem that makes at most $O(n^3)$ calls to
an evaluation oracle. This improves upon the previously best $O(n^3 \log^2(n))$
oracle complexity for strongly polynomial algorithms given in [Lee, Sidford and
Wong, FOCS 2015] and [Dadush, V{\'e}gh and Zambelli, SODA 2018], and an
exponential time algorithm with oracle complexity $O(n^3 \log(n))$ given in the
former work, answering two open problems posted therein.
</p>
<p>Our result is achieved by an application of the LLL algorithm [Lenstra,
Lenstra and Lov\'asz, Math. Ann. 1982] for the shortest lattice vector problem.
We show how an approximately shortest vector of certain lattice can be used to
reduce the dimension of the problem, and how the oracle complexity of such a
procedure is advantageous compared with the method that uses the Frank-Tardos
framework. Our analysis of the oracle complexity is based on a potential
function that captures simultaneously the size of the search set and the
density of the lattice. To achieve the $O(n^2)$ term in the oracle complexity,
technical ingredients from convex geometry are applied.

isoperimetric profile of a planar domain measures the minimum perimeter needed
to inscribe a shape with prescribed area varying from 0 to the area of the
domain. While this profile has proven valuable for evaluating properties of
geographic partitions, existing algorithms for its computation rely on
aggressive approximations and are still computationally expensive. In this
paper, we propose a practical means of approximating the isoperimetric profile
and show that for domains satisfying a "thick neck" condition, our
approximation is exact. For more general domains, we show that our bound is
still exact within a conservative regime and is otherwise an upper bound. Our
method is based on a traversal of the medial axis which produces efficient and
robust results. We compare our technique with the state-of-the-art
approximation to the isoperimetric profile on a variety of domains and show
significantly tighter bounds than were previously achievable.

Regression that achieves statistically optimal convergence rate under mild
distributional assumptions. Concretely, we assume our data is drawn from a
$k$-hypercontractive distribution and an $\epsilon$-fraction is adversarially
corrupted. We then describe an estimator that converges to the optimal
least-squares minimizer for the true distribution at a rate proportional to
$\epsilon^{2-2/k}$, when the noise is independent of the covariates. We note
that no such estimator was known prior to our work, even with access to
unbounded computation. The rate we achieve is information-theoretically optimal
and thus we resolve the main open question in Klivans, Kothari and Meka
[COLT'18]. Our key insight is to identify an analytic condition relating the
distribution over the noise and covariates that completely characterizes the
rate of convergence, regardless of the noise model. In particular, we show that
when the moments of the noise and covariates are negatively-correlated, we
obtain the same rate as independent noise. Further, when the condition is not
satisfied, we obtain a rate proportional to $\epsilon^{2-4/k}$, and again match
the information-theoretic lower bound. Our central technical contribution is to
algorithmically exploit independence of random variables in the
"sum-of-squares" framework by formulating it as a polynomial identity.

showed that if the union of supply and demand graphs is planar, then the cut
condition is sufficient for routing demands. Okamura-Seymour showed that if all

routing demands. We consider a common generalization of these settings where
the end points of each demand are on the same face of the planar graph. We show
that if the source sink pairs on each face of the graph are such that sources
and sinks appear contiguously on the cycle bounding the face, then the flow cut
gap is at most 3. We come up with a notion of approximating demands on a face
by convex combination of laminar demands to prove this result.

maximizing $x^TAx$ subject to the constraint $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. This problem,
called MaxQP by Charikar and Wirth [FOCS'04], generalizes MaxCut and has
natural applications in data clustering and in the study of disordered magnetic
phases of matter. Charikar and Wirth showed that the problem admits an
$\Omega(1/\lg n)$ approximation via semidefinite programming, and Alon,
Makarychev, Makarychev, and Naor [STOC'05] showed that the same approach yields
an $\Omega(1)$ approximation when $A$ corresponds to a graph of bounded
chromatic number. Both these results rely on solving the semidefinite
relaxation of MaxQP, whose currently best running time is
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}\cdot \min\{N,n^{1.5}\})$, where $N$ is the number of nonzero
entries in $A$ and $\tilde{O}$ ignores polylogarithmic factors.
</p>
<p>In this sequel, we abandon the semidefinite approach and design purely
combinatorial approximation algorithms for special cases of MaxQP where $A$ is
sparse (i.e., has $O(n)$ nonzero entries). Our algorithms are superior to the
semidefinite approach in terms of running time, yet are still competitive in
terms of their approximation guarantees. More specifically, we show that:

</p>
<p>- MaxQP admits an $\Omega(1/\lg a_{\max})$-approximation in $O(n^{1.5} \lg
a_{\max})$ time, where $a_{\max}$ is the maximum absolute value in $A$, when
the corresponding graph is $d$-degenerate.
</p>
<p>- MaxQP admits a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation in $O(n)$ time when the
corresponding graph has bounded local treewidth.
</p>

the corresponding graph is $H$-minor-free.

</p>
<p>Recently, Bhaskara et al. (NeurIPS 2019) showed how to adapt the classical
$k$-means++ algorithm to the setting with outliers. However, their algorithm
needs to output $O(\log (k) \cdot z)$ outliers, where $z$ is the number of true
outliers, to match the $O(\log k)$-approximation guarantee of $k$-means++. In
this paper, we build on their ideas and show how to adapt several sequential
and distributed $k$-means algorithms to the setting with outliers, but with
substantially stronger theoretical guarantees: our algorithms output
$(1+\varepsilon)z$ outliers while achieving an $O(1 /
\varepsilon)$-approximation to the objective function. In the sequential world,
we achieve this by adapting a recent algorithm of Lattanzi and Sohler (ICML
2019). In the distributed setting, we adapt a simple algorithm of Guha et al.
(IEEE Trans. Know. and Data Engineering 2003) and the popular $k$-means$\|$ of
Bahmani et al. (PVLDB 2012).
</p>
<p>A theoretical application of our techniques is an algorithm with running time
$\tilde{O}(nk^2/z)$ that achieves an $O(1)$-approximation to the objective
function while outputting $O(z)$ outliers, assuming $k \ll z \ll n$. This is
complemented with a matching lower bound of $\Omega(nk^2/z)$ for this problem
in the oracle model.

    <title>A Method for Fast Computing the Algebraic Degree of Boolean Functions</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1593993600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bakoev:Valentin.html">Valentin Bakoev</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01116">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The algebraic degree of Boolean functions (or vectorial Boolean functions) is
an important cryptographic parameter that should be computed by fast
algorithms. They work in two main ways: (1) by computing the algebraic normal
form and then searching the monomial of the highest degree in it, or (2) by
examination the algebraic properties of the true table vector of a given
function. We have already done four basic steps in the study of the first way,
and the second one has been studied by other authors. Here we represent a
method for fast computing (the fastest way we know) the algebraic degree of
Boolean functions. It is a combination of the most efficient components of
these two ways and the corresponding algorithms. The theoretical time
complexities of the method are derived in each of the cases when the Boolean
function is represented in a byte-wise or in a bitwise manner. They are of the
same type $\Theta(n.2^n)$ for a Boolean function of $n$ variables, but they
have big differences between the constants in $\Theta$-notation. The
theoretical and experimental results shown here demonstrate the advantages of
the bitwise approach in computing the algebraic degree - they are dozens of
times faster than the byte-wise approaches.

arbitrary graph $G$, and that enumerate in output all the (inclusion-wise)
maximal "subgraphs" of $G$ which fulfil a given property $\Pi$. All over this
paper, we study several different properties $\Pi$, and the notion of subgraph
under consideration (induced or not) will vary from a result to another.
</p>
<p>More precisely, we present efficient algorithms to list all maximal split
subgraphs, sub-cographs and some subclasses of cographs of a given input graph.
All the algorithms presented here run in polynomial delay, and moreover for
split graphs it only requires polynomial space. In order to develop an
algorithm for maximal split (edge-)subgraphs, we establish a bijection between
the maximal split subgraphs and the maximal independent sets of an auxiliary
graph. For cographs and some subclasses , the algorithms rely on a framework
recently introduced by Conte &amp; Uno called Proximity Search. Finally we consider
the extension problem, which consists in deciding if there exists a maximal
induced subgraph satisfying a property $\Pi$ that contains a set of prescribed
vertices and that avoids another set of vertices. We show that this problem is
NP-complete for every "interesting" hereditary property $\Pi$. We extend the
hardness result to some specific edge version of the extension problem.

They are not.</p>

<p>Wikipedia has <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wankel_Cycle_anim_en.gif">a good visualization of how Wankel engines work</a>, which I’ve copied below. They go through the same four steps as a conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-stroke_engine">four-stroke combustion engine</a>, in which a piston pulls away from the combustion chamber, sucking in a mixture of fuel and air, pushes back towards the chamber, compressing the mixture, ignites the mixture, pushing the piston back out and applying force to the drive shaft, and then pushes back towards the chamber, pushing the exhaust out. The difference is that in a Wankel engine, these four steps happen at four different locations within the combustion chamber, as the gases within it are pushed around by a curved triangular piston, the rotor of the engine.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Animation of a Wankel engine by Y tambe from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wankel_Cycle_anim_en.gif" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/animated-wankel.gif"/></p>

<p>The driveshaft in the engine is the fixed smaller gear in the center of the animation; in the actual engine, this gearwheel would itself be spinning, but this is not shown. The triangular rotor connects to the driveshaft by an eccentric planetary gear, and spins around the driveshaft like a hula hoop around a spinning dancer. The gears have teeth and radii in the ratio 3:2, causing the driveshaft to spin three times faster than the rotor. As it does so, the three corners of the rotor (the “apex seals”) stay in contact with the outer wall of the engine, called its stator, so that the gases in the engine do not leak between different phases.</p>

<p>The shape of the stator is not determined by the curve of the rotor itself, but only by the trajectory of the moving apex seals. This trajectory is a curve called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitrochoid">epitrochoid</a>. If you’ve ever played with a spirograph, you know what an epitroichoid is: it’s what you get by fixing one circular disk, letting another circular disk rotate around it, placing a point somewhere within the rotating disk, and tracing the curve that it follows. Here’s <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EpitrochoidIn3.gif">another Wikipedia animation</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Animation of an epitrochoid by Sam Derbyshire from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EpitrochoidIn3.gif" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/animated-epitrochoid.gif"/></p>

<p>Different ratios of radii between the inner and outer disk give you different numbers of lobes in the curve, and different placements of the moving point in the outer disk (closer to or farther from the disk center) give you curves that are closer to a circle or more curvy. Placing the moving point on the outer circle itself gives you pointy rather than curvy epitrochoids, and placing it even farther out turns the inner bulges of these curves into self-crossing loops.</p>

<p>Spirograph trajectories differ from rotating apex seal trajectories in at least three ways: in the Wankel engine, the central circle (the driveshaft) rotates rather than being held stationary, the outer circle (the planetary gear) surrounds the central circle rather than being outside it, and the point whose motion is being traced (the apex seal) is outside the outer circle rather than inside it. Nevertheless, the shape is still a two-lobed epitrochoid; see the “double generation theorem” of the Bernoullis, as described by Nash,<sup id="fnref:nash"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/07/05/shape-wankel-rotor.html#fn:nash">1</a></sup> for why the same curve can be generated in multiple ways. Modulo the scale of the whole system, there is one free parameter controlling the precise shape of this epitrochoid: the ratio of the distances from the center of the rotor to the apex seals and to the planetary gear. If the apex seals are too close in, the planetary gear will bash into into the stator; if they are too far out, the stator will be close to circular and there will be little change in pressure from one part of the combustion cycle to another, losing engine efficiency. The choice made in actual engines is not the one that places the apex seals as close as possible, but seems to involve more careful optimization that considers the shape and size of the regions formed by the rotor and stator at different stages of the combustion cycle.</p>

<p>Once the stator shape has been determined, one can then proceed to answer the question we started with: what is the shape of the rotor? The main design constraint is that it should touch or at least stay close to the inner bulge of the stator (on its “side seals”), to prevent exhaust gas from flowing back around to the intake. The shape that achieves this can be understood by a thought experiment in which we imagine the rotor as somehow being fixed in space while the vehicle containing it rotates around it, rather than vice versa. As the vehicle rotates, its stator passes through parts of the space that cannot be occupied by the rotor. The parts of space that remain untouched by the rotating stator are available to be used by the rotor, and should be used by it if we want a rotor that stays in contact with the stator on its side seals. Mathematically, this is described as an “envelope” of the positions of the rotating stator with respect to the fixed rotor. This envelope is a curved triangle, but not a Reuleaux triangle. Its curves are flatter than a Reuleaux triangle’s arcs, but also they are not circular arcs. As an envelope of algebraic curves, they are presumably algebraic themselves, but of higher order; trigonometric formulas are given by Shung and Pennock.<sup id="fnref:sp"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/07/05/shape-wankel-rotor.html#fn:sp">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In practice, the rotor shape varies from its ideal envelope-of-epitrochoid form, in a couple of different ways. First, as Drogosz explains,<sup id="fnref:drogosz"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/07/05/shape-wankel-rotor.html#fn:drogosz">3</a></sup> for ease of manufacturing it is often approximated by circular arcs rather than exactly following the envelope shape. As long as the approximation stays within the envelope, the rotor will avoid colliding with the stator, and the side seal contact is not so important near the corners of the triangle, so that’s where the approximation is most noticeable. Second, real Wankel rotors often have scoops taken out from the middles of their sides, to form mini-combustion chambers that guide and shape the combustion gases within the engine.</p>

    <title>TR20-098 |  Impossibility of Derandomizing the Isolation Lemma for all Families | 

	Rohit Gurjar, 

	Thomas Thierauf, 

	Manindra Agrawal</title>
    <summary>The Isolation Lemma states that when random weights are assigned to the elements of a finite set $E$, then in any given family of subsets of $E$, exactly one set has the minimum weight, with high probability. In this note, we present two proofs for the fact that it is impossible to efficiently derandomize the Isolation Lemma for arbitrary families.

The first proof is from Chari, Rohatgi and Srinivasan and uses the potential method. An alternate proof is due to the first author of this note. It uses the polynomial method. However, it is not written anywhere. The main purpose of this note is to present that proof. Additionally we show that the above lower bounds are almost tight with respect to various parameters.</summary>

John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did not use Zoom. Their correspondence, from 1777 up to their deaths hours apart on July 4, 1826, fills a 600-page <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adams-Jefferson-Letters-Complete-Correspondence-Jefferson/dp/0807842303">book</a>. </p>
<p>
Today, Independence Day in the US, we consider the kind of intellectual fireworks represented by the correspondence.</p>
<p>
Jefferson and Adams were intellectual opposites as well as political rivals. Adams favored a strong central government to bridle human passions, whereas Jefferson’s support for the French Revolution continued beyond its devolution into the Reign of Terror. They debated many other points of politics, philosophy, and culture. </p>
<p>
Abigail Adams, the wife of John, joined in some of the exchanges. Because she often stayed in Massachusetts while he was in Philadelphia or New York or elsewhere, the husband and wife exchanged many letters—over 1,100 in all. His letter to her on July 3, 1776, instituted the use of fireworks to celebrate anniversaries of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>
Today there is not much in the way of fireworks displays. Most have been canceled because we cannot allow crowds to view them. In the Buffalo area, some townships are having small displays with limited access, and some displays are being set on high points for possible area viewing. So we felt we should write about fireworks of a different kind, a kind that is not restricted by the pandemic and might thrive through it. But first we’ll make a point about the history of fireworks.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Fireworks: Ancient, Early, and Modern </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Fireworks go back at least 1,100 years to China, where chemists discovered the fun of stuffing volatile compounds into tubes of bamboo or paper and setting them off. Some have pyrotechnics going back another 1,000 years, to about 200 BCE, insofar as bamboo was known to pop with a loud sound when dried and heated. Gunpowder traveled best of the compounds and made its way into Europe at least by the 1200s. The first recorded wide-scale fireworks display in England was in 1486 for the wedding of King Henry VII to Elizabeth of York, which ended the Wars of the Roses. Shakespeare mentions fireworks in <em>Love’s Labours Lost</em>. The Mughals in India from the 1500s to the 1800s made fireworks a diversion for noble women on the Diwali holiday:</p>

<p>
Our point is that 1776 isn’t even halfway back to the beginning of using fireworks for celebrations, even just in the West. Can we even call it “Early”? Lavish displays to mark major events were common by the mid-1700s. A royal display in 1749 was accompanied by orchestral music commissioned from George Frideric Handel and went ahead despite rain. Over 12,000 people also paid to attend the main rehearsal six days earlier, many braving an hours-long traffic jam on approaches to the London Bridge. That feels quite modern to us. Adams’s <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-02-02-0016">letter</a> mentioned other social features we know today:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The pandemic has curtailed others of these. The major North American team sports have not resumed either. Some parades have been run in “reverse” mode: the floats and performers stay put while spectators drive by slowly in cars.</p>
<p>
Adams’s letter has another, earlier, passage that chills today. The letter begins by saying that the Declaration was supposed to have been made in December, 1775, and enumerates plans the colonies had made contingent on this. He then says that what caused the plans to be aborted was an outbreak of disease:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> All these Causes however in Conjunction would not have disappointed Us, if it had not been for a Misfortune, which could not be foreseen, and perhaps could not have been prevented, I mean the Prevalence of the small Pox among our Troops. . . . This fatal Pestilence compleated our Destruction.—It is a Frown of Providence upon Us, which We ought to lay to heart. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The ellipsis is in the letter—as Ken’s children have pointed out, trailing off thought with dots in letters or e-mails or Facebook posts or texts is a distinctive habit of us older folk. Thus a specific outbreak of a contagious disease changed our history then as now.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ideas: Ancient, Early, and Modern </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/some-real-and-some-virtual-news/">remarked</a> on how the pandemic has affected opportunities to exchange ideas and how to compensate. One impacted series that both of us intended to visit this spring has been the series of workshops at the Simons Institute in Berkeley. </p>
<p>
Still, the Simons Foundation has continued its other ways to stimulate ideas. Here we offer our congratulations to Venkatesan Guruswami, Omer Reingold, and David Woodruff, who have just been <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/simons-investigators/?tab=awardees&amp;filter_years=2020">appointed</a> as Simons investigators for 2020. </p>
<p>
In briefly talking about their work, we want to make a point about how the pandemic enables <em>taking the long view</em> of ideas—in a way that appointments such as these promote. It is easy to get wrapped up in immediate aspects of a current hot problem and not be aware that it has a history. The history may not involve exactly the same ideas as the problem, but related ideas whose importance was appreciated much earlier. “Early” may not mean the Middle Ages or the 1700s as with fireworks, but it can mean times before any of us were born.</p>
<p>
Venkatesan and Omer and David each have done some stellar research, broadly in various parts of theory. They each have many results, but we thought we would highlight just one result each. We picked a result that we think is representative, is deep, is beautiful, and is one that we personally admire the most.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> “Ancient” Times </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
Venkatesan did important work on a problem that was created before complexity theory existed. Our favorite is his ground-breaking work on list decoding.</p>
<p>
What is the best way to encode data to protect it against various kinds of errors? This is still open. But Venkatesan changed the landscape. </p>
<p>
The questions about error correcting codes go back to the 1940’s. Usually the first results are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">credited</a> to Richard Hamming in 1947. Soon the notion of list decoding was introduced. The cool idea is that doing not require an answer, but allow a list of possible answers. The hope is that with other information about the message we might be able to select <i>the</i> answer.</p>
<p>
Venkatesan and Ken’s colleague Atri Rudra found explicit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_decoding">codes</a> that achieve list-decoding capacity, that is, they have optimal redundancy. </p>
<p>
What we like so much is the model is so natural and so powerful. There are many applications of list decoding to complexity theory. See Madhu Sudan’s <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/madhu/papers/noneed/ifip-journ.ps">survey</a> for some additional comments. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Early Times </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
Omer did his most important work on problems that were first studied in the early days of complexity theory. Our favorite is his beautiful work on small-memory deterministic graph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL_(complexity)">walks</a>. </p>
<p>
Is <img alt="{\mathsf{L &lt; NL}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BL+%3C+NL%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{L &lt; NL}}"/>? This is still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NL_(complexity)">open</a>. But Omer made a huge contribution to our understanding of fundamental complexity classes. Romas Aleliunas, Dick Karp, Laszlo Lovasz, and Charlie Rackoff proved earlier that random small space could navigate undirected graphs provided they could flip coins. In a sense Omer removed the coins to get his result that undirected graph connectivity is in <img alt="{\mathsf{L}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BL%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{L}}"/>. The previous result was easy—I can say that because I (Dick) was a co-author on it—but Omer’s theorem is deep.</p>
<p>
Omer’s <a href="https://omereingold.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/sl.pdf">proof</a> drew heavily on expander graphs and the zig-zag product from his earlier work with Salil Vadhan and Avi Wigderson for creating them. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Modern Times </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
David did his most important work on problems that were only created relatively recently. Our favorite is his work on approximately <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dwoodruf/www/knw10b.pdf">counting</a> distinct elements. This work is joint with Daniel Kane and Jelani Nelson and appeared at PODS 2010. It was the first streaming algorithm with an optimal combination of space usage and update time. Here is the relevant table from their paper (KNW):</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/algtable.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17261" height="163" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/algtable.jpg?w=500&amp;h=163" width="500"/></a></p>
<p>
Streaming algorithms are relatively new and parts of data science are newer. But working with data is old, as old as codes. This finally leads us to pose an outlandish question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Can all of this work be usefully interpreted from the standpoint of coding theory? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This is outlandish, because the word “code” does not even appear in either Reingold’s paper or KNW. But part of holding coding theory to be a paradigm, as both Ken and I experienced in graduate school, is that its perspective should expand. Is this capable of creating intellectual fireworks? We’ll see.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>

Have a safe and happy fourth of July.</p>

distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a
new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence
guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not
covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this
result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance
to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that
complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new
step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show
state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave
distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.

    <title>A Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme For A NP-Hard Problem</title>

to a particular non-convex case: assert the inclusion of the intersection of a
set of balls with equal radii in another ball with a different radius. Given a
certain condition on the radii is met, our method can decide if the inclusion
happens or not. The condition on the radii can be seen as a generalization of
linear programming. Next we apply the results to approximate the solution of a
NP-hard problem.

    <title>Efficient Document Exchange and Error Correcting Codes with Asymmetric Information</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Cheng:Kuan.html">Kuan Cheng</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Li:Xin.html">Xin Li</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00870">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study two fundamental problems in communication, Document Exchange (DE)
and Error Correcting Code (ECC). In the first problem, two parties hold two
strings, and one party tries to learn the other party's string through
communication. In the second problem, one party tries to send a message to
another party through a noisy channel, by adding some redundant information to
protect the message. Two important goals in both problems are to minimize the
communication complexity or redundancy, and to design efficient protocols or
codes.
</p>
<p>Both problems have been studied extensively. In this paper we study whether
asymmetric partial information can help in these two problems. We focus on the
case of Hamming distance/errors, and the asymmetric partial information is
modeled by one party having a vector of disjoint subsets $\vec{S}=(S_1, \cdots,
S_t)$ of indices and a vector of integers $\vec{k}=(k_1, \cdots, k_t)$, such
that in each $S_i$ the Hamming distance/errors is at most $k_i$. We establish
both lower bounds and upper bounds in this model, and provide efficient
randomized constructions that achieve a $\min\lbrace O(t^2), O\left((\log \log
n)^2\right) \rbrace $ factor within the optimum, with almost linear running
time.
</p>
<p>We further show a connection between the above document exchange problem and
the problem of document exchange under edit distance, and use our techniques to
give an efficient randomized protocol with optimal communication complexity and
\emph{exponentially} small error for the latter. This improves the previous
result by Haeupler \cite{haeupler2018optimal} (FOCS'19) and that by Belazzougui
and Zhang \cite{BelazzouguiZ16} (FOCS'16). Our techniques are based on a
generalization of the celebrated expander codes by Sipser and Spielman
\cite{sipser1996expander}, which may be of independent interests.

directly perform gates between arbitrary pairs of qubits, which is unlikely to
be practical for large-scale experiments. Power-law interactions with strength
decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ in the distance $r$ provide an experimentally
realizable resource for information processing, whilst still retaining
long-range connectivity. We leverage the power of these interactions to
implement a fast quantum fanout gate with an arbitrary number of targets. Our
implementation allows the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and Shor's algorithm
to be performed on a $D$-dimensional lattice in time logarithmic in the number
of qubits for interactions with $\alpha \le D$. As a corollary, we show that
power-law systems with $\alpha \le D$ are difficult to simulate classically
even for short times, under a standard assumption that factoring is classically
intractable. Complementarily, we develop a new technique to give a general
lower bound, linear in the size of the system, on the time required to
implement the QFT and the fanout gate in systems that are constrained by a
linear light cone. This allows us to prove an asymptotically tighter lower
bound for long-range systems than is possible with previously available
techniques.

Naturally, I’ve learned a lot about how to use this platform—one that, despite numerous quirks and flaws, <em>actually works</em> well enough that it could probably replace at least 2/3 of in-person talks and meetings after the covid crisis is over.  But one particular lesson is so important that I thought I’d make a public service announcement of it.  So without further ado:</p>



<p><strong>Email the link.</strong></p>



<p>You know, the thing like</p>



<p>https://us02web.zoom.us/jblahblah</p>



<p>that you actually click to get to the actual conversation.  <em>Definitely</em> email the link to the speaker (!).  But also email it to whomever said they plan to attend.  Resend the link between a day and an hour in advance, so that it doesn’t get buried, but turns up right away when people search their inboxes.  If possible, put the link in <em>every single email</em> about the meeting or lecture.  Even if you already sent the link for previous iterations of the meeting and it hasn’t changed, send it again.  Don’t assume people will find the link on the web.  Don’t make them click through five other links or open an attached PDF for it.  Don’t send ten emails that explain every possible detail of the meeting except how to get to it.  Just <strong>email the link.</strong>  That’s all.  Thanks!</p></div>

<p>As <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2018/02/20/research-masters/">I wrote before</a>, for students that discovered their interest in theoretical CS late in their undergrad, or perhaps after they graduated, a research Masters, can be a great option. This is particularly the case if the program is funded (i.e., students get a stipend and don’t need to pay tuition). Such programs are not common in the U.S., but there are some excellent choices around the world.</p>



<p>Since (as far as I know) there is no single source listing such programs, I thought a crowdsourced Google spreadsheet might be useful and so created one here: <a href="http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters" rel="nofollow">http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters</a></p>



<p>If you know of more places, please fill out this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/qfnbEZYYYDtFCDpx9" rel="nofollow">https://forms.gle/qfnbEZYYYDtFCDpx9</a> </p></div>

    <p>Dubious journal publisher MDPI provides special-issue editors with some number of no-publication-charge slots, but requires that priority for these slots be given to first-world scholars, because they are the ones with “more abundant scientific research resources” (read: funds to pay publication charges). This didn’t sit well with three environmental health failure researchers, who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/16/failure-fails-as-publisher-privileges-the-privileged/">resigned their guest editorship over it</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104363585936972806"/>, <a href="https://wash.leeds.ac.uk/what-the-f-how-we-failed-to-publish-a-journal-special-issue-on-failures/">see also</a>).</p>

Ritchie’s doctoral committee signed off in 1968, but the Harvard Library wanted a bound copy and he was unwilling to pay the binding costs so he never officially received his Ph.D. According to the post, the thesis defines a simple model of computation characterizing primitive recursion, within which one can prove that the complexity and growth rates of primitive recursive functions are equal.</p>

	Md Lutfar Rahman, 

	Thomas Watson</title>
    <summary>In a STOC 1976 paper, Schaefer proved that it is PSPACE-complete to determine the winner of the so-called Maker-Breaker game on a given set system, even when every set has size at most 11. Since then, there has been no improvement on this result. We prove that the game remains PSPACE-complete even when every set has size 6.</summary>

<p>2020 sucks.</p>



<p>Yesterday I learned that <a href="https://www.cifar.ca/cifarnews/2020/06/18/a-quantum-festschrift-for-david-poulin">David Poulin</a>, a creative and widely-beloved quantum computing and information theorist, has died at age 43, of an aggressive brain cancer.  After studying under many of the field’s legends—Gilles Brassard, Wojciech Zurek, Ray Laflamme, Gerard Milburn, John Preskill—David became a professor at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec.  There he played a leading role in CIFAR (the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research), eventually co-directing its quantum information science program with Aephraim Steinberg.  Just this fall (!), David moved to Microsoft Research to start a new phase of his career.  He’s survived by a large family.</p>



<p>While I can’t claim any deep knowledge of David’s work—he and I pursued very different problems—it seems appropriate to mention some of his best-known contributions.  With David Kribs, Ray Laflamme, and Maia Lesosky, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0504189">introduced</a> the formalism of operator quantum error correction, and made many other contributions to the theory of quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance (including the estimation of thresholds).  He and coauthors <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1147">showed</a> in a <em>Nature</em> paper how to do quantum state tomography on 1D matrix product states efficiently.  With Pavithran Iyer, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3235">proved</a> that optimal decoding of stabilizer codes is #P-hard.</p>



<p>And if none of that makes a sufficient impression on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers: well, back in 2013, when D-Wave was claiming to have achieved huge quantum speedups, David Poulin was one of the few experts willing to take a clear skeptical stance in public (including right in my comment section—see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1400#comment-79596">here</a> for example).</p>



<p>I vividly remember being officemates with David back in 2003, at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo—before Perimeter had its sleek black building, when it still operated out of a converted tavern.  (My and David’s office was in the basement, reached via a narrow staircase.)  David liked to tease me: for example, if I found him in conversation with someone else and asked what it was about, he’d say, “oh, nothing to do with computational efficiency, no reason for you to care.”  (And yet, much of David’s work ultimately <em>would</em> have to do with computational efficiency.)</p>



<p>David was taken way too soon and will be missed by everyone who knew him.  Feel free to share David stories in the comments.</p></div>

Joshua Greene and Andrew Lobb <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09193.pdf">proved</a> last month that every <em>smooth</em> Jordan curve in the plane and real <img alt="{r \leq 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cleq+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r \leq 1}"/>, there are four points on the curve that form a rectangle with sides of ratio <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>.</p>
<p>
Today we explain how this result relates to Otto Toeplitz’s famous “square peg conjecture,” which is the case <img alt="{r = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r = 1}"/> when the curve need not be smooth.</p>
<p><span id="more-17244"/></p>
<p>
We noticed this via an <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> last Thursday by Kevin Hartnett for <em>Quanta</em>. Hartnett describes this research advance as a product of the pandemic inducing them to take time for deeper reflection on fundamental problems. We wonder how much is bubbling on hard problems in our own field—this is one reason for our last post’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/some-real-and-some-virtual-news">interest</a> in (good kinds of) “gossip.”  He also gives great diagrams for the geometrical intuition.</p>
<p>
We will portray this advance instead along lines of things we’ve said recently about how to attack hard problems by seeking and solving simpler ones or special cases as stepping stones. Dick wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/21/the-inscribed-square-problem/">post</a> two years ago on the original Toeplitz problem, which this work still leaves open. That post focused on ways general Jordan curves can be nasty. This one needs an extra niceness condition but proves a stronger result for all <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>. How much can progress on “nice” inform problems with “nasty”? That kind of question comes up in complexity theory all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Pegging Rectangles </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A <em>Jordan curve</em> is the image of a continuous 1-1 map <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> from the circle to the plane. The condition of being 1-1 prevents the image from intersecting itself, so it is a single closed loop. By the Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem">theorem</a>, the loop always partitions the rest of the plane into two connected regions, exactly one of which is bounded. Amazingly, a Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood_curve">can</a> have positive Lebesgue measure, yet cannot fill all of <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{R}^2}"/>. Such curves can, however, approach the kind of space-filling curves defined by Giuseppe Peano, and thus have any Lebesgue density less than <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, as was noted also by William Osgood in his 1903 <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1986455.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
<p>
The Toeplitz conjecture is that every Jordan curve has four points that form a square. As noted in Dick’s post, the positive-area case is actually an easy yes-case. Nasty cases are where the curve is nowhere-differentiable with zero area. Thus far, the problem has been answered <em>yes</em> only in the presence of some uniformity condition that limits the local nastiness of the curve. The simplest one is for the curve to be <em>smooth</em> in that <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> has a continuous first derivative. Here is a smooth curve that is not convex, so that the square need not be “inside” the curve:</p>
<p/><p/>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/29/taking-a-problem-down-a-peg/matschkefig2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17247"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17247" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/matschkefig2.jpg?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
This diagram is from Benjamin Matchske’s wonderful recent <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/201404/rnoti-p346.pdf">survey</a> of the peg problem in the <em>AMS Notices</em>. Four months ago we’d have said it looks like a thin heart or fat boomerang. <i>Now</i> it looks to us like a face mask.</p>
<p>
As the survey notes, it is easy to show that every Jordan curve has <em>some</em> rectangle. The rectangle problem is to show that rectangles of <i>every</i> aspect ratio <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> can be pegged to the curve. There are two main reasons the square and rectangle problems are hard and harder:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Although any Jordan curve can be written as a limit of nice ones, the squares in the nice ones can degenerate to a single point in the limit. <p/>
</li><li>
Even for nice curves, a parity property that holds for squares can fail for rectangles.
</li></ol>
<p>
The property in the second point enables arguments of the kind: <em>for generic curves the number of squares is odd, therefore it is nonzero</em>. This then carries over to sufficiently nice curves in the generic closure. The failure of this property for rectangles is a main reason the results by Greene and Lobb are new.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Paper </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The new paper is written tersely at a high level, and we must confess not being able to catch all details in compressed time. But we can highlight some aspects of the argument. First, as we have said, it exemplifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Solve a Simpler Problem</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is however coupled with a second aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Bring Up the Reserves</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
It may be that the rectangle conjecture is not only true but “equally true” in the sense that the fundamental reason applies equally well to the case of rectangles. The parity argument that works for cases involving squares may be a crutch that misses the deepest explanations. Promoting arguments that avoid this crutch may marshal resources needed to make a breakthrough on the main problem for completely general Jordan curves.</p>
<p>
This runs somewhat counter to what we have said about <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> versus <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> proof attempts recently. The reason for <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/> believed by most is that problems like SAT require <em>exponential</em> time, not just super-polynomial time. Yet no one knows even a <em>super-linear</em> lower bound, apart from barely-superlinear bounds that exploit grainy aspects of the multitape Turing machine model and apply only to it. Nor is any super-linear lower bound known on Boolean circuit size. Maybe it is a viable strategy also to “bring up reserves” by finding restricted cases where (conditional) exponential lower bounds can be proven, as well as to explore contingencies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">SETH</a>, as we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">here</a>. But both of use have always felt that the super-linear frontier holds the buried keys to further progress.</p>
<p>
The Greene-Lobb proof has two aspects that may also resonate in complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Blow Up the Objects</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> in <em>Quanta</em> has great diagrams illustrating how the set of pairs of points on the curve corresponds to a Möbius strip in a related space. Cole Hugelmeyer, a graduate student at Princeton, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07336.pdf">proved</a> last year how to get rectangles covering at least one-third of possible values <img alt="{r \in (0,1]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cin+%280%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r \in (0,1]}"/> by embedding the Möbius strips in a four-dimensional space. Intersections between a strip and a rotated copy yield rectangles on the original Jordan curve. </p>
<p>
That led Greene and Lobb to consider larger objects with properties like pairs of Möbius strips in the larger space. The Klein bottle is the natural next thing to consider and led to a feature of their proof that made the desired conclusion pop out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Identify and Rule Out Obstructions</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The clever point pivots on the fact that a Klein bottle cannot be smoothly embedded into the complex plane <img alt="{\mathbb{C}^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{C}^2}"/> as a Lagrangian submanifold. The proof shows that for any prescribed aspect ratio <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> one can construct a mapping that almost succeeds in embedding such a Klein bottle. The fact that it must fail means that the image must yield a point of intersection witnessing the failure. The presence of this point then yields the construction of four other points on the Jordan curve that form the vertices of the needed rectangle.</p>
<p>
We have briefly <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">mentioned</a> how the concept of <em>obstructions</em> is integral to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_complexity_theory">Geometric</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1944345.1944346">Complexity</a> <a href="http://gct.cs.uchicago.edu/">Theory</a> attack on <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/>. Closer to home, however, is how László Babai's graph isomorphism algorithm and proof works by identifying a subclass of graphs called Johnson graphs as obstructions to a simpler algorithm, as we highlighted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/snow-and-theory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Can you find more lessons from the new advance on the Toeplitz problem?  Dick and I have considered ideas of blowing up from languages to pairs of languages (and making <i>reductions</i> between problems the fundamental units of analysis) but this has not gone beyond dreamwork.</p>

    <title>Can you name a famous living Chemist? Can anyone?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
I was re-watching the  Greatest-of-all-time Jeopardy championship and the following happen (I paraphrase)<br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
Alex Trebek: The category is Chemistry and we have a special guest reading the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Darling: I wonder who that will be.<br/>
<br/>
Bill: Hmm. I assume some famous chemist.<br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
So who was it? Bryan Cranston, the actor who PLAYED chemist Walter White on <i>Breaking Bad.</i><br/>
<br/>
Why couldn't they get a famous living chemist to read the clues?<br/>
<br/>
My guess: there are no famous living chemists.<br/>
<br/>
The number of famous living scientists is fairly short and they are often known for things that are not quite their science. Some are famous because the popularize science (deGrasse Tyson, Dawkins) or because of something unusual about their life (Hawkings when he was alive) or for something else entirely that they did (Ted Kaczynski).  Are any famous for the actual work that they do in the science?<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Wiles was famous for a brief time, and even made People Magazine's <i>25 most intriguing people of the year</i> list in the early 1990's (after he solved Fermat's Last Theorem). So he was famous but it was short lived.<br/>
<br/>
Terry Tao was on the Colbert Report (see <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/6wtwlg/the-colbert-report-terence-tao">here</a>) after he won the Fields Medal, the MacAuthor Genius award, and the Breakthrough prize. And even that fame was short lived.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the web page of Nobel Prize winners, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The only Chemistry Nobel's I recognized were Marie Curie,  Irene Joilet-Curie (Marie's Daughter), and Erst Rutherford.<br/>
<br/>
The only Physics Nobel's I recognized were<br/>
<br/>
Richard Feynman,<br/>
<br/>
 Eugene Wigner (for writing about <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences</a>),<br/>
<br/>
Richard Hofstadter (since he was the father of Douglas H and an uncle of Leonard H)<br/>
<br/>
 Andrew Geim (since he won  both an Ig-Noble prize and a Nobel prize, see  <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/10/noble-and-ig-noble-prizes.html">here</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Wolfgang Pauli (I've heard the term `Pauli Principle" though I did not know what it was until I looked it up while preparing this blog. I prob still don't really know what it means.)<br/>
<br/>
Enrico Fermi<br/>
<br/>
Erwin Schrodinger<br/>
<br/>
Paul Dirac<br/>
<br/>
Robert Millikan<br/>
<br/>
Albert Einstein<br/>
<br/>
Max Karl Ernest Ludwig Planck (I thought his last name was `Institute')<br/>
<br/>
Johannes Diderik van der Waals<br/>
<br/>
Pierre Curie<br/>
<br/>
Marie Curie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, some questions:<br/>
<br/>
a) Am I wrong? Are there famous living chemists I never heard of? Are there any famous living scientists who are famous for their work in science?<br/>
<br/>
b) If I am right then was there ever a time when there were famous scientists?<br/>
<br/>
c) If there was such a time, what changed?<br/>
<br/>
(I ask all of this non-rhetorically and with no agenda to push.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <title>What We've Learned to Control</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m giving a keynote address at the <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/">virtual IFAC congress this July</a>, and I submitted an abstract that forces me to reflect on the current state of research at the intersection of machine learning and control. 2020 is particularly appropriate for reflection: For personal reasons, I’ve been working in this space for about half a decade now and <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/">wrote a blog series on the topic two years ago</a> and it seemed like ideal timing. For the broader community, 2020 happens to be the year we were promised fleets of self-driving cars. Of course, for a myriad of reasons, we’re nowhere close to achieving this goal. Full self-driving has been a key motivator of work in learning-enabled autonomous systems, and it’s important to note this example as a marker of how difficult problems this space really are.</p>

<p>The research community has come to terms with this difficulty, and has committed itself to address the many pressing challenges. Over the last year I attended several great meetings on this topic, including an <a href="https://ajwagen.github.io/adsi_learning_and_control/">NSF funded workshop at UW</a>, a plenary session at <a href="https://ita.ucsd.edu/ws/">ITA</a>, a workshop on intersections of <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">learning, control, and optimization at IPAM</a>, and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/l4dc/home">second annual conference on Learning for Dynamics and Control</a>. There is clearly a ton of enthusiasm from researchers in a many different disciplines, and we’re seeing fascinating results mixing techniques from machine learning, computer science, and control. Obviously, I’m going to be leaving out many incredible papers, but, focusing on the theoretical end of the spectrum, perhaps I could highlight <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11899">new work on policy optimization</a> that demonstrates how simple optimization techniques can efficiently solve classic, nonconvex control-design problems or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">work connecting regret minimization and adaptive control</a> that provides nonasymptotic bounds.</p>

<p>This work has been very useful for establishing language to bridge communication between the diverse research camps interested in the space of learning, dynamics and automation. But, as I’ll discuss shortly, I’d argue that it hasn’t provided many promising approaches to improving large-scale autonomy. That’s ok! These problems are incredibly difficult and aren’t going to be solved by wishing for them to be solved. But I also think it might be worth taking a moment to reflect on which problems we are working on. It’s always a bit too easy for theorists to focus  on improving technical results and lose sight of why someone proved those results in the first place.</p>

<p>As an illustrative example, my research group spent a lot of time studying the <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/08/lqr/">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a> (LQR). The point of this work was initially to establish baselines: LQR has a closed form solution when the model is known, so we wanted to understand how different algorithms might perform when the underlying model was unknown. It turns out that if you are willing to collect enough data, the best thing you can do for LQR is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07826">estimate the dynamical model, and then exploit this model as if it were true</a>. This so-called “certainty equivalent control” is what practitioners have been doing since the mid-60s to fly satellites and solve other optimal control problems. Proving this result required a bunch of new mathematical insights that established connections between high dimensional statistics and automatic control theory. But it did not bring us closer to solving new challenges in robotics or autonomous systems. Our work here merely showed that what the controls community had been doing for 50 years was already about as well as we could do for this important baseline problem.</p>

<p>So what are the ways forward? Are there things that theory-minded folks can work on short term that might help us understand paths towards improving learning systems in complex feedback loops? Let me suggest a few challenges that I see as both very pressing, but also ones where we might be able to make near-term progress.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-is-still-not-reliable-technology">Machine Learning is still not reliable technology</h2>

<p>At the aforementioned <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">IPAM meeting</a>, Richard Murray gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi8Y---ce28">fantastic survey of the sorts of standards of reliability imposed in aerospace engineering</a>. Go watch it! I don’t want to spoil it for you, but his discussion of Ram Air Turbines is gripping. Richard covers what is needed to get to the sorts of reliability we’d like in autonomous systems. Unfortunately, having <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08237">88.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet</a>—while a stunning achievement—doesn’t tell us how to get to systems with failure rates on the order of 1 in a billion. As Boeing has tragically shown, cutting corners on autonomous system safety standards has horrible, tragic consequences.</p>

<p>How can we make machine learning more robust? How can we approach the failure rates needed for safe, reliable autonomy? And how can we establish testing protocols to assure we have such low failure rates?</p>

<h2 id="prediction-systems-in-feedback-loops">Prediction systems in feedback loops</h2>

<p>One particular aspect that I think is worth considering is how supervised learning systems can function as “sensors” in feedback loops. Even if you know everything about a dynamical system, when you observe the state via an estimator generated by a learned component, it’s not clear how to best take action on this observation. Most classic control and planning assumes that your errors in state-estimation are Gaussian or nicely uniformly bounded. Of course, the errors from machine learning systems are neither of these (I recommend checking out the <a href="https://youtu.be/A0cb7wZVFf4">crazy videos</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1130956365063761920">confusion</a> that comes out of Tesla Autopilot’s vision systems). How to properly characterize the errors of machine learning systems for control applications seems like a useful, understudied problem. Using off-the-shelf machine learing analysis, it’s unavoidable to have to densely sample all of the possible scenarios in advance in order to guarantee the sort of uniform error bounds desired by control algorithms. This isn’t practical, and, indeed, it’s clear that this sort of sensor characterization is not needed to make reasonable demos work. Though it’s a bit mundane, I think a huge contribution lies in understanding how much data we need to quantify the uncertainty in learned perception components. It’s still not clear to me if this is a machine learning question or a closed-loop design question, and I suspect both views of the problem will be needed to make progress.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-we-all-sleeping-on-model-predictive-control">Why are we all sleeping on model predictive control?</h2>

<p>I still remain baffled by how <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/05/02/adp/">model predictive control</a> (MPC) is consistently under appreciated. We’ll commonly see the same tasks in the same meeting, one task done on a robot using some sort of deep reinforcement learning and the other done using model predictive control, and the disparity in performance is stark. It’s like the difference between watching an Olympic level sprinter and me jogging in my neighborhood with a set of orthotics.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from the IPAM workshop. Martin Riedmiller presented work at DeepMind to catch a ball in a cup:</p>



<p>This system uses two cameras, has a rather large “cup,” (it’s a wastepaper basket) and yet still takes 3 days to train on the robot. Francesco Borrelli presented a different approach. Using only a single camera and basic, simple Newtonian physics, and MPC they were able to achieve this performance on the standard-sized “ball-in-a-cup” toy:</p>



<p>If you only saw these two videos, I can’t fathom why would you invest all of your assets into deep RL. I understand there are still a lot of diehards out there, and I know this will offend them. But I want to make a constructive point: so many theorists are spending a lot of time studying RL algorithms, but few in the ML community are analyzing MPC and why it’s so successful. We should rebalance our allocation of mental resources!</p>

<p>Now, while the basic idea of MPC is very simple, the theory gets very hairy very quickly. It definitely takes some time and effort to learn about how to prove convergence of MPC protocols. I’d urge the MPC crowd to connect more with the learning theory crowd to see if a common ground can be found to better understand how MPC works and how we might push its performance even farther.</p>

<h2 id="perhaps-we-should-stop-taking-cues-from-alphago">Perhaps we should stop taking cues from AlphaGo?</h2>

<p>One of the grand goals in RL is to use function approximation algorithms to estimate value functions. The conventional wisdom asserts that the world is a giant Markov Decision Process and once you have its value function, you can just greedily maximize it and you’ll win at life. Now, this sort of approach clearly doesn’t work for robots, and I’m perplexed by why people still think it will work at all. Part of the motivation is that this approach was used to solve Go. But at some point I think we all have to come to terms with the fact that games are not the real world.</p>

<p>Now, I’d actually argue that RL <em>does</em> work in the real world, but it’s in systems that most people don’t actively think of as RL systems. Greedy value function estimation and exploitation is <em>literally</em> how all internet revenue is made. Systems simply use past data to estimate value functions and then choose the action that maximizes the value at the next step. Though seldom described as such, these are instances of the “greedy contextual bandit” algorithm, and this algorithm makes tech companies tons of money. But many researchers have also pointed out that this algorithm leads to misinformation, polarization, and radicalization.</p>

<p>Everyone tries to motivate RL by the success of AlphaGo, but they should be using the success of Facebook and Google instead. And if they did this, I think it would be a lot more clear why RL is terrifying and dangerous, and one whose limitations we desperately need to understand so that we can build safer tools.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-the-70s-about-optimal-control">Lessons from the 70s about optimal control</h2>

<p>I have one set of ideas along these lines that, while I think is important, I still am having a hard time articulating. Indeed, I might just take a few blog posts to work through my thoughts on this, but let me close this blog with a teaser of discussions to come. As I mentioned above, optimal control was a guiding paradigm for a variety of control applications in the 60s and 70s. During this time, it seemed like there might even be hidden benefits to a full-on optimization paradigm: though you’d optimize a single, simple objective, you would often get additional robustness guarantees for free. However, it turned out that this was very misleading and that <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1101812">there were no guarantees of robustness even for simple optimal control problems</a>. This shouldn’t be too surprising, as if you devote a lot of resources towards one objective, you are likely neglecting some other objective. But showing how and why these fragilities arise is quite delicate. It’s not always obvious how you <em>should</em> be devoting your resources.</p>

<p>Trying to determine how to allocate engineering resources to balance safety and performance is the heart of “robust control.” One thing I’m fascinated by moving forward is if any of the early developments in robust control might transfer over for a new kind of “robust ML.” Unfortunately for all of us, robust control is a rather encrypted literature. There is a lot of mathematics, but often not clear statements about <em>why</em> we study particular problems or what are the fundamental limits of feedback. While diligent young learning theorists have been scouring classic control theory text books for insights, these books don’t always articulate what we can and cannot do and what are the problems that control theory might help solve. We still have a lot of work to do in communicating what we know and what problems remain challenging. I think it would be useful for control theorists to think of how to best communicate the fundamental concepts of robust control. I hope to take up this challenge in the next few months on this blog.</p>

<p><em>I’d like to thank Sarah Dean, Horia Mania, Nik Matni, and Ludwig Schmidt for their helpful feedback on this post. I’d also like to thank John Doyle for several inspiring conversations about robustness in optimal control and on the encrypted state of the control theory literature.</em></p></div>
