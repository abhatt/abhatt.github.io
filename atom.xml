    <title>TR19-038 |  Statistical Difference Beyond the Polarizing Regime |

    <summary>The polarization lemma for statistical distance ($\mathrm{SD}$), due to Sahai and Vadhan (JACM, 2003), is an efficient transformation taking as input a pair of circuits $(C_0,C_1)$ and an integer $k$ and outputting a new pair of circuits $(D_0,D_1)$ such that if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1)\geq\alpha$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \geq 1-2^{-k}$ and if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1) \leq \beta$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \leq 2^{-k}$. The polarization lemma is known to hold for any constant values $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$, but extending the lemma to the regime in which $\alpha^2 \leq \beta &lt; \alpha$ has remained elusive. The focus of this work is in studying the latter regime of parameters. Our main results are:

1. Polarization lemmas for different notions of distance, such as Triangular Discrimination ($\mathrm{TD}$) and Jensen-Shannon Divergence ($\mathrm{JS}$), which enable polarization for some problems where the statistical distance satisfies $\alpha^2 &lt; \beta &lt; \alpha$. We also derive a polarization lemma for statistical distance with any inverse-polynomially small gap between $\alpha^2$ and $\beta$ (rather than a constant).

2. The average-case hardness of the statistical difference problem (i.e., determining whether the statistical distance between two given circuits is at least $\alpha$ or at most $\beta$), for any values of $\beta &lt; \alpha$, implies the existence of one-way functions. Such a result was previously only known for $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$.

3. A (direct) constant-round interactive proof for estimating the statistical distance between any two distributions (up to any inverse polynomial error) given circuits that generate them.</summary>

problem. While recent work has shown that the approximate version of this
problem is PPA-complete, we show that the exact version is much harder.
Specifically, finding a solution with $n$ cuts is FIXP-hard, and deciding
whether there exists a solution with fewer than $n$ cuts is ETR-complete. We
also give a QPTAS for the case where each agent's valuation is a polynomial.
</p>
<p>Along the way, we define a new complexity class BU, which captures all
problems that can be reduced to solving an instance of the Borsuk-Ulam problem
exactly. We show that FIXP $\subseteq$ BU $\subseteq$ TFETR and that LinearBU
$=$ PPA, where LinearBU is the subclass of BU in which the Borsuk-Ulam instance
is specified by a linear arithmetic circuit.

    <title>An algorithmic approach to the existence of ideal objects in commutative algebra</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Powell:Thomas.html">Thomas Powell</a>, Peter M Schuster, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wiesnet:Franziskus.html">Franziskus Wiesnet</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03070">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The existence of ideal objects, such as maximal ideals in nonzero rings,
plays a crucial role in commutative algebra. These are typically justified
using Zorn's lemma, and thus pose a challenge from a computational point of
view. Giving a constructive meaning to ideal objects is a problem which dates
back to Hilbert's program, and today is still a central theme in the area of
dynamical algebra, which focuses on the elimination of ideal objects via
syntactic methods. In this paper, we take an alternative approach based on
Kreisel's no counterexample interpretation and sequential algorithms. We first
give a computational interpretation to an abstract maximality principle in the
countable setting via an intuitive, state based algorithm. We then carry out a
concrete case study, in which we give an algorithmic account of the result that
in any commutative ring, the intersection of all prime ideals is contained in
its nilradical.

    <title>Fast Exact Dynamic Time Warping on Run-Length Encoded Time Series</title>

series. The standard dynamic programming approach to compute the dtw-distance
of two length-$n$ time series, however, requires $O(n^2)$ time, which is often
too slow in applications. Therefore, many heuristics have been proposed to
speed up the dtw computation. These are often based on approximating or
bounding the true dtw-distance or considering special inputs (e.g. binary or
piecewise constant time series). In this paper, we present a fast and exact
algorithm to compute the dtw-distance of two run-length encoded time series.
This might be used for fast and accurate indexing and classification of time
series in combination with preprocessing techniques such as piecewise aggregate
approximation (PAA).

    <title>Hierarchies in directed networks</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Tatti:Nikolaj.html">Nikolaj Tatti</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02999">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Interactions in many real-world phenomena can be explained by a strong
hierarchical structure. Typically, this structure or ranking is not known;
instead we only have observed outcomes of the interactions, and the goal is to
infer the hierarchy from these observations. Discovering a hierarchy in the
context of directed networks can be formulated as follows: given a graph,
partition vertices into levels such that, ideally, there are only edges from
upper levels to lower levels. The ideal case can only happen if the graph is
acyclic. Consequently, in practice we have to introduce a penalty function that
penalizes edges violating the hierarchy. A practical variant for such penalty
is agony, where each violating edge is penalized based on the severity of the
violation. Hierarchy minimizing agony can be discovered in $O(m^2)$ time, and
much faster in practice. In this paper we introduce several extensions to
agony. We extend the definition for weighted graphs and allow a cardinality
constraint that limits the number of levels. While, these are conceptually
trivial extensions, current algorithms cannot handle them, nor they can be
easily extended. We provide an exact algorithm of $O(m^2 \log n)$ time by
showing the connection of agony to the capacitated circulation problem. We also
show that this bound is in fact pessimistic and we can compute agony for large
datasets. In addition, we show that we can compute agony in polynomial time for
any convex penalty, and, to complete the picture, we show that minimizing
hierarchy with any concave penalty is an NP-hard problem.

theorem, Halin graphs are 4-vertex-colorable. On the other hand, they are not
2-vertex-colorable because they have triangles. We show that all Halin graphs
are 3-vertex-colorable except even wheels. We also show how to find the perfect

capture the geometry of objects by means of three-dimensional point clouds.
Often the obtained data consist of a dense sampling of the object's surface,
containing many redundant 3D points. These unnecessary data samples lead to
high computational effort in subsequent processing steps. Thus, point cloud
sparsification or compression is often applied as a preprocessing step. The two
standard methods to compress dense 3D point clouds are random subsampling and
approximation schemes based on hierarchical tree structures, e.g., octree
representations. However, both approaches give little flexibility for adjusting
point cloud compression based on a-priori knowledge on the geometry of the
scanned object. Furthermore, these methods lead to suboptimal approximations if
the 3D point cloud data is prone to noise. In this paper we propose a
variational method defined on finite weighted graphs, which allows to sparsify
a given 3D point cloud while giving the flexibility to control the appearance
of the resulting approximation based on the chosen regularization functional.
The main contribution in this paper is a novel coarse-to-fine optimization
scheme for point cloud sparsification, inspired by the efficiency of the
recently proposed Cut Pursuit algorithm for total variation denoising. This
strategy gives a substantial speed up in computing sparse point clouds compared
to a direct application on all points as done in previous works and renders
variational methods now applicable for this task. We compare different settings
for our point cloud sparsification method both on unperturbed as well as noisy
3D point cloud data.

    <title>Quantum hardness of learning shallow classical circuits</title>

circuits under the uniform distribution and in the distribution-independent
framework of PAC learning. In order to attain our results, we establish
connections between quantum learning and quantum-secure cryptosystems. We then
achieve the following results.
</p>
<p>1) Hardness of learning AC$^0$ and TC$^0$ under the uniform distribution. Our
first result concerns the concept class TC$^0$ (resp. AC$^0$), the class of
constant-depth and polynomial-sized circuits with unbounded fan-in majority
gates (resp. AND, OR, NOT gates). We show that if there exists no quantum
polynomial-time (resp. sub-exponential time) algorithm to solve the Learning
with Errors (LWE) problem, then there exists no polynomial-time quantum
learning algorithm for TC$^0$ (resp. AC$^0$) under the uniform distribution
(even with access to quantum membership queries). The main technique in this
result uses explicit pseudo-random generators that are believed to be
quantum-secure to construct concept classes that are hard to learn quantumly
under the uniform distribution.
</p>
<p>2) Hardness of learning TC$^0_2$ in the PAC setting. Our second result shows
that if there exists no quantum polynomial time algorithm for the LWE problem,
then there exists no polynomial time quantum PAC learning algorithm for the
class TC$^0_2$, i.e., depth-2 TC$^0$ circuits. The main technique in this
result is to establish a connection between the quantum security of public-key
cryptosystems and the learnability of a concept class that consists of
decryption functions of the cryptosystem.
</p>
<p>This gives a strong conditional negative answer to one of the "Ten Semi-Grand
Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory" raised by Aaronson [Aar05], who asked
if AC$^0$ and TC$^0$ can be PAC-learned in quantum polynomial time.

the capacity of the knapsack and the follower's profits are uncertain. Adopting
the robust optimization approach and assuming that the follower's profits
belong to a given uncertainty set, our aim is to compute a worst case optimal
solution for the leader. We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial
time for both discrete and interval uncertainty. In the latter case, we make
use of an algorithm by Woeginger for a class of precedence constraint knapsack
problems.

    <title>A face cover perspective to $\ell_1$ embeddings of planar graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1552089600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Filtser:Arnold.html">Arnold Filtser</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02758">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>It was conjectured by Gupta et. al. [Combinatorica04] that every planar graph
can be embedded into $\ell_1$ with constant distortion. However, given an
$n$-vertex weighted planar graph, the best upper bound is only $O(\sqrt{\log
n})$ by Rao [SoCG99]. In this paper we study the terminated case, where there
is a set $K$ of terminals, and the goal is to embed only the terminals into
$\ell_1$ with low distortion. In a seminal paper, Okamura and Seymour
[J.Comb.Theory81] showed that if all the terminals lie on a single face, they
can be embedded isometrically into $\ell_1$. More generally, suppose that the
terminals could be covered by $\gamma$ faces. In a recent paper Krauthgamer,
Lee and Rika [SODA19] showed an upper bound of $O(\log \gamma)$ on the
distortion, improving previous results by Lee and Sidiropoulos [STOC09] and
Chekuri et. al. [J.Comb.Theory13]. Our contribution is a further improvement of
the upper bound to $O(\sqrt{\log\gamma})$. Note that since every planar graph
has at most $O(n)$ faces, any further improvement of this result, will imply an
improvement upon Rao's long standing upper bound.
</p>
<p>It is well known that the flow-cut gap equals to the distortion of the best
embedding into $\ell_1$. In particular, our result provide a polynomial time
$O(\sqrt{\log \gamma})$-approximation to the sparsest cut problem on planar
graph, for the case where all the demand pairs can be covered by $\gamma$
faces.

    <title>Stronger L2/L2 Compressed Sensing; Without Iterating</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1552089600</feedworld_mtime>

sensing. The main contribution of our work is an improvement over [Gilbert, Li,
Porat and Strauss, STOC 2010] with faster decoding time and significantly
smaller column sparsity, answering two open questions of the aforementioned
work.
</p>
<p>Previous work on sublinear-time compressed sensing employed an iterative
procedure, recovering the heavy coordinates in phases. We completely depart
from that framework, and give the first sublinear-time $\ell_2/\ell_2$ scheme
which achieves the optimal number of measurements without iterating; this new
approach is the key step to our progress. Towards that, we satisfy the
$\ell_2/\ell_2$ guarantee by exploiting the heaviness of coordinates in a way
that was not exploited in previous work. Via our techniques we obtain improved
results for various sparse recovery tasks, and indicate possible further
applications to problems in the field, to which the aforementioned iterative
procedure creates significant obstructions.

(MMW) update enjoys the same regret bounds as MMW, up to a small constant
factor. Unlike MMW, where every step requires full matrix exponentiation, our
steps require only a single product of the form $e^A b$, which the Lanczos
method approximates efficiently. Our key technique is to view the sketch as a
randomized mirror projection, and perform mirror descent analysis on the
expected projection. Our sketch solves the online eigenvector problem,
improving the best known complexity bounds. We also apply this sketch to a
simple no-regret scheme for semidefinite programming in saddle-point form,
where it matches the best known guarantees.

word-RAM data structure from which we can efficiently recover the sign of the
sum of any triple of numbers, one in each set. This is similar to a previous
work by some of the authors to encode the order type of a finite set of points.
While this previous work showed that it was possible to achieve slightly
subquadratic space and logarithmic query time, we show here that for the
simpler 3SUM problem, one can achieve an encoding that takes
$\tilde{O}(N^{\frac 32})$ space for inputs sets of size $N$ and allows constant

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Via <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4133">Scott</a>, John Horgan wrote a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">blog post</a> following on his 1993 Scientific American article <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">The Death of Proof</a>. The article talked about computer-generated proofs, experimental mathematics and even mentioned some of our work on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/103418.103428">transparent proofs</a> (basically time-efficient probabilistically checkable proofs). I got (sarcastically I think) accused of killing mathematics after that article but of course we had traditional proofs about probabilistically check proofs. Andrew Wiles got a sidebar titled "A Splendid Anachronism?" for merely solving the most famous open problem in all of mathematics. Somehow traditional mathematical proofs survived the article.<div>

TCS is surely blessed with mathematical beauty. As a graduate student a long time ago, it was mathematical beauty that attracted me to TCS, and continued to lead my research for many years.

Here here on the beauty of complexity. So what about truth? I cover much of this in my <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/9/38904-the-status-of-the-p-versus-np-problem/fulltext">P v NP survey</a>. In short the P v NP captures the most critical aspects of what is efficiently computable but it is not the endpoint. Nevertheless P v NP captures both truth and beauty and that's why the problem has so captivated and guided me throughout my research career.</div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: justify;">Spending your life staring at a (traditional) computer screen may not be ideal for your eyes (and more); so since an early age I have been dreaming of a “purely mechanical” monitor that you could stare at more or less indefinitely, like at parchment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This dream is not becoming reality, sort of.  The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dasung-Ink-Paperlike-13-3-Monitor/dp/B07GWGFW1B/ref=asc_df_B07GWGFW1B/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=309743296044&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=4273202700836301476&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9002067&amp;hvtargid=pla-571127059636&amp;psc=1">Dasung E-ink monitor </a>has no backlight and instead reportedly uses electric flows to move ink droplets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some consideration, spending yet more hours reading reviews online and watching youtube videos about it sealed the deal.  I shelled out $1300 and bought the thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have had it for a few days now and I am sort of happy. I went from using a giant 30-inch monitor far away (my theory for avoiding eye strain) to using a ~13-inch monitor at pretty much the same distance as reading a book. I had to avoid sunlight, now I seek it (see the picture).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="20190307_094550" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" src="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/20190307_094550.jpg?w=640"/></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The monitor makes your computer look like Windows 3.1 on a monochrome screen from the 80’s. The refresh is slow, and there is a ghosting effect, meaning there are shadows of previous images — which you can clear out. Also, it’s 4:3 instead of 16:9, which is a pain because it means I have to change resolution when I am forced to use my other monitor (for example if I have to check colors — the screen is gray-scale, did I mention that?). It makes browsing the internet quite painful, which is a nice side effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contrary to advice, I am using it as my primary monitor. I am sort of happy with it and don’t regret buying it. I have started writing and reading papers with it and it’s working well enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think as soon as the technology improves the market for these things will be huge.  Already having a 17″ monitor in 16:9 ratio, ideally touch-screen, even if gray scale, would be a dream come true.</p></div>

    <title xml:lang="en-US">Death of proof greatly exaggerated</title>
    <summary xml:lang="en-US">In 1993, the science writer John Horgan—who’s best known for his book The End of Science, and (of course) for interviewing me in 2016—wrote a now-(in)famous cover article for Scientific American entitled “The Death of Proof.” Mashing together a large number of (what I’d consider) basically separate trends and ideas, Horgan argued that math was […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In 1993, the science writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horgan_(journalist)">John Horgan</a>—who’s best known for his book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Science-Knowledge-Twilight-Scientific/dp/0465065929">The End of Science</a></em>, and (of course) for <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">interviewing me in 2016</a>—wrote a now-(in)famous cover article for <em>Scientific American</em> entitled <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e56/c6fea76922082400dfc6e13a3a169ae7b9a6.pdf">“The Death of Proof.”</a>  Mashing together a large number of (what I’d consider) basically separate trends and ideas, Horgan argued that math was undergoing a fundamental change, with traditional deductive proofs being replaced by a combination of non-rigorous numerical simulations, machine-generated proofs, probabilistic and probabilistically-checkable proofs, and proofs using graphics and video.  Horgan also suggested that Andrew Wiles’s then-brand-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">proof</a> of Fermat’s Last Theorem—which might have looked, at first glance, like a spectacular counterexample to the “death of proof” thesis—could be the “last gasp of a dying culture” and a “splendid anachronism.”  Apparently, “The Death of Proof” garnered one of the largest volumes of angry mail in <em>Scientific American</em>‘s history, with mathematician after mathematician arguing that Horgan had strung together half-digested quotes and vignettes to manufacture a non-story.</p>



<p>Now Horgan—who you could variously describe as a wonderful sport, or a ham, or a sucker for punishment—has written a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">26-year retrospective</a> on his “death of proof” article.  The prompt for this was Horgan’s recent discovery that, back in the 90s, David Hoffman and Hermann Karcher, two mathematicians annoyed by the “death of proof” article, had named a nonexistent mathematical object after its author.  The so-called <em><a href="https://minimalsurfaces.blog/home/repository/non-existent-surfaces/the-horgan-surface/">Horgan surface</a></em> is a minimal surface that numerical computations strongly suggested should exist, but that can be rigorously proven not to exist after all.  “The term was intended as an insult, but I’m honored anyway,” Horgan writes.</p>



<p>As a followup to his blog post, Horgan then decided to solicit commentary from various people he knew, including yours truly, about “how proofs are faring in an era of increasing computerization.”  He wrote, “I’d love to get a paragraph or two from you.”  Alas, I didn’t have the time to do as requested, but only to write <i>eight</i> paragraphs.  So Horgan suggested that I make the result into a post on my own blog, which he’d then link to.  Without further ado, then:</p>



<hr/>



<p>John, I like you so I hate to say it, but the last quarter century has not been kind to your thesis about “the death of proof”!  Those mathematicians sending you the irate letters had a point: there’s been no fundamental change to mathematics that deserves such a dramatic title.  Proof-based math remains quite healthy, with (e.g.) a solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture">Poincaré conjecture</a> since your article came out, as well as to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05363">Erdős discrepancy problem</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadison%E2%80%93Singer_problem">Kadison-Singer conjecture</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan%27s_conjecture">Catalan’s conjecture</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.998&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">bounded gaps in primes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">testing primality in deterministic polynomial time</a>, etc. — just to pick a few examples from the tiny subset of areas that I know anything about.</p>



<p>There are evolutionary changes to mathematical practice, as there always have been.  Since 2009, the website <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a> has let mathematicians query the global hive-mind about an obscure reference or a recalcitrant step in a proof, and get near-instant answers.  Meanwhile <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/">“polymath” projects</a> have, with moderate success, tried to harness blogs and other social media to make advances on long-standing open math problems using massive collaborations.</p>



<p>While humans remain in the driver’s seat, there are persistent efforts to increase the role of computers, with some notable successes.  These include Thomas Hales’s 1998 computer-assisted proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture">Kepler Conjecture</a> (about the densest possible way to pack oranges) — now fully machine-verified from start to finish, after <del>the </del><em><del>Annals of Mathematics</del></em><del> refused to publish a mixture of traditional mathematics and computer code</del> (seems this is not exactly what happened; see the comment section for more).  It also includes William McCune’s 1996 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_algebra">Robbins Conjecture</a> in algebra (the computer-generated <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/papers/robbins/eqp-theorem.proof.txt">proof</a> was only half a page, but involved substitutions so strange that for 60 years no human had found them); and at the “opposite extreme,” the 2016 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem">Pythagorean triples problem</a> by Marijn Heule and collaborators, which weighed in at 200 terabytes (at that time, “the longest proof in the history of mathematics”).</p>



<p>It’s conceivable that someday, computers will replace humans at all aspects of mathematical research — but it’s also conceivable that, by the time they can do that, they’ll be able to replace humans at music and science journalism and everything else!</p>



<p><a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/proofs.ppt">New notions of proof</a> — including probabilistic, interactive, zero-knowledge, and even quantum proofs — have seen further development by theoretical computer scientists since 1993.  So far, though, these new types of proof remain either entirely theoretical (as with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01664">quantum proofs</a>), or else they’re used for cryptographic protocols but not for mathematical research.  (For example, zero-knowledge proofs now play a major role in certain cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zcash">Zcash</a>.)</p>



<p>In many areas of math (including my own, theoretical computer science), proofs have continued to get longer and harder for any one person to absorb.  This has led some to advocate a split approach, wherein human mathematicians would talk to each other only about the handwavy intuitions and high-level concepts, while the tedious verification of details would be left to computers.  So far, though, the huge investment of time needed to write proofs in machine-checkable format — for almost no return in new insight — has prevented this approach’s wide adoption.</p>



<p>Yes, there are non-rigorous approaches to math, which continue to be widely used in physics and engineering and other fields, as they always have been.  But none of these approaches have displaced proof as the gold standard whenever it’s available.  If I had to speculate about why, I’d say: if you use non-rigorous approaches, then even if it’s clear to you under what conditions your results can be trusted, it’s probably much less clear to others.  Also, even if only one segment of a research community cares about rigor, whatever earlier work that segment builds on will need to be rigorous as well — thereby exerting constant pressure in that direction.  Thus, the more collaborative a given research area becomes, the more important is rigor.</p>



<p>For my money, the elucidation of the foundations of mathematics a century ago, by Cantor, Frege, Peano, Hilbert, Russell, Zermelo, Gödel, Turing, and others, still stands as one of the greatest triumphs of human thought, up there with evolution or quantum mechanics or anything else.  It’s true that the ideal set by these luminaries remains mostly aspirational.  When mathematicians say that a theorem has been “proved,” they still mean, as they always have, something more like: “we’ve reached a social consensus that all the ideas are now in place for a strictly formal proof that could be verified by a machine … with the only task remaining being massive rote coding work that none of us has any intention of ever doing!”  It’s also true that mathematicians, being human, are subject to the full panoply of foibles you might expect: claiming to have proved things they haven’t, squabbling over who proved what, accusing others of lack of rigor while hypocritically taking liberties themselves.  But just like love and honesty remain fine ideals no matter how often they’re flouted, so too does mathematical rigor.</p>

    <title>TR19-037 |  Closure of VP under taking factors: a short and simple proof | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	Chi-Ning  Chou, 

	Noam Solomon</title>
    <summary>In this note, we give a short, simple and almost completely self contained proof of a classical result of Kaltofen [Kal86, Kal87, Kal89] which shows that if an n variate degree $d$ polynomial f can be computed by an arithmetic circuit of size s, then each of its factors can be computed by an arithmetic circuit of size at most poly(s, n, d). 

However, unlike Kaltofen's argument, our proof  does not  directly give an efficient algorithm for computing the circuits for the factors of f.</summary>

    <title>TR19-036 |  On the complexity of computing a random Boolean function over the reals | 

	Pavel Hrubes</title>
    <summary>We say that a first-order formula $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ over $\mathbb{R}$ defines a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, if for every $x_1,\dots,x_n\in\{0,1\}$, $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ is true iff $f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=1$. We show that:

(i) every $f$ can be defined by a formula of size $O(n)$, 
(ii) if $A$ is required to have at most $k\geq 1$ quantifier alternations, there exists an $f$ which requires  a formula of size $2^{\Omega(n/k)}$. 
 
The latter result implies several previously known as well as some new lower bounds in computational complexity. We note that (i) holds over any field of characteristic zero, and (ii) holds for any real closed or algebraically closed field.</summary>

    <title>TR19-035 |  PIT for depth-4 circuits and Sylvester-Gallai theorem for polynomials | 

	Alexey Milovanov</title>
    <summary>This text is a development of  a preprint of Ankit Gupta. 

We present an approach for devising a deterministic polynomial time whitekbox identity testing (PIT) algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.
This approach is similar to Kayal-Saraf approach for depth-$3$ circuits. Kayal and Saraf  based their algorithm on Sylvester-Gallai-type theorem about linear polynomials. We show how it is possible to generalize this approach to depth-$4$ circuits. However we failed to implement this plan completely. We succeeded to construct a polynomial time deterministic algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin and its correctness requires a hypothesis. Also we present a  polynomial-time (unconditional) algorithm for some subclass of   depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.</summary>

    <title>TR19-034 |  On $\epsilon$-sensitive monotone computations | 

	Pavel Hrubes</title>
    <summary>We show that strong-enough lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits or the non-negative rank of a matrix imply unconditional lower bounds in arithmetic or Boolean circuit complexity. First, we show that if a polynomial $f\in {\mathbb {R}}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ of degree $d$ has an arithmetic circuit of size $s$ then $(x_1+\dots+x_n+1)^d+\epsilon f$ has a monotone arithmetic circuit of size $O(sd^2+n\log n)$, for some $\epsilon&gt;0$.  Second, if $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a Boolean function,  we associate with $f$ an explicit exponential-size matrix $M(f)$ such that the Boolean circuit size of $f$ is at least $\Omega(\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))- 2n)$, where $J$ is the all-ones matrix and $\hbox{rk}_+$ denotes the non-negative rank of a matrix. In fact, the quantity $\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))$ characterizes how hard is it to distinguish rejecting and accepting inputs of $f$ by means of a linear program. 
Finally, we introduce a proof system resembling the Boolean monotone calculus and show that similar $\epsilon$-sensitive lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits imply lower bounds on proof-size in the system.</summary>

    <title>TR19-033 |  Counting basic-irreducible factors mod $p^k$ in deterministic poly-time and $p$-adic applications | 

	Ashish Dwivedi, 

	Rajat Mittal, 

	Nitin Saxena</title>
    <summary>Finding an irreducible factor, of a polynomial $f(x)$ modulo a prime $p$, is not known to be in deterministic polynomial time. Though there is such a classical algorithm that {\em counts} the number of irreducible factors of $f\bmod p$. We can ask the same question modulo prime-powers $p^k$. The irreducible factors of $f\bmod p^k$ blow up exponentially in number; making it hard to describe them. Can we count  those irreducible factors $\bmod~p^k$ that remain irreducible mod $p$? These are called {\em basic-irreducible}. A simple example is in $f=x^2+px \bmod p^2$; it has $p$ many basic-irreducible factors. Also note that, $x^2+p \bmod p^2$ is irreducible but not basic-irreducible!

We give an algorithm to count the number of basic-irreducible factors of $f\bmod p^k$ in deterministic poly($\deg(f),k\log p$)-time. This solves the open questions posed in (Cheng et al, ANTS'18 \&amp; Kopp et al, Math.Comp.'19). In particular, we are counting roots $\bmod\ p^k$; which gives the first deterministic poly-time algorithm to compute Igusa zeta function of $f$. Also, our algorithm efficiently partitions the set of all basic-irreducible factors (possibly exponential) into merely $\deg(f)$-many disjoint sets, using a compact tree data structure and {\em split} ideals.</summary>

    <title>TR19-031 |  Non-deterministic Quasi-Polynomial Time is Average-case Hard for ACC Circuits | 

	Lijie Chen</title>
    <summary>Following the seminal work of [Williams, J. ACM 2014], in a recent breakthrough, [Murray and Williams, STOC 2018] proved that NQP (non-deterministic quasi-polynomial time) does not have polynomial-size ACC^0 circuits.
	
We strengthen the above lower bound to an average case one, by proving that for all constants c, there is a language in NQP, which is not 1/2+1/log^c(n)-approximable by polynomial-size ACC^0 circuits. In fact, our lower bound holds for a larger circuit class: 2^(log^a n)-size ACC^0 circuits with a layer of threshold gates at the bottom, for all constants a. Our work also improves the average-case lower bound for NEXP against polynomial-size ACC circuits by [Chen, Oliveira, and Santhanam, LATIN 2018].
	
Our new lower bound builds on several interesting components, including: 
	
Barrington's theorem and the existence of an NC^1-complete language which is random self-reducible.
		
The sub-exponential witness-size lower bound for NE against ACC^0 and the conditional non-deterministic PRG construction in [Williams, SICOMP 2016].
		
An ``almost'' almost-everywhere MA average-case lower bound (which strengthens the corresponding worst-case lower bound in [Murray and Williams, STOC 2018]). 
		
A PSPACE-complete language which is same-length checkable, error-correctable and also has some other nice reducibility properties, which builds on [Trevisan and Vadhan, Computational Complexity 2007]. Moreover, all its reducibility properties have corresponding low-depth non-adaptive oracle circuits.

Like other lower bounds proved via the ``algorithmic approach'', the only property of ACC^0 of THR exploited by us is the existence of a non-trivial  SAT algorithm for ACC^0 of THR [Williams, STOC 2014]. Therefore, for any typical circuit class C, our results apply to them as well if the corresponding non-trivial SAT (in fact, GAP-UNSAT) algorithms are discovered.</summary>

    <title>How are there 20 copies of my new book through other booksellers and why are they so highly priced</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(This is about my book PROBLEMS WITH A POINT: exploring Math and computer science<br/>
by Gasarch and Kruskal, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279974/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=gasarch&amp;qid=1551731760&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1">here</a>. This post is NOT a plug.)<br/>
<br/>
I often see weird pricing on amazon but don't have enough inside information to explain it. This time I have seen some weird pricing on amazon but DO have enough information to be truly baffled.<br/>
<br/>
My book is on amazon. You can buy it<br/>
<br/>
Softcover new: $38.00<br/>
<br/>
Hardcover new: $68.00<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that all makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
OR you can buy it from some other source.<br/>
<br/>
There are 10 copies of the softcover, they claim new,  ranging from $38.00 to $57.00.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 copies of the softcover, they claim used (how used could it be?), $49 and $53<br/>
<br/>
There are 9 copies of the hardcover, they claim new, ranging from $68.00 to $91.00<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 copies of the hardcover, they claim used, $84.00 and $88.00<br/>
<br/>
This raises two questions<br/>
<br/>
1) I have a copy, Clyde got a copy, and two copy's were send to reviewers. Neither Clyde nor I have sold our copy. So how did 20 or so copies get out there?<br/>
<br/>
2) Why do they cost MORE than list price.<br/>
<br/>
I've asked around and got some answers, but I INVITE you to give more possible answers. If your answer is not just speculation (e.g., `I used to be in the black market  book business and here's the real scoop') then that would be great; however, I will take specuation<br/>
<br/>
POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR HOW SOMEONE GOT COPIES<br/>
<br/>
1) Clyde and I haven't gotten our free copies yet. Hijacked?  Here's hoping the hijackers read it and enjoyed it before posting it. However, this theory is unlikely since I inquired with World Scientific (our publisher) and found out we'll be getting our free copies in 2 weeks. So this theory will either be confirmed or denied in 2 weeks. I would bet against OR those are some really bad hijackers.<br/>
<br/>
2) Complete ripoff. You pay the money and get NOTHING. I think this was more likely in the early days of amazon (or e-bay or....) but now things are pretty well monitored. I have sold books on amazon and am very impressed with how foolproof it is. Still --- could be.<br/>
<br/>
3) Someone hacked my computer. Really? Where did they get the orange covers? Why would they bother? This is not Harry Potter. Plus I asked our staff and NO this could not happen.<br/>
<br/>
4) Some of the shipment dates are fairly far in the future, so they plan to get an order, then<br/>
order the book, and have it send to the buyer, at a profit. Seems like too much sugar for a satoshi, BUT could be profitable if its a bot and its automated to do this with lots of books.<br/>
<br/>
5) My publisher also send the book to other sellers. That does not explain the higher prices.<br/>
<br/>
WHY THE HIGHER PRICES?<br/>
<br/>
1) They are counting on people assuming that other sellers are cheaper without checking. Would people do that? People still fall for the Nigerian billionaire scam, so maybe yes.<br/>
<br/>
2) The seller themselves, which is possibly an army of bots, didn't bother checking but priced it<br/>
similar to other books. This is plausible since $38.00 is fairly cheap, so looking at similar books may get you a higher price.<br/>
<br/>
-----<br/>
Any speculation is welcome so long as it does not involve space aliens or astrology.<br/>

<p><strong>Local Computation Algorithms for Spanners</strong>, by Merav Parter, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Ali Vakilian, Anak Yodpinyanee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08266">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of computing a \(k\)-spanner for a graph \(G\). This is a subgraph \(H\), where (for any pair of vertices) the shortest path distance in \(H\) is at most \(k\) times the corresponding distance in \(G\). A Local Computation Algorithm (LCA) essentially gives sublinear query access to (some spanner) \(H\), without any preprocessing on \(G\). In other words, an LCA takes as input an edge \((i,j)\) in \(G\), and in sublinear time says “yes” or “no”. Despite no preprocessing, it is guaranteed that all the “yes” answers form a spanner, and the number of “yes” answers is small. One of the main challenges in LCAs for graph problems is getting a polynomial dependence on \(\Delta\), the maximum degree. (Many results end up with an exponential dependence on \(\Delta\), essentially assuming bounded-degree.) This paper give an LCA outputting spanners of optimal size for \(k=3,5\), with query complexity \(n^{1-\alpha}\) (for constant \(\alpha\) depending on \(k\)). The second result works for general \(k\), but has a query complexity that is \(O(\Delta^4n^{2/3})\).</p>



<p><strong>Set Cover in Sub-linear Time</strong>, by Piotr Indyk, Sepideh Mahabadi, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Ali Vakilian, Anak Yodpinyanee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03534">arXiv</a>). Set cover needs no introduction. This paper considers sublinear algorithms for set cover. It is convenient to think of the instance as a binary \(m \times n\) matrix, for \(m\) sets over a universe of size \(n\). The query model gives access to the \(j\)th non-zero entry in a desired column/row. The aim is this paper is to actually construct a set cover, and not just approximate its size (the latter problem with initiated in <a href="https://onak.pl/download/publications/Nguyen_Onak-constant_time_approximation.pdf">Nguyen-Onak</a>). The first result shows a black-box conversion of any set cover algorithm into a sublinear query complexity algorithm. Any \(\alpha\)-approximation for set cover can be converted into an \(O(\alpha)\)-approximation, that makes \(O(m(n/k)^{\beta} + nk)\) (where \(k\) is the optimal set cover size, and \(\beta &lt; 1\) depends on \(\alpha\)). For large \(k\), the paper gives an \(O(mn/k)\) query, \(O(\log n)\)-approximation algorithm. There are various lower bounds given, that show these dependencies are necessary.</p>



<p><strong>Distributional Property Testing in a Quantum World</strong> by András Gilyén and Tongyang Li (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00814">arXiv</a>). There are two aspects to quantum distribution testing. First, we can think of faster distribution testing (for classical problems) using quantum computation. Second, we can generalize the problem of distribution testing to its quantum equivalent, called density operator testing (this papers gives the first result for this quantum generalization). A distribution is a non-negative vector in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with unit \(l_1\)-norm. The quantum generalization, a density operator, is a PSD matrix in \(\mathbb{C}^n\) with unit trace. This paper has a number of results, along both aspects. For example, for the well-known problem of testing equality of distributions under total variation distance, the papers gives an \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon)\) tester (an improvement over classical lower bounds). For testing equality of density operators under the same distance, the paper gives an \(O(n/\epsilon)\) tester (note that the trivial bound is \(O(n^2)\), since the operator is a matrix).</p></div>

    <title>TR19-030 |  Non-Locality in Interactive Proofs | 

	Claude Crépeau, 

	Nan Yang</title>
    <summary>In multi-prover interactive proofs (MIPs), the verifier is usually non-adaptive. This stems from an implicit problem which we call “contamination” by the verifier. We make explicit the verifier contamination problem, and identify a solution by constructing a generalization of the MIP model. This new model quantifies non-locality as a new dimension in the characterization of MIPs. A new property of zero-knowledge emerges naturally as a result by also quantifying the non-locality of the simulator.</summary>

    <title>TR19-029 |  Biasing Boolean Functions and Collective Coin-Flipping Protocols over Arbitrary Product Distributions | 

	Yuval Filmus, 

	Lianna Hambardzumyan, 

	Hamed Hatami, 

	Pooya Hatami, 

	David Zuckerman</title>
    <summary>The seminal result of Kahn, Kalai and Linial shows that a coalition of $O(\frac{n}{\log n})$ players can bias the outcome of *any* Boolean function $\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ with respect to the uniform measure. We extend their result to arbitrary product measures on $\{0,1\}^n$, by combining their argument with a completely different argument that handles very biased coordinates. 

We view this result as a step towards proving a conjecture of Friedgut, which states that Boolean functions on the continuous cube $[0,1]^n$ (or, equivalently, on $\{1,\dots,n\}^n$) can be biased using coalitions of $o(n)$ players. This is the first step taken in this direction since Friedgut proposed the conjecture in 2004. 

Russell, Saks and Zuckerman extended the result of Kahn, Kalai and Linial to multi-round protocols, showing that when the number of rounds is $o(\log^* n)$, a coalition of $o(n)$ players can bias the outcome with respect to the uniform measure. We extend this result as well to arbitrary product measures on $\{0,1\}^n$.

The argument of Russell et al.\ relies on the fact that a coalition of $o(n)$ players can boost the expectation of any Boolean function from $\epsilon$ to $1-\epsilon$ with respect to the uniform measure. This fails for general product distributions, as the example of the AND function with respect to $\mu_{1-1/n}$ shows. Instead, we use a novel boosting argument alongside a generalization of our first result to arbitrary finite ranges.</summary>

    <title>TR19-028 |  From DNF compression to sunflower theorems via regularity | 

	Jiapeng Zhang, 

	Shachar Lovett, 

	Noam Solomon</title>
    <summary>The sunflower conjecture is one of the most well-known open problems in combinatorics. It has several applications in theoretical computer science, one of which is DNF compression, due to Gopalan, Meka and Reingold [Computational Complexity 2013]. In this paper, we show that improved bounds for DNF compression imply improved bounds for the sunflower conjecture, which is the reverse direction of [Computational Complexity 2013]. The main approach is based on regularity of set systems and a structure-vs-pseudorandomness approach to the sunflower conjecture.</summary>

<p>
Jimmy Wales is the co-founder of Wikipedia. Of course this is the wonderful online non-profit encyclopedia we all know and love.</p>
<p>
Today I want to talk about using the web to search for math information. </p>
<p>
I do a huge amount of research on the web. Years ago I would spend hours and hours each week in the library. I looked for books and articles on various math issues. No more. Today it’s all web-based resources. What has happened is that primary sources—research papers—have become as easily browsable as Wikipedia. Many of them, anyway.</p>
<p>
Wikipedia often does not include proofs of mathematical theorems—those are linked to primary papers or authoritative surveys or books. There is a website <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">Proof Wiki</a> which tries to bridge the gap without the reader needing to follow links into papers. Right now they are <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Euclid's_Theorem">featuring</a> Euclid’s Theorem on the infinitude of primes—which we have posted about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/29/primes-and-polynomials/">recently</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/07/11/you-cannot-do-that/">before</a>. They have style guides for how the reasoning is laid out.</p>
<p>
There are also many style guides around the web for writing good mathematics and computer science papers. But the guides seem to stop short of the level of the phrases that irk me. When those phrases show up in the primary sources, there’s no fallback. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Phrases </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are a few top ones. I omit the well known ones, the ones that are obvious, and some that are in preparation for a future post—just kidding. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>It is well known</i>. Not by me. The reason I am searching for papers on this subject is that I do not know the basics of the area. If you must say this phrase please add a possible reference. That would be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Clear from the proof of the theorem</i>. Not by me. This means that the author did not state the proof in the greatest generality possible. We all do this, but it may help if this is avoided.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> <i>It is easy to see</i>. Similar to the last item. Ken vividly remembers a seminar in the early 1980s by Peter Neumann at Oxford that showed excerpts from a French mathematician in which the phrase “Il est aisé de voir” appeared often. The French phrase even reads just like the English one. But that mathematician had a reasonable excuse. He was Évariste Galois, and he had a duel early the next morning.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Proof omitted</i>. Please no.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Easy calculation</i>. Not by me. The reason it usually is avoided is that it is too difficult a computation. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>This case is the same as the previous case</i>. Not always. This has been the source of errors for me and others over the years. Good place to check the argument. Maybe a suggestion that there should be a Lemma that covers both cases.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>In our paper in preparation</i>. Please no. I cannot read a paper that does not exist yet.</p>
<p>
Finally the worst in my opinion.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>It costs $37.95</i>. Oh no. Many times we find papers that are behind a pay-wall. I always hate this. The authors of course wish to make they work available to all possible. But the reality is that often papers are protected. Thanks to our friends at Wikipedia and Arxiv that this is not the case for lots of stuff. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/bill-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-15665"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15665" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/bill.png?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
But I have wondered who ever pays the crazy amount of $37.95? Does anyone ever pay that? Is it equivalent to saying: This paper is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ken’s Examples </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken has one example that has driven him crazy for years and again these past two weeks. Many of you have probably used it often.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> <i>This procedure runs in polynomial time.</i> Excuse me, <em>what</em> polynomial time? At least tell us the best exponent you know…</p>
<p>
A related matter is attending to “edge cases” of theorems. Sometimes the edge cases are meant to be excluded. For example, “Let <img alt="{\alpha &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha &gt; 0}"/>” excludes <img alt="{\alpha = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha = 0}"/>; maybe nothing more needs to be said. But in other cases it is not so clear. A theorem may suggest limits and it is nice to say what happens if one tries to take those limits. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are you favorite phrases that drive you crazy?</p></font></font></div>

It’s about Egyptian fractions – representations of rationals as sums of distinct unit fractions – and is motivated by the conjecture that it’s always possible for all denominators to be semiprime.

    <title>Flying Pigs Unsafe at Any Speed</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Take a moment and imagine a flying pig. Do you see a pig with tiny wings lazily guiding along. But pigs are not particularly slow animals as anyone has seen a <a href="https://youtu.be/-eMV1jxfl40?t=73">pig race</a> at a county fair can attest to that. So why not in the air shouldn't a pig go faster than an unladen African swallow?<br/>
<br/>
I have a point discussing the fastness of a flying pig. Consider my favorite flying pig, P = NP. I would put more probability on an actual flying pig (thanks CRISPR) than polynomial-time algorithms for traveling salesman.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I get in the following conversation:<br/>
<br/>
<b>AI person</b>: The P v NP problem is irrelevant as we have machine learning and SAT solvers and we can for all practical purposes solve NP-complete problems.<br/>
<b>Me</b>: If P = NP we can solve AI!<br/>
<b>AI</b>: If P = NP it's likely to have a very slow poly-time algorithm with high exponents and constants and be for all practical purposes useless.<br/>
<br/>
Let's break that down. The claim is E(running time of SAT|running time of SAT is poly) = cn<sup>k</sup> for some large c and k. First of all you are conditioning on a probability zero event. Beyond that nearly all the known problems we know that sit in polynomial time have practical efficient solutions. So under the assumption that SAT is one of these problems, why shouldn't the same rule apply. You've already made the assumption we can reduce its running time from exponential to polynomial, so why would it stop at some high polynomial?<br/>
<br/>
If we are going to talk about the hypothetical flying pig P = NP world, let my algorithms run fast.</div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: A matroid is an abstract combinatorial object which generalizes the notions of spanning trees, and linearly independent sets of vectors. I will talk about an efficient algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to approximately count the number of bases of any given matroid.</p>
<p>The proof is based on a new connections between high dimensional simplicial complexes, and a new class of multivariate polynomials called completely log-concave polynomials. In particular, we exploit a fundamental fact from our previous work that the bases generating polynomial of any given matroid is a log-concave function over the positive orthant.</p>
<p>Based on joint works with Nima Anari, Kuikui Liu, and Cynthia Vinzant.</p></blockquote>
