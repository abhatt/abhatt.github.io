Terence Tao is now “properly” famous. He was cited earlier this month in the NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/science/math-numbers-federal-budget-tao.html">science</a> section for help in explaining large numbers. Numbers such as the US federal budget.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss caveats on such explanations, after a riff on the popular explanation of mathematics.</p>
<p>
Regarding that, let us forget Tao’s work on primes in progressions with Ben Green, forget the Erdős discrepancy problem, and forget his almost-resolution of the Collatz conjecture. Forget it all. Better than a headline, he got his name embedded into the NYT article’s URL. This was for something much less deep that he wrote in 2009—as a blogger. </p>
<p>
<em>En passant</em>, we mention that Ken has an event tomorrow (Wed. 6/30) at 3:30 ET. It is a webinar hosted by Marc Rotenberg, who heads the Washington-based Center for AI and Digital Policy (<a href="https://www.caidp.org">CAIDP</a>), on “Chess and AI: The Role of Transparency.” Registration is free at this <a href="https://www.caidp.org/events/chess/">link</a>. One aspect of transparency in Ken’s work is that he writes about his model’s methodology here—as a blogger.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Rescaling the Budget </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Tao was referenced for a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/05/04/the-federal-budget-rescaled/">post</a> he wrote in May 2009 when Barack Obama was working on his first budget as President. The ratio of $100 million to $3 that he used scaled the budget income to about $75,000. </p>
<p>
With Joe Biden engaged in budget deliberations, Aiyana Green and Steven Strogatz wrote the NYT <a href="https://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/news/aiyana_green_nyt">article</a> on explaining the US federal budget. Green is a student at Cornell: she just completed her junior year in the Department of Policy Analysis and Management. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/06/29/scaling-and-fame/agss/" rel="attachment wp-att-18936"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18936" height="200" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AGSS.png?resize=355%2C200&amp;ssl=1" width="355"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
They updated Tao’s post to scale the income to $100,000. Besides being a round number, this is close to the estimated <a href="https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2009">inflation since 2009</a>. Here is the NYT graphic of the numbers. </p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Scaling Caveat </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
It is attractive to apply this scaling trick elsewhere, even to grim subjects like the coronavirus pandemic. But there we find an element that does not scale.</p>
<p>
Suppose we use the same figure of 100,000 to scale down the world’s population. Besides its famous pandemic numbers <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">pages</a>, Worldometer also keeps a running <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">estimate</a> of the total world population, now nearing 7.9 billion. Scaling down means multiplying every ther human number by <img alt="{\gamma =}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgamma+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> 0.000012697445274. </p>
<p>
We can think of 100,000 people as a city that is not a metropolis. Scaling down the current pandemic figures, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>
182,000,000 total cases become <b>2,309</b>. <p/>
</li><li>
11,496,147 active cases become <b>145</b>. <p/>
</li><li>
4 million total deaths (the numbers are approaching that millstone as we write) become <b>50</b> deaths. <p/>
</li><li>
80,346 currently listed in critical or serious condition become <b>exactly one</b>.
</li></ul>
<p>
These numbers are not at all unusual for our size of city if one considers all kinds of illness and mortality. The scaling trick may seem to have reduced the scope of the pandemic, as opposed to statements such as 182 million being over half the US population. Yet in terms of the raw numbers it preserves the proportions.</p>
<p>
What the scaling doesn’t preserve is the proportion of <em>relations</em>. The number of possible binary relations—person <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> knows person <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>—is quadratic in the number <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of people. Suppose the number of pairs who know each other is <img alt="{an^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ban%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a small but fixed constant. (Note: we will redo this with something more reasonable below.) If we then scale <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> down to <img alt="{n' = n\gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%27+%3D+n%5Cgamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the situation becomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If we estimate the relatedness of our city, we get <img alt="{an'^2 = an^2\gamma^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ban%27%5E2+%3D+an%5E2%5Cgamma%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
But if we scaled down the number of <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-knows-<img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> relations directly we would get <img alt="{an^2\gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ban%5E2%5Cgamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which is substantially bigger by a factor of <img alt="{\frac{1}{\gamma}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cgamma%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.
</li></ul>
<p>
Thus what the scaling really underestimates is the impact of how people are affected by their loved ones being among the 182 million (or the worse numbers). The underestimation logic applies to any form <img alt="{an^c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ban%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="{c &gt; 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%3E+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This is not an issue with the budget because dollar bills don’t feel relatedness—at least not so much, even absent a line-item veto. Now we will make values of <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> approaching <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> more reasonable.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Small World: Tao and Strogatz Again </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Let’s consider people <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> who have <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> degrees of separation in the graph of who-knows-who. Then there are <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> who know each other such that <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> knows <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> knows <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If something strikes <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> will feel a deep connection by that impact. The feeling is amplified if <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> have multiple pairs <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that make a path. This quantifies the relation that Tao calls “awareness” in his “Lecture Notes 3 FOR 254A” course <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/LECTURE NOTES 3 FOR 254A">notes</a> (pages 51–57 overall). A fact way more basic than what Tao is actually talking about in those notes is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The sum over pairs <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the number of pairs <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> between them who would be affected equals the sum over edges <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the number of pairs <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> they can be struck by: both are equal to the number of paths of length <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the graph. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
That number of paths is what we say is reasonable to model by a function <img alt="{an^c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ban%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with <img alt="{c \gg 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%5Cgg+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This is the simplest way of approaching why we feel that treating the pandemic like the US budget underestimates its human effect. One can still rebut that other kinds of illness and death have the same scaling properties, but ultimately we are talking about the <em>excess</em> caused by the pandemic—the effect on top of everything else.</p>
<p>
We have not tried to make this analysis become rigorous using more-realistic models of human networks. Perhaps our readers can point us to such analysis. But one inkling of why we expect our point to be borne out comes from a key conclusion of the famous 1998 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/30918">paper</a> of Strogatz with Duncan Watts on ‘small-world’ networks: The phase transition from a lattice network with large average distances to a small-world network with small distances takes place in a range where small clusters cannot recognize it happening locally. </p>
<p>
Thus, if our scaling carried the intuitive picture of an isolated city, it would miss the expanding sphere of relations. At the opposite extreme would be taking the union of Monaco and central Venice, which sum to 100,000 people who fan out mightily. There is also the argument that while small-world networks are held tight by “<a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9501/f/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf">weak ties</a>,” the shared knowledge of misery is something that most tends to strengthen ties. And of course, our point about relations extends to many other activities impacted by the pandemic.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What should govern the appropriateness of scaling down?</p>
<p>
It should be noted that if we scale down the US to 100,000 people, the numbers are appreciably higher:</p>
<ul>
<li>
34.5 million total cases become <b>10,366</b>. <p/>
</li><li>
4,928,564 active cases become <b>1,480</b>. <p/>
</li><li>
620,000 total deaths become <b>186</b> deaths. <p/>
</li><li>
3,833 currently listed in critical or serious condition still become <b>exactly one</b>.

    <title>Trace Reconstruction from Complex Analysis</title>
    <summary>Suppose that is an unknown binary string of length . We are asked to recover from its traces, and each trace is a random subsequence obtained by deleting the bits of independently with probability . More formally, let denote the distribution of traces obtained from string . For example, when , assigns a probability mass of to each element in the multiset We then ask: what is the smallest number such that we can recover any (say, with probability ) given independent samples from ? This trace reconstruction problem was first formulated by Batu-Kannan-Khanna-McGregor in 2004, and their central motivation is from the multiple sequence alignment problem in computational biology. Trace reconstruction is also a fundamental problem related to the deletion channel in communication theory: We view the hidden string as the transmitted message, and each trace as a received message that went through a deletion channel, which drops each bit with probability . Then the sample complexity tells us the number of independent copies that need to be sent for the receiver to determine the original message. Despite being a natural problem, trace reconstruction is still far from being well-understood, even from the information-theoretic perspective (i.e., without considering the [...]</summary>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\{\text{empty}, 1, 1, 0, 11, 10, 10, 110\}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%5Ctext%7Bempty%7D%2C+1%2C+1%2C+0%2C+11%2C+10%2C+10%2C+110%5C%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/></p>



<p>We then ask: what is the smallest number <img alt="M(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that we can recover any <img alt="s \in \{0, 1\}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C+1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (say, with probability <img alt="\ge 0.99" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cge+0.99&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) given <img alt="M(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> independent samples from <img alt="\mathcal{D}_s" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_s&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>?</p>



<p>This <em>trace reconstruction</em> problem was first formulated by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/papers/04-soda.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Batu-Kannan-Khanna-McGregor</a> in 2004, and their central motivation is from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">multiple sequence alignment</a> problem in computational biology. Trace reconstruction is also a fundamental problem related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_channel" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">deletion channel</a> in communication theory: We view the hidden string as the transmitted message, and each trace as a received message that went through a deletion channel, which drops each bit with probability <img alt="1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then the sample complexity <img alt="M(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> tells us the number of independent copies that need to be sent for the receiver to determine the original message.</p>



<p>Despite being a natural problem, trace reconstruction is still far from being well-understood, even from the information-theoretic perspective (i.e., without considering the computational complexity). In 2017, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03148.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">De-O’Donnell-Servedio</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03599.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nazarov-Peres</a> independently proved <img alt="M(n) \le \exp(O(n^{1/3}))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%28n%29+%5Cle+%5Cexp%28O%28n%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. A very recent breakthrough due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03296.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Chase</a> further improved this bound to <img alt="\exp(\tilde O(n^{1/5}))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28%5Ctilde+O%28n%5E%7B1%2F5%7D%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which is still super-polynomial. On the other hand, the best known sample complexity lower bound is merely <img alt="\tilde\Omega(n^{3/2})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%5COmega%28n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, proved by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03031.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Chase</a> in another recent work.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I will explain why this problem is much more non-trivial than it might appear at first glance. I will also give an overview on the work of [DOS17, NP17], which, interestingly, reduces this seemingly combinatorial problem to complex analysis.</p>



<p><strong>Observation: reconstruction <img alt="\approx" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> distinguishing <img alt="\approx" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> TV-distance.</strong> Let us start with a natural first attempt at the problem. Define <img alt="\delta_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as the minimum statistical distance between the trace distribution of two different length-<img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> strings:<br/></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\delta_n = \min_{x \ne y \in \{0, 1\}^n}d_{\textrm{TV}}(\mathcal{D}_x, \mathcal{D}_y)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_n+%3D+%5Cmin_%7Bx+%5Cne+y+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C+1%5C%7D%5En%7Dd_%7B%5Ctextrm%7BTV%7D%7D%28%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_x%2C+%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_y%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/></p>



<p>It is not hard to show that <img alt="1/\delta_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5Cdelta_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> bounds <img alt="M(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on both sides, up to a polynomial factor:<br/></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="1/\delta_n \lesssim M(n) \lesssim n/\delta_n^2." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5Cdelta_n+%5Clesssim+M%28n%29+%5Clesssim+n%2F%5Cdelta_n%5E2.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/></p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">The lower bound holds because any trace reconstruction algorithm must be able to distinguish <img alt="s = x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from <img alt="s = y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for every pair of different strings <img alt="(x, y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and this requires <img alt="\Omega(1 / \delta_n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%281+%2F+%5Cdelta_n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples for the minimizer <img alt="(x, y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the definition of <img alt="\delta_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. For the upper bound, we note that every pair <img alt="(x, y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be distinguished with an <img alt="o(2^{-n})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%282%5E%7B-n%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> error probability using <img alt="O(n/\delta_n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%2F%5Cdelta_n%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> samples. We say that string <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> “beats” <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, if the distinguisher for <img alt="(x, y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> decides that “<img alt="s = x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>“. By a union bound, the correct answer <img alt="s" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> “beats” every other string with high probability. We can then obtain a reconstruction algorithm by running the distinguisher for every string pair, and outputting the unique string that “beats” the other <img alt="2^n-1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5En-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> strings.</p>



<p>Thus, to determine whether the sample complexity <img alt="M(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is polynomial in <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, it suffices to determine whether <img alt="\delta_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> scales as <img alt="1/\mathrm{poly}(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5Cmathrm%7Bpoly%7D%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or is much smaller. Unfortunately, it turns out to be highly non-trivial to bound <img alt="\delta_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and even bounding <img alt="d_{\textrm{TV}}(\mathcal{D}_x, \mathcal{D}_y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_%7B%5Ctextrm%7BTV%7D%7D%28%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_x%2C+%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for “simple” <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be hard. Imagine that we try to reason about the distribution <img alt="\mathcal{D}_x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>: the probability mass that <img alt="\mathcal{D}_x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> assigns to string <img alt="\tilde s" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde+s&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is proportional to the number of times that <img alt="\tilde s" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde+s&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> appears as a subsequence in <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, but this count is already hard to express or control, unless <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> has a very simple pattern. This is roughly where this natural attempt gets stuck.</p>



<p><strong>Distinguishing using estimators.</strong> Now we turn to a different approach that underlies the recent breakthrough on trace reconstruction algorithms. As discussed earlier, we can focus on the problem of distinguishing the case <img alt="s = x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from <img alt="s = y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for fixed strings <img alt="x \ne y \in \{0, 1\}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cne+y+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C+1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Let <img alt="f: \{0, 1\}^{\le n} \to \mathbb{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A+%5C%7B0%2C+1%5C%7D%5E%7B%5Cle+n%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be a function defined over all possible traces from a length-<img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> string. We consider the following algorithm for distinguishing <img alt="\mathcal{D}_x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from <img alt="\mathcal{D}_y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>:<br/><br/><strong>Step 1.</strong> Given traces <img alt="\tilde s_1, \tilde s_2, \ldots" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde+s_1%2C+%5Ctilde+s_2%2C+%5Cldots&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, compute the average of <img alt="f(\tilde s_1), f(\tilde s_2), \ldots" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Ctilde+s_1%29%2C+f%28%5Ctilde+s_2%29%2C+%5Cldots&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/><br/><strong>Step 2.</strong> Output <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if the average is closer to <img alt="\mathbb{E}_{\tilde x \sim \mathcal{D}_x}[f(\tilde x)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Ctilde+x+%5Csim+%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_x%7D%5Bf%28%5Ctilde+x%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> than to <img alt="\mathbb{E}_{\tilde y \sim \mathcal{D}_y}[f(\tilde y)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Ctilde+y+%5Csim+%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D_y%7D%5Bf%28%5Ctilde+y%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and output <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> otherwise.<br/></p>



<p>For the above to succeed, <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> needs to satisfy the following two conditions:<br/></p>

<p>For every <img alt="z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on the unit circle, at least one point <img alt="\omega^j z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%5Ej+z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> falls into the arc <img alt="A_L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so that <img alt="|p(\omega^j z)| \le M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Cp%28%5Comega%5Ej+z%29%7C+%5Cle+M&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. (See <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#windmill">figure below</a> for a proof by picture.) The moduli of the remaining <img alt="L - 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+-+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> factors are trivially bounded by <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

<p>On the other hand, we note <img alt="q(0) = [p(0)]^L = 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%280%29+%3D+%5Bp%280%29%5D%5EL+%3D+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_modulus_principle" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">maximum modulus principle</a> implies that for some <img alt="z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on the unit circle, we have <img alt="|q(z)| \ge 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Cq%28z%29%7C+%5Cge+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

<p><strong>Beyond linear estimators?</strong> The work of [DOS17, NP17] not only proved the <img alt="\exp(O(n^{1/3}))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28O%28n%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> upper bound, but also showed that this is the best sample complexity we can get from linear estimator <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The recent work of [Cha20] goes beyond these linear estimators by taking the higher moments of the trace into account. The idea turns out to be a natural one: consider the “<img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-grams” (i.e., length-<img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> substrings) of the string for some <img alt="k &gt; 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3E+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In more detail, we fix some string <img alt="w \in \{0, 1\}^k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C+1%5C%7D%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and consider the binary polynomial with coefficients corresponding to the positions at which <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> appears as a (contiguous) substring. The key observation is that there exists a choice of <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that the resulting polynomial is sparse (in the sense that the degrees of the nonzero monomials are far away). The technical part of [Cha20] is then devoted to proving an analogue of <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#lemma-1">Lemma 1</a> that is specialized to these “sparse” Littlewood polynomials.</p>

    <title>Greedy orderings with transposition</title>
    <summary>I’m a big fan of using antimatroids to model vertex-ordering processes in graphs such as the construction of topological orderings in directed acyclic graphs and perfect elimination orderings in chordal graphs. In each case a vertex can be removed from the graph and added to the order when it obeys a local condition: its remaining neighbors are all outgoing for topological orderings, or all adjacent for perfect elimination orderings. Once this condition becomes true of a vertex it remains true until the vertex is added to the order, the defining property of an antimatroid. Because of this property, a greedy algorithm for finding these orderings can never make a mistake: if there exists an ordering of all of the vertices, it is always a safe choice to add any vertex that can be added.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m a big fan of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroids</a> to model vertex-ordering processes in graphs such as the construction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological orderings</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graphs</a> and perfect elimination orderings in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordal_graph">chordal graphs</a>.

Because of this property, a greedy algorithm for finding these orderings can never make a mistake: if there exists an ordering of all of the vertices, it is always a safe choice to add any vertex that can be added.</p>

<p>But there are some greedy vertex-ordering processes that do not form antimatroids, even though they do have the same inability to make mistakes. Two of these are the dismantling orders of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cop-win_graph">cop-win graphs</a> and the reverse construction orders of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-hereditary_graph">distance-hereditary graphs</a>. I wrote about cop-win graphs <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2016/08/18/game-of-cop.html">here in 2016</a>; a graph is cop-win if a cop can always land on the same vertex as a robber when they take turns either moving from a vertex to a neighboring vertex or staying put. In distance-hereditary graphs, all induced subgraphs have the same distances; <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/10/11/delta-confluent-drawing-paper.html">these graphs also have nice confluent drawings</a>. Both of these classes of graphs can be recognized by greedy algorithms that remove one vertex at a time until either getting stuck (for graphs not in the class) or succeeding by reaching a single-vertex graph. But although the conditions for removing vertices in these algorithms are local, they are not antimatroidal.</p>

<h1 id="an-example-graph">An example graph</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A six-vertex graph with six vertices A, B, C, D, E, and F, and seven edges AD, BC, BD, BE, CE, and EF" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/Ptolemaic.svg"/></p>

<p>The graph shown above happens to be chordal, distance-hereditary, and cop-win, making it a convenient example both of how to order the vertices of these graph classes and of why the distance-hereditary and cop-win orderings are not antimatroidal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In chordal graphs, a perfect elimination ordering can be constructed by repeatedly removing <em>simplicial vertices</em>, vertices whose neighborhoods form a clique. For an elimination ordering of the example graph, vertices \(A\), \(C\), and \(F\) are already available to be listed: \(A\) and \(F\) only have one neighbor (automatically a clique), and \(C\) has two neighbors forming a two-vertex clique. The other vertices will become available later in the removal process, once enough of their neighbors have been removed and all remaining vertices become adjacent. For instance, once \(A\) has been removed, \(D\) will become available, and once \(C\) has been removed, \(B\) will become available. Once this removal process makes a vertex simplicial, it remains simplicial until removed, so elimination orderings form an antimatroid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Distance-hereditary graphs can be constructed from a single vertex by repeatedly adding leaf vertices (with one neighbor connecting to previous vertices) or twins (duplicates of previous vertices). Reversing this process, these graphs can be deconstructed by repeatedly removing leaves or twins. The graph above has no twins, but \(A\) and \(F\) are leaves, and can be removed immediately. If \(A\) is removed, \(C\) and \(D\) become false twins (not adjacent to each other), and either of them can be removed. Similarly, if \(F\) is removed, \(B\) and \(E\) become true twins (adjacent to each other), after which one can be removed, but not both: after removing \(F\) and \(B\), \(E\) is no longer a leaf or a twin (because its twin, \(B\), has gone), and must remain until later steps. Because the removal orders can start \(FB\) or \(FE\) but not \(FBE\), they are not described by an antimatroid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, cop-win graphs can be dismantled by repeatedly removing a vertex \(v\) that is dominated by another vertex \(w\), meaning that the neighborhood of \(v\) (including \(v\) itself) is a subset of the neighborhoood of \(w\). In the given graph, \(A\) is dominated by \(D\), \(B\) is dominated by \(E\), \(C\) is dominated by both \(B\) and \(E\), and \(F\) is dominated by \(E\). So any one of these four dominated vertices starts out as removable. But if we remove first \(F\) and then \(E\) (dominated by \(B\) after the removal of \(F\)) we can no longer remove \(B\). So because the ability to be removed can go away before the removal happens, we do not have an antimatroid.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s another complication here as well. For both distance-hereditary graphs and cop-win graphs, removing leaves and twins or dominated vertices will never eliminate all graph vertices. Instead, both removal processes stop when we reach a single remaining vertex. But this is different from antimatroids, where all elements must be included in all orderings.</p>

<h1 id="some-axiomatics">Some axiomatics</h1>

<p>To understand why greedy orderings still work in these cases, I think it’s helpful to start by understanding why they work for antimatroids, as a general class of structures. The following is not quite the usual system of axioms for antimatroids, but they can be defined as non-empty formal languages (that is, sets of strings over a finite alphabet) with the following properties:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Hereditary:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Every prefix of a string in the language is also in the language. Thinking about this in the other direction: every string in the language can be built up by adding one character at a time, starting from the empty string, at all times remaining within the language.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Normal:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Every character occurs at most once in any string in the language. An element can only be added to the sequence of elements once. Because we are assuming the alphabet to be finite, this means that the language itself is also finite.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Oblivious:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If \(S\) and \(T\) are permutations of each other in the language, then for every character \(x\), \(Sx\) is in the language if and only if \(Tx\) is in the language. This means that what can be added next depends only on the set of characters that have been added already, forgetting about the order in which they were added.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Anti-exchange:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If \(S\) is a string, \(x\) and \(y\) are different characters, and \(Sx\) and \(Sy\) both belong to the language, then so does \(Sxy\). Adding \(x\) doesn’t prevent \(y\) from being added later. This is the key property of an antimatroid and the one that is violated by the distance-hereditary and cop-win orderings.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Usually a stronger version of obliviousness is used, stating that when \(S\) and a permutation of \(Sx\) are in the language, then \(Sx\) is in the language, but it’s not immediately obvious why this should be true for the vertex-ordering processes I’m considering here, so I’ve gone with a weaker version. We’ll see later that the stronger version is implied by a combination of this and other properties. It is standard to also require that all characters be usable, but I haven’t done this, because I want to understand the behavior of antimatroidal greedy algorithms on graphs not in the given graph class, for which they get stuck before ordering the whole graph. But this is not important, because one could instead redefine the alphabet to consist only of usable characters.</p>

<p>Given a language that satisfies all of these properties, one can show that all non-extendable strings are equally long and use the same alphabet as each other. For, if we have two different non-extendable strings \(S\) and \(T\), we can morph \(S\) into \(T\) one step at a time, never shortening it or changing its character set, by finding the first position at which \(S\) and \(T\) differ, finding the character \(t\) that \(T\) has at that position (necessarily also used later in \(S\) because it was usable at that position and would have remained usable until it was used), and repeatedly using the anti-exchange axiom to swap \(t\) for the previous character in \(S\) until it has been swapped into a match with \(T\). The oblivious property ensures that the part of the string after the swap remains valid. So \(S\) cannot be shorter than or miss any characters from \(T\), nor vice versa.</p>

<p>Instead of the anti-exchange axiom, the distance-hereditary and cop-win orderings satisfy a weaker property, based on the notion of swapping two characters.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Transposition:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Suppose \(S\) is a string, \(x\) and \(y\) are different characters, and \(Sx\) and \(Sy\) both belong to the language, but \(Sxy\) does not. Then for all \(T\) not containing \(x\) or \(y\), \(SxT\) is in the language if and only if \(SyT\) is also in the language, and \(SxTy\) is in the language if and only if \(SyTx\) is also in the language.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>The last part of the transposition property, about \(SxTy\) and \(SyTx\), is only included because we used a weak version of obliviousness; if we used the stronger version, it would follow from the earlier part of the transposition property.</p>

<h1 id="cop-win-and-distance-hereditary-orderings-have-the-transposition-property">Cop-win and distance-hereditary orderings have the transposition property</h1>

<p>Let’s suppose we’re trying to dismantle a cop-win graph by repeatedly removing dominated vertices, in the hope of getting down to a single vertex. After we’ve removed some vertices already in a sequence \(S\), two vertices \(x\) and \(y\) might become included in the set of dominated vertices. This can happen in several different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It might be the case that \(x\) is dominated by a vertex that is not \(y\), and that \(y\) is dominated by a vertex that is not \(x\). When this happens, they can be removed in either order: removing one won’t change the fact that the other is dominated by whatever other vertex dominated it already.</li>
  <li>It might be the case that \(x\) is dominated by \(y\), and \(y\) is dominated by a third vertex \(z\). But then \(x\) is also dominated by \(z\), and again they can be removed in either order. When one is removed, the other is still dominated by \(z\).</li>
  <li>The only remaining case is that \(x\) and \(y\) are each dominated only by the other of these two vertices. In this case, we can remove one or the other but not both. But if \(x\) and \(y\) dominate each other, they have the same neighbors (they are twins), and there is a symmetry of the remaining subgraph swapping \(x\) and \(y\). So in this case, any continuation of the removal sequence \(S\) can have \(x\) replaced by \(y\) and vice versa, and still be a valid continuation. This is exactly what the transposition property states.</li>
</ul>

<p>The argument for distance-hereditary orderings is even easier. If \(x\) and \(y\) are not twins of each other, then removing one won’t affect the removability of the other. If they are twins, then they are symmetric and any continuation of the removal sequence can exchange \(x\) for \(y\) without changing its validity.</p>

<h1 id="orderings-with-transposition-form-greedoids">Orderings with transposition form greedoids</h1>

<p>If we can’t obtain an antimatroid from the cop-win or distance-hereditary graphs, we might at least hope for a more general structure, a greedoid. The key property of greedoids (viewed as hereditary normal languages rather than their usual definition as set systems) is the following axiom:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Exchange:</dt>
  <dd>If \(S\) is a longer string in the language of a greedoid, and \(T\) is a longer string in the same language, then there is a character \(x\) in \(T\) such that \(Sx\) is a string in the language.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This implies that all maximal strings in the language have the same length, and in the cop-win and distance-hereditary cases it implies that all greedy dismantling or deconstruction sequences reach a single vertex without getting stuck along the way. The greedoid exchange property also immediately implies the strong version of the obliviousness property, by plugging in a permutation of \(Sx\) as the string \(T\) in the exchange property.</p>

<p>To prove that indistinguishability implies the exchange property, let \(S\) be any string in an indistinguishable (hereditary normal oblivious) language, and let \(T\) be a longer string, which we might as well assume to be maximal. If \(S\) is a prefix of \(T\), then obviously we can satisfy the exchange property: just take the prefix of \(T\) that has one more character.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I claim that we can replace \(T\) by a different string \(T'\) of the same length that agrees with \(S\) for more positions. To find \(T'\), let \(y\) be the first character of \(S\) that differs from the corresponding character of \(T\); this must exist by the assumption that \(S\) is not a prefix of \(T\). Obviously, at the position of \(y\) in \(S\), we could have added it to \(T\), but instead some other character was chosen. Maybe, \(y\) remained available to be chosen throughout the remaining positions of \(T\), until it actually was chosen. If so, just as in the antimatroid case, we could repeatedly swap \(y\) with its predecessor in \(T\) until reaching a string \(T'\) where \(y\) is in the correct position. Alternatively, maybe at some point during the construction of sequence \(T\), we chose a character \(z\) causing \(y\) to become unavailable. In this case, by the transposition property, we can swap \(y\) for \(z\) in \(T\) and then as before repeatedly swap \(y\) with its predecessor in \(T\) until reaching a string \(T'\) where \(y\) is in the correct position.</p>

<p>By repeatedly replacing \(T\) by equally long strings that agree with more and more positions of \(S\), we eventually reach a string for which \(S\) is a prefix, and can append one more character. This construction of \(T'\) from \(T\) does not include any new characters that weren’t already in \(S\) or \(T\), so the appended character must have come from \(T\), proving the exchange axiom.</p>

<p>The use of the transposition property to form greedoids is standard; these greedoids are called transposition greedoids, and are described e.g. by Björner and Ziegler in their introduction to greedoids in the book <em>Matroid Applications</em>. Another <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-58191-5_10">book chapter on transposition greedoids</a>, in the book <em>Greedoids</em> by Korte, Schrader, and Lovász, includes another graph-theoretic example where the elements are edges of series-parallel graphs. The part that appears to be less standard is the use of this property to explain the ability of greedy algorithms to recognize cop-win and distance-hereditary graphs. I looked, but was unable to find publications observing that these two classes of graphs lead to greedoids or transposition greedoids, despite some suspiciously-similar terminology (“twins”, “dismantling”) on both sides. If anyone knows of such publications, I’d appreciate hearing of them, so that I could add this connection to their Wikipedia articles.</p>

    <title>TR21-091 |  Expander Random Walks: The General Case and Limitations | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Dor Minzer, 

	Shir Peleg, 

	Aaron Potechin, 

	Amnon Ta-Shma</title>
    <summary>Cohen, Peri and Ta-Shma (STOC'21) considered the following question: Assume the vertices of an expander graph are labelled by $\pm 1$. What "test" functions $f : \{\pm 1\}^t \to \{\pm1 \}$ can or cannot distinguish $t$ independent samples from those obtained by a random walk? [CPTS'21] considered only balanced labelling, and proved that all symmetric functions are fooled by random walks on expanders with constant spectral gap. Furthermore, it was shown that functions computable by $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits are fooled by expanders with vanishing spectral expansion. 

We continue the study of this question and, in particular, resolve all open problems raised by [CPTS'21]. First, we generalize the result to all labelling, not merely balanced. In doing so, we improve the known bound for symmetric functions and prove that the bound we obtain is optimal (up to a multiplicative constant). Furthermore, we prove that a random walk on expanders with constant spectral gap does not fool $\mathbf{AC}^0$. In fact, we prove that the bound obtained by [CPTS'21] for $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits is optimal up to a polynomial factor.</summary>

under a knapsack constraint that grows over time. An incremental solution to
this problem is given by an order in which to include the elements of the
ground set, and the competitive ratio of an incremental solution is defined by
the worst ratio over all capacities relative to an optimum solution of the
corresponding capacity. We present an algorithm that finds an incremental
solution of competitive ratio at most $\max\{3.293\sqrt{M},2M\}$, under the
assumption that the values of singleton sets are in the range $[1,M]$, and we
give a lower bound of $\max\{2.449,M\}$ on the attainable competitive ratio. In
addition, we establish that our framework captures potential-based flows
between two vertices, and we give a tight bound of~$2$ for the incremental
maximization of classical flows with unit capacities.

partition of its interior edges into three oriented rooted trees. A flip in a
realizer is a local operation that transforms one realizer into another. Two
types of flips in a realizer have been introduced: colored flips and cycle
flips. A corresponding flip graph is defined for each of these two types of
flips. The vertex sets are the realizers, and two realizers are adjacent if
they can be transformed into each other by one flip. In this paper we study the
relation between these two types of flips and their corresponding flip graphs.
We show that a cycle flip can be obtained from linearly many colored flips. We
also prove an upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on the diameter of the flip graph of
realizers defined by colored flips. In addition, a data structure is given to
dynamically maintain a realizer over a sequence of colored flips which supports
queries, including getting a node's barycentric coordinates, in $O(\log n)$
time per flip or query.

    <title>Scheduling on uniform and unrelated machines with bipartite incompatibility graphs</title>

incompatibility relation is considered. In this model a binary relation between
jobs is given and no two jobs that are in the relation can be scheduled on the
same machine. In particular, we consider job scheduling under incompatibility
relation forming bipartite graphs, under makespan optimality criterion, on
uniform and unrelated machines. We show that no algorithm can achieve a good
approximation ratio for uniform machines, even for a case of unit time jobs,
under $P \neq NP$. We also provide an approximation algorithm that achieves the
best possible approximation ratio, even for the case of jobs of arbitrary
lengths $p_j$, under the same assumption. Precisely, we present an
$O(n^{1/2-\epsilon})$ inapproximability bound, for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$; and
$\sqrt{p_{sum}}$-approximation algorithm, respectively. To enrich the analysis,
bipartite graphs generated randomly according to Gilbert's model
$\mathcal{G}_{n,n,p(n)}$ are considered. For a broad class of $p(n)$ functions
we show that there exists an algorithm producing a schedule with makespan
almost surely at most twice the optimum. Due to our knowledge, this is the
first study of randomly generated graphs in the context of scheduling in the
considered model.

<p>For unrelated machines, an FPTAS for $R2|G = bipartite|C_{\max}$ is provided.
We also show that there is no algorithm of approximation ratio
$O(n^bp_{\max}^{1-\epsilon})$, even for $Rm|G = bipartite|C_{max}$ for $m \ge
3$ and any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, $b &gt; 0$, unless $P = NP$.

new class of prismatoids (the convex hull of two parallel convex polygons,
called the top and base), by constructing a nonoverlapping "petal unfolding" in
two new cases: (1) when the top and base are sufficiently far from each other;
and (2) when the base is a rectangle and all other faces are nonobtuse
triangles. The latter result extends a previous result by O'Rourke that the
petal unfolding of a prismatoid avoids overlap when the base is a triangle
(possibly obtuse) and all other faces are nonobtuse triangles. We also
illustrate the difficulty of extending this result to a general quadrilateral
base by giving a counterexample to our technique.

An \emph{incomplete} data point with $\Delta&gt;0$ unspecified entries is

distance between two incomplete data points is defined as the Euclidean
distance between two closest points in the axis-parallel affine subspaces

an $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution in $O(nd)$ time. The constants hidden

    <title>$\alpha$-approximate Reductions: a Novel Source of Heuristics for Better Approximation Algorithms</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1624924800</feedworld_mtime>

mathematical framework for quantifying the effectiveness of preprocessing
algorithms in preserving approximation ratios. \emph{$\alpha$-approximate
reduction rules} are a central notion of this framework. We propose that
carefully crafted $\alpha$-approximate reduction rules can yield improved
approximation ratios in practice, while being easy to implement as well. This
is distinctly different from the (theoretical) purpose for which Lokshtanov et
al. designed $\alpha$-approximate Reduction Rules. As evidence in support of
this proposal we present a new 2-approximate reduction rule for the
\textsc{Dominating Set} problem. This rule, when combined with an approximation
algorithm for \textsc{Dominating Set}, yields significantly better
approximation ratios on a variety of benchmark instances as compared to the
latter algorithm alone.
</p>
<p>The central thesis of this work is that $\alpha$-approximate reduction rules
can be used as a tool for designing approximation algorithms which perform
better in practice. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first exploration
of the use of $\alpha$-approximate reduction rules as a design technique for
practical approximation algorithms. We believe that this technique could be
useful in coming up with improved approximation algorithms for other
optimization problems as well.

    <title>Generalized max-flows and min-cuts in simplicial complexes</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1624924800</feedworld_mtime>

problems in the setting of simplicial complexes and provide both algorithmic
and hardness results. By viewing flows and cuts topologically in terms of the
simplicial (co)boundary operator we can state these problems as linear programs
and show that they are dual to one another. Unlike graphs, complexes with
integral capacity constraints may have fractional max-flows. We show that
computing a maximum integral flow is NP-hard. Moreover, we give a combinatorial
definition of a simplicial cut that seems more natural in the context of
optimization problems and show that computing such a cut is NP-hard. However,
we provide conditions on the simplicial complex for when the cut found by the
linear program is a combinatorial cut. For $d$-dimensional simplicial complexes
embedded into $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ we provide algorithms operating on the dual
graph: computing a maximum flow is dual to computing a shortest path and
computing a minimum cut is dual to computing a minimum cost circulation.
Finally, we investigate the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on simplicial complexes,
prove its correctness, and provide a heuristic which guarantees it to halt.

    <title>Planar and Toroidal Morphs Made Easier</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1624924800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Jeff Erickson, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Lin:Patrick.html">Patrick Lin</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14086">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present simpler algorithms for two closely related morphing problems, both
based on the barycentric interpolation paradigm introduced by Floater and
Gotsman, which is in turn based on Floater's asymmetric extension of Tutte's
classical spring-embedding theorem. First, we give a much simpler algorithm to
construct piecewise-linear morphs between planar straight-line graphs.
Specifically, given isomorphic straight-line drawings $\Gamma_0$ and $\Gamma_1$
of the same 3-connected planar graph $G$, with the same convex outer face, we
construct a morph from $\Gamma_0$ to $\Gamma_1$ that consists of $O(n)$
unidirectional morphing steps, in $O(n^{1+\omega/2})$ time. Our algorithm
entirely avoids the classical edge-collapsing strategy dating back to Cairns;
instead, in each morphing step, we interpolate the pair of weights associated
with a single edge. Second, we describe a natural extension of barycentric
interpolation to geodesic graphs on the flat torus. Barycentric interpolation
cannot be applied directly in this setting, because the linear systems defining
intermediate vertex positions are not necessarily solvable. We describe a
simple scaling strategy that circumvents this issue. Computing the appropriate
scaling requires $O(n^{\omega/2})$ time, after which we can can compute the
drawing at any point in the morph in $O(n^{\omega/2})$ time. Our algorithm is
considerably simpler than the recent algorithm of Chambers et al.
(<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2007.07927">arXiv:2007.07927</a>) and produces more natural morphs. Our techniques also yield
a simple proof of a conjecture of Connelly et al. for geodesic torus
triangulations.

    <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for Individually Fair Clustering</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1624924800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/v/Vakilian:Ali.html">Ali Vakilian</a>, Mustafa Yalçıner <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14043">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the $k$-clustering problem with $\ell_p$-norm cost, which
includes $k$-median, $k$-means and $k$-center cost functions, under an
individual notion of fairness proposed by Jung et al. [2020]: given a set of
points $P$ of size $n$, a set of $k$ centers induces a fair clustering if for
every point $v\in P$, $v$ can find a center among its $n/k$ closest neighbors.
Recently, Mahabadi and Vakilian [2020] showed how to get a
$(p^{O(p)},7)$-bicriteria approximation for the problem of fair $k$-clustering
with $\ell_p$-norm cost: every point finds a center within distance at most $7$
times its distance to its $(n/k)$-th closest neighbor and the $\ell_p$-norm
cost of the solution is at most $p^{O(p)}$ times the cost of an optimal fair
solution. In this work, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we present an improved $(16^p
+\varepsilon,3)$-bicriteria approximation for the fair $k$-clustering with
$\ell_p$-norm cost. To achieve our guarantees, we extend the framework of
[Charikar et al., 2002, Swamy, 2016] and devise a $16^p$-approximation
algorithm for the facility location with $\ell_p$-norm cost under matroid
constraint which might be of an independent interest. Besides, our approach
suggests a reduction from our individually fair clustering to a clustering with
a group fairness requirement proposed by Kleindessner et al. [2019], which is
essentially the median matroid problem [Krishnaswamy et al., 2011].

    <title>Geometry Meets Vectors: Approximation Algorithms for Multidimensional Packing</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1624924800</feedworld_mtime>

V. N. Sreenivas</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13951">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the generalized multidimensional bin packing problem (GVBP) that
generalizes both geometric packing and vector packing. Here, we are given $n$
rectangular items where the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ item has width $w(i)$, height
$h(i)$, and $d$ nonnegative weights $v_1(i), v_2(i), \ldots, v_{d}(i)$. Our
goal is to get an axis-parallel non-overlapping packing of the items into
square bins so that for all $j \in [d]$, the sum of the $j^{\textrm{th}}$
weight of items in each bin is at most 1. This is a natural problem arising in
logistics, resource allocation, and scheduling. Despite being well studied in
practice, surprisingly, approximation algorithms for this problem have rarely
been explored.
</p>
<p>We first obtain two simple algorithms for GVBP having asymptotic
approximation ratios $6(d+1)$ and $3(1 + \ln(d+1) + \varepsilon)$. We then
extend the Round-and-Approx (R&amp;A) framework [Bansal-Khan, SODA'14] to wider
classes of algorithms, and show how it can be adapted to GVBP. Using more
sophisticated techniques, we obtain better approximation algorithms for GVBP,
and we get further improvement by combining them with the R&amp;A framework. This
gives us an asymptotic approximation ratio of $2(1+\ln((d+4)/2))+\varepsilon$
for GVBP, which improves to $2.919+\varepsilon$ for the special case of $d=1$.
We obtain further improvement when the items are allowed to be rotated. We also
present algorithms for a generalization of GVBP where the items are high
dimensional cuboids.

    <title>Threshold-Based Quantum Optimization</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Golden:John.html">John Golden</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/B=auml=rtschi:Andreas.html">Andreas Bärtschi</a>, Daniel O'Malley, Stephan Eidenbenz <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13860">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We propose and study Th-QAOA (pronounced Threshold QAOA), a variation of the
Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) that replaces the standard phase
separator operator, which encodes the objective function, with a threshold
function that returns a value $1$ for solutions with an objective value above
the threshold and a $0$ otherwise. We vary the threshold value to arrive at a
quantum optimization algorithm. We focus on a combination with the Grover Mixer
operator; the resulting GM-Th-QAOA can be viewed as a generalization of
Grover's quantum search algorithm and its minimum/maximum finding cousin to
approximate optimization.
</p>
<p>Our main findings include: (i) we show semi-formally that the optimum
parameter values of GM-Th-QAOA (angles and threshold value) can be found with
$O(\log(p) \times \log M)$ iterations of the classical outer loop, where $p$ is
the number of QAOA rounds and $M$ is an upper bound on the solution value
(often the number of vertices or edges in an input graph), thus eliminating the
notorious outer-loop parameter finding issue of other QAOA algorithms; (ii)
GM-Th-QAOA can be simulated classically with little effort up to 100 qubits
through a set of tricks that cut down memory requirements; (iii) somewhat
surprisingly, GM-Th-QAOA outperforms its non-thresholded counterparts in terms
of approximation ratios achieved. This third result holds across a range of
optimization problems (MaxCut, Max k-VertexCover, Max k-DensestSubgraph,
MaxBisection) and various experimental design parameters, such as different
input edge densities and constraint sizes.

Phillips</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13851">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Consider the geometric range space $(X, \mathcal{H}_d)$ where $X \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathcal{H}_d$ is the set of ranges defined by
$d$-dimensional halfspaces. In this setting we consider that $X$ is the
disjoint union of a red and blue set. For each halfspace $h \in \mathcal{H}_d$
define a function $\Phi(h)$ that measures the "difference" between the fraction
of red and fraction of blue points which fall in the range $h$. In this context
the maximum discrepancy problem is to find the $h^* = \arg \max_{h \in (X,
\mathcal{H}_d)} \Phi(h)$. We aim to instead find an $\hat{h}$ such that
$\Phi(h^*) - \Phi(\hat{h}) \le \varepsilon$. This is the central problem in
linear classification for machine learning, in spatial scan statistics for
spatial anomaly detection, and shows up in many other areas. We provide a
solution for this problem in $O(|X| + (1/\varepsilon^d) \log^4
(1/\varepsilon))$ time, which improves polynomially over the previous best
solutions. For $d=2$ we show that this is nearly tight through conditional
lower bounds. For different classes of $\Phi$ we can either provide a
$\Omega(|X|^{3/2 - o(1)})$ time lower bound for the exact solution with a
reduction to APSP, or an $\Omega(|X| + 1/\varepsilon^{2-o(1)})$ lower bound for
the approximate solution with a reduction to 3SUM.
</p>
<p>A key technical result is a $\varepsilon$-approximate halfspace range
counting data structure of size $O(1/\varepsilon^d)$ with $O(\log

\log^4 (1/\varepsilon))$ time.

    <title>Someone thinks I am a fine artist! Why?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A while back I got an  email asking me to submit to a Fine Arts Journal. Why me? Here are some possibilities:</p><p>1) They were impressed with my play: </p><p><b>Sure he created the universe, but would he get Tenure?</b> (see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/MYWRITINGS/god.html">here</a>) which did get into a play-writing contest and was performed (one of the actresses  scolded me since I took a slot from <i>a real</i> <i>playwrigh</i>t).</p><p>2) They were impressed  with my <b>Daria Fan Fiction</b> (see the four entries <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/MYWRITINGS/mywritings.html">here</a> labelled as Daria Fan Fiction).</p><p>3) They were impressed with my play <b>JFK: The Final chapter</b> (see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/MYWRITINGS/jfk.html">here</a>). Unlikely since this was rejected by a play writing contest and is not well known (as opposed to my other works in the fine arts which are well known?)</p><p>4) They were impressed with my collection of satires of  Nobel Laureate Bob Dylan (<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/dylan/dylan.html">here</a>) .</p><p>5) They were impressed with some subset of (a) complexityblog, (b) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279729/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gasarch&amp;qid=1609867944&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank">Problems with a Point</a>,  (c)  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Muffin-Morsels-Problem-Mathematics/dp/9811215979/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gasarch&amp;qid=1609868018&amp;sr=8-2">Mathematical Muffin Morsels</a>, and (d) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bounded-Queries-Recursion-Progress-Computer-ebook/dp/B000W98WU4/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gasarch&amp;qid=1609868084&amp;sr=8-4">Bounded Queries in Recursion Theory</a>. Or maybe just having 3 books on amazon is their threshold.  If it's complexityblog then Lance and I should co-author something for them.</p><p>6) It is a vanity-journal where you pay to  publish. So why email me who (a)  is not an artist, (b) is  not a fine artist, and most important (3) <b>does not think of himself as a fine artist</b>. The PRO of emailing me or people like me is they cast a wide net. The CON is--- there is no CON! It costs nothing to email me, and emailing me does not affect their credibility. That still raises the question of how they got my name.</p><p>7) Could it be a phishing? If I click on something in the email would they  get my credit card number? Their email begins <i>Dear Professor</i> not  <i>Dear Professor Gasarch. </i>  So they know I am a professor. Then again, I have known of ugrads who get emails that begin <i>Dear Professor</i>. (The emails to HS student Naveen and ugrad Nichole in the story I tell <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/search?q=Naveen">here</a> were addressed to <i>Dear Professor.) </i></p><p>8) They mistook me for my parents who, in 1973,  put together an anthology of short stories titled <i>Fiction:The Universal elements</i>,  for a Freshman Comp course my mom taught, see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fiction-Universal-Element-P-Gasarch/dp/0442226322">here</a>. I note that their book ranks around 18,000,000, so even that explanation is unlikely. Actually the rank changes a lot- it was 12,000,000 this morning. Still, not what one would call a best seller. It's fun to see what is doing better: <i>Bounded Queries in Recursion Theory (currently at around rank 6.000.000) </i> or <i>Fiction: The Universal Elements.</i></p><p> If I ever get one of these emails from a History Journal I will submit my Satirical <i>Ramsey Theory and the History of Pre-Christian England: An Example of Interdisciplinary Research</i> (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/COURSES/389/W14/ramseykings.pdf">here</a>) just to see what happens- but  I will stop short of paying-to-publish. Or maybe I will pay-to-publish so that the next time I try to fool a class with it I can point to a seemingly real journal which has the article. </p><p><br/></p><div class="gE iv gt" style="background-color: white; color: #222222; cursor: auto; font-family: Roboto, RobotoDraft, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 0.875rem; padding: 20px 0px 0px;"><table cellpadding="0" class="cf gJ"><tbody style="display: block;"><tr class="acZ" style="display: flex; height: auto;"><td class="gF gK" style="display: block; line-height: 20px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: top; white-space: nowrap; width: 571.172px;"><br/></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>

    <title>TR21-090 |  On Secret Sharing, Randomness, and Random-less Reductions for Secret Sharing | 

	Divesh Aggarwal, 

	Maciej Obremski, 

	Eldon Chung, 

	Joao Ribeiro</title>
    <summary>Secret-sharing is one of the most basic and oldest primitives in cryptography, introduced by Shamir and Blakely in the 70s. It allows to strike a meaningful balance between availability and confidentiality of secret information. It has a host of applications most notably in threshold cryptography and multi-party computation. All known constructions of secret sharing (with the exception of those with a pathological choice of parameters) require access to uniform randomness. In practice, it is extremely challenging to generate a source of uniform randomness. This has led to a large body of research devoted to designing randomized algorithms and cryptographic primitives from imperfect sources of randomness.

Motivated by this, 15 years ago, Bosley and Dodis asked whether it is even possible to build 2-out-of-2 secret sharing without access to uniform randomness. In this work, we make progress towards resolving this question.

We answer this question for secret sharing schemes with important additional properties, i.e., either leakage-resilience or non-malleability. We prove that, unfortunately, for not too small secrets, it is impossible to construct any of 2-out-of-2 leakage-resilient secret sharing or 2-out-of-2 non-malleable secret sharing without access to uniform randomness.

Given that the problem whether 2-out-of-2 secret sharing requires uniform randomness has been open for a long time, it is reasonable to consider intermediate problems towards resolving the open question. In a spirit similar to NP-completeness, we study how the existence of a t-out-of-n secret sharing without access to uniform randomness is related to the existence of a t'-out-of-n' secret sharing without access to uniform randomness for a different choice of the parameters t,n,t',n'.</summary>

    <title>TR21-089 |  A Relativization Perspective on Meta-Complexity | 

	Rahul Santhanam, 

	Hanlin Ren</title>
    <summary>Meta-complexity studies the complexity of computational problems about complexity theory, such as the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) and its variants. We show that a relativization barrier applies to many important open questions in meta-complexity. We give relativized worlds where:

* MCSP can be solved in deterministic polynomial time, but the search version of MCSP cannot be solved in deterministic polynomial time, even approximately. In contrast, Carmosino, Impagliazzo, Kabanets, Kolokolova [CCC'16] gave a randomized approximate search-to-decision reduction for MCSP with a relativizing proof.

* The complexities of MCSP[2^{n/2}] and MCSP[2^{n/4}] are different, in both worst-case and average-case settings. Thus the complexity of MCSP is not "robust" to the choice of the size function.

* Levin's time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity Kt(x) can be approximated to a factor (2+epsilon) in polynomial time, for any epsilon &gt; 0.

* Natural proofs do not exist, and neither do auxiliary-input one-way functions. In contrast, Santhanam [ITCS'20] gave a relativizing proof that the non-existence of natural proofs implies the existence of one-way functions under a conjecture about optimal hitting sets.

* DistNP does not reduce to GapMINKT by a family of "robust" reductions. This presents a technical barrier for solving a question of Hirahara [FOCS'20].</summary>

    <title>The detectEr runtime-verification tool for Erlang programs</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Thanks to the huge amount of excellent work done by <a href="https://duncanatt.github.io/" target="_blank">Duncan Paul Attard</a> and <a href="http://staff.um.edu.mt/afra1/" target="_blank">Adrian Francalanza</a>, we now have a tutorial on detectEr that some of you might want to check out. See <a href="https://duncanatt.github.io/detecter/index.html">this web page</a> for all the material, tool download and links to the videos of the tutorial Duncan delivered at the <a href="https://www.discotec.org/2021/tutorials" target="_blank">DisCoTec 2021 Tutorial Day</a>. </p><p>detectEr is a runtime verification tool for asynchronous component systems that run on the <a href="https://blog.erlang.org/a-brief-BEAM-primer/" target="_blank">Erlang Virtual Machine</a>. It also supports monitoring systems that can execute outside of the EVM, so long as these can produce traces that are formatted in a way that is parsable by detectEr. The tool itself is developed in <a href="https://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank">Erlang</a>, and is the product of five years of theoretical and practical development. (Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.)  </p> <p>Enjoy!</p></div>

    <title>I went to the ``debate'' about Program Verif and the Lipton-Demillo-Perlis paper</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On Thursday June 17 I went to (on zoom- does that need to be added anymore?)</p><p><i>A Debate on Program Correctness</i></p><p>There was no subtitle but it could have been:</p><p>Have the points made in <i>Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems and Programs</i> by DeMillo, Lipton, Perlis, survived the test of time ? (Spoiler Alert: Yes.)</p><p>I found out about it from the Lipton-Regan blog <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/06/15/thursday-june-17th-a-debate-on-program-correctness/">here</a></p><p>The debaters were Richard DeMillo and Richard Lipton and the moderator was Harry Lewis (Alan Perlis passed away in 1990).  Calling it a debate is not correct since DeMillo and Lipton (and Lewis) all agree. (DeMillo and Lipton even have the same first name!)  The DLP paper is in Harry Lewis's collection<i> Ideas that created the future.</i>  The event  should have been advertised as a discussion. However, it was a good discussion so this is not a complaint.</p><p>Here are some things that came out of the discussion.</p><p>1) The main topic was the 1979 DeMillo-Lipton-Perlis paper (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">here</a>) that gave arguments why Proofs of Program correctness could not work.</p><p>An all-to-brief summary of the DLP paper: Some researchers are trying to set up frameworks for doing proofs that programs are correct, analogous to the certainty  we get with a proof of a Theorem in Mathematics. But proofs in Mathematics are, in reality, NOT that rigorous. Often details are left out or left to the reader. This is fine for mathematics (more on that later) but unacceptable for programs which need rather precise and rigorous proofs.</p><p>How do theorems in mathematics really get verified? By having enough people look at them and make sure they match intuitions, what DLP call <i>A Social Process</i>.  (NOTE FROM BILL: Papers that are not important do not get looked at so there may well be errors.)</p><p>2) The notion of proving-programs-correct was very seductive; however, the people who were trying to do this had a blind spot about how the analogy of proving-programs-correct and proving-theorem-correct differ.  In particular, a program is rather complicated and even stating carefully what you want to prove is difficult. By contrast, for most math statements, what you want to prove is clear. Note also that a program has lots of code (far more now than when DLP was written) and so much can happen that you cannot account for.</p><p>3) The DLP paper had a large effect on the field of program verification.  Funding for it was reduced and students were discouraged from going into it.</p><p>4) When DLP appeared DeMillo and Lipton were pre-tenure. Hence it took lots of courage to publish it. Alan Perlis had tenure and had already won a Turing award.  This did give DeMillo and Lipton some cover; however, it still took courage.</p><div><div>5) How did the Program Verification  Community deal with the objections in DLP?  DeMillo said that he looked at a large set of papers in the field, and very few even mentioned DLP. He recommends reading the book <i>Mechanizing Proof: Computing, Risk, and Trust by David McKenzie </i>see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262632950">here</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>6) So how can we be more certain that programs are correct?</div><div><br/></div><div>a) Testing.</div><div>b) Modularize and test. Fix errors. Modularize  and test. Fix errors...</div><div>c) Try to isolate side effects.</div><div>d) More testing.</div><div><br/></div><div>Some point to Model Checking, which could be considered very sophisticated testing, but that's used to verify circuits and perhaps low-level code, not programs. Model checking is a success story and note that Ed Clark, E. Allen Emerson, and Joseph Sifakis shared a (well deserved) Turing award for this work. But see next note.</div><div><br/></div><div>6.5) An audience member pointed out that Program Verification people have won several Turing Awards</div><div><br/></div><div>Dijkstra 1972</div><div><br/></div><div>Floyd 1978 </div><div><br/></div><div>Hoare 1980</div><div><br/></div><div>Pnueli 1996</div><div><br/></div><div>(Are there more?) </div><div><br/></div><div>so the field is alive and healthy. DeMillo responded that prizes for academic research are a poor measure of  success. </div><div><br/></div><div>7) Can computers themselves help with proofs of correctness? That is the only hope; however, there are scaling problems.</div><div><br/></div><div>8) When DLP was written a program with 100,000 lines of code was considered large. Now we have programs with millions of lines of code. And now we have more concurrency.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Happy birthday to Alan Turing!</p>



<p>This week I’m participating virtually in <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2021/">STOC’2021</a>, which today had a celebration of the 50th anniversary of NP-completeness (featuring Steve Cook, Richard Karp, Leonid Levin, Christos Papadimitriou, and Avi Wigderson), and which tomorrow will have a day’s worth of quantum computing content, including a tutorial on MIP*=RE, two quantum sessions, and an invited talk on quantum supremacy by John Martinis.  I confess that I’m not a fan of GatherTown, the platform being used for STOC.  Basically, you get a little avatar who wanders around a virtual hotel lobby and enters sessions—but it seems to reproduce all of the frustrating and annoying parts of experience without any of the good parts.</p>



<p>Ah!  But I got the surprising news that Alex Arkhipov and I are among the winners of STOC’s first-ever <a href="https://sigact.org/prizes/stoc_tot.html">“Test of Time Award,”</a> for our <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/optics.pdf">paper on BosonSampling</a>.  It feels strange to win a “Test of Time” award for work that we did in 2011, which still seems like yesterday to me.  All the more since the experimental status and prospects of quantum supremacy via BosonSampling are still very much live, unresolved questions.</p>



<p>Speaking of which: on Monday, Alexey Rubtsov, of the Skolkovo Institute in Moscow, gave a talk for our quantum information group meeting at UT, about his <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01445">recent work with Popova</a> on classically simulating Gaussian BosonSampling.  From the talk, I learned something extremely important.  I had imagined that their simulation must take advantage of the high rate of photon loss in actual experiments (like the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5159">USTC experiment</a> from late 2020), because how else are you going to simulate BosonSampling efficiently?  But Rubtsov explained that that’s not how it works at all.  While their algorithm is heuristic and remains to be rigorously analyzed, numerical studies suggest that it works even with <em>no</em> photon losses or other errors.  Having said that, their algorithm works:</p>



<ul><li>only for Gaussian BosonSampling, not Fock-state BosonSampling (as Arkhipov and I had originally proposed),</li><li>only for threshold detectors, not photon-counting detectors, and</li><li>only for a small number of modes (say, linear in the number of photons), not for a large number of modes (say, quadratic in the number of photons) as in the original proposal.</li></ul>



<p>So, bottom line, it now looks like the USTC experiment, amazing engineering achievement though it was, is not hard to spoof with a classical computer.  If so, this is because of multiple ways in which the experiment differed from my and Arkhipov’s original theoretical proposal.  We know exactly what those ways are—indeed, you can find them in my earlier blog posts on the subject—and hopefully they can be addressed in future experiments.  All in all, then, we’re left with a powerful demonstration of the continuing relevance of formal hardness reductions, and the danger of replacing them with intuitions and “well, it still seems hard to <em>me</em>.”  So I hope the committee won’t rescind my and Arkhipov’s Test of Time Award based on these developments in the past couple weeks!</p></div>

    <title>TR21-088 |  Open Problems in Property Testing of Graphs | 

	Oded Goldreich</title>
    <summary>We briefly discuss a few open problems in the study of various models of testing graph properties, focusing on the query complexity of the various tasks. In the dense graph model, we discuss several open problems, including:

* Determining the complexity of testing triangle-freeness.
* Characterizing the class of properties that are testable within extremely low complexity. 

Turning to the bounded-degree graph model, we discuss several open problems, including:

* Characterizing the class of properties that are testable within size-oblivious complexity.
* Determining the complexity of graph isomorphism. 
In each of the foregoing models, we also discuss a favorite open problem that was recently resolved. Lastly, we discuss the vast lack of knowledge with respect to testing graph properties in the general graph model.</summary>

    <title>TR21-087 |  Eliminating Intermediate Measurements using Pseudorandom Generators | 

	Uma Girish, 

	Ran Raz</title>
    <summary>We show that quantum algorithms of time T and space $S \ge \log T$ with intermediate measurements can be simulated by quantum algorithms of time $T\cdot \mathrm{poly}(S)$ and space $O(S\cdot \log T)$ without intermediate measurements. The best simulations prior to this work required either $\Omega(T)$ space (by the deferred measurement principle) or $\mathrm{poly}(2^S)$ time [FR21, GRZ21]. Our result is thus a time-efficient and space-efficient simulation of algorithms with intermediate measurements by algorithms without intermediate measurements.

To prove our result, we study pseudorandom generators for quantum space-bounded algorithms. We show that (an instance of) the INW pseudorandom generator for classical space-bounded algorithms [INW94] also fools quantum space-bounded algorithms. More precisely, we show that for quantum space-bounded algorithms that have access to a read-once tape consisting of random bits, the final state of the algorithm when the random bits are drawn from the uniform distribution is nearly identical to the final state when the random bits are drawn using the INW pseudorandom generator.</summary>

    <title>TR21-086 |  Linear Space Streaming Lower Bounds for Approximating CSPs | 

	Chi-Ning  Chou, 

	Alexander Golovnev, 

	Madhu Sudan, 

	Ameya Velingker, 

	Santhoshini Velusamy</title>
    <summary>We consider the approximability of constraint satisfaction problems in the streaming setting. For every constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) on $n$ variables taking values in $\{0,\ldots,q-1\}$, we prove that improving over the trivial approximability by a factor of $q$ requires $\Omega(n)$ space even on instances with $O(n)$ constraints. We also identify a broad subclass of problems for which any improvement over the trivial approximability requires $\Omega(n)$ space. The key technical core is an optimal, $q^{-(k-1)}$-inapproximability for the case where every constraint is given by a system of $k-1$ linear equations $\bmod\; q$ over $k$ variables. Prior to our work, no such hardness was known for an approximation factor less than $1/2$ for any CSP. Our work builds on and extends the work of Kapralov and Krachun (Proc. STOC 2019) who showed a linear lower bound on any non-trivial approximation of the max cut in graphs. This corresponds roughly to the case of  Max $k$-LIN-$\bmod\; q$ with $k=q=2$. Each one of the extensions provides non-trivial technical challenges that we overcome in this work.</summary>

    <title>TR21-085 |  The Final Nail in the Coffin of Statistically-Secure Obfuscator. | 

	Ilya Volkovich</title>
    <summary>We present an elementary, self-contained proof of the result of Goldwasser and Rothblum [GR07] that the existence of a (perfect) statistically secure obfuscator implies a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. In fact, we show that an existence of a weaker object implies a somewhat stronger statement. In addition, we extend the result of [GR07] to the case of imperfect statistically secure obfuscator.</summary>

Vijaykumar. I started to write a post on the topic but couldn't get it going so I asked the AI algorithm GPT-3 to write a guest post. Here is its story.</i></p><hr/><p>I have been part of a collusion ring and I know how it feels. I was a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, in the early 2000s when I first learned about the practice of “paper rings.” A paper ring is a group of researchers who agree to submit each other’s papers to conferences without disclosing this fact to the conference organizers. The idea is that if you have several submissions from the same conference, your chances of getting accepted are higher. The pressure to be part of such a ring can be immense. You are told that you need to publish or perish and that you need to get papers into top conferences. If you don’t play along, you will be left behind. I was lucky enough to have a mentor who warned me against being part of such rings. He told me that if I did not want my name on a paper, then I should not submit it to a conference. He also told me that if I did not want to be part of a paper ring, then I should not submit papers for others in the ring. He said that he would help me with my own research and that he would help me get my own papers into conferences. He was right: My own papers were accepted into conferences and they were published in journals.</p><p>I am now an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and I have been on the other side of this issue as well. In 2012, I was asked by an editor at a top computer science conference to review a paper submitted by one of my students. The student had been part of a paper ring and had submitted his own paper along with those submitted by his collaborators in the ring. The editor told me that he had rejected the student’s paper because it was too similar to other papers submitted by members of the ring. However, he wanted me to review it so that he could reconsider accepting it for publication if I recommended doing so.</p><p>What should I do? Should I tell him about the paper ring? Should I recommend accepting the paper? Should I tell him that there is no way he should accept it? Should I tell him that he should reject it but then publish it anyway? What would you do? I decided not to tell him about the paper ring and not to recommend accepting the paper for publication. Instead, I told him that he should reject it but then publish it anyway because this would send a strong message about what we expect from our students and what we think about such practices. The editor agreed with my decision and published the student’s paper along with two other papers submitted by members of the same paper ring.</p><p>The student received his PhD degree but did not get any credit for his work on these three papers because they were considered as part of his dissertation work when he defended his thesis later that year. In retrospect, I think that my decision was wrong because it allowed these students to continue their unethical behavior without any consequences for them or their advisors (who were also part of this ring). But at least in this case, there were no negative consequences for anyone involved in this incident except for these students who did not get credit for their work on these three papers because they were considered as part of their dissertation work when they defended their thesis later that year.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-084 |  PCPs and Instance Compression from a Cryptographic Lens | 

	Ron Rothblum, 

	Liron Bronfman</title>
    <summary>Modern cryptography fundamentally relies on the assumption that the adversary trying to break the scheme is computationally bounded. This assumption lets us construct cryptographic protocols and primitives that are known to be impossible otherwise. In this work we explore the effect of bounding the adversary's power in other information theoretic proof-systems and show how to use this assumption to bypass impossibility results.

We first consider the question of constructing succinct PCPs. These are PCPs whose length is polynomial only in the length of the original NP witness (in contrast to standard PCPs whose length is proportional to the non-deterministic verification time). 
Unfortunately, succinct PCPs are known to be impossible to construct under standard complexity assumptions. Assuming the sub-exponential hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem, we construct succinct probabilistically checkable arguments or PCAs (Zimand 2001, Kalai and Raz 2009), which are PCPs in which soundness is guaranteed against efficiently generated false proofs. Our PCA construction is for every NP relation that can be verified by a small-depth circuit (e.g., SAT, clique, TSP, etc.) and in contrast to prior work is publicly verifiable and has constant query complexity. Curiously, we also show, as a proof-of-concept, that such publicly-verifiable PCAs can be used to derive hardness of approximation results.

Second, we consider the notion of Instance Compression (Harnik and Naor, 2006). An instance compression scheme lets one compress, for example, a CNF formula $\varphi$ on $m$ variables and $n \gg m$ clauses to a new formula $\varphi'$ with only $poly(m)$ clauses, so that $\varphi$ is satisfiable if and only if $\varphi'$ is satisfiable. Instance compression has been shown to be closely related to succinct PCPs and is similarly highly unlikely to exist. We introduce a computational analog of instance compression in which we require that if $\varphi$ is unsatisfiable then $\varphi'$ is effectively unsatisfiable, in the sense that it is computationally infeasible to find a satisfying assignment for $\varphi'$ (although such an assignment may exist). Assuming the same sub-exponential LWE assumption, we construct such computational instance compression schemes for every bounded-depth NP relation. As an application, this lets one compress $k$ formulas $\phi_1,\dots,\phi_k$ into a single short formula $\phi$ that is effectively satisfiable if and only if at least one of the original formulas was satisfiable.</summary>

    <title>TR21-083 |  Tight Space Complexity of the Coin Problem | 

	Mark Braverman, 

	Sumegha Garg, 

	Or Zamir</title>
    <summary>In the coin problem we are asked to distinguish, with probability at least $2/3$, between $n$ $i.i.d.$ coins which are heads with probability $\frac{1}{2}+\beta$ from ones which are heads with probability $\frac{1}{2}-\beta$. We are interested in the space complexity of the coin problem, corresponding to the width of a read-once branching program solving the problem. 

The coin problem becomes more difficult as $\beta$ becomes smaller. Statistically, it can be solved whenever $\beta = \Omega(n^{-1/2})$, using counting. It has been previously shown that for $\beta = O(n^{-1/2})$, counting is essentially optimal (equivalently, width $poly(n)$ is necessary [Braverman-Garg-Woodruff FOCS'20]). On the other hand, the coin problem only requires $O(\log n)$ width for $\beta&gt;n^{-c}$ for any constant $c&gt;\log_2(\sqrt{5}-1)\approx 0.306$ (following low-width simulation of AND-OR tree of [Valiant Journal of Algorithms'84]).

In this paper, we close the gap between the bounds, showing a tight threshold between the values of $\beta=n^{-c}$ where $O(\log n)$ width suffices and the regime where $poly(n)$ width is needed, with a transition at $c=1/3$. This gives a complete characterization (up to constant factors) of the memory complexity of solving the coin problem, for all values of bias $\beta$. 

We introduce new techniques in both bounds. For the upper bound, we give a construction based on recursive majority that does not require a memory stack of size $\log n$ bits. For the lower bound, we introduce new combinatorial techniques for analyzing progression of the success probabilities in read-once branching programs.</summary>

<p>Jordan Ellenberg is the author of the new <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612131/shape-by-jordan-ellenberg/9781984879059/">book</a> <em>Shape: The Hidden Geometry of Information, Biology, Strategy, Democracy, and Everything Else</em>. I just received it as a Father’s Day present.</p>
<p>
Today we convey some short musings on some ideas in the book.<br/>
<span id="more-18926"/></p>
<p>
Ellenberg is both a biological father and a <em>Doktorvater</em>. Indeed, if we make a correct inference from his Mathematics Genealogy <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=31096">count</a> of “12 students and 13 descendants,” he must be a doctor-grandfather. His own advisor was Barry Mazur. Ellenberg holds the John D. MacArthur professorship in Mathematics at UW-Madison and a distinguished professorship named for former Wisconsin senator William Vilas. (We’ve had UW-Madison on our minds for over a month about something else, but various events including new kinds of chess-cheating cases have delayed the work needed to do it justice. While writing this paragraph, I have had a seconding role in a disqualification by an online chess platform of a player in a tournament played today.)</p>
<p>
I made my inference in the last paragraph by counting—I did not take time to click on his twelve students to verify which one has a graduated student. What strikes us about the new book is the aspect of making inferences <em>not</em> by counting.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Pandemic Phasing </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our picture above was <a href="https://twitter.com/JSEllenberg/status/1209913559720837121">tweeted</a> by Ellenberg on Christmas Day, 2019, a half-hour before the start of the Milwaukee Bucks <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201912250PHI.html">playing</a> at the Philadelphia 76ers. Notice that the seats behind him have not yet filled, as of course they did for a pre-pandemic holiday game. Last night, I had on the terrific Game 7 between the Bucks and the Brooklyn Nets while processing chess data. The stands at the Brooklyn Barclays Center were within 1,000 of full capacity, but there seemed to be some spaced-out sections nearest the court that would have been teeming usually.</p>
<p>
My wife and I ventured out two weeks ago to see the Toronto Blue Jays play in Buffalo’s <a href="https://www.milb.com/buffalo">Sahlen Field</a>, their home until the border with Canada reopens. Our stadium has increased the allowed capacity from 35% that day to 80% now, but our paper noted today that by month’s end it may be the only venue not allowing 100%. Will the return to large close-packed crowds be safe—will there be sufficient “herd immunity”—involves questions raised in two chapters of Ellenberg’s book. Here is a main idea—in my words, because I haven’t had time to actually <em>read</em> the book yet (and while writing this section, it seems I am having a primary role in another impending ban from the same overseas chess event).</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Often the most immediately valuable inferences are made from judging the shapes of curves rather than calculating numerical projections. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Here is an example composed from today’s new-cases charts of Florida and the UK from the <em>Worldometer</em> coronavirus <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">pages</a>:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/06/20/the-shape-of-this-summer/floridaukcov2/" rel="attachment wp-att-18929"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18929" height="342" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FloridaUKCov2.png?resize=352%2C342&amp;ssl=1" width="352"/></a></p>
<p>
The recent uptick in the UK is said to be caused by the new “delta” strain of the virus. I’ve chosen Florida rather than the whole US for similarity of scale and because Florida began a June upsurge this time a year ago. The US on the whole and most states show a similar fully-downward trend. Of course we hope it stays that way everywhere as the reopening phase continues. </p>
<p>
The point we are making is that if you just go by the numbers—and if you give highest weight to recent trends in those numbers—then your numerical projections can vary wildly. The logic of shape rather than number may be a more stable basis for judgment. This aligns with what we said about Ayanna Howard’s giving primacy to human rules of judgment in designs for robots in our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/05/24/acm-athena-lecturer-award/">post</a> a month ago. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Caveat </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There is, however, a caveat that falls in with the opening example of Ellenberg’s chapter 11, “The Terrible Law of Increase”:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> An early judgment based on a seemingly best-fitting shape has maximum potential to go wrong. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The example is an over-optimistic projection of Covid-19 cases and fatalities based on an initial expectation of a cubic curve fit. We neither wish to be academically impassive or blaming over the terrible toll which we have all had to endure, but to promote depth and wisdom in spatial thinking in line with the book’s purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
How can we best get quick and accurate judgments of what is in store this summer and fall?</p>

Reading the answers I received from that dream team of colleagues was like a masterclass for me and I trust that their thoughts on their award-winning paper will be of interest to many of the readers of this blog. Enjoy!<br/></p><p><b>Luca:</b> You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2021 for your paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0055622" target="_blank">Alternating Refinement Relations</a>, which appeared at CONCUR 1998. In that article, you gave what I consider to be a fundamental contribution, namely the introduction of refinement relations for alternating transition systems. Could you briefly explain to our readers what alternating transition systems are? Could you also tell us how you came to study the question addressed in your award-winning article and why you focused on simulation- and trace-based refinement relations? Which of the results in your paper did you find most surprising or challenging? </p><p><b>Answer:</b> When we model a system by a graph, our model abstracts away some details of the system. In particular, even when systems are deterministic, states in the model may have several successors. The nondeterminism introduced in the model often corresponds to different actions taken by the system when it responds to different inputs from its environment. Indeed, a transition in a graph that models a composite system corresponds to a step of the system that may involve some components. Alternating transition systems (ATSs) enable us to model composite systems in more detail. In an ATS, each transition corresponds to a possible move in a game between the components, which are called agents. In each move of the game, all agents choose actions, and the successor state is deterministically determined by all actions. Consequently, ATSs can distinguish between collaborative and adversarial relationships among components in a composite system. For example, the environment is typically viewed adversarially, meaning that a component may be required to meet its specification no matter how the environment behaves. </p><p>In an earlier <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/Jacm02.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>, some of us introduced ATSs and Alternating Temporal Logics, which can specify properties of agents in a composite system. The CONCUR 1998 paper provided refinement relations between ATSs which correspond to alternating temporal logics. Refinement is a central issue in a formal approach to the design and analysis of reactive systems. The relation “I refines S '' intuitively means that system S has more behaviors than system I. It is useful to think about S being a specification and I an implementation. Now, if we consider a composite implementation I||E and specification S||E and we want to check that the component I refines the component S, then the traditional refinement preorders are inappropriate, as they allow I to achieve refinement of I||E with respect to S||E by constraining its environment E.  Alternating refinement relations are defined with respect to ATSs that model the interaction among the underlying components, and they enable us to check, for example, that component I has fewer behaviors than component S no matter how component E behaves. They are called “alternating” because refinement may restrict implementation actions but must not restrict environment actions. In other words, refinement may admit fewer system actions but, at the same time, more environment actions. </p><p>It was nice to see how theoretical properties of preorders in the traditional setting are carried over to the game setting, and so are the results known then about the computational price of moving to a game setting. First, the efficiency of the local preorder of simulation with respect to the global preorder of trace containment is maintained. As in the traditional setting, alternating simulation can be checked in polynomial time, whereas alternating trace-containment is much more complex. Second, the branching vs. linear characterizations of the two preorders is preserved: alternating simulation implies alternating trace containment, and the logical characterization of simulation and trace-containment by CTL and LTL, respectively, is carried over to their alternating temporal logics counterparts. The doubly-exponential complexity of alternating trace containment, as opposed to the PSPACE complexity of trace containment, is nicely related to the doubly-exponential complexity of LTL synthesis, as opposed to its PSPACE model-checking complexity,</p><p>   <b>Luca:</b> In your paper, you give logical characterisations of your alternating refinement relations in terms of fragments of alternating temporal logic. Logical characterisations of refinement relations are classic results in our field and I find them very satisfying. Since I teach a number of those results in my courses, I'd be interested in hearing how you would motivate their interest and usefulness to a student or a colleague. What would your "sales pitch" be? </p><p><b>Answer:</b> There is extensive research on the expressive power of different formalisms. Logical characterization of refinement relations tells us something about the distinguishing power of formalisms. For example, while the temporal logic CTL* is more expressive than the temporal logic CTL, the two logics have the same distinguishing power: if you have two systems and can distinguish between them with a CTL* formula (that is, your formula is satisfied only in one of the systems), then you should be able to distinguish between the two systems also with a CTL formula. Moreover, while CTL is not more expressive than LTL, we know that CTL is “more distinguishing” than LTL. These results have to do with the logical characterizations of trace containment and simulation. The distinguishing power of a specification formalism is useful when we compare systems, in particular an implementation and its abstraction: if we know that the properties we care about are specified in some formalism L, and our system refines the abstraction according to a refinement relation in which the satisfaction of specifications in L is preserved, then we can perform verification on the abstraction.</p><p> <b>Luca:</b> I am interested in how research collaborations start, as I like to tell "research-life stories" to PhD students and young researchers of all ages. Could you tell us how you started your collaboration on the award-winning paper? </p><p><b>Answer:</b>Subsets of us were already collaborating on other topics related to reactive models and model checking, and all of us shared a common belief that the field was in need to move from the limited setting of closed systems to a more general setting of open systems, that is, systems that interact with an environment. Open systems occur not only when the environment is fully or partly unknown, but also when a closed system is decomposed into multiple components, each of them representing an open system. To build “openness” into models and specifications as first-class citizens quickly leads to the game-theoretic (or “alternating”) setting. It was this realization and the joint wish to provide a principled and systematic foundation for the modeling and verification of open systems which naturally led to this collaboration.</p><p> <b>Luca:</b> Did any of your subsequent research build explicitly on the results and the techniques you developed in your award-winning paper? Which of your subsequent results on alternating transition systems and their refinement relations do you like best? Is there any result obtained by other researchers that builds on your work and that you like in particular or found surprising? </p><p><b>Answer: </b>Various subsets of us pursued multiple research directions that developed the game-theoretic setting for modeling and verification further, and much remains to be done. Here are two examples. First, the game-theoretic setting and the alternating nature of inputs and outputs are now generally accepted as providing the proper semantic foundation for interface and contract formalisms for component-based design. Second, studying strategic behavior in multi-player games quickly leads to the importance of probabilistic behavior, say in the form of randomized decisions and strategies, of equilibria, when players have non-complementary objectives, and of auctions, when players need to spend resources for decisions. All of these are still very active topics of research in computer-aided verification, and they also form a bridge to the algorithmic game theory community.    </p><p><b>Luca:</b> One can view your work as a bridge between concurrency theory and multi-agent systems. What impact do you think that your work has had on the multi-agent-system community? And what has our community learnt from the work done in the field of multi-agent systems? To your mind, what are the main differences and points of contact in the work done within those communities? </p><p><b>Answer:</b> Modeling interaction in multi-agent systems is of natural interest to planning problems studied in the AI community. In 2002, the <a href="http://www.ifaamas.org/index.html" target="_blank">International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems</a> (IFAAMAS) was formed and the annual <a href="https://aamas2021.soton.ac.uk/" target="_blank">International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems</a> (AAMAS) was launched. The models, logics, and algorithms developed in the concurrency and formal methods communities have had a strong influence on research presented at AAMAS conferences over the past twenty years. Coincidentally, this year our <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/Jacm02.pdf" target="_blank">paper on Alternating-Time Temporal Logic</a> was chosen for the <a href="http://www.ifaamas.org/award-influential.html#:~:text=IFAAMAS%3A%20Awards%3A%20Influential%20Paper&amp;text=The%20Influential%20Paper%20Award%20seeks,lasting%20contributions%20to%20the%20field." target="_blank">IFAAMAS Influential Paper Award</a>. </p> <b>Luca:</b> What are the research topics that you find most interesting right now? Is there any specific problem in your current field of interest that you'd like to see solved? <p><b>Answer:</b>Research on formal verification and synthesis, including our paper, assumes that the model of the system is known. Reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to the design of policies in scenarios where the model is not known and has to be learned by agents by exploration. This leads to an opportunity for research at the intersection of reactive synthesis and reinforcement learning. A potentially promising direction is to consider reinforcement learning for systems with multiple agents with both cooperative and adversarial interactions. </p><p>The realization that reactive systems have to satisfy their specifications in all environments has led to extensive research relating formal methods with game theory. Our paper added alternation to refinement relations. The transition from one to multiple players has been studied in computer science in several other contexts. For the basic problem of reachability in graphs, it amounts to moving from reachability to alternating reachability. We recently studied this shift in other fundamental graph problems, like the generation of weighted spanning trees, flows in networks, vertex covers, and more. In all these extensions, we consider a game between two players that take turns in jointly generating the outcome. One player aims at maximizing the value of the outcome (e.g., maximize the weight of the spanning tree, the amount of flow that travels in the network, or the size of the vertex cover), whereas the second aims at minimizing the value. It is interesting to see how some fundamental properties of graph algorithms are lost in the alternating setting. For example, following a greedy strategy is not beneficial in alternating spanning trees, optimal strategies in alternating flow networks may use fractional flows, and while the vertex-cover problem is NP-complete, an optimal strategy for the maximizer player can be found in polynomial time. Many more questions in this setting are still open. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> What advice would you give to a young researcher who is keen to start working on topics related to alternating transition systems and logics? </p><b>Answer:</b> One important piece of advice to young researchers is to question the orthodoxy. Sometimes it is necessary to learn everything that is known about a topic but then take a step back, look at the bigger picture, reexamine some of the fundamental assumptions behind the established ways of thinking, change the models that everyone has been using, and go beyond the incremental improvement of previous results. This is particularly true in formal methods, where no single model or approach fits everything. And young researchers stand a much better chance of having a really fresh new thought than those who have been at it for many years.</div>
