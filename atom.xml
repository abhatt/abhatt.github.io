    <title>Local Access to Sparse Connected Subgraphs Via Edge Sampling</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1594598400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/e/Epstein:Rogers.html">Rogers Epstein</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05523">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We contribute an approach to the problem of locally computing sparse
connected subgraphs of dense graphs. In this setting, given an edge in a
connected graph $G = (V, E)$, an algorithm locally decides its membership in a
sparse connected subgraph $G^* = (V, E^*)$, where $E^* \subseteq E$ and $|E^*|
= o(|E|)$. Such an approach to subgraph construction is useful when dealing
with massive graphs, where reading in the graph's full network description is
impractical.
</p>
<p>While most prior results in this area require assumptions on $G$ or that
$|E'| \le (1+\epsilon)|V|$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we relax these assumptions.
Given a general graph and a parameter $T$, we provide membership queries to a
subgraph with $O(|V|T)$ edges using $\widetilde{O}(|E|/T)$ probes. This is the
first algorithm to work on general graphs and allow for a tradeoff between its
probe complexity and the number of edges in the resulting subgraph.
</p>
<p>We achieve this result with ideas motivated from edge sparsification
techniques that were previously unused in this problem. We believe these
techniques will motivate new algorithms for this problem and related ones.
Additionally, we describe an efficient method to access any node's neighbor set
in a sparsified version of $G$ where each edge is deleted with some i.i.d.
probability.

classical models of computation. A common belief is that this function is
exponentially hard for the implementation by reversible ancilla-free circuits,
even though introducing a small number of ancillae allows a very efficient
implementation. In this paper, we refute the exponential hardness conjecture by
developing a polynomial-size reversible ancilla-free circuit computing the
Hidden Weighted Bit function. Our circuit has size $O(n^{6.42})$, where $n$ is
the number of input bits. We also show that the Hidden Weighted Bit function
can be computed by a quantum ancilla-free circuit of size $O(n^2)$. The
technical tools employed come from a combination of Theoretical Computer
Science (Barrington's theorem) and Physics (simulation of fermionic
Hamiltonians) techniques.

that one of its generalizations to the tensor setting, tensor border rank, can

this problem by providing analogs of Sch\"onhage's construction for tensors of
order four and higher. Sch\"onhage's work was motivated by the study of the
computational complexity of matrix multiplication; we discuss implications of
our results for the asymptotic rank of higher order generalizations of the
matrix multiplication tensor.

synthetic data---a sanitized version of a sensitive dataset that approximately
preserves the answers to a large collection of statistical queries. All three
algorithms are \emph{oracle-efficient} in the sense that they are
computationally efficient when given access to an optimization oracle. Such an
oracle can be implemented using many existing (non-private) optimization tools
such as sophisticated integer program solvers. While the accuracy of the
synthetic data is contingent on the oracle's optimization performance, the
algorithms satisfy differential privacy even in the worst case. For all three
algorithms, we provide theoretical guarantees for both accuracy and privacy.
Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our methods scale well with
both the dimensionality of the data and the number of queries. Compared to the
state-of-the-art method High-Dimensional Matrix Mechanism \cite{McKennaMHM18},
our algorithms provide better accuracy in the large workload and high privacy
regime (corresponding to low privacy loss $\varepsilon$).

plane graphs has received considerable attention in recent years. In
particular, given a graph $G$, a connected subgraph $H$ of $G$ and a drawing
$\mathcal{H}$ of $H$, the extension problem asks whether $\mathcal{H}$ can be
extended into a drawing of $G$ while maintaining some desired property of the
drawing (e.g., planarity).
</p>
<p>In their breakthrough result, Angelini et al. [ACM TALG 2015] showed that the
extension problem is polynomial-time solvable when the aim is to preserve
planarity. Very recently we considered this problem for partial 1-planar
drawings [ICALP 2020], which are drawings in the plane that allow each edge to
have at most one crossing. The most important question identified and left open
in that work is whether the problem can be solved in polynomial time when $H$
can be obtained from $G$ by deleting a bounded number of vertices and edges. In
this work, we answer this question positively by providing a constructive
polynomial-time decision algorithm.

of $O(n^{5/6+o(1)})$ and $O(n^{21/22+o(1)})$, respectively, by Eden et al.
[DISC 2019]. For all $p\geq 6$, ours is the first sub-linear round algorithm
for $K_p$ listing.
</p>
<p>We leverage the recent expander decomposition algorithm of Chang et al. [SODA
2019] to create clusters with a good mixing time. Three key novelties in our
algorithm are: (1) we carefully iterate our listing process with coupled values
of min-degree within the clusters and arboricity outside the clusters, (2) all
the listing is done within the cluster, which necessitates new techniques for
bringing into the cluster the information about \emph{all} edges that can
potentially form $K_p$ instances with the cluster edges, and (3) within each
cluster we use a sparsity-aware listing algorithm, which is faster than a
general listing algorithm and which we can allow the cluster to use since we
make sure to sparsify the graph as the iterations proceed.
</p>
<p>As a byproduct of our algorithm, we show an \emph{optimal} sparsity-aware
algorithm for $K_p$ listing, which runs in $\tilde{\Theta}(1 + m/n^{1 + 2/p})$
rounds in the \clique model. Previously, Pandurangan et al. [SPAA 2018], Chang
et al. [SODA 2019], and Censor-Hillel et al. [TCS 2020] showed sparsity-aware
algorithms for the case of $p = 3$, yet ours is the first such sparsity aware
algorithm for $p \geq 4$.

    <title>Target set selection with maximum activation time</title>

Lima, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Maia:Ana_Karolinna.html">Ana Karolinna Maia</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sampaio:Rudini.html">Rudini Sampaio</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sau:Ignasi.html">Ignasi Sau</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05246">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A target set selection model is a graph $G$ with a threshold function
$\tau:V\to \mathbb{N}$ upper-bounded by the vertex degree. For a given model, a
set $S_0\subseteq V(G)$ is a target set if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into
non-empty subsets $S_0,S_1,\dotsc,S_t$ such that, for $i \in \{1, \ldots, t\}$,
$S_i$ contains exactly every vertex $v$ having at least $\tau(v)$ neighbors in
$S_0\cup\dots\cup S_{i-1}$. We say that $t$ is the activation time
$t_{\tau}(S_0)$ of the target set $S_0$. The problem of, given such a model,
finding a target set of minimum size has been extensively studied in the
literature. In this article, we investigate its variant, which we call
TSS-time, in which the goal is to find a target set $S_0$ that maximizes
$t_{\tau}(S_0)$. That is, given a graph $G$, a threshold function $\tau$ in
$G$, and an integer $k$, the objective of the TSS-time problem is to decide
whether $G$ contains a target set $S_0$ such that $t_{\tau}(S_0)\geq k$. Let
$\tau^* = \max_{v \in V(G)} \tau(v)$. Our main result is the following
dichotomy about the complexity of TSS-time when $G$ belongs to a minor-closed
graph class ${\cal C}$: if ${\cal C}$ has bounded local treewidth, the problem
is FPT parameterized by $k$ and $\tau^{\star}$; otherwise, it is NP-complete
even for fixed $k=4$ and $\tau^{\star}=2$. We also prove that, with $\tau^*=2$,
the problem is NP-hard in bipartite graphs for fixed $k=5$, and from previous
results we observe that TSS-time is NP-hard in planar graphs and W[1]-hard
parameterized by treewidth. Finally, we present a linear-time algorithm to find
a target set $S_0$ in a given tree maximizing $t_{\tau}(S_0)$.

applications, including personalized recommendation, team formation, and
revenue maximization via viral marketing. The massive instances occurring in
modern day applications can render existing algorithms prohibitively slow,
while frequently, those instances are also inherently stochastic. Focusing on
these challenges, we revisit the classic problem of maximizing a (possibly
non-monotone) submodular function subject to a knapsack constraint. We present
a simple randomized greedy algorithm that achieves a $5.83$ approximation and
runs in $O(n \log n)$ time, i.e., at least a factor $n$ faster than other
state-of-the-art algorithms. The robustness of our approach allows us to
further transfer it to a stochastic version of the problem. There, we obtain a
$9$-approximation to the best adaptive policy, which is the first constant
approximation for non-monotone objectives. Experimental evaluation of our
algorithms showcases their improved performance on real and synthetic data.

    <title>Ronald Graham: A summary of blog Posts We had about his work</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To Honor Ronald Graham I summarize the blog posts we had about his work.<br/>
<br/>
1) Blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/05/new-ramsey-result-that-will-be-hard-to.html">New Ramsey Result that will be hard to verify but Ronald Graham thinks its right which is good enough for me</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Wikipedia (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem">here</a>) says that in the early 1980's (can't Wikipedia be more precise than that?) Ronald Graham conjectured the following:<br/>
<br/>
For all 2-colorings of N, there exists x,y,z all the same color such that (x,y,z) form a Pythagorean triple.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot imagine he did not also conjecture this to be true for all finite colorings.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that when he conjectured it, the outcomes thought to be likely were:<br/>
<br/>
a) A purely combinatorial (my spell check says that combinatorial  is not a word. Really? It gets 14,000,000 hits) proof. Perhaps a difficult one. (I think Szemeredi's proof of his density theorem is a rather difficult but purely combinatorial proof).<br/>
<br/>
b) A proof that uses advanced mathematics, like Roth's proof of the k=3 case of Sz-density, or Furstenberg's proof of Sz theorem.<br/>
<br/>
c) The question stays open though with some progress over the years, like R(5).<br/>
<br/>
What actually happened was<br/>
<br/>
d) A SAT Solver solves it AND gets exact bounds:<br/>
<br/>
For all 2-colorings of {1,...,7285} there is a mono Pythag triple.<br/>
<br/>
There exists a 2-coloring of {1,...,7284} with no mono Pythag triple.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this would have been guessed as the outcome back in the early 1980's.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
2) Blog Post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/05/ronald-grahams-other-large-number-well.html">Ronald Graham's Other Large Number- well it was large in 1964 anyway</a><br/>
<br/>
Let<br/>
<br/>
a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2)<br/>
<br/>
I have not given a(0) and a(1). Does there exists rel prime values of a(0) and a(1) such that for all n, a(n) is composite.<br/>
<br/>
In 1964 Ronald Graham showed yes, though the numbers he found (with the help of 1964-style computing) were<br/>
<br/>
a(0) = 1786772701928802632268715130455793<br/>
<br/>
a(1) = 2059683225053915111058164141686995<br/>
<br/>
I suspect it is open to get smaller numbers, though I do not know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
3) Blog Post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/12/solution-to-reciprocals-problem.html">Solution to the reciprocals problem</a><br/>
<br/>
Prove or disprove that there exists 10 natural numbers a,...,j such that<br/>
<br/>
2011= a+ ... + j<br/>
1 = 1/a + ... + 1/j<br/>
<br/>
I had pondered putting this on a HS math competition in 2011; however, the committee thought it was too hard. I blogged on the problem asking for solutions, seeing if there was one that a HS student could have gotten. The following post (this one) gave those solutions. My conclusion is that it could have been put on the competition, but its a close call.<br/>
<br/>
All of the answers submitted had some number repeated.<br/>
<br/>
So I wondered if there was a way to do this with distinct a,...,j.<br/>
<br/>
 I was told about Ronald Grahams result:<br/>
<br/>
For all n at least 78, n can be written as the sum of DISTINCT naturals, where the sum of<br/>
the reciprocals is 1.<br/>
<br/>
This is tight: 77 cannot be so written.<br/>
<br/>
Comment on that blog DID include solutions  to my original problem with all distinct numbers<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
4) Blog Post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2013/04/a-nice-case-of-interdisciplinary.html">A nice case of interdisplanary research</a> tells the story of how the study of history lead to R(5) being determined (see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/ramseykings.pdf">here</a> for the actual paper on the subject). One of the main players in the story is the mathematician<br/>
<br/>
Alma Grand-Rho.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this is an anagram of<br/>
<br/>
Ronald Graham.<br/>
<br/>
What is the probability that two mathematicians have names that are anagrams. I suspect very small. However, see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2013/04/post-mortem-on-april-fools-day-joke.html">this</a> blog post to see why the probability is not as small as it might be.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
5) Blog Post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/search?q=Meme">Winner of Ramsey Meme Contest</a> This post didn't mention Ronald Graham; however I think he would have liked it.<br/>

    <title>Graham–Pollak partitions</title>
    <summary>As you’ve probably already seen, Ron Graham recently died. I first met him many years ago at Xerox PARC; what I remember from that meeting is this old guy easily beating me at ping-pong, and I was startled to learn (while working to beef up his Wikipedia article after his death) that that was exactly Graham’s first impression of Paul Erdős. We’ve chatted about research, most recently in 2018 in Barbados, but somehow never published anything together; on the other hand, Graham’s work in computational geometry, Ramsey theory, and approximation algorithms has certainly had a strong influence on me. Anyway, as part of the project of improving his Wikipedia article, I put together a separate new article on the Graham–Pollak theorem, the theorem that partitioning the edges of an -vertex complete graph into complete bipartite subgraphs requires at least subgraphs. And while doing that, I started to wonder about what the optimal partitions look like, and how many there are.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As you’ve probably already seen, Ron Graham recently died. I first met him many years ago at Xerox PARC; what I remember from that meeting is this old guy easily beating me at ping-pong, and I was startled to learn (while working to beef up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Graham">his Wikipedia article</a> after his death) that that was exactly Graham’s first impression of Paul Erdős.

Anyway, as part of the project of improving his Wikipedia article, I put together a separate new article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%E2%80%93Pollak_theorem">the Graham–Pollak theorem</a>, the theorem that partitioning the edges of an -vertex complete graph into complete bipartite subgraphs requires at least  subgraphs. And while doing that, I started to wonder about what the optimal partitions look like, and how many there are.</p>

<p>In <em>Proofs from THE BOOK</em>, Aigner and Ziegler describe a simple construction for an -subgraph partition: just order the vertices of the complete graph, and make a star connecting each vertex (except the last) to its later neighbors.
But there are a lot more partitions than that. For instance, you can take any rooted binary tree whose leaves are the vertices of the complete graph, and form a partition in which each complete bipartite subgraph connects the left and right descendants of one of the interior nodes of the tree. The ordered star partition is the special case of this where each internal node has one leaf child.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Graham&#x2013;Pollak partitions from binary trees" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/graham-pollak-hierarchy.svg"/></p>

<p>Even these are not the only possibilities. For instance, a four-vertex complete graph can be partitioned into  subgraphs in this triskelion pattern:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Graham&#x2013;Pollak partitions from binary trees" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/graham-pollak-triskelion.svg"/></p>

<p>More generally, whenever one has a partition of , one can form a partition of a larger complete graph by partitioning its vertices into  subsets, applying the partition of  to the edges that go from one subset to another, and then recursively partitioning the edges within each subset. This is already enough to show that there is a rapidly growing number of these partitions, but not enough to count them more precisely.</p>

<p>This still leaves many questions. How many Graham–Pollak partitions does  have, as a function of ? How complicated can they be? If we define a state space whose states are Graham–Pollak partitions, and whose state transitions correspond to re-partitioning the subgraph formed by two of the complete bipartite graphs, is it connected? Can a graph traversal of this state space list all the Graham–Pollak partitions faster than a brute force search? What does a random partition look like?</p>

<p>It’s too bad Ron’s no longer around to help answer some of them.</p>

    <title>TR20-104 |  On Counting $t$-Cliques Mod 2 | 

	Oded Goldreich</title>
    <summary>For a constant integer $t$, we consider the problem of counting the number of $t$-cliques $\bmod 2$ in a given graph. 
We show that this problem is not easier than determining whether a given graph contains a $t$-clique, and present a simple worst-case to average-case reduction for it. The reduction runs in linear time when graphs are presented by their adjacency matrices, and average-case is with respect to the uniform distribution over graphs with a given number of vertices.</summary>

    <title>Practical Budgeted Submodular Maximization</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nutov:Zeev.html">Zeev Nutov</a>, Elad Shoham <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04937">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the Budgeted Submodular Maximization problem, that seeks to
maximize an increasing submodular function subject to budget constraints.
Extending a result of Khuller, Moss, and Naor for the Budgeted Coverage
problem, Sviridenko showed that the greedy algorithm combined with guessing 3
most profitable elements of an optimal solution has approximation ratio
$\alpha=1-\frac{1}{e} \approx 0.632$. We show that just $2$ guesses suffice to
achieve ratio $\alpha$, 1 guess suffices to achieve ratio $0.899 \alpha \approx
0.568$, while ratio $0.68\alpha \approx 0.43$ can be achieved without any
guessing. We note that ratio $\alpha-\epsilon$ can be achieved using
${(1/\epsilon)}^{O(1/\epsilon^4)}n\log n$ value oracle calls, but this
algorithm is impractical already for large values of $\epsilon$. Among
practical algorithms, our is the currently best known one.

for five decades. Since the development of A* in 1969 many approaches have been
investigated, traditionally classified as either grid decomposition, potential
fields or sampling-based. In this work, we focus on using numerical
optimization, which is understudied for solving motion planning problems. This
lack of interest in the favor of sampling-based methods is largely due to the
non-convexity introduced by narrow passages. We address this shortcoming by
grounding the motion planning problem in differential geometry. We demonstrate
through a series of experiments on 3 Dofs and 6 Dofs narrow passage problems,
how modeling explicitly the underlying Riemannian manifold leads to an
efficient interior-point non-linear programming solution.

    <title>Safety in $s$-$t$ Paths, Trails and Walks</title>

Tomescu</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04726">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given a directed graph $G$ and a pair of nodes $s$ and $t$, an \emph{$s$-$t$
bridge} of $G$ is an edge whose removal breaks all $s$-$t$ paths of $G$ (and
thus appears in all $s$-$t$ paths). Computing all $s$-$t$ bridges of $G$ is a
basic graph problem, solvable in linear time.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we consider a natural generalisation of this problem, with the
notion of "safety" from bioinformatics. We say that a walk $W$ is \emph{safe}
with respect to a set $\mathcal{W}$ of $s$-$t$ walks, if $W$ is a subwalk of
all walks in $\mathcal{W}$. We start by considering the maximal safe walks when
$\mathcal{W}$ consists of: all $s$-$t$ paths, all $s$-$t$ trails, or all
$s$-$t$ walks of $G$. We show that the first two problems are immediate
linear-time generalisations of finding all $s$-$t$ bridges, while the third
problem is more involved. In particular, we show that there exists a compact
representation computable in linear time, that allows outputting all maximal
safe walks in time linear in their length.
</p>
<p>We further generalise these problems, by assuming that safety is defined only
with respect to a subset of \emph{visible} edges. Here we prove a dichotomy
between the $s$-$t$ paths and $s$-$t$ trails cases, and the $s$-$t$ walks case:
the former two are NP-hard, while the latter is solvable with the same
complexity as when all edges are visible. We also show that the same complexity
results hold for the analogous generalisations of \emph{$s$-$t$ articulation
points} (nodes appearing in all $s$-$t$ paths).
</p>
<p>We thus obtain the best possible results for natural "safety"-generalisations
of these two fundamental graph problems. Moreover, our algorithms are simple
and do not employ any complex data structures, making them ideal for use in
practice.

    <title>Treewidth-Aware Complexity in ASP: Not all Positive Cycles are Equally Hard</title>

(ASP) is NP-complete, thus, as hard as the satisfaction problem for classical
propositional logic (SAT). The best algorithms to solve these problems take
exponential time in the worst case. The exponential time hypothesis (ETH)
implies that this result is tight for SAT, that is, SAT cannot be solved in
subexponential time. This immediately establishes that the result is also tight
for the consistency problem for ASP. However, accounting for the treewidth of
the problem, the consistency problem for ASP is slightly harder than SAT: while
SAT can be solved by an algorithm that runs in exponential time in the
treewidth k, it was recently shown that ASP requires exponential time in k
\cdot log(k). This extra cost is due checking that there are no self-supported
true atoms due to positive cycles in the program. In this paper, we refine the
above result and show that the consistency problem for ASP can be solved in
exponential time in k \cdot log({\lambda}) where {\lambda} is the minimum
between the treewidth and the size of the largest strongly-connected component
in the positive dependency graph of the program. We provide a dynamic
programming algorithm that solves the problem and a treewidth-aware reduction
from ASP to SAT that adhere to the above limit.

one endpoint in $S\subset V$ and the other endpoint in $V\setminus S$, and
whenever $G[S]$ is connected, the cut $[S,V\setminus S]$ of $G$ is called a
connected cut. A bond of a graph $G$ is an inclusion-wise minimal disconnecting
set of $G$, i.e., bonds are cut-sets that determine cuts $[S,V\setminus S]$ of
$G$ such that $G[S]$ and $G[V\setminus S]$ are both connected. Contrasting with
a large number of studies related to maximum cuts, there exist very few results
regarding the largest bond of general graphs. In this paper, we aim to reduce
this gap on the complexity of computing the largest bond, and the maximum
connected cut of a graph. Although cuts and bonds are similar, we remark that
computing the largest bond and the maximum connected cut of a graph tends to be
harder than computing its maximum cut. We show that it does not exist a
constant-factor approximation algorithm to compute the largest bond, unless P =
NP. Also, we show that {\sc Largest Bond} and {\sc Maximum Connected Cut} are
NP-hard even for planar bipartite graphs, whereas \textsc{Maximum Cut} is
trivial on bipartite graphs and polynomial-time solvable on planar graphs. In
addition, we show that {\sc Largest Bond} and {\sc Maximum Connected Cut} are
NP-hard on split graphs, and restricted to graphs of clique-width $w$ they can
not be solved in time $f(w)\times n^{o(w)}$ unless the Exponential Time
Hypothesis fails, but they can be solved in time $f(w)\times n^{O(w)}$.
Finally, we show that both problems are fixed-parameter tractable when
parameterized by the size of the solution, the treewidth, and the twin-cover
number.

containing three mandatory vertices. In 2006, Chudnovsky and Seymour
[Combinatorica, 2010] presented the first polynomial time algorithm for this
problem, which has become a critical subroutine in many algorithms for
detecting induced subgraphs, such as beetles, pyramids, thetas, and even and
odd-holes. In 2007, Derhy and Picouleau [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 2009]
considered the natural generalization to $k$ mandatory vertices, proving that,
when $k$ is part of the input, the problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, and ask
what is the complexity of four-in-a-tree. Motivated by this question and the
relevance of the original problem, we study the parameterized complexity of
$k$-in-a-tree. We begin by showing that the problem is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard
when jointly parameterized by the size of the solution and minimum clique cover
and, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, does not admit an $n^{o(k)}$ time
algorithm. Afterwards, we use Courcelle's Theorem to prove fixed-parameter
tractability under cliquewidth, which prompts our investigation into which
parameterizations admit single exponential algorithms; we show that such
algorithms exist for the unrelated parameterizations treewidth, distance to
cluster, and distance to co-cluster. In terms of kernelization, we present a
linear kernel under feedback edge set, and show that no polynomial kernel
exists under vertex cover nor distance to clique unless $\mathsf{NP} \subseteq
\mathsf{coNP}/\mathsf{poly}$. Along with other remarks and previous work, our
tractability and kernelization results cover many of the most commonly employed
parameters in the graph parameter hierarchy.

    <title>TR20-103 |  One-Tape Turing Machine and Branching Program Lower Bounds for MCSP |

    <summary>For a size parameter $s\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$, the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (denoted by ${\rm MCSP}[s(n)]$) is the problem of deciding whether the minimum circuit size of a given function $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ (represented by a string of length $N := 2^n$) is at most a threshold $s(n)$. A recent line of work exhibited ``hardness magnification'' phenomena for MCSP: A very weak lower bound for MCSP implies a breakthrough result in complexity theory. For example, McKay, Murray, and Williams (STOC 2019) implicitly showed that, for some constant $\mu_1 &gt; 0$, if ${\rm MCSP}[2^{\mu_1\cdot n}]$ cannot be computed by a one-tape Turing machine (with an additional one-way read-only input tape) running in time $N^{1.01}$, then ${\rm P}\neq{\rm NP}$.
    
    In this paper, we present the following new lower bounds against one-tape Turing machines and branching programs:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  A randomized two-sided error one-tape Turing machine (with an additional one-way read-only input tape) cannot compute ${\rm MCSP}[2^{\mu_2\cdot n}]$ in time $N^{1.99}$, for some constant $\mu_2 &gt; \mu_1$.  
        \item A non-deterministic (or parity) branching program of size $o(N^{1.5}/\log N)$ cannot compute MKTP, which is a time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity analogue of MCSP. This is shown by directly applying the Nechiporuk method to MKTP, which previously appeared to be difficult.
    \end{enumerate}
    These results are the first non-trivial lower bounds for MCSP and MKTP against one-tape Turing machines and non-deterministic branching programs, and essentially match the best-known lower bounds for any explicit functions against these computational models.
    
    The first result is based on recent constructions of pseudorandom generators for read-once oblivious branching programs (ROBPs) and combinatorial rectangles (Forbes and Kelley, FOCS 2018; Viola 2019). En route, we obtain several related results:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There exists a (local) hitting set generator with seed length $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N})$ secure against read-once polynomial-size non-deterministic branching programs on $N$-bit inputs.
        \item Any read-once co-non-deterministic branching program computing MCSP must have size at least $2^{\widetilde{\Omega}(N)}$.
    \end{enumerate}</summary>

    <summary>Blockchain databases are storage systems that combine properties of both blockchains and databases like decentralization, tamper-resistance, low query latency, and support for complex queries. As they gain wider adoption, concerns over the confidentiality of the data they manage will increase. Already, several projects use blockchains to store sensitive data like...</summary>

    <title>TCS book: Call for GitHub issues</title>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I originally planned this summer to finish the work on my <a href="https://introtcs.org/">Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</a> book, and in particular write the two missing chapters on space complexity and interactive proof systems. Needless to say, this summer did not go as planned and I won’t be able to write these chapters. However, I still intend to go over the existing chapters, fixing typos, adding examples, exercises, and generally making it friendlier to beginning undergraduate students. </p>



<p>Toward this end, I would be grateful for people posting bugs, typos, and suggestions as <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues">GitHub issues</a> (I currently have 267 closed and 14 open issues which I hope to get to soon). Of course, if you are technically inclined and there’s a simple local fix, you can also make  a <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>



<p>Aside from these fixes, I am making two more “global” changes to the book. First, I am adding a “non mathy overview” for each chapter. While some students got a lot from reading the book prior to lectures, others were intimidated by the mathematical notation, and so I hope this more gentle introduction will be helpful. I am also adding more examples &amp; solved exercises toward this end. </p>



<p>Another change is that I now follow the more traditional way of presenting deterministic finite automata <em>before </em>Turing machines – DFAs are still optional and can be skipped without missing anything, but some instructors find them as a good introduction to Turing Machines. Thus the order of presentation of materials in the book is roughly as follows:<br/></p>



<ol><li><strong>Introduction, representing objects as strings</strong> –  Representing numbers, lists, etc. Specifying computational tasks as functions mapping binary strings to binary strings,  Cantor’s theorem.</li><li><strong>Finite functions and Boolean circuits</strong> – Every function can be computed by some circuit, circuits as straightline programs, representing circuits as strings, universal circuit evaluator, counting lower bound.</li><li><strong>Computing on unbounded inputs</strong> – DFAs (optional), Turing Machines, equivalence between Turing machines, RAM machines and programming languages, λ calculus (optional), cellular automata (optional)</li><li><strong>Uncomputability</strong> – Universal Turing machine, Halting problem, reductions, Rice’s Theorem. Optional: Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, uncomputability of quantified arithmetic statements, context free grammars.</li><li><strong>Efficient computation</strong> – Modeling running time, time hierarchy theorem,  <strong>P</strong> and <strong>EXP</strong></li><li><strong>NP and NP completeness</strong> – Polynomial-time reductions, Cook-Levin Theorem (using circuits), definition of <strong>NP</strong> using “proof system”/”verifying algorithms” (no non-deterministic TMs), <strong>NP</strong> completeness, consequences of <strong>P</strong>=<strong>NP</strong>: search to decision, optimal machine learning, etc..</li><li><strong>Randomized computation:</strong> Worst-case randomized computation, defining <strong>BPP</strong>,  Sipser-Gács, does <strong>BPP</strong>=<strong>P</strong>? (a little on derandomization)</li><li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> One time pad, necessity of long keys for information theoretic crypto,  pseudorandom generators and stream ciphers, taste of public key and “magic” (ZKP, FHE, MPC)</li><li><strong>Quantum computing:</strong> Some quantum mechanics background – double slit experiment,  Bell’s inequality. Modeling quantum computation. Bird’s eye view of Shor’s algorithm and quantum Fourier transform.</li></ol>

Ron Graham just passed away Monday at the age of <img alt="{84}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B84%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{84}"/> in La Jolla near UCSD. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I wish to say a few words about Ron.</p>
<p>
Tributes are being written as we write, including <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2016/01/11/ronald-graham/">this</a> from the Simons Foundation. Here is the American Mathematical Society <a href="https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=6244">announcement</a>, which we saw first: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Ron Graham, a leader in discrete mathematics and a former president of both the AMS (1993-1994) and the MAA (2003-2004), died on July 6. He was 84. Graham published more than 350 papers and books with many collaborators, including more than 90 with his wife, Fan Chung, and more than 30 with Paul Erdős. He was known for his infectious enthusiasm, his originality, and his accessibility to anyone who had a mathematics question. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
A <a href="https://www.bradyharanblog.com/blog/the-day-i-met-ron-graham">tribute</a> by Brady Haran embeds several short videos of Ron and his work. Fan’s own <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/ron/">page</a> for Ron has much more. We have made a collage of images from his life:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rongrahamcollage.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17279" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rongrahamcollage.jpg?w=600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Ron was special and will be greatly missed by all. We at GLL send our thoughts to his dear wife, Fan. Ken and I knew Ron for many years. Ken knew Ron since a visit to Bell Labs in the 1980s and meeting Fan too at STOC 1990. I knew Ron since I was at Yale in the 1970’s—a long time ago. I recall fondly meeting him for the first time when he was at Bell Labs.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Stories </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken and I thought we would give some personal stories about Graham. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Ken’s story is told <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/03/28/happy-100th-birthday-paul-erdos/">here</a>. In breaking a confidence by telling Erdős the secret about Bobby Fischer recounted there, Ken hoped that it would spread behind the scenes to enough people that Fischer would be less blamed for failing to play Anatoly Karpov in 1975. Since Erdős was staying with the Grahams, presumably it would have emerged there. The social excursion during STOC 1990 was a dinner cruise in Baltimore’s harbor. Ron and Fan and Ken found each other right away, and some questions to Ken about chess quickly went to the Fischer topic. At least Ken knows the secret was retold at least once. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Ron told me once that he was the accountant for Erdős. One of Ron’s jobs was to keep track of the prize money that Erdős owed. Ron would send out the checks to whoever solved the next problem. One of the brilliant insights of Erdős was to make the problems hard, but at least some where solvable. Ron told me that for years no one would actually cash the checks. They would frame them and proudly display them.</p>
<p/><p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/check.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17280" height="102" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/check.png?w=220&amp;h=102" width="220"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Ron said that he liked this for the obvious reason—less cash for Erdős to have to pay. But the advent of color xerox machines in the 1970’s changed this. He told me that people began cashing the checks and displaying the color copy. Bummer.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> My first talk at Bell Labs was on my work on the planar separator theorem—joint work with Bob Tarjan. At the beginning of the talk I saw that Ron had a pile of papers on his desk. He was a manager and I guessed he had some paper work to do. I gave my talk. At the end I when up to Ron in the back and he said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I did not get any work done. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I still fondly remember that as high praise. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Graham loved to do hand stands. I recall walking around Bell Labs one day when out of the blue Ron did a full handstand. He said that he liked to do these on the hand rail of the stairs. The trick he said was: “To not fall down.” </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/well.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17281" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/well.jpg?w=600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
I searched for him doing handstands and found out he and Fan lived in a modern beautiful <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/home/">house</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When two mathematicians found a circular home designed by architect Kendrick Bangs Kellogg in La Jolla, they treasured their unique discovery. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/home1.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17283" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/home1.jpg?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Fun and Games </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ron kept a simply organized <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/">page</a> of all his papers. They are not sorted by subject or kind, but the titles are so descriptive that you can tell at a glance where the fun is. A number of them are expositions in the popular magazines of the AMS and MAA. </p>
<p>
Among them, we’ll mention this <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/16_02_insert_and_add.pdf">note</a> from 2016, titled “Inserting Plus Signs and Adding.” It is joint with Steve Butler, who penned his own <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/07/reflections-on-ronald-graham-by-steve.html">reminiscence</a> for Lance and Bill’s blog, and Richard Strong. </p>
<p>
Say that a number <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> is “reducible” to a number <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/> in one step (in base <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b}"/>) if there is a way to insert one or more <img alt="{+}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{+}"/> signs into the base-<img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b}"/> representation of <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> so that the resulting numbers add up to <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/>. For example, 1935 is reducible to 99 via <img alt="{1 + 93 + 5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%2B+93+%2B+5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1 + 93 + 5}"/>. The number 99 reduces only to 18 via <img alt="{9+9}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B9%2B9%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{9+9}"/>, and 18 reduces only to 9, which cannot be reduced further. Thus Ron’s birth year took <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3}"/> reduction steps to become a single digit. However, doing <img alt="{1+9+3+5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B9%2B3%2B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1+9+3+5}"/> gives 18 straightaway and thus saves a step. The paper gives cases where inserting <img alt="{+}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{+}"/> everywhere is <em>not</em> a quickest way to reduce to a single digit.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Here are some possible answers—which would you expect to be correct in the case where <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b}"/> is base 10?</p>
<ul>

<p>
Your expectation might be wrong—see the paper for the answer and its nifty proof. For a warmup, if you want to answer without looking at the paper, prove that the final reduced digit is the same regardless of the sequence of reductions.</p>
<p>
Ron is also known for very big integers, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham's_number">one</a> that held the record for largest to appear in a published mathematical proof. You can find it among the above tributes and also on a <a href="https://www.zazzle.com/store/grahamsnumber">T-shirt</a>.  We could also mention his role in the largest <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/16/05/30/2241225/computer-generates-largest-math-proof-ever-at-200tb-of-data">proof</a> known to date—at 200 terabytes it almost doubles the size of the <a href="http://tb7.chessok.com/">tables</a> for proving results of seven-piece chess endgames.</p>
<p>
If you desire serious fun, look also to Ron’s books. He wrote several, including co-authoring the nonpareil <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics">textbook</a> <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> with Don Knuth and Oren Patashnik.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Prizes </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ron, in the tradition famously followed by Erdős, liked to put <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cash-for-math-the-erdos-prizes-live-on-20170605/">money</a> on problems. A $10 dollar problem was much easier than a $100 one. A $1,000 one is extremely hard, and so on. In Ron’s paper on his favorite <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/20_02_favorite.pdf">problems</a> he stated this one: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Let <img alt="{H_{n} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{1}{j}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH_%7Bn%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bj%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H_{n} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{1}{j}}"/>. Challenge: prove the inequality for all <img alt="{n \ge 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cge+1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n \ge 1}"/>, </em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{d | n} d \le H_{n} + \exp(H_{n})\log(H_{n}). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bd+%7C+n%7D+d+%5Cle+H_%7Bn%7D+%2B+%5Cexp%28H_%7Bn%7D%29%5Clog%28H_%7Bn%7D%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{d | n} d \le H_{n} + \exp(H_{n})\log(H_{n}). "/></p>
</em><p><em>	 </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
And he put the prize at $1,000,000. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em/></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Why is this reward so outrageous? Because this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0008177.pdf">conjecture</a> is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis! A single <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> violating would imply there are infinitely many zeroes of the Riemann zeta function off the critical line <img alt="{R(z) = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28z%29+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(z) = 1}"/>. Of course, the $1,000,000 prize is not from me but rather is offered by the Clay Mathematics Institute since the Riemann Hypothesis is one of their six remaining Millennium Prize Problems. We hope to live to see progress in the Challenges and Conjectures mentioned in this note, especially the last one! </em>

Alas Ron did not get to see this resolved. Nor of course did Erdős, nor may any of us. But Ron is prominently mentioned on another Simons <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2015/12/10/new-erdos-paper-solves-egyptian-fraction-problem/">page</a> where Erdős lives on, and so may Ron.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>

Ron died at age <img alt="{84}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B84%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{84}"/>. Perhaps he liked that it is the sum of a twin prime <img alt="{41 + 43}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B41+%2B+43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{41 + 43}"/>, and also three times a perfect number. We will always remember <img alt="{84}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B84%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{84}"/> because of Ron.  <b>Added 7/10:</b> <img alt="{84}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B84%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{84}"/> is also his current h-index <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qrPaF3QAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra&amp;fbclid=IwAR2Tx1GkRQ6-6K-hlumvpBqWUku2Msea6_dybwrYK8tVeNUuYOD6czZ24ZY">according to</a> Google Scholar.

    <title>TR20-102 |  Notes on Hazard-Free Circuits | 

	Stasys Jukna</title>
    <summary>The problem of constructing hazard-free Boolean circuits (those avoiding electronic glitches) dates back to the 1940s and is an important problem in circuit design. Recently, Ikenmeyer et al. [J. ACM, 66:4 (2019), Article 25] have shown that the hazard-free circuit complexity of any Boolean function $f(x)$ is lower-bounded by the monotone circuit complexity of the monotone Boolean function which accepts an input $x$ iff $f(z)=1$ for some vector $z\leq x$. We give a short and amazingly simple proof of this interesting result. We also show that a circuit is hazard-free if and only if the circuit and its dual produce (purely syntactically) all prime implicants of the functions they compute. This extends a classical result of Eichelberger [IBM J. Res. Develop., 9 (1965)] showing this property for depth-two circuits producing no terms containing a variable together with its negation. Finally, we give a very simple non-monotone Boolean function whose hazard-free circuit complexity is super-polynomially larger than its unrestricted circuit complexity.</summary>

    <title>Reflections on Ronald Graham by Steve Butler</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div>
<i>Ronald Graham passed away on July 6 at the age of 84. We present reflections on Ronald Graham by </i><i>Steve Butler.</i></div>
<div>
<i><br/></i></div>
<hr/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Getting to work with Ron Graham</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Ron Graham has helped transform the mathematics community and in particular been a leader in discrete mathematics for more than 50 years. It is impossible to fully appreciate the breadth of his work in one sitting, and I will not try to do so here. Ron has put his papers online and made them <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/">freely available</a>, a valuable treasure; and there are still many a hidden gem inside of these papers that are waiting to be picked up, polished, and pushed further.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I want to share about how I got to know and work with Ron. To be fair I knew about Ron long before I ever knew Ron. He was that rare pop-star mathematician who had managed to reach out and become visible outside of the mathematical community. And so as a teenager I read about Ron in a book about Erdos. I thought to myself that this guy sounds really cool and someday I might even get to see him give a talk (if I was lucky).</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I went to UC San Diego for graduate school and after a series of near-misses ended up studying under Fan Chung. I passed Ron in the stairwell once, and then also helped them move some furniture between their two adjoining homes (graduate students are great for manual labor). But I became determined to try and find a way to start a conversation with Ron and maybe work up to working on a problem. So I took the usual route: I erased the chalkboards for him.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Before his class on discrete mathematics would start, I would come in and clean the chalkboards making them pristine. It also gave me time to occasionally engage in some idle chat, and he mentioned that his papers list was far from complete. I jumped on it and got to work right away and put his papers online and have been maintaining that list for the last fifteen years. This turned out to be no small feat and required about six months of work.  Many papers had no previous online version, and there were even a few papers that Ron had written that he had forgotten about! But this gave me a reason to come to Ron and talk with him about his various papers and then he would mention some problems he was working on with others and where they were stuck and thought I might give them a try.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
So I started to work on these problems and started to make progress. And Ron saw what I was able to do and would send me more problems that fit my abilities and interests, and I would come back and show him partial solutions, or computations, and then he would often times fill in the gaps. He was fun to work with, because we almost always made progress; even when we didn't make progress we still understood things more fully. Little by little our publications (and friendship) grew and we now have 25+ joint publications, and one more book that will be coming out in the next few years about the enumerating juggling patterns.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
After all of that though, I discovered something. I could have just gone to Ron's door and knocked and he would have talked to me, and given me problems (though our friendship would not become so deep if I had chosen the forthright method). But almost no graduate students in math were brave enough to do it; they were scared off by his reputation. As a consequence, Ron had far fewer math graduate students than you would expect. (To any math graduate student out there, don't let fear stop you from talking with professors; many of them are much nicer than you think, and the ones that are not nice are probably not that great to work with.)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
So one of the most important lessons I learned from Ron was the importance of kindness. Ron was generous and kind to everyone (and I really stress the word everyone) that he met. It didn't matter what walk of life you were in, what age you were, or what level of math (if any) that you knew, he was kind and willing to share his time and talents. He always had something in reach in his bag or pocket that he could pull out and show someone and give them an unexpected sense of wonder.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Richard Hamming <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">once said</a> "you can be a nice guy or you can be a great scientist", the implication being that you cannot do both. Ron showed that you can be a nice guy and a great scientist. And I believe that a significant portion of his success is owed to his being kind; all of us should learn from his examples and show more kindness towards others.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
This is only one of many lessons I learned from Ron. Another thing I learned from Ron is the importance of data. I have seen multiple times when we would work on a problem and generate data resulting in what I thought were hopeless numbers to understand. But Ron looked at that same data and with a short bit of trial and error was able to make a guess of what the general form was. And almost inevitably he would be right! One way that Ron could do this was to start by factoring the values, and if all the prime factors were small he could guess that the expression was some combination of factorials and powers and then start to play with expressions until things worked out. Even when I knew what he did, I still am amazed that he was able to do it.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I will miss Ron, I will never have a collaboration as deep, as meaningful, and as personal. I am better for having worked with him, and learning from him about how to be a better mathematician and a better person.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Thank you, Ron.</div></div>

<p>Karlin, Klein, and Oveis Gharan have just <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01409">posted a paper</a> in which, at long last, they improve over the 1.5 approximation ratio for metric TSP which was achieved, in 1974, by Christofides. For a long time, it was suspected that the Held-Karp relaxation of metric TSP had an approximation ratio better than 1.5, but there was no viable approach to prove such a result. In 2011, two different approaches were developed to improve 1.5 in the case of shortest-path metrics on unweighted graphs: one by Oveis Gharan, Saberi and Singh and one by Momke and Svensson. The algorithm of Karlin, Klein and Oveis Gharan (which does not establish that the Held-Karp relaxation has an integrality gap better than 1.5) takes as a starting point ideas from the work of Oveis Gharan, Saberi and Singh. </p>

<p>Yesterday, Bloom and Sisask <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03528">posted a paper</a> in which they show that there is a constant <img alt="c&gt;0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c&gt;0"/> such that, for every sufficiently large <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N"/>, if <img alt="A \subseteq \{1,\ldots, N \}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Csubseteq+%5C%7B1%2C%5Cldots%2C+N+%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A \subseteq \{1,\ldots, N \}"/> has cardinality at least <img alt="N / (\log N)^{1+c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N+%2F+%28%5Clog+N%29%5E%7B1%2Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N / (\log N)^{1+c}"/>, then <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> contains a non-trivial length-3 arithmetic progression. Without context, this may seem like a strange result to get excited about, but it sits at the nexus of a number of fundamental results and open questions in combinatorics. Gil Kalai <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/07/08/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-7-bloom-and-sisask-just-broke-the-logarithm-barrier-for-roths-theorem/">has written an excellent post</a> telling the story of this problem, so instead of writing a worse version of it I will refer the reader to Gil’s blog.</p>
<p>Back to bad news, the day after Harvard announced that it would deliver courses online only in 2020-21, the Trump administration announced that it would void student visas of students who are not attending in-person classes in 2020-21. Back to good news, Harvard and MIT announced that they will sue the federal government over this, and other universities, including the University of California system, are planning similar responses. Apart from the action, I was really heartened to read MIT’s President <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-and-harvard-file-suit-against-new-ice-regulations-0708">statement on the matter</a> (thanks to Vinod Vaikuntanathan for bringing it my attention) which is worth reproducing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
To the members of the MIT community,</p>
<p>On Monday, in a surprising development, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that it will not permit international students on F-1 visas to take a full online course load this fall while studying in the United States. As I wrote yesterday, this ruling has potentially serious implications for MIT’s international students and those enrolled at institutions across the country.</p>
<p>This morning, in response, MIT and Harvard jointly filed suit against ICE and the US Department of Homeland Security in federal court in Massachusetts. In the lawsuit, we ask the court to prevent ICE and DHS from enforcing the new guidance and to declare it unlawful.</p>
<p>The announcement disrupts our international students’ lives and jeopardizes their academic and research pursuits. ICE is unable to offer the most basic answers about how its policy will be interpreted or implemented. And the guidance comes after many US colleges and universities either released or are readying their final decisions for the fall – decisions designed to advance their educational mission and protect the health and safety of their communities.</p>
<p>Our international students now have many questions – about their visas, their health, their families and their ability to continue working toward an MIT degree. Unspoken, but unmistakable, is one more question: Am I welcome?</p>
<p>At MIT, the answer, unequivocally, is yes.</p>
<p>MIT’s strength is its people – no matter where they come from. I know firsthand the anxiety of arriving in this country as a student, excited to advance my education, but separated from my family by thousands of miles. I also know that welcoming the world’s brightest, most talented and motivated students is an essential American strength.</p>
<p>While we pursue legal protections for our international students, we will continue to stay in close touch with them through email and updates on the International Students Office’s website. If you have questions, you may write to the ISO at iso-help@mit.edu.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>L. Rafael Reif
</p></blockquote>
<p>This way of talking like a human being, and like you actually care about the matter at hand, is a big contrast with the robotic statements that usually come out of campus leadership. The corresponding message from UC Berkeley’s Chancellor is the way such statements usually are like:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear campus community,</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security issued new guidance to universities related to international students and fall instruction requirements. The guidance is deeply concerning: it could potentially force the return of many international students to their home countries if they are unable to find the appropriate balance of in-person and remote classes. These requirements run counter to our values of being an inclusive community and one that has a long tradition of welcoming international students from around the globe. International students enrich campus life immeasurably, through their participation in classes, research collaborations and extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>We will explore all of our options, legal and otherwise, to counter the deleterious effects of these policies that imp act the ability for international students to achieve their academic goals. It is not only important for UC Berkeley but for all of higher education across the U.S. to take every step possible to mitigate these policies that send a message of exclusion to our international community of scholars. We will partner with our professional associations to advocate for sound legislation that continues to support international educational exchange.</p>
<p>More immediately, we are working with colleagues across our campus to identify a path that will allow us to comply with these requirements while ensuring a healthy learning environment, and paying attention to the needs of our international students. We recognize the concern and anxiety these new rules have created, and we are moving quickly to ensure that we offer the proper balance of online and in-person classes so that our students can remain in the U.S. and satisfy their visa requirements, and that those students residing outside the U.S. can maintain their enrollment status.</p>
<p>We expect to announce more details soon. Should you have any questions, please contact the Berkeley International Office at internationaloffice@berkeley.edu.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Carol Christ<br/>
Chancellor</p>
<p>Lisa Alvarez-Cohen<br/>
Vice Provost for Academic Planning and Senior International Officer
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to think about where this difference in tone is coming from. Carol Christ is a renown humanities scholar who, I suppose, writes well. She comes across as charismatic and caring, and she is definitely straight-talking in person. Probably, as for everything else, Berkeley has a byzantine process to create announcements and press releases, and if Stephen Colbert was the Chancellor of UC Berkeley, after a couple of weeks on the job he would sound just as <i>deeply concerned</i> and just as into <i>exploring all options</i>, while meanwhile <i>working to identify a path</i> and <i>paying attention</i> about something that is totally fucked up and needs action <i>today</i>.</p>
<p>Which brings me to all the statements in support of Black Lives Matter that have been coming out of every scholarly institution in the last few days. While their messages are generally unobjectionable, there is a certain sameness to their form (“we say their names…”, “we will do the work…”, “we see you…”) and they don’t sound at all like the way the people putting them out speak. This has complicated causes, including the fact that many such statements came out of letter-writing campaigns that demanded statements in a very specific way, without leaving a lot of room for individual expression. The association of American Poets, for example, put out a statement of solidarity with the Black community; in response, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/books/poetry-foundation-black-lives-matter.html">letter with 1800 signatories</a> claimed that it was too weak a statement and that it was, in fact, itself an act of violence against Black people; several resignations followed. The Board of the National Book Critics Circle was working on such a statement, and the work devolved into acrimony and several rounds of “I am outraged and I resign,” “no <i>I</i> am outraged at your outrage and <i>I</i> resign, “well then <i>I</i> am outraged that you are outraged at her outrage” until almost the whole board was gone in a “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/national-book-critics-circle-resignations.html">sequence of events [that] was bizarre and bloody in an end-of-a-Tarantino-movie way</a>.”</p>
<p>Also, people in America talk about race the way UC Berkeley administrators talk about anything, that is extremely carefully and vacuously. But, back to the statements about foreign students, the difference between the administrative cultures at MIT and Berkeley is not the only difference between the statements of Reif and Christ: clearly a big difference is that Reif is an immigrant himself. When Trayvon Martin was killed, Obama talked about the killing in a way that was very different, and much more meaningful, than other politicians: if I had a son, Obama said, he would look a lot like Trayvon. If there were more people of color in positions of academic leadership, I think that we would have seen an academic response to Black Lives Matter that would have been less fearful, dogmatic and robotic and more meaningful and productive. Or perhaps we would have all ended up like the National Book Critic Circle, it’s hard to say.</p></div>

<p>Once again Extraordinary news regarding Roth Theorem! (I thank Ryan <span class="qu"><span class="gD">Alweiss for telling me about it and </span></span>Rahul Santhanam for telling me about Thomas and Olof’s earlier attempts.)</p>
<p>Suppose that <img alt="R_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="R_n"/>  is a subset of <img alt="\{1,2,\dots, n \}" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2C+n+%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{1,2,\dots, n \}"/> of maximum cardinality not containing an arithmetic progression of length 3. Let <img alt="r_3(n)=|R_n|" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_3%28n%29%3D%7CR_n%7C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="r_3(n)=|R_n|"/>.

<p>A few days ago Thomas Bloom and Olof Sisask proved that for some <img alt="c&gt;0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c&gt;0"/></p>

<p>This is an extraordinary result!!! I will tell you a little more about it below.</p>
<h2>Ron Graham</h2>
<p>I just heard yesterday the sad news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Graham">Ron Graham</a> passed away. Ron was an extraordinary mathematician and an extraordinary person. I first met Ron in Montreal in 1978 and we met many times since then. Ron will be dearly missed.</p>
<h3>Back to the new bounds on Roth’s theorem</h3>
<p>From an abstract of a lecture by Thomas and Olof: “This is the integer analogue of a result of Bateman and Katz for the model setting of vector spaces over a finite field, and the proof follows a similar structure.”</p>
<p>A catchy (weaker) formulation which goes back to Erdos and Turan is:</p>
<p>Let <img alt="a_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="a_n"/> be a sequence of integers so that <img alt="\sum \frac{1}{a_n} = \infty" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Ba_n%7D+%3D+%5Cinfty&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\sum \frac{1}{a_n} = \infty"/>, then the sequence contains an arithmetic progression of length three!!</p>
<p>Bloom and Sisask’s result implies, of course, Van der Korput’s result that the primes contain infinitely many 3-terms arithmetic progression as well as Green’s 2005 result asserting it for every  dense subset of primes.</p>
<p>Szemeredi’s celabrated result extended Roth’s theorem to arithmetic progression of any fixed size, and Green-Tao celebrated 2008 result asserts that the primes (or a dense subsets of primes) contain arithmetic progression of any length. (The case of 3-term AP is so far much simpler for all the results mentioned below.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A little more about the history of the problem below the fold</p>
<p><span id="more-14203"/></p>
<h2>Roth, Szemeredi, Heath-Brown, and Bourgain; Salem-Spencer and Behrend.</h2>
<p>Let’s wrire $r_3(n)=n/g(n)$. Roth proved that <img alt="g(n) \ge \log\log n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28n%29+%5Cge+%5Clog%5Clog+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="g(n) \ge \log\log n"/>. Szemeredi and Heath-Brown improved it to <img alt="g(n) \ge \log^c n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28n%29+%5Cge+%5Clog%5Ec+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="g(n) \ge \log^c n"/> for some <img/>$latex c&gt;0$ (Szemeredi’s argument gave <img alt="c=1/4" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=c%3D1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c=1/4"/>.) Jean Bourgain improved the bound in 1999 to <img alt="c=1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3D1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c=1/2"/> and in 2008 to <img alt="c=3/4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3D3%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c=3/4"/> (up to lower order terms).</p>
<p>Erdös and Turan who posed the problem in 1936 described a set not containing an arithmetic progression of size <img alt="n^c" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Ec&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n^c"/>.  Salem and Spencer improved this bound to <img alt="g(n) \le e^{logn/ loglogn}" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=g%28n%29+%5Cle+e%5E%7Blogn%2F+loglogn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="g(n) \le e^{logn/ loglogn}"/>. Behrend’s upper bound from 1946 is of the form <img alt="g(n) \le e^{C\sqrt {\log n}}" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=g%28n%29+%5Cle+e%5E%7BC%5Csqrt+%7B%5Clog+n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="g(n) \le e^{C\sqrt {\log n}}"/>. A small improvement was achieved  by Elkin and is discussed <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/07/10/pushing-behrend-around/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Elkin's result">here</a>.  (Look also at the remarks following that post.)</p>
<h2>Sanders</h2>
<p>In 2010 Tom Sanders was able to refine Bourgain’s argument and proved that <img alt="g(n) \ge (\log n)^{3/4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28n%29+%5Cge+%28%5Clog+n%29%5E%7B3%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="g(n) \ge (\log n)^{3/4}"/>. A few month later  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0104">Tom have managed to reach the logarithmic barrier and to prove </a>that</p>
<p><img alt="g(n) \ge (\log n)/(\log \log n)^{6}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28n%29+%5Cge+%28%5Clog+n%29%2F%28%5Clog+%5Clog+n%29%5E%7B6%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="g(n) \ge (\log n)/(\log \log n)^{6}."/></p>
<p>We reported about this outstanding achievement in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2010/11/24/roths-theorem-sanders-reaches-the-logarithmic-barrier/">this blog post</a> and quoted from his paper: “There are two main new ingredients in the present work: the first is a way of transforming sumsets introduced by <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0802.4371">Nets Katz and Paul Koester</a> in 2008, and the second is a result on the <img alt="L_p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="L_p"/>-invariance of convolutions due to <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1003.2978">Ernie Croot and Olof Sisask</a> (2010).”</p>

<p>A closely related problem  in <img alt="\Gamma=" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%3D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\Gamma="/><img alt="\{0,1,2\}^n" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%2C2%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{0,1,2\}^n"/>. It is called the <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/02/23/open-question-best-bounds-for-cap-sets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Cap sets at Tao">cap set problem</a>. A subset of <img alt="\Gamma" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\Gamma"/> is called a cap set if it contains no arithmetic progression of size three or, alternatively, no three vectors that sum up to 0(modulo 3). If $latex <img alt="A" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/>_n$  is a cap set of maximum size in <img alt="\Gamma" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\Gamma"/> we can ask how the function <img alt="f(n)=|A_n|" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29%3D%7CA_n%7C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f(n)=|A_n|"/> behaves. In 1995 Roy Meshulam proved, using Roth’s argument, that <img alt="f(n) \le 3^n/n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29+%5Cle+3%5En%2Fn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f(n) \le 3^n/n"/> . Edell found an example of a cap set of size <img alt="2.2^n" src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=2.2%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="2.2^n"/>.  Again the gap is exponential.  What is the truth? Improving Meshulam’s result may be closely related to crossing the <img alt="\log n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\log n"/> barrier for Roth’s theorem. In 2007 Tom Sanders  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.5101">managed to achieve it </a>, not for the cup problem, but for a related problem over Z/4Z.</p>
<h2>Bateman and Katz</h2>
<p>In 2011, <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1101.5851" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Bateman and Nets Katz</a> improved, after many years of attempts by many, the Roth-Meshulam bound.  They proved using Fourier methods that <img alt="f(n) \le 3^n/n^{1+c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29+%5Cle+3%5En%2Fn%5E%7B1%2Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f(n) \le 3^n/n^{1+c}"/> for some <img alt="c&gt;0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c&gt;0"/>! This was very exciting.   See these two posts on Gowers’s blog (<a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/01/11/what-is-difficult-about-the-cap-set-problem/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I</a>,<a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/more-on-the-cap-set-problem/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">II</a>). This raised the question if the new method allows breaking the  logarithmic barrier for Roth’s theorem.</p>
<h3>Polymath 6</h3>
<p>Tim Gowers <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/02/05/polymath6-a-is-to-b-as-c-is-to/">proposed in 2011 polymath6 </a> to try to break the logarithmic barrier for Roth based on the Bateman-Katz breakthrough. (Here is<a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Improving_the_bounds_for_Roth%27s_theorem"> the wiki</a>; and a <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/2011/02/05/polymath6-improving-the-bounds-for-roths-theorem/">related post by Sanders</a>, and a <a href="https://polymathprojects.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/polymath-3.pdf">document by Katz</a>) This project did not get off the ground. We can regard the news as giving support that the polymath6 project was timely and of an appropriate level, and also as giving some support to an advantage of the conventional way of doing mathematics compared to the polymath way.</p>
<h2> Croot-Lev-Pach-Ellenberg-Gijswijt solution to the Cap set problem via the polynomial method</h2>
<p>Next and quite recently came a startling development  – the Croot-Lev-Pach-Ellenberg-Gijswijt capset bound <img alt="f(n) \le 2.756^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29+%5Cle+2.756%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f(n) \le 2.756^n"/>. (Croot, Lev, and Pach gave an exponential improvement for the Z/4Z case (see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/math-from-facebook/">this post</a>) and a few weeks later Ellenberg and Gijswijt used the method for the Z/3Z case (see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/05/15/mind-boggling-following-the-work-of-croot-lev-and-pach-jordan-ellenberg-settled-the-cap-set-problem/">this post</a>).)</p>
<p>A natural question that many people asked was how this development relates to improving the bounds for Roth perhaps even towards the Behrend bound. We discussed it a little over here and in other places. This is still an interesting possibility.</p>
<h2>The new result: Bloom and Sisask</h2>
<p>However, just a <del>few months</del> few years after the Bateman-Katz result have become obsolete for the cap-set problem, the Bateman-Katz method prevailed in this wonderful breakthrough of Bloom and Sisask giving <img alt="g(n) \ge \log^c n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28n%29+%5Cge+%5Clog%5Ec+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="g(n) \ge \log^c n"/> for <img alt="c&gt;1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3E1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c&gt;1"/>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Congratulations!!!</span></h3>
<h2>An old post and poll</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/an-open-discussion-and-polls-around-roths-theorem/">an old post we asked</a>: “How does <img alt="r_3(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_3%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="r_3(n)"/> behave? Since we do not really know, will it help talking about it? Can we somehow look beyond the horizon and try to guess what the truth is? (I still don’t know if softly discussing this or other mathematical problems is a fruitful idea, but it can be enjoyable.)” We even had a poll collecting people’s predictions about <img alt="r_3(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_3%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="r_3(n)"/>.  Somewhat surprisingly 18.18% of answerers predicted that <img alt="r_3(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_3%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="r_3(n)"/> behaves like <img alt="\frac{1}{(\log n)^c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%28%5Clog+n%29%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\frac{1}{(\log n)^c}"/> for some <img alt="c&lt;1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3C1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c&lt;1"/>.</p>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I want to dive into some classic results in robust control and try to relate them to our current data-driven mindset. I’m going to try to do this in a modern way, avoiding any frequency domain analyses.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to solve some optimal control problem: you spend time modeling the dynamics of your system, how it responds to stimuli, and which objectives you’d like to maximize and constraints you must adhere to. Each of these modeling decisions explicitly encodes both your beliefs about reality and your mental criteria of success and failure. <em>Robustness</em> aims to quantify the effects of oversight on your systems behavior. Perhaps your model wasn’t accurate enough, or perhaps you forgot to include some constraint in your objective. What are the downstream consequences?</p>

<p>In the seventies, it was believed that optimization-based frameworks for control had “natural robustness.” The solutions of optimal control problems were often robust to phenomena not explicitly modeled by the engineer. As a simple example, suppose you have an incorrect model of the dynamical system you are trying to steer. How accurate do you need to be in order for this policy to be reasonably successful?</p>

<p>To focus in on this, let’s study the continuous-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR). I know I’ve been arguing that we should  be moving away from LQR in order to understand the broader challenges in learning and control, but the LQR baseline has so many lessons to teach us. Please humor me again for a few additional reasons: First, most of the history I want to tell arises from studying continuous-time LQR in the 1970s. It’s worth understanding that history with a modern perspective. Second, LQR does admit elegant closed form formulae that are helpful for pedagogy, and they are particularly nice in continuous time.</p>

<h2 id="lqr-in-continuous-time">LQR in Continuous Time</h2>

<p>Suppose we have a dynamical system that we model as an ODE:</p>



<p>Here, as always, $x_t$ is the state, $u_t$ is the control input signal, and $A$ and $B$ are matrices of appropriate dimensions. The goal of the continuous-time LQR problem is to minimize the cost functional</p>



<p>over all possible control inputs $u_t$. Let’s assume for simplicity that $Q$ is a positive semidefinite matrix and $R$ is positive definite.</p>

<p>The optimal LQR policy is <em>static state feedback</em>: there is some matrix $K$ such that</p>



<p>for all time. $K$ has a closed form solution that can be found by solving a <em>continuous algebraic Riccatti equation</em> (CARE) for a matrix $P$:</p>



<p>and then setting</p>



<p>Importantly, we take the solution of the CARE where $P$ that is positive definite. If a positive definite solution of the CARE exists, then it is optimal for continuous time LQR. There are a variety of ways to prove this condition is sufficient, including an appeal to dynamic programming in continuous time. A simple argument I like uses the quadratic structure of LQR to derive the necessity of the CARE solution. (I found this argument in <a href="https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~hespanha/linearsystems/">Joao Hespansha’s book</a>).</p>

<p>Regardless, showing a positive definite CARE solution exists takes considerably more work. It suffices to assume that the pair $(A,B)$ is controllable and the pair $(Q,A)$ is detectable. But proving these conditions are sufficient requires a lot of manipulation of linear algebra, and I don’t think I could cleanly distill a proof into a blog post. I mention this just to reiterate that while LQR is definitely the simplest problem to study, its analysis in continuous time on an infinite time horizon is nontrivial. LQR is not really “easy.” It’s merely the easiest problem in a space of rather hard problems.</p>

<h2 id="gain-margins">Gain margins</h2>

<p>Let’s now turn to robustness. Suppose there is a mismatch between our modeled dynamics and reality. For example, what if the actual system is</p>



<p>for some matrix $B_\star$. Such model mismatches occur all the time. For example, in robotics, we can send a signal “u” to the joint of some robot. This would be some voltage that would need to be linearly transformed into some torque by a motor. It requires a good deal of calibration to make sure that the output of the motor is precisely the force dictated by the voltage output from our controller. Is there a way to guarantee some leeway in the mapping from voltage to torque?</p>

<p>An attractive feature of LQR is that we can quantify precisely how much slack we have directly from the CARE solution. We can use the solution of the CARE to build a <em>Lyapunov function</em> to guarantee stability of the system. Recall that a Lyapunov function is a function $V$ that maps states to real numbers, is nonnegative everywhere, is equal to $0$ only when $x=0$, and whose value is strictly decreasing along any trajectory of a dynamical system. In equations:</p>



<p>If you have a Lyapunov function, then all trajectories must converge to $x=0$: if you are at any nonzero state, the value of $V$ will decrease. If you are at $0$, then you will be at a global minimum of $V$ and hence can’t move to any other state.</p>

<p>Let $P$ be the solution of the CARE and let’s posit that $V(x) = x^\top  P x$ is a Lyapunov function. Since $P$ is positive definite, we have $V(x)\geq 0$ and $V(x)=0$ if and only if $x=0$. To prove that the derivative of the Lyapunov function is negative, we can first compute the derivative:</p>



<p>Note that it is sufficient to show that  $(A-B_\star K)^\top P + P(A-B_\star K)$ is a negative definite matrix as this would prove that the derivative is negative for all nonzero $x_t$. To prove that this expression is negative definite, let’s apply a bit of algebra to generate some sufficient conditions. Using the definition of $K$ and the fact that $P$ solves the CARE gives the following chain of equalities:</p>



<p>Here, the first equality is simply expanding the matrix product. The second equation uses the fact that $P$ is a solution to the CARE. The third equality uses the definition of $K$. The final equation is an algebraic rearrangement.</p>

<p>With this final expression, we can cook up a huge number of conditions under which we get “robustness for free.” First, consider the base case where $B=B_\star$. Since $R$ is positive definite and $Q$ is positive semidefinite, the entire expression is negative definite, and hence we have proven the system is stable.</p>

<p>Second, there is a famous result that LQR has “large gain margins.” The gain margin of a control system is an interval $(t_0,t_1)$ such that for all $t$ in this interval, our control system is stable with the controller $tK$. Another way of thinking about the gain margin is to assume that $B_\star = tB$, and to find the largest interval such that the system $(A,B_\star)$ is stabilized by a control policy $K$. For LQR, there are very large margins: if we plug in the identity $B_\star=tB$, we find that $x^\top  P x$ is a Lyapunov function provided that $t \in (\tfrac{1}{2},\infty)$. LQR control turns out to be robust to a wide range of perturbations to the matrix $B$. Intuitively, it makes sense that if we would like to drive a signal to zero and have more control authority than we anticipated then our policy will still drive the system to zero. This is the range of $t \in [1,\infty)$. The other part of the interval is perhaps more interesting: for the LQR problem, even if we only have half of the control authority we had planned for, we still will successfully stabilize our system from any initial condition.</p>

<p>In discrete time, you can derive similar formulae with essentially the same argument. Unfortunately, the expressions are not as elegant. Also, note that you cannot expect infinite gain margins in discrete time. In continuous time a differential equation $\dot{x}_t = M x_t$ is stable if all of the eigenvalues of $M$ have negative real parts. In discrete time, you need all of the eigenvalues to have magnitude less than $1$. For almost any random set triple $(A,B,K)$, $A-t B K$ is going to have large eigenvalues for $t$ large enough. Nonetheless, you can certainly derive analogous conditions as to which errors are tolerable.</p>

<p>There are a variety of other conditions that can be derived from our matrix expression. Most generally, the control system will be stable provided that</p>



<p>The LQR gain margins fall out naturally from this expression when we assume $B_\star = t B$. However, we can guarantee much more general robustness using this inequality. For example, if we assume that $B_\star = BM$ for some square matrix $M$, then $K$ stabilizes the pair $(A,B_\star)$ if all of the eigenvalues of $M+M^\top $ are greater than $1$.</p>

<p>Perhaps more in line with what we do in machine learning, suppose we are able to collect a lot of data, do some uncertainty quantification, and guarantee a bound $|B-B_\star|_2&lt;\epsilon$. Then as long as</p>



<p>we will be guaranteed stable execution. This expression depends on the matrices $P$, $Q$, and $R$, so it has a different flavor of the infinite gain margin conditions which held irrespective of the dynamics or the cost. Moreover, if $P$ has large eigenvalues, then we are only able to guarantee safe execution for small perturbations to $B$. This foreshadows issues I’ll dive into in later posts. I want to flag here that these calculations reveal some fragilities of LQR: While the controller is always robust to perturbations along the direction of the matrix $B$, you can construct examples where the system is highly sensitive to tiny perturbations orthogonal to $B$. I’ll return in the next post to start to unpack how optimal control has some natural robustness, but it has natural fragility as well.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-101 |  Lower Bounds for XOR of Forrelations | 

	Uma Girish, 

	Ran Raz, 

	Wei Zhan</title>
    <summary>The Forrelation problem, first introduced by Aaronson [AA10] and Aaronson and Ambainis [AA15], is  a well studied computational problem in the context of separating quantum and classical computational models. Variants of this problem were used to give tight separations between quantum and classical query complexity [AA15]; the first separation between poly-logarithmic quantum query complexity and bounded-depth circuits of super-polynomial size, a result that also implied an oracle separation of the classes BQP and PH [RT19]; and improved separations between quantum and classical communication complexity [GRT19]. In all these separations, the lower bound for the classical model only holds when the advantage of the protocol (over a random guess) is more than $\approx 1/\sqrt{N}$, that is, the success probability is larger than $\approx 1/2 + 1/\sqrt{N}$. This is unavoidable as $\approx 1/\sqrt{N}$ is the correlation between two coordinates of an input that is sampled from the Forrelation distribution, and hence there are simple classical protocols that achieve advantage $\approx 1/\sqrt{N}$, in all these models.

To achieve separations when the classical protocol has smaller advantage, we study in this work the XOR of $k$ independent copies of (a variant of) the Forrelation function (where $k\ll N$). We prove a very general result that shows that any family of Boolean functions that is closed under restrictions, whose Fourier mass at level $2k$ is bounded by $\alpha^k$ (that is, the sum of the absolute values of all Fourier coefficients at level $2k$ is bounded by $\alpha^k$), cannot compute the XOR of $k$ independent copies of the Forrelation function with advantage better than $O\left(\frac{\alpha^k}{{N^{k/2}}}\right)$. This is a strengthening of a result of [CHLT19], that gave a similar statement for $k=1$, using the technique of [RT19]. We give several applications of our result. In particular, we obtain the following separations:

Quantum versus Classical Communication Complexity: We give the first example of a partial Boolean function that can be computed by a simultaneous-message quantum protocol with communication complexity $\mbox{polylog}(N)$ (where Alice and Bob also share $\mbox{polylog}(N)$ EPR pairs), and such that, any classical randomized protocol of communication complexity at most $\tilde{o}(N^{1/4})$, with any number of rounds,  has quasipolynomially small advantage over a random guess. Previously, only separations where the classical protocol has polynomially small advantage were known between these models [G16, GRT19].

Quantum Query Complexity versus Bounded Depth Circuits: We give the first example of a partial Boolean function that has a quantum query algorithm with query complexity $\mbox{polylog}(N)$, and such that, any constant-depth circuit of quasipolynomial size has quasipolynomially small advantage over a random guess. Previously, only separations where the constant-depth circuit has polynomially small advantage were known [RT19].</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If there were ever a time for liberals and progressives to put aside their internal squabbles, you’d think it was now.  The President of the United States is a racist gangster, who might not leave if he loses the coming election—all the more reason to ensure he loses in a landslide.  Due in part to that gangster’s breathtaking incompetence, 130,000 Americans are now dead, and the economy tanked, from a pandemic that the rest of the world has under much better control.  The gangster’s latest “response” to the pandemic has been to disrupt the lives of thousands of foreign scientists—including several of my students—by threatening to cancel their visas.  (American universities will, of course, do whatever they legally can to work around this act of pure spite.)</p>



<p>So how is the left responding to this historic moment?</p>



<p>This weekend, 536 people did so by … <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZqWl5grm_F5Kn_0OarY9Q2jlOnk200PvhM5e3isPvY/preview?pru=AAABc0ugms8*_1VPq2TCPXlcaha9KVY3_Q">trying to cancel Steven Pinker</a>, stripping him of “distinguished fellow” and “media expert” status (whatever those are) in the Linguistics Society of America for ideological reasons.</p>



<p>Yes, Steven Pinker: the celebrated linguist and cognitive scientist, author of <em>The Language Instinct</em> and <em>How the Mind Works</em> (which had a massive impact on me as a teenager) and many other books, and academic torch-bearer for the Enlightenment in our time.  For years, I’d dreaded the day they’d <em>finally</em> come for Steve, even while friends assured me my fears must be inflated since, after all, they hadn’t come for him yet.</p>



<p>I concede that the cancelers’ logic is impeccable.  If they can get Pinker, everyone will quickly realize that there’s no longer any limit to who they can get—including me, including any writer or scientist who crosses them.  If you’ve ever taken, or aspire to take, any public stand riskier than “waffles are tasty,” then don’t delude yourself that you’ll be magically spared—<em>certainly</em> not by your own progressive credentials.</p>



<p>I don’t know if the “charges” against Pinker merit a considered response  (Pinker <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1279934082210816003">writes</a> that some people wondered if they were satire).  For those who care, though, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/07/05/the-purity-posse-pursues-pinker/">here’s</a> a detailed and excellent takedown by the biologist and blogger Jerry Coyne, and <a href="https://medium.com/@bhpartee/my-response-to-the-pinker-petition-open-letter-to-the-linguistics-community-80e2e4d9dbe2">here’s another</a> by Barbara Partee.</p>



<p>So, it seems Pinker once used the term “urban crime,” which can be a racist dogwhistle—except that in this case, it literally meant “urban crime.”  Pinker once referred to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_New_York_City_Subway_shooting">Bernie Goetz</a>, whose 1984 shooting of four robbers in the NYC subway polarized the US at the time, as a “mild-mannered engineer,” in a sentence whose purpose was to <em>contrast</em> that description with the ferocity of Goetz’s act.  Pinker “appropriated” the work of a Black scholar, Harvard Dean Lawrence Bobo, which apparently meant <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1268180637418164224?fbclid=IwAR1drpt4R2khSEEyiKiQMXEYloxy_6YzDTIvUEhb_FEkxL-KAPe9XvPYurg">approvingly citing him</a> in a tweet.  Etc.  Ironically, it occurred to me that the would-be Red Guards could’ve built a much stronger case against Pinker had they seriously engaged with his decades of writing—writing that really <em>does</em> take direct aim at their whole worldview, they aren’t wrong about that—rather than superficially collecting a few tweets.</p>



<p>What Coyne calls the “Purity Posse” sleazily gaslights its readers as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We want to note here that we have no desire to judge Dr. Pinker’s actions in moral terms, or claim to know what his aims are. Nor do we seek to “cancel” Dr. Pinker, or to bar him from participating in the linguistics and LSA communities (though many of our signatories may well believe that doing so would be the right course of action).</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words: many of us “may well believe” that Pinker’s scientific career should be ended entirely.  But magnanimously, <em>for now</em>, we’ll settle for a display of our power that leaves the condemned heretic still kicking.  So don’t accuse us of wanting to “cancel” anyone!</p>



<p>In that same generous spirit:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Though no doubt related, we set aside questions of Dr. Pinker’s tendency to move in the proximity of what The Guardian called a revival of “scientific racism”, his public support for David Brooks (who has been argued to be a proponent of “gender essentialism”), his expert testimonial in favor of Jeffrey Epstein (which Dr. Pinker now regrets), or his dubious past stances on rape and feminism.</p></blockquote>



<p>See, even while we make these charges, we disclaim all moral responsibility for making them.  (For the record, Alan Dershowitz asked Pinker for a linguist’s opinion of a statute, so Pinker provided it; Pinker didn’t know at the time that the request had anything to do with Epstein.)</p>



<p>Again and again, spineless institutions have responded to these sorts of ultimatums by capitulating to them.  So I confess that the news about Pinker depressed me all weekend.  The more time passed, though, the more it looked like the Purity Posse might have <em>actually</em> overplayed its hand this time.  Steven Pinker is not weak prey.</p>



<p>Let’s start with what’s missing from the petition: Noam Chomsky <a href="https://twitter.com/ZaidJilani/status/1279505236181356544">pointedly refused to sign</a>.  How that must’ve stung his comrades!  For that matter, virtually all of the world’s well-known linguists refused to sign.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Jackendoff">Ray Jackendoff</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_DeGraff">Michel DeGraff</a> were originally on the petition, but their names turned out to have been forged (were others?).</p>



<p>But despite the flimsiness of the petition, suppose the Linguistics Society of America caved.  OK, I mused, how many people have even <em>heard</em> of the Linguistics Society of America, compared to the number who’ve heard of Pinker or read his books?  If the LSA expelled Pinker, wouldn’t they be forever known to the world <em>only</em> as the organization that had done that?</p>



<p>I’m tired of the believers in the Enlightenment being constantly on the defensive.  “No, I’m not a racist or a misogynist … on the contrary, I’ve spent decades advocating for … yes, I did say that, but you completely misunderstood my meaning, which in context was … <em>please, I’m begging you</em>, can’t we sit and discuss this like human beings?”</p>



<p>It’s time for more of us to stand up and say: yes, I am a center-left extremist.  Yes, I’m an Enlightenment fanatic, a radical for liberal moderation and reason.  If liberalism is the vanilla of worldviews, then I aspire to be the most intense vanilla anyone has ever tasted.  I’m not a closeted fascist.  I’m not a watered-down leftist.  I’m something else.  I consider myself ferociously anti-racist and anti-sexist and anti-homophobic and pro-downtrodden, but I don’t cede to any ideological faction the right to dictate what those terms mean.  The world is too complicated, too full of ironies and surprises, for me to outsource my conscience in that way.</p>



<p>Enlightenment liberalism at least has the virtue that it’s not some utopian dream: on the contrary, it’s already led to most of the peace and prosperity that this sorry world has ever known, wherever and whenever it’s been allowed to operate.  And while “the death of the Enlightenment” gets proclaimed every other day, liberal ideals have by now endured for centuries.  They’ve outlasted kings and dictators, the Holocaust and the gulag.  They certainly have it within them to outlast some online sneerers.</p>



<p>Yes, sometimes martyrdom (or at least career martyrdom) is the only honorable course, and yes, the childhood bullies <em>did</em> gift me with a sizeable persecution complex—I’ll grant the sneerers that.  But on reflection, no, I don’t want to be a martyr for Enlightenment values.  I want Enlightenment values to <em>win</em>, and not by vanquishing their opponents but by persuading them.  As Pinker <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1279936590236790784">writes</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A final comment: I feel sorry for the signatories. Moralistic dudgeon is a shallow and corrosive indulgence, &amp; policing the norms of your peer group a stunting of the intellect. Learning new ideas &amp; rethinking conventional wisdom are deeper pleasures … and ultimately better for the world. Our natural state is ignorance, fallibility, &amp; self-deception. Progress comes only from broaching &amp; evaluating ideas, including those that feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable.</p></blockquote>



<p>Spend a lot of time on Twitter and Reddit and news sites, and it <em>feels like</em> the believers in the above sentiment are wildly outnumbered by the self-certain ideologues of all sides.  But just like the vanilla in a cake can be hard to taste, so there are more Enlightenment liberals than it seems, even in academia—especially if we include all those who never explicitly identified that way, because they were too busy building or fixing or discovering or teaching, and because they mistakenly imagined that if they just left the Purity Posse alone then the Posse would do likewise.  If that’s you, then please ask yourself now: <em>what is my personal break-point for speaking up?</em></p></div>

<p><em>(Ed: We have removed a previously posted paper due to correctness concerns raised by our readers. Please look at the <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1361">post on our paper policy</a>.)</em></p>



<p><strong>Palette Sparsification Beyond (∆ + 1) Vertex Coloring</strong> by Noga Alon and Sepehr Assadi (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10456.pdf">arXiv</a>). A basic fact from graph theory is that any graph has a \((\Delta+1)\)-coloring, where \(\Delta\) is the maximum degree. Followers of property testing are likely familiar with a fantastic result of <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~sa1497/pages/sublinear_vertex-coloring_2019.html">Assadi-Chen-Khanna</a> (ACK) on sublinear algorithms, that gives a sublinear algorithm for \((\Delta+1)\)-coloring. (The running time is \(\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})\), where \(n\) is the number of vertices.) The key tool is a palette sparsification theorem: suppose each vertex is given a “palette” of \((\Delta+1)\) colors. Each vertex randomly sparsifies its palette by sampling \(O(\log n)\) colors, and is constrained to only use these colors. Remarkably, whp the graph can still be properly colored. This tool is at the heart of sublinear time/space algorithms for coloring. This paper gives numerous extensions to this theorem, where one can tradeoff a larger initially palette for a smaller final sample. Another extension is for triangle-free graphs, where the initial palette is of size \(O(\Delta/\ln \Delta)\) and the sample is of size \(O(\Delta^\gamma + \sqrt{\ln n})\) (for parameter \(\gamma &lt; 1\). This leads to an \(O(n^{3/2 + \gamma})\) time algorithm for \(O(\Delta/\ln \Delta)\) coloring of triangle-free graphs.</p>



<p><strong>When Algorithms for Maximal Independent Set and Maximal Matching Run in Sublinear-Time</strong> by Sepehr Assadi and Shay Solomon (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07628.pdf">arXiv</a>). Taking off from sublinear coloring algorithms, one can ask if there are sublinear time algorithms for Maximal Independent Set (MIS) and Maximal Matching (MM). Alas, ACK prove that this is impossible. This paper investigates when one can get a sublinear time algorithm for these problems. For graph \(G\), let \(\beta(G)\) be the “neighborhood independence number”, the size of the largest independent set contained in a vertex neighborhood. This papers shows that both problems can be solved in \(\widetilde{O}(n \beta(G))\) time. Examples of natural classes of graphs where \(\beta(G)\) is constant: line graphs and unit-disk graphs. An interesting aspect is that MIS algorithm is actually deterministic! It’s the simple marking algorithm that rules out neighborhoods of chosen vertices; the analysis shows that not much time is wasted in remarking the same vertex. </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Algorithms and Lower Bounds for Metric TSP Cost Estimation</strong> by Yu Chen, Sampath Kannan, and Sanjeev Khanna (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05490.pdf">arXiv</a>). This paper studies sublinear algorithms for the metric TSP problem. The input is an \(n \times n\) distance matrix. One can 2-approximate the TSP by computing the MST, and a result of <a href="http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2416/">Czumaj-Sohler</a> gives a \((1+\varepsilon)\)-approximation algorithm for the latter, running in \(O(n\varepsilon^{-O(1)})\) time. The main question is: can one beat the 2-factor approximation in sublinear time? This paper considers the graphic TSP setting, where the distance matrix corresponds to the shortest path metric of an unweighted graph. One result is a \((2-\varepsilon_0)\)-approximation algorithm (for an explicit constant \(\varepsilon_0\)) that runs in \(\widetilde{O}(n)\) time. For the important \((1,2)\) TSP setting (all distances are either 1 or 2), the paper gives a \(O(n^{1.5})\) time 1.63-approximation algorithm. Interestingly, there is a lower bound showing that \((1+\varepsilon)\)-approximations, for arbitrarily small \(\varepsilon\), cannot be achieved in \(o(n^2)\) time. One of the key tools is sublinear algorithms for estimating the maximum matching size, itself a well-studied problem in the community.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-100 |  Streaming Verification for Graph Problems: Optimal Tradeoffs and Nonlinear Sketches | 

	Amit Chakrabarti, 

	Prantar Ghosh, 

	Justin Thaler</title>
    <summary>We study graph computations in an enhanced data streaming setting, where a space-bounded client reading the edge stream of a massive graph may delegate some of its work to a cloud service. We seek algorithms that allow the client to verify a purported proof sent by the cloud service that the work done in the cloud is correct.
  A line of work starting with Chakrabarti et al. (ICALP 2009) has provided such algorithms, which we call schemes, for several statistical and graph-theoretic problems, many of which exhibit a tradeoff between the length of the proof and the space used by the streaming verifier.
  
  This work designs new schemes for a number of basic graph problems---including triangle counting, maximum matching, topological sorting, and single-source shortest paths---where past work had either failed to obtain smooth tradeoffs between these two key complexity measures or only obtained suboptimal tradeoffs. Our key innovation is having the verifier compute certain nonlinear sketches of the input stream, leading to either new or improved tradeoffs. In many cases, our schemes in fact provide optimal tradeoffs up to logarithmic factors. 

  Specifically, for most graph problems that we study, it is known that the product of the verifier's space cost $v$ and the proof length $h$ must be at least $\Omega(n^2)$ for $n$-vertex graphs. However, matching upper bounds are only known for a handful of settings of $h$ and $v$ on the curve $h \cdot v=\tilde{\Theta}(n^2)$. For example, for counting triangles and maximum matching, schemes with costs lying on this curve are only known for $(h=\tilde{O}(n^2), v=\tilde{O}(1))$, $(h=\tilde{O}(n), v=\tilde{O}(n))$, and the trivial $(h=\tilde{O}(1), v=\tilde{O}(n^2))$. A major message of this work is that by exploiting nonlinear sketches, a significant ``portion'' of costs on the tradeoff curve $h \cdot v = n^2$ can be achieved.</summary>
