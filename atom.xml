    <title>Current CS 124 Stats</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is as much personal recording for me (and perhaps of interest to Harvard people who read the blog).  But also putting the numbers here for others to know for comparison.<br/><br/>I'm teaching the undergraduate algorithms and data structures class, CS 124, for the first time in a few years, so let's look at the initial enrollment numbers.  Harvard has its strange and wonderful shopping period, so I'm just getting the numbers now after the first week.  (Feel free to comment with comparative stats from your own institution!)<br/><br/>Current numbers are a bit over 280 students, about 20 more than last year, about 60 more than the last time I taught it.  Seems like the course has been growing about 20 people a year for the last few years.  This number may go up or down a few (most likely down), but is probably close to where the class will end up.  I keep thinking we've hit "peak 124", but it keep going upwards.  Part of this seems to be because a few more grad students (especially various master's students) are taking it.  Something like 1/7 of the undergraduates take this course now, which to me always seems amazing.  When I was an undergraduate at Harvard, CS courses were just not this big.  My first year teaching at Harvard, CS 124 was about 90 students, and that was huge.  I do realize, of course, that many places have even larger CS classes;  I'm not meaning to complain.<br/><br/>Surprising to me, about 1/4 of the course is first-years.  This is more than I remember from my previous years teaching it;  it's a hard course that requires both math and programming background, so first-years usually wait.  On the other hand, the first-years taking it are self-selecting, and in past years the first-year grade average is notably higher than the class average.<br/><br/>About 40% sophomores, not surprisingly the largest group.  Then a mix of juniors, seniors, and grad students from various programs.<br/><br/>The course is also offered through the Extension School;  here numbers change a lot.  Right now it's about 45, but that will most likely drop further.<br/><br/>If I've counted right, it's my 18th time teaching the class.  I'm pretty sure I'll get to 20.  I suppose it's possible I'll get to 30 or more, but it's likely someone else will take it over at some point.</div>

    <title>Ultimate greedy approximation of independent sets in subcubic graphs</title>

problem in bounded degree graphs. This is one of the most classic and widely
studied NP-hard optimization problems. We focus on the well known minimum
degree greedy algorithm for this problem. This algorithm iteratively chooses a
minimum degree vertex in the graph, adds it to the solution and removes its
neighbors, until the remaining graph is empty. The approximation ratios of this
algorithm have been very widely studied, where it is augmented with an advice
that tells the greedy which minimum degree vertex to choose if it is not
unique. Our main contribution is a new mathematical theory for the design of
such greedy algorithms with efficiently computable advice and for the analysis
of their approximation ratios. With this new theory we obtain the ultimate
approximation ratio of 5/4 for greedy on graphs with maximum degree 3, which
completely solves the open problem from the paper by Halldorsson and Yoshihara
(1995). Our algorithm is the fastest currently known algorithm with this
approximation ratio on such graphs. We apply our new algorithm to the minimum
vertex cover problem on graphs with maximum degree 3 to obtain a substantially
faster 6/5-approximation algorithm than the one currently known. We complement
our positive, upper bound results with negative, lower bound results which
prove that the problem of designing good advice for greedy is computationally
hard and even hard to approximate on various classes of graphs. These results
significantly improve on such previously known hardness results. Moreover,
these results suggest that obtaining the upper bound results on the design and
analysis of greedy advice is non-trivial.

We mainly rely on sparse interpolation and on a new algorithm for verifying a
sparse product that has also a quasi-linear time complexity. Using Kronecker
substitution techniques we are able to extend our result to the multivariate

    <title>Efficient Differentially Private F_0 Linear Sketching</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1580688000</feedworld_mtime>

vectors, one can compute the sketch of the difference between the vectors. This
allows us to answer fine-grained questions about the difference between two
data sets. In this work, we consider how to achieve this kind of property with
sketches that are differentially private. We describe how to compute linear
sketches for $F_0$, the number of distinct elements, that can efficiently be
made differentially private. Specifically, we consider a sketch that is linear
over GF(2), mapping a vector $x\in \{0,1\}^u$ to $Hx\in\{0,1\}^\tau$ for a
matrix $H$ sampled from a suitable distribution $\mathcal{H}$. Differential
privacy is achieved by using randomized response, flipping each bit of $Hx$
with probability $p&lt;1/2$. That is, for a vector $\varphi \in \{0,1\}^\tau$
where $\Pr[(\varphi)_j = 1] = p$ independently for each entry $j$, we consider
the noisy sketch $Hx + \varphi$, where the addition of noise happens over
GF(2). We show that for every choice of $0&lt;\beta, \varepsilon &lt; 1$ there exists
$p&lt;1/2$ and a distribution $\mathcal{H}$ of linear sketches of size $\tau =
O(\log^4(u)\varepsilon^{-2}\beta^{-2})$ such that: 1) For random
$H\sim\mathcal{H}$ and noise vector $\varphi$, given $Hx + \varphi$ we can
compute an estimate of $\Vert x\Vert_0$ that is accurate within a factor
$1\pm\beta$, plus an additive error $O(\log^3(u)\varepsilon^{-2}\beta^{-2})$,
with high probability, and 2) For every $H\sim\mathcal{H}$, $Hx + \varphi$ is
$\varepsilon$-differentially private over the randomness in $\varphi$.
Previously, Mir et al.~(PODS 2011) had described a private way of sketching
$F_0$, but their noise vector $\varphi$ is constructed using the exponential
mechanism, and is not computationally efficient (quasipolynomial time in the
sketch size)...

    <title>An algebraic 1.375-approximation algorithm for the Transposition Distance Problem</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1580688000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>L. A. G. Silva, L. A. B. Kowada, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rocco:N=_R=.html">N. R. Rocco</a>, M. E. M. T. Walter <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11570">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In genome rearrangements, the mutational event \emph{transposition} swaps two
adjacent blocks of genes in one chromosome. The \emph{Transposition Distance
Problem} (TDP) aims to find the minimum number of transpositions (distance)
required to transform one chromosome into another, both represented as
permutations. Setting the target permutation as the identity permutation, makes
the TDP equivalent to the problem of \emph{Sorting by Transpositions} (SBT).
</p>
<p>TDP is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard and the best approximation algorithm with a
$1.375$ ratio was proposed in 2006 by Elias and Hartman. Their algorithm
employs a technique called \emph{simplification} to transform an input
permutation $\pi$ into a \emph{simple permutation} $\hat{\pi}$, obtained by
inserting new symbols into $\pi$ in a way that the lower bound of the
transposition distance of $\pi$ is kept on $\hat{\pi}$. The assumption is that
handling with simple permutations is easier than with normal ones. A sequence
of transpositions sorting $\hat{\pi}$ can be mimicked to sort $\pi$.
</p>
<p>In this work, we first show that the algorithm of Elias and Hartman may
require one transposition above the intended approximation ratio of $1.375$,
depending on how the input permutation is simplified. Then, we propose a new
$1.375$-approximation algorithm to solve TDP based on an algebraic formalism
which does not use simplification, ensuring the approximation ratio of $1.375$
for all the permutations in the Symmetric Group $S_n$. We also propose a new
upper bound for the transposition distance.
</p>
<p>Implementations of our algorithm and the one of Elias and Hartman were
audited using GRAAu tool. The results show that, taking as input short
permutations with maximum length $13$, in addition to keeping the approximation
below the $1.375$ ratio, our algorithm returns a higher percentage of exact
distances than the one of Elias and Hartman.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>What a great title for a legal thriller.  And for a history buff like me — something I never thought I would become and that must be a side effect of having learnt absolutely zero history in school — how arousing it is to hear what John Adams said in 1776, and details of the Great Debate, and the rhetoric!  It is  apt that I am following the discussion on an analog radio, my habit of the last 10 years or so, another thing I never thought I would do but that I actually find quite relaxing now.  It takes my mind off my own worry, and it soothes my eyes.  I recommend it at small doses to avoid sudden onset of nausea.  It is also apt that I follow it from <a href="https://www.redfin.com/MA/Chestnut-Hill/150-Woodland-Rd-02467/home/11457721">my house</a>, built two centuries ago though not as long ago as reported online, as I recently discovered sifting historical records. It comes to my mind that I now know what it means to renovate an old house. This is not something that I can recommend, but it is an experience that has had a profound and lasting impact on me.  I am aware of mortise locks, three-tab shingles, the terminological jungle of drywall et similia, caulking, baseboards, the difference between granite and quartz, between 4-inch and no backsplash, pvc, fixtures, the evolution of toilets and countless other things that I can’t list but that suddenly spring up in my mind when entering any house, including most recent additions such as the electrical system.</p>



<p>Once, while waiting for yet another late sub-contractor I wrote:</p>



<p>The revenge of the housekeepers</p>



<p>For centuries they slept in niches inside their masters’ houses, cooked meals in crammed kitchens, hand-washed laundry bent in basements. Now they are gone, but the houses still stand. Their niches are our offices where we can’t fit a table. We spend most of our family time in the crammed kitchen, the other rooms unused since nobody has the energy to shuttle the food, or clean. And faltering to hoist the laundry load from the basement we bump the head.</p></div>

<p>
Hassler Whitney was an American mathematician. He contributed seminal ideas to both discrete and continuous mathematics and forged between the two. One of his early results was an algebraic characterization of duality in planar graphs that later led him to found matroid theory.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss notions of duality for general graphs.</p>
<p>
Duality in planar graphs goes back even before Leonhard Euler and his famous formula <img alt="{V - E + F = 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV+-+E+%2B+F+%3D+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{V - E + F = 2}"/> for the vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron. Johannes Kepler recognized that if one assigns a node to each face of the cube and connect the nodes of adjacent faces, then one obtains the skeleton of the octahedron. If one similarly makes a graph from the eight faces of the octahedron, then the skeleton of the cube reappears. Thus the cube and octahedron are <em>dual</em> to each other, as are the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. The tetrahedron is <em>self-dual</em>.</p>
<p>
Still in the years before Euler began graph theory by abstracting the islands and bridges of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), the idea of duality proved useful in engineering for diagramming stresses between struts in bridges and similar structures. This required going beyond polyhedra to consider planar graphs that might have multiple edges or even loops. This is the kind of duality that Whitney characterized. But there are two drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It only applies to planar graphs. <p/>
</li><li>
The dual graph <img alt="{G^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G^*}"/> need not be unique up to isomorphism—it may depend on how the original graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> is drawn.
</li></ul>
<p>
We can embed graphs on surfaces of higher genus to answer the former objection, but then the second still bites and other properties break down. We are mindful of Michael Atiyah’s opening words in his 2007 <a href="https://fme.upc.edu/ca/arxius/butlleti-digital/riemann/071218_conferencia_atiyah-d_article.pdf">essay</a>, “Duality in Mathematics and Physics”:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Duality in mathematics is not a theorem, but a “principle.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
But graphs don’t even seem to fulfill the “principle” part. Let’s see why.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Planar Duality </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The rules to build the dual <img alt="{G^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G^*}"/> of a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> drawn in the plane are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Place a vertex for each face, including the region outside the graph. <p/>
</li><li>
For every edge in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/>, add an edge to <img alt="{G^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G^*}"/> between the vertices of the adjoining faces. <p/>
</li><li>
If the adjoining faces are the same face, the vertex gets a loop.
</li></ol>
<p>
Consider the triangle graph at left below. There is only an inside face and an outside face. By rule 3 we need to connect the corresponding vertices once for each edge. Thus we get three parallel edges. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/02/01/subliminal-graph-duals/triangleloopsdual/" rel="attachment wp-att-16613"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-16613" height="85" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/triangleloopsdual.jpg?w=360&amp;h=85" width="360"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Despite the multiplicity of <img alt="{G^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G^*}"/>, its dual is again the triangle graph. The property <img alt="{(G^*)^* = G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28G%5E%2A%29%5E%2A+%3D+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(G^*)^* = G}"/> breaks down, however, for the tree and forest at right. All trees or forests of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> edges becomes a single node with <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> loops. Moreover, the dual of the graph of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> loops at one node depends on how the graph is drawn. If there are at most two nested “petals” of loops then the dual is a path of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> nodes, but if all <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> loops are separate petals then the dual is the star of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> nodes. No disconnected graph can be a planar dual.</p>
<p>
The problem emerges even when <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> and <img alt="{G^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G^*}"/> are both simple graphs—note how the dual’s maximum node degree equals the size of the outer face:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/02/01/subliminal-graph-duals/simpleduals2/" rel="attachment wp-att-16614"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16614" height="147" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/simpleduals2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=147" width="300"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
If <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> is <em>3-connected</em>, meaning that every pair of nodes <img alt="{u,v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%2Cv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u,v}"/> can be connected by three paths that meet only at <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> and <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/>, then all drawings of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> give the same <img alt="{G^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G^*}"/> and <img alt="{(G^*)^* = G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28G%5E%2A%29%5E%2A+%3D+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(G^*)^* = G}"/> does hold. This was one of Whitney’s seminal results in the 1930s. The above graph and its duals are not 3-connected, as is most readily seen by noting that each becomes disconnected upon removing its two vertices in the central column as drawn.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Plane Speaking </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Whitney also proved that a connected graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> is planar if and only if there is a 1-1 map of its edges to edges of a graph <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G'}"/> such that every cycle in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> maps to a minimal cut-set of <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G'}"/> (i.e., a minimal set of edges whose removal disconnects <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G'}"/>) and vice-versa. Any dual of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> can be <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G'}"/>. The point is that this duality condition makes no direct reference to the geometry of polyhedra or the sphere or plane. Unlike the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuratowski's_theorem">theorem</a> by Kazimierz Kuratowski that a graph is non-planar if and only if it has <img alt="{K_5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_5}"/> or <img alt="{K_{3,3}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7B3%2C3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{3,3}}"/> as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_minor">minor</a>, it seems not so easily extended to surfaces of higher genus.</p>
<p>
You may wonder by now: why not just regard the complement of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> as the dual? This would be fine if we ruled out having loops or multiple edges. But the drift of the above is to include them. If so, how would we cap the multiplicity to define the complement?</p>
<p>
One more theorem by Whitney points in a direction that embraces loops and multiple edges and more. A <em>matroid</em> can be defined as a set <img alt="{E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E}"/> together with an integer function <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> defined on subsets of <img alt="{E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E}"/> such that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<img alt="{f(\emptyset) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5Cemptyset%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(\emptyset) = 0}"/>; <p/>
</li><li>
for all <img alt="{a \in E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Cin+E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a \in E}"/>, <img alt="{f(\{a\}) \leq 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5C%7Ba%5C%7D%29+%5Cleq+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(\{a\}) \leq 1}"/>; <p/>
</li><li>
if <img alt="{A \subseteq B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Csubseteq+B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \subseteq B}"/> then <img alt="{f(A) \leq f(B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28A%29+%5Cleq+f%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(A) \leq f(B)}"/>; and <p/>
</li><li>
if <img alt="{A \subseteq B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Csubseteq+B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \subseteq B}"/> and <img alt="{c \notin B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%5Cnotin+B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c \notin B}"/> then <img alt="{f(B \cup \{c\}) - f(B) \leq f(A \cup \{c\}) - f(A)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28B+%5Ccup+%5C%7Bc%5C%7D%29+-+f%28B%29+%5Cleq+f%28A+%5Ccup+%5C%7Bc%5C%7D%29+-+f%28A%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(B \cup \{c\}) - f(B) \leq f(A \cup \{c\}) - f(A)}"/>.
</li></ol>
<p>
The <em>rank</em> of (finite) sets of vectors in a vector space obeys these properties. The last property intuitively says that if <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> is independent of <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> then it is certainly independent of any subset of <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. The following function on sets of edges in a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> obeys these rules: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f_G(A) = \text{the maximum cardinality of a tree or forest using edges in }A. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f_G%28A%29+%3D+%5Ctext%7Bthe+maximum+cardinality+of+a+tree+or+forest+using+edges+in+%7DA.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  f_G(A) = \text{the maximum cardinality of a tree or forest using edges in }A. "/></p>
<p>One attraction of matroids <img alt="{(E,f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28E%2Cf%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(E,f)}"/> is that they automatically have duals <img alt="{(E,f^*)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28E%2Cf%5E%2A%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(E,f^*)}"/> where </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f^*(A) = |A| - f(E) + f(E \setminus A).

This is a beautiful statement. But it does not help us with isomorphism invariance. The trouble is that <img alt="{f_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_G}"/> does not characterize <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/>.

The shape of the tree does not matter. Ditto forests. We can get on a better track, however, by loosening up the requirement that the rank of a single element is at most <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>.</p>

If we relax the second matroid axiom to read <img alt="{f(\{a\}) \leq k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5C%7Ba%5C%7D%29+%5Cleq+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(\{a\}) \leq k}"/> for any <img alt="{a \in E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Cin+E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a \in E}"/>, then it is natural to take <img alt="{c = k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%3D+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c = k}"/>.

The dual of the edge incident to two nodes is an edge incident to <em>zero</em> nodes, which is called a <em>circle</em>. The dual of a forest of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> disjoint edges is a collection of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> circles. The intuition is that the disjoint edges are maximally independent, like a basis of a vector space. The dual of a basis is the zero vector, and the circles are like copies of the zero vector. The path of two nodes at right is not maximally independent and its dual is a double-loop. The single loop is <em>self-dual</em>. Also self-dual are the “lollipop” graph, which consists of one edge and one loop, and the triangle graph:</p>

What about the dual of <img alt="{K_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_4}"/> at right? It is after all planar. Consider any subset <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> of one or two edges. The edge set <img alt="{E \setminus A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%5Csetminus+A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E \setminus A}"/> still spans the graph, so the <img alt="{r_G(E \setminus A) - r_G(E)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_G%28E+%5Csetminus+A%29+-+r_G%28E%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_G(E \setminus A) - r_G(E)}"/> part of <img alt="{r^*_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%5E%2A_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r^*_G}"/> cancels, leaving <img alt="{r^*_G(A) = 2|A|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%5E%2A_G%28A%29+%3D+2%7CA%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r^*_G(A) = 2|A|}"/>. Thus every pair of edges in the dual would have to be independent, hence disjoint. In a graph, this means we’d have to have <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> disjoint edges, but we already know that is the dual of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> circles, which is different.

<p/><p>
Indeed, every graph in which all nodes have degree 3 or more has a dual that “goes invisible” as far as graphs are concerned. Yet we will argue that those duals are still useful for studying graphs.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> My Invisible Dual Friend </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are duals good for? We don’t often want to prove something <em>about the dual</em>. We want to prove something about the original <img alt="{G_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G_0}"/> we are given. </p>
<p>
What we have in mind is the kind of proof that goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Transform <img alt="{G_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G_0}"/> to its dual <img alt="{G_0^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_0%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G_0^*}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
Perform an operation <img alt="{op}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bop%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{op}"/> on <img alt="{G_0^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_0%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G_0^*}"/> to get <img alt="{G_1^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_1%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G_1^*}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
Transform back to get <img alt="{G_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G_1}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
Use <img alt="{G_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G_1}"/> and the simple nature of <img alt="{op}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bop%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{op}"/> on the dual to infer something about <img alt="{G_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G_0}"/>.
</li></ol>
<p>
Thus we can still <em>use</em> the duals implicitly. The existence of the dual for all graphs and its uniqueness (well, up to isolated nodes—a topic for a next post) will help us here. We also need that the transformed-back object is always a graph again, of course. </p>
<p>
Perhaps the simplest operations are adding or deleting an edge <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/>.

This is the operation we called “explosion” in <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/contraction-and-explosion/">two</a> previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/26/a-matroid-quantum-connection/">posts</a>. </p>

To check the theorem, note how the “lollipop” graph is self-dual but with the edges <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a}"/> and <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b}"/> changing roles. If we delete the edge <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a}"/> from the dual we get a loop, which remains a loop on transforming back. That is the same as exploding <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a}"/> in the lollipop: the “stick” part <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b}"/> recoils into a loop. If instead we delete <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b}"/> from the dual we are left with a regular edge, which transforms back into a <em>circle</em>. That is the same as what is left of the head of the lollipop upon exploding the stick. Here are two more examples of explosions:</p>

What is the best way of visualizing the 2-polymatroid duals of graphs when they aren’t graphs? </p>
<p>
Should we accept an answer where most of the graph duals are submerged below the surface? In a <a href="https://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~whittle/pubs/Tutte_invariants_of_2-polymatroids.pdf">paper</a> by James Oxley and Geoff Whittle that we have referenced <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/26/a-matroid-quantum-connection/">before</a>, we take this remark—</p>

    <title>Algorithmic Aspects of Secure Connected Domination in Graphs</title>

Venkata Subba Reddy</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11250">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple, undirected and connected graph. A connected
dominating set $S \subseteq V$ is a secure connected dominating set of $G$, if
for each $ u \in V\setminus S$, there exists $v\in S$ such that $(u,v) \in E$
and the set $(S \setminus \{ v \}) \cup \{ u \} $ is a connected dominating set
of $G$. The minimum size of a secure connected dominating set of $G$ denoted by
$ \gamma_{sc} (G)$, is called the secure connected domination number of $G$.
Given a graph $ G$ and a positive integer $ k,$ the Secure Connected Domination
(SCDM) problem is to check whether $ G $ has a secure connected dominating set
of size at most $ k.$ In this paper, we prove that the SCDM problem is
NP-complete for doubly chordal graphs, a subclass of chordal graphs. We
investigate the complexity of this problem for some subclasses of bipartite
graphs namely, star convex bipartite, comb convex bipartite, chordal bipartite
and chain graphs. The Minimum Secure Connected Dominating Set (MSCDS) problem
is to find a secure connected dominating set of minimum size in the input
graph. We propose a $ (\Delta(G)+1) $ - approximation algorithm for MSCDS,
where $ \Delta(G) $ is the maximum degree of the input graph $ G $ and prove
that MSCDS cannot be approximated within $ (1 -\epsilon) ln(| V |)$ for any $
\epsilon &gt; 0 $ unless $ NP \subseteq DTIME(| V |^{O(log log | V |)})$ even for
bipartite graphs. Finally, we show that the MSCDS is APX-complete for graphs
with $\Delta(G)=4$.

    <title>Polynomial Time Algorithms for Constructing Optimal Binary AIFV-$2$ Codes</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1580601600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Mordecai Golin, Elfarouk Harb <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11170">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Huffman Codes are optimal Instantaneous Fixed-to-Variable (FV) codes in which
every source symbol can only be encoded by one codeword. Relaxing these
constraints permits constructing better FV codes. More specifically, recent
work has shown that AIFV-$m$ codes can beat Huffman coding. AIFV-$m$ codes
construct am $m$-tuple of different coding trees between which the code
alternates and are only almost instantaneous (AI). This means that decoding a
word might require a delay of a finite number of bits.
</p>
<p>Current algorithms for constructing optimal AIFV-$m$ codes are iterative
processes that construct progressively "better sets" of code trees. The
processes have been proven to finitely converge to the optimal code but with no
known bounds on the convergence rate.
</p>
<p>This paper derives a geometric interpretation of the space of binary AIFV-$2$
codes, permitting the development of the first polynomially time-bounded
iterative procedures for constructing optimal AIFV codes.
</p>
<p>We first show that a simple binary search procedure can replace the current
iterative process to construct optimal binary AIFV-$2$ codes. We then describe
how to frame the problem as a linear programming with an exponential number of
constraints but a polynomial-time separability oracle. This permits using the
Gr\"otschel, Lov\'asz and Schrijver ellipsoid method to solve the problem in a
polynomial number of steps. While more complicated, this second method has the
potential to lead to a polynomial time algorithm to construct optimal AIFV-$m$
codes for general $m$.

    <title>Optimal and Perfectly Parallel Algorithms for On-demand Data-flow Analysis</title>

numerous static analysis applications, such as live variables analysis, alias
analysis and null pointers analysis. The most widely-used framework for
interprocedural data-flow analysis is IFDS, which encompasses distributive
data-flow functions over a finite domain. On-demand data-flow analyses restrict
the focus of the analysis on specific program locations and data facts. This
setting provides a natural split between (i) an offline (or preprocessing)
phase, where the program is partially analyzed and analysis summaries are
created, and (ii) an online (or query) phase, where analysis queries arrive on
demand and the summaries are used to speed up answering queries.
</p>
<p>In this work, we consider on-demand IFDS analyses where the queries concern
program locations of the same procedure (aka same-context queries). We exploit
the fact that flow graphs of programs have low treewidth to develop faster
algorithms that are space and time optimal for many common data-flow analyses,
in both the preprocessing and the query phase. We also use treewidth to develop
query solutions that are embarrassingly parallelizable, i.e. the total work for
answering each query is split to a number of threads such that each thread
performs only a constant amount of work. Finally, we implement a static
analyzer based on our algorithms, and perform a series of on-demand analysis
experiments on standard benchmarks. Our experimental results show a drastic
speed-up of the queries after only a lightweight preprocessing phase, which
significantly outperforms existing techniques.

collector. LDP protocols have been increasingly deployed in the industry. A
basic building block is frequency oracle (FO) protocols, which estimate
frequencies of values. While several FO protocols have been proposed, the
design goal does not lead to optimal results for answering many queries. In
this paper, we show that adding post-processing steps to FO protocols by
exploiting the knowledge that all individual frequencies should be non-negative
and they sum up to one can lead to significantly better accuracy for a wide
range of tasks, including frequencies of individual values, frequencies of the
most frequent values, and frequencies of subsets of values. We consider 10
different methods that exploit this knowledge differently. We establish
theoretical relationships between some of them and conducted extensive
experimental evaluations to understand which methods should be used for
different query tasks.

But despite their five-way symmetry these tiles (<a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/06/26/copenhagen-non-penrose.html">also used in a more modern Copenhagen plaza</a>) can’t form Penrose tilings.</p>

    <p>Since the case analysis from my earlier post was a little undetailed, here’s an illustration with more. If you have a pentagon with three consecutive sides adjacent to other pentagons, then a wedge of the plane is forced to be filled by repeating tiles. And if not, then you get repeating patterns along parallel lines and the tiling has at least one direction of translational symmetry.</p>

    <title>An unflippable polygon</title>
    <summary>We have neither a polynomial-time algorithm for counting the polygonalizations of a point set, nor a proof that the problem is hard. Given this lack of knowledge, it is natural to ask whether the number of polygonalizations can at least be approximated efficiently. A well-known principle in this area states that approximate counting is almost the same as approximately-uniform random generation (an algorithm for one can often be converted to an algorithm for another). And a standard method for randomly generating combinatorial objects is to set up a Markov chain whose states are the objects and whose stationary distribution is the uniform distribution. A long-enough random walk in this Markov chain will then lead to a state that is approximately uniformly distributed. The hard part, though, is finding a Markov chain for which one can prove that “long enough” is only polynomially many steps; that is, it mixes rapidly.</summary>

<p>For polygonalizations, a natural family of moves to consider are the <em>flips</em> in which we remove two edges from a polygon through the given points and replace them by a different two edges. There are two possible pairs of replacement edges, but one of the two never works: it would reconnect the two paths formed by removing the two edges into two cycles, instead of a single cycle. The other replacement sometimes works, and sometimes produces two crossed edges, also disallowed. Before we ask whether a Markov chain with these moves mixes rapidly, though, we need to ask whether it is even connected. Can we get from every polygon to every other polygon through the same set of points by making a sequence of flips?</p>

<p>This question was already considered in 2002 by Carmen Hernando, Michael E. Houle, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Hurtado">Ferran Hurtado</a> in their paper “On local transformation of polygons with visibility properties” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(01)00409-1"><em>Theor. Comput. Sci.</em> 289 (2): 919–937, 2002</a>). Unfortunately, they shows that it is not always possible. In particular, they found the following polygon, from which no flip is possible:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Unflippable polygonalization, redrawn from an example of Hernando, Houle, and Hurtado" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/unflippable-polygon.svg"/></p>

<p>More, the same polygon also cannot be changed by another kind of step that Hernando et al. call a VE-flip, in which one removes three edges, two of which are attached to the same point, and replaces them by a different three edges. In effect, this step moves the point to a different part of the polygon while leaving the cyclic sequence of the other points unchanged.</p>

<p>Hernando et al. ask whether there is any finite bound on the number of edges one may need to remove and replace in each step, in order to be able to convert any polygon into any other polygon on the same points. As far as I know, this 18-year-old problem remains open.</p>

<h2>Absorption and distributive absorption</h2>
<p>First the authors construct approximate decomposition (they divide the problem into two cases) and then they apply a powerful method called <strong>absorption</strong>. Here is what they write:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To prove our ﬁnishing lemmas, we use an absorption strategy. Absorption has its origins in work by Erdős, Gyárfás and Pyber [5] and Krivelevich [14], but was codiﬁed by Rödl, Ruciński and Szemerédi [20] as a versatile technique for extending approximate results into exact ones. For both Case A and Case B we use a new implementation of distributive absorption, a method introduced by the ﬁrst author in [16].</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Absorption is one of the most powerful current methods in extremal combinatorics. It is important in the construction of designs (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2014/01/16/amazing-peter-keevash-constructed-general-steiner-systems-and-designs/">here</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/amazing-stefan-glock-daniela-kuhn-allan-lo-deryk-osthus-give-a-new-proof-for-keevashs-theorem-and-more-news-on-designs/">here</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/02/23/peter-keevash-more-and-easier-designs/">here</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/seminaire-n-bourbaki-designs-exist-after-peter-keevash-the-paper/">here</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/bbfinal-2.pdf">my own survey</a>), and in the the solution of several other important conjectures.</p>

<p>A related paper with an amusing name and an amusing abstract is:  E. Szemerédi “Is laziness paying off? (`Absorbing’ method).”  The abstract of the paper reads “We are going to mention some embedding problems. The main ideas of most of the solution of these problems are that do not work too much. Finish the job almost, then use some kind of absorbing configuration (that is what we call laziness).”</p>
<p>Montgomery, Pokrovskiy, and Sudakov’s paper concludes with two related famous conjectures:</p>
<h2><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/pms.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19267" height="261" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/pms.png?w=640&amp;h=261" width="640"/></a></h2>
<h2>The graceful tree conjecture</h2>
<p>Motivated by Ringel’s conjecture, in 1967 Alexander Rosa conjectured that every tree <em>T</em> with <em>n</em> edges admits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceful_labeling"><strong>graceful labeling</strong></a>, namely a labeling of the vertices by the numbers 0,1,…,n such that if we label an edge by the absolute value of the difference of the labels for its two vertices, then all the edge labels are different!</p>
<p>This famous conjecture (stronger than Ringel’s conjecture) is known as the <b>Graceful Tree conjecture </b>and also as the <b>Ringel-Rosa-Kötzig conjecture. </b>It is still open.</p>
<h2>Packing trees of different sizes: Gyárfás conjecture</h2>
<p>Gyárfás conjecture (1976): Let <img alt="T_1, \dots ,T_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2CT_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="T_1, \dots ,T_n"/> be trees with <img alt="T_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="T_i"/> having <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i"/> vertices for each <img alt="i=1,2,\dots,n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3D1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2Cn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i=1,2,\dots,n"/>. Then the edges of <img alt="K_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="K_n"/> can be decomposed into <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> trees which are isomorphic to <img alt="T_1, \dots ,T_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2CT_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="T_1, \dots ,T_n"/> respectively.</p>

    <title>TR20-008 |  Better Secret-Sharing via Robust Conditional Disclosure of Secrets | 

	Benny Applebaum, 

	Amos Beimel, 

	Oded Nir, 

	Naty Peter</title>
    <summary>A secret-sharing scheme allows to distribute a secret $s$ among $n$ parties such that only some predefined ``authorized'' sets of parties can reconstruct the secret, and all other ``unauthorized'' sets learn nothing about $s$.  The collection of authorized sets is called the access structure. For over 30 years, it was known that any (monotone) collection of authorized sets can be realized by a secret-sharing scheme whose shares are of size $2^{n-o(n)}$ and until recently no better scheme was known. In a recent breakthrough, Liu and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2018) have reduced the share size to $2^{0.994n+o(n)}$, which was later improved to $2^{0.892n+o(n)}$ by Applebaum et al. (EUROCRYPT 2019).

In this paper we improve the exponent of general secret-sharing down to $0.637$. For the special case of linear secret-sharing schemes, we get an exponent of $0.762$ (compared to $0.942$ of Applebaum et al.).

As our main building block, we introduce a new  \emph{robust} variant of conditional disclosure of secrets (robust CDS) that achieves unconditional security even under limited form of re-usability. We show that the problem of general secret-sharing reduces to robust CDS with sub-exponential overhead and derive our main result by implementing robust CDS with a non-trivial exponent. The latter construction follows by presenting a general immunization procedure that turns standard CDS into a robust CDS.</summary>

	Claude Crépeau,

	Louis Salvail, 

	Lucas Stinchcombe, 

	Nan Yang</title>
    <summary>In this work we consider the following problem: in a Multi-Prover environment, how close can we get to prove the validity of an NP statement in Zero-Knowledge ? We exhibit a set of two novel Zero-Knowledge protocols for the 3-COLorability problem that use two (local) provers or three (entangled) provers and only require them to reply two trits each. This greatly improves the ability to prove Zero-Knowledge statements on very short distances with very minimal equipment.</summary>

<p>
Alan Turing proved the undecidability of the Halting Problem in 1936. Under a slight tweak to history he could thereby have refuted the “Magnus Embedding Conjecture” from 1930.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I point out a potential historical analogy to the brilliant new result of Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, and Henry Yuen (JNVWY), which refuted the Connes Embedding Conjecture.<br/>
<span id="more-16601"/></p>
<p>
We are quick to say there was no “Embedding Conjecture” in a 1930 journal <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/crll.1930.1930.issue-163/crll.1930.163.141/crll.1930.163.141.xml">paper</a> by Wilhelm Magnus, which comprised his doctoral thesis, and a 1932 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01455888">followup</a>. But there could have been. His solution to the word problem for finitely generated groups with one relation involved embedding certain subgroups into free groups. He might have conjectured that a similar strategy would work for <img alt="{m \geq 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%5Cgeq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m \geq 2}"/> relations. </p>
<p>
This is shown false by Turing’s theorem. Again our historical timing is out of order. The connection between groups and halting wasn’t established until Pyotr Novikov <a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&amp;jrnid=tm&amp;paperid=1180&amp;option_lang=eng">proved</a> undecidability with <img alt="{m = 28}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+28%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m = 28}"/> relations in 1955. This was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01101402">improved</a> to <img alt="{m = 12}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+12%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m = 12}"/> by Vadim Borisov. The cases <img alt="{m = 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m = 2}"/> to <img alt="{m = 11}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+11%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m = 11}"/> remain open. </p>
<p>
The historical sequence aside, Turing’s undecidability result did lead to other theorems. Tracing how this works might give a guide to further possible consequences of JNVWY. We do not plan on trying to explain the long JNVWY proof. We are, like many others, not able to say anything meaningful yet. Our goal is simpler: We want to place their result in a historical context. We hope that this might help us understand what they did. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Halting and Mathematics </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Suppose we time travel back years ago—when the Halting Problem (HP) was a new result. Can we see how the HP being undecidable could have been used to prove positive theorems? The flavor is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1 (Rough Theorem)</b> <em> There is no normal form for objects of type <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The proof is: Suppose there were normal forms for objects <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>. Then we could use this to solve the HP. But this is impossible. </p>
<p>
The upshot of the proof is that we should examine the technical details further. Above we have hinted that the HP shows that a whole variety of group theory “conjectures” cannot be true. We are not saying that anyone actually conjectured that they were true. But we are saying that HP shows that they are wrong. This is an example of computability/complexity theory yielding results in non-complexity areas. We’ll first elaborate on the group case and then give two other concrete examples.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Group Theory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Groups, especially infinite groups, often are defined by giving two things: A set <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> of generators, say <img alt="{x,y,\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y,\dots}"/>, and a set <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> of relationships they satisfy. For example, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  xy = yx. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++xy+%3D+yx.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  xy = yx. "/></p>
<p>If <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> are the only generators this says that the group is commutative. This enables one quickly to tell e.g. that the words <img alt="{xyxxyx}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bxyxxyx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{xyxxyx}"/> and <img alt="{yxxyxx}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Byxxyxx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{yxxyxx}"/> are equal, or equivalently, that </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x^{-1}x^{-1}y^{-1}x^{-1}x^{-1}y^{-1}xyxxyx = 1. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5E%7B-1%7Dx%5E%7B-1%7Dy%5E%7B-1%7Dx%5E%7B-1%7Dx%5E%7B-1%7Dy%5E%7B-1%7Dxyxxyx+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  x^{-1}x^{-1}y^{-1}x^{-1}x^{-1}y^{-1}xyxxyx = 1. "/></p>
<p>The <em>word problem</em> is, given <img alt="{R,S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%2CS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R,S}"/> and a word <img alt="{w \in S^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw+%5Cin+S%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w \in S^*}"/>, does <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> evaluate to <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>?</p>
<p>
Wilhelm Magnus proved that if <img alt="{||R|| = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%7CR%7C%7C+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{||R|| = 1}"/> then the word problem is decidable, regardless of the size of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/>. That is, one can decide if two words are the same. This is a landmark result with many consequences. An obvious issue might have been:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Can the word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_for_groups">problem</a> for any group with a finite number of relationships be reduced to answer questions about one relator groups? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Following these <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~andyp/notes/OneRelator.pdf">notes</a> on Magnus’s proof by Andrew Putman makes us think this could have happened. Magnus began in his thesis by proving his <em>Freiheitsatz</em>—“Freedom Theorem”—showing that for any word <img alt="{r_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_1}"/> and subgroup <img alt="{H_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H_1}"/> that does not include <img alt="{r_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_1}"/>, <img alt="{H_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H_1}"/> can be embedded bijectively into a free group. His followup showed how to manipulate the embeddings while inducting on the length of the word <img alt="{r_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_1}"/>. The <em>Freiheitsatz</em> applies of course to any sequence <img alt="{r_1,\dots,r_m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cr_m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_1,\dots,r_m}"/> and respective <img alt="{H_1,\dots,H_m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH_1%2C%5Cdots%2CH_m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H_1,\dots,H_m}"/>, and we can then take intersections of those subgroups. </p>
<p>
Could one have expected this strategy to extend for <img alt="{m &gt; 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3E+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m &gt; 1}"/>? This is perhaps historically hard to resolve. But the HP anyway makes the strategy impossible. This followed as soon as the word problem for groups was shown to be undecidable by Novikov. Perhaps the most aesthetic example of a group with an undecidable word problem comes from a 1986 <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ijm/1256044631">paper</a> by Donald Collins. It has 27 relations, one fewer than Novikov and 15 more than Borisov, but a smaller description overall:</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Number Theory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The HP implies that Diophantine equations are complicated. Consider the famous local-global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_principle">principle</a> of Helmut Hasse. This implies that a equation over the integers 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(x,y,z,\dots) = 0, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2C%5Cdots%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  f(x,y,z,\dots) = 0, "/></p>
<p>has a solution provided it has a solution over the reals and also has a solution modulo every prime <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/>. Note that the reals are needed because of equations like <img alt="{x^{2} = -1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7B2%7D+%3D+-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x^{2} = -1}"/>. </p>
<p>
This principle is true for certain types of equations, but it is false in general. The proof that Hilbert’s Tenth Problem is equivalent to the HP shows that this principle is false. Do you see why?</p>
<p>
Suppose it was true. Then we could decide the HP as follows. Run a search looking for a solution to the given equation. At the same time check that the equation is possible over the reals and also check for each prime <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> that it has a solution modulo <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/>. This can be done for each <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> in a computable bound. So one or the other search eventually stops.</p>
<p>
Note that it is still open whether Hilbert’s Tenth problem is undecidable over the <em>rationals</em> instead of the integers. This means that given a polynomial equation 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(x,y,z,\dots) = 0, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2C%5Cdots%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  f(x,y,z,\dots) = 0, "/></p>
<p>does it have a solution over the rationals? We discussed this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/hilberts-tenth-over-the-rationals/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/hilberts-10-5th-problem/">here</a>. Of course if there were a normal form argument for such a problem, this would make it decidable. Bjorn Poonen wrote a nice <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/h10_notices.pdf">survey</a> about this for the 2008 <em>AMS Notices</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Spectral Gaps </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This example comes closer to being concrete. In quantum physics, the <em>spectral gap</em> of a many-body system is the energy difference between its ground state and its first excited state. The system is represented by a Hamiltonian operator, which can be finite or infinite. It is often more convenient to represent a highly regular structure such as a crystal lattice by a succinctly presented infinite operator than a large finite one with indeterminate cutoffs. </p>
<p>
In 2015, Toby Cubitt, David Perez-Garcia, and Michael Wolf (CPW) showed that the spectral gap in such cases is uncomputable. Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16059">paper</a> in <em>Nature</em> was accompanied by a <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/paradox-at-the-heart-of-mathematics-makes-physics-problem-unanswerable-1.18983">column</a> by Davide Castelvecchi expressly drawing the link to Turing and also to Kurt Gödel. See also this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05924">comparison</a> by Seth Lloyd with his own earlier undecidability results in quantum and this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00825">reply</a> by CPW.</p>
<p>
The full <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04573.pdf">paper</a> by CPW—127 pages—connects their proof to the undecidability of tiling problems. It also involves finite quantum circuits for phase estimation. They state:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Conjectures about the spectral gap, such as the Haldane conjecture, the 2D AKLT conjecture, or the Yang-Mills mass gap conjecture in quantum field theory, implicitly assume that these questions can be answered one way or the other. Our results prove that the answer to the general spectral gap question is not determined by the axioms of mathematics. Whilst our results are still a long way from proving that any of these specific conjectures are axiomatically undecidable, they at least open the door to the possibility that these—or similar—questions about physical models may be provably unanswerable. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
They also cite a 2014 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.4466.pdf">paper</a> showing that a related problem about whether a matrix operator represents a physical state with no negative eigenvalues is undecidable in the thermodynamic limit and NP-hard in bounded cases. We wonder in particular how the new JNVWY theorem may amplify the connection between undecidability and these conjectures, in ways that would prove further theorems about the latter.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the community of mamathetitians in a certain country there are mamathetitians in two areas: Anabra (fraction <strong><em>p</em></strong> of the mamathetitians) and Algasis (fraction <strong><em>1-p</em></strong> of  mamathetitians.) There are ten universities with 50 faculty members in each mamathetics department and there is a clear ranking of these universities from best to worse. (So a better university pays higher salary and gives better working conditions.)  Every year 40 fresh Ph D’s are in the job market and each university  hires two of the fresh Ph. D.’s as new faculty members replacing retired faculty members.</p>
<p><strong>The objective value</strong> <em><strong>v(x)</strong></em> of every mamathetitian <em><strong>x</strong></em> is a random variable uniformly distributed in the interval<strong> [0,1]</strong>.  <strong>The subjective value</strong> of <em><strong>x</strong></em> in the eyes of another mamathetitian <em><strong>y</strong></em> is <em><strong>v(x)+t</strong></em> if they belong to the same area and <em><strong>v(x)-t</strong></em> if they belong to different areas, where <em><strong>t</strong></em> is a small real number.</p>
<p>The top ranked university hires the best two fresh Ph. D.’s  according to average value in the eyes of the faculty, the second university hires the second best two students etc.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that to start is <em><strong>p=0.25</strong></em>, so <strong>25%</strong> of all faculty are anabraists, and <strong>75%</strong> are algasisits and this is the ratio in every university. Let us also assume that among the students for ever <strong>25%</strong> are anabraists, and <strong>75%</strong> are algasisits.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Test your intuition (and/or, programming skills) 43: What will be the distribution of anabraists and algasisits in the departments as time advances (depending on <em>t</em>), what will be the stationary distribution across departments?</span></h3>
<p>We can also ask about variations to the model:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">Further test you intuition, imagination and programming skill: How does the answer change if you change the model in various ways. Change the value of p? Make the initial distribution random across departments?  Add noise to the subjective value? Make the bias in subjective evaluation <strong>asymmetric</strong>? make different assumptions on the fresh Ph. D.s? etc. etc.</span></p>
<p>References to similar models considered in the literature are most welcome.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I do not know the answers.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Here are very interesting outcomes by Joshua Paik. We see a sort of Zebra-strips patterns between Algasis dominated departments and Anabra dominated departments.</span></p></div>

    <title>The World of Publishing</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bill is out for blogging for a couple of weeks on injured-reserve (he’ll be fine). I put together a quick blog post on what’s happening in the world of publications. <br/>
<br/>
The Trump administration has suggested requiring publishers to make all papers based on US federally-funded publicly available immediately instead of after one year. The Association of American Publishers sent an <a href="https://presspage-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/1508/lettertothepresidentfrom140researchandpublishingorgs-2.pdf?10000">open letter</a>--how do we maintain the organizations and the people who work there if we give up a major revenue source. The ACM joined the letter which caused quite a backlash forcing the ACM to <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/january/message-from-the-acm-president-regarding-open-access">explain itself</a>, write another <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-letter-to-ostp.pdf">letter</a>, and run some <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/january/oa-webinars">webinars</a> about open access the last of which is tomorrow. In the end, this is leading to some good discussions about open access and the financial models of academic societies. <br/>
<br/>
The ACM also has a <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author-name-changes">new policy</a>, three options for what happens when an author changes their name: Maintain separate identities, have the two identities link to each other, or retroactively change the name on all previous papers. I can see good reasons for all three options.<br/>
<br/>
Finally Moshe Vardi writes in his <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241717-publish-and-perish/fulltext">CACM column</a> about the ecological cost of conferences and suggests that conferences allow authors to (video)phone it in. Emmanuel Viola offers <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/01/01/publish-and-perish/">his own thoughts</a>. Most Conferences will continue to require authors to show up, with only occasional exceptions as needed, believing these policies will keep their conference healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I believe conferences should exist because researchers want to attend, not because they have to. We still need conferences so our community can get together and I don’t believe we can do that via the Internet no matter how good the VR experience gets. But we can have more videos and less conferences and reduce the costs: time, financial and environmental.</div>

<p>Title: The lower tail for triangles in random graphs</p>
<p>Abstract:<br/>
Let <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="X"/> denote the number of triangles in the random graph <img alt="G_{n,p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_%7Bn%2Cp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_{n,p}"/>. The problem of determining the asymptotics of the logarithmic lower tail probability of~<img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="X"/>, that is, the function <img alt="f_c(n,p) = - \log Pr(X \le c \mathbb E [X])" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_c%28n%2Cp%29+%3D+-+%5Clog+Pr%28X+%5Cle+c+%5Cmathbb+E+%5BX%5D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_c(n,p) = - \log Pr(X \le c \mathbb E [X])"/>, for <img alt="c \in [0,1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cin+%5B0%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c \in [0,1)"/>, has attracted considerable attention of both the combinatorics and the probability communities. In this talk, we explain how one can bound <img alt="f_c(n,p)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_c%28n%2Cp%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_c(n,p)"/> from above by solving a natural combinatorial optimisation problem that generalises Mantel’s / Turán’s theorem. Moreover, we will prove a matching lower bound on <img alt="f_c(n,p)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_c%28n%2Cp%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_c(n,p)"/> in the case <img alt="p = 1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p = 1/2"/>. Our argument, which employs ideas from an earlier joint work with Gady Kozma, Tom Meyerovitch, and Ron Peled, exploits connections between entropy and independence.</p>
<p>This is joint work with Gady Kozma.</p></div>

<p>They are looking for applications from students, postdocs, and young researchers in physics &amp; math, as well computer scientists. While I am biased (I will be lecturing there too) I think the combination of lecturers, speakers, and audience members will yield a very unique opportunity for interaction across communities, and strongly encourage theoretical computer scientists to apply (which you can from the <a href="http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/">website</a>). Let me also use this opportunity to remind people again of <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/03/30/physics-computation-blog-post-round-up/">Tselil Schramm’s blog post</a> where she collected some of the lecture notes from the seminar we ran on physics &amp; computation.</p>



<p><strong>More information about the summer school:</strong></p>



<p>The “Les Houches school of physics”, situated close to Chamonix and the Mont Blanc in the French Alps, has a long history of forming generations of young researchers on the frontiers of their fields. Our school is aimed primarily at the growing audience of theoretical physicists and applied mathematicians interested in machine learning and high-dimensional data analysis, as well as to <strong>colleagues from other fields</strong> interested in this interface. <em>[my emphasis –Boaz]</em> We will cover basics and frontiers of high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, the theory of computing and learning, and probability theory. We will focus in particular on methods of statistical physics and their results in the context of current questions and theories related to machine learning and neural networks. The school will also cover examples of applications of machine learning methods in physics research, as well as other emerging applications of wide interest. Open questions and directions will be presented as well.</p>



<p>Students, postdocs and young researchers interested to participate in the event are invited to apply on the website <a href="http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/" rel="nofollow">http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/</a> before March 15, 2020. The capacity of the school is limited, and due to this constraint participants will be selected from the applicants and participants will be required to attend the whole event.</p>

<p>
Claire Cameron is the senior science editor at an online publication called <a href="https://www.inverse.com/"><i>Inverse</i></a>. She has written an incomplete <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/61364-2020-science-and-tech-predictions">article</a> titled, “The 2020s: 20 science and tech predictions for the new decade.” She has posted 12 of the predictions, but the top 8 will be revealed on Wednesday, January 22.  <b>Update 1/22:</b> The predictions will be revealed over the coming week.  <b>Update 1/23:</b> Or not…#8 has not yet been posted.  <b>1/24:</b> Still not.  Maybe we need to write a post titled, “Predicting When Predictors Will Predict.”</p>
<p>
Today we offer a game of predicting: what will she predict? We also make some predictions for this year, including some that have already come true—the best kind.<br/>
<span id="more-16583"/></p>
<p>
Here are her 12 predictions. See if you can guess her other 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>
20. In the 2020s, human-level A.I. will arrive and finally pass the Turing test. <p/>
</li><li>
19. In the 2020s, tiny biosensors could make a 911 phone call from Mars. <p/>
</li><li>
18. Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s vacuum-sealed transit system, may get a speed boost. <p/>
</li><li>
17. In the 2020s, we will have a real Robot Olympics. (And it’ll be a lot cooler than the regular Olympics.) <p/>
</li><li>
16. A woeful prediction: Air pollution levels will remain constant in the ’20s. <p/>
</li><li>
15. Solar panels will continue to decline in price in the 2020s. <p/>
</li><li>
14. Humans return to the Moon. <p/>
</li><li>
13. Killer robots may roam the Earth. (That is, autonomous weapons will become reality.) <p/>
</li><li>
12. We’re gonna live a whole lot longer. (The linked description muses about 1,000-year lifespans beginning this decade.) <p/>
</li><li>
11. If you hope to see a self-driving car this decade, keep dreaming. <p/>
</li><li>
10. We’ll witness CRISPR gene-editing trials on humans. <p/>
</li><li>
9. We’ll be doing experiments on lab-grown brains.
</li></ul>
<p>
There are already some clear big ones: yes to the Turing test and long lifespans and gene+brain editing but nix to self-driving cars. There may be some logical entailments, e.g., if 11 is false—so that self-driving cars are released—does that make 13 true? </p>
<p>
None of these predictions is out-of-the-blue: they all connect to initiatives already underway. So there should be some basis for inferring the missing eight. Quantum computing is one obvious area. Reviewing last year’s predictions will bring us there.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Last Year’s Predictions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We made 5 perennial predictions and 5 new ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>No circuit lower bound of <img alt="{1000n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1000n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1000n}"/> or better will be proved for <img alt="{\mathrm{SAT}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7BSAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathrm{SAT}}"/>.</em> Check. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A “provably” secure crypto-system will be broken.</em> No need to check—happens all the time. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>At least five claims that <img alt="{\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}}"/> and five that <img alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}"/> will be made.</em> The <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> versus <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> claims <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm">page</a> has stopped being updated, but we can just count from comments on this blog. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A computer scientist will win a Nobel Prize.</em> Again, not close—unless you count how vital lithium-ion batteries are to laptop computers. Two physicists won for discovering exoplanets in Earth-Sun type contexts, a question we retired last year. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A Clay problem will be solved, or at least notable progress made.</em> A year ago we said this did not happen in 2018, but now for 2019 we’ll say <em>yes</em> based on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07321.pdf">paper</a> by Michael Griffin, Ken Ono, Larry Rolen, and Don Zagier (GORZ), which we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/a-prime-breakthrough/">here</a> with progress on the Riemann Hypothesis.
</li></ul>
<p>
The GORZ paper was #1 on this <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/g30346822/biggest-math-breakthroughs-2019/">list</a> of “The 10 Biggest Math Breakthroughs of 2019” by <em>Popular Mechanics</em>. We also covered the list’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/30/writing-33-as-a-sum-of-cubes/">#2</a>, <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/26/quantum-switch-em/">#3</a> (in one subsection), <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/tools-and-sensitivity/">#4</a> (with a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/25/discrepancy-games-and-sensitivity/">followup</a>), and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/21/the-shortest-path-to-the-abel-prize/">#10</a> items—not too bad. </p>
<p>
The five non-perennial predictions from last year were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Deep learning methods will be found able to solve integer factoring. This will place current cryptography is trouble.</em> We had guessed a followup to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03768.pdf">this</a> or <a href="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/factoring-massive-numbers-a-new-machine-learning-approach">this</a>, but we do not see one from 2019. <p/>

<em>Deep learning methods will be found to help prove that factoring is hard.</em> See above. Instead, there was <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q3/poor-mans-qubit-can-solve-quantum-problems-without-going-quantum.html">this</a> (or see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342">this</a>). <p/>
</li><li>
<em>The lines between heuristically solvable and really hard problems will become clearer—or more simply, SAT-solvers will hit a wall.</em> Well hey, the best papers in the <a href="http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/program.html">program</a> for the SAT 2019 conference in Lisbon included <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/On_Super_Strong_ETH.pdf">this</a> by Nikhil Vyas and Ryan Williams. It refutes a “super-strong ETH” statement for random <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>-SAT instances with a fixed clause-to-variable ratio. So we guess a wall got broken thru instead. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>An algorithm originating in a theoretical model will be enshrined in law.</em> The Supreme Court cases on gerrymandering which we thought could do this instead nixed the algorithmic model—for now. Differential privacy was formally <a href="https://www2.census.gov/about/policies/2019-11-paper-differential-privacy.pdf">adopted</a> for the 2020 Census, but apparently at the level of memoranda pursuant to the long-existing Title 13 rather than to new legislation. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Quantum supremacy will be proved—finally.</em>  This needs its own subsection to evaluate.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Quantum Supremacy </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
Last year, if we had written “claimed” or even “achieved,” we would now say <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">bingo</a>. But writing “proved” sets a higher standard. To judge from <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4447">this</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/ibm-edges-closer-to-quantum-supremacy-with-50qubit-processor">this</a>, it appears the Google-led team is upping their qubit count from 53 to 57 in order to shore up their quantum supremacy claim. </p>
<p>
However, we look back at what we called the “three planks” of a quantum supremacy claim:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Build a physical device capable of a nontrivial sampling task. <p/>
</li><li>
Prove that it gains advantage over known classical approaches. <p/>
</li><li>
Prove that comparable classical hardware cannot gain such advantage.
</li></ol>
<p>
We don’t think IBM’s 2.5-day simulation that would run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(supercomputer)">Summit</a> supercomputer is “comparable hardware” enough to count as a “known classical approach.” So we claim part credit even with the “proved” wording based on plank 2 surviving IBM’s challenge and any other as far as we know. There is still our friend Gil Kalai’s now-detailed <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/12/27/the-google-quantum-supremacy-demo/">critique</a> of the modeling that the Google team’s analysis leans on. </p>
<p>
The level of plank 2 is what we meant a year ago anyway. See how we flip things in our last prediction below.  Incidentally, in regard to the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">argument</a> over the terms quantum “supremacy” and “advantage,” we stand by the different definitions toward the end of our predictions <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/06/predictions-for-2019/">post</a> a year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Five Predictions for 2020 </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
For our five predictions—besides the five perennial ones—we start with something easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The power of multiple quantum entangled provers will be resolved, with repercussions for other areas of mathematics.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
This isn’t a total gimme: the proof could be wrong. The idea and connections, however, already seem clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Resolving the Sunflower Conjecture will run up against mainstream complexity theory issues.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
This may be more a stretch. We note this new <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~anuprao/pubs/sunflower.pdf">paper</a> by Anup Rao simplifying some aspects of the proof of last year’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483">advance</a> on the problem by Ryan Alweiss, Shachar Lovett, Kewen Wu, and Jiapeng Zhang. Sunflower bounds are known to impact some complexity problems that seem more specialized, but neither paper mentions widening the contingencies. But talking about “mainstream” complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>A previously overlooked contingency involving two pairs of complexity classes will be found that can be taught in an intro theory course.</em> We mean something like <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P = P \implies PSPACE = X}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P+%3D+P+%5Cimplies+PSPACE+%3D+X%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P = P \implies PSPACE = X}}"/>, where of course we don’t know what <img alt="{\mathsf{X}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BX%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{X}}"/> is. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>The fourth-power upper bound given by Hao Huang’s proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture will be improved to <img alt="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^4)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29+%3D+o%28s%28f%29%5E4%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^4)}"/> but not to <img alt="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^{4-\delta})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29+%3D+o%28s%28f%29%5E%7B4-%5Cdelta%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^{4-\delta})}"/> for any fixed <img alt="{\delta &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta &gt; 0}"/>.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
We don’t have a concrete reason to think this, only the thought that if this were false in either direction then that might have been found already in the half-year since Huang’s paper. We note this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05406.pdf">survey</a> from two weeks ago. </p>
<p>
Now to get back to quantum. Instead of refining what we wrote a year ago, we do the opposite:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The statistical test underlying the quantum supremacy claim will not be tied to a mainstream complexity collapse.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
That is, the coming year will <em>not</em> see a result of the form: if polynomial-sized classical hardware can achieve the same statistical separation as modeled for the quantum hardware (under either the linear or logarithmic “cross-entropy benchmark”) then counting and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to <img alt="{\Sigma_3^p \cap \Pi_3^p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CSigma_3%5Ep+%5Ccap+%5CPi_3%5Ep%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Sigma_3^p \cap \Pi_3^p}"/>. Thus we expect to still be talking about all this a year from now.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Poem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Talking about talking about quantum supremacy, I wrote a short poem on its larger significances:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> ‘It From Bit’ we once proclaimed,<br/>
but now the Bit has bit the dust<br/>
from whizzing quantum chips that gamed<br/>
coherence to evade the trust<br/>
that the Word drove creation’s hour:<br/>
Mother Nature fully lexical.<br/>
Why don’t our brains then have this power?<br/>
It is a status most perplexical. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The import of the <em>polynomial-time Church-Turing thesis</em> is that symbolic computation, our brains, our computing devices whose programs execute at the level of machine <em>language</em>, and natural processes on which any computing device can be based, are equivalent under broad notions of efficiency not just in computability. If this <em>fails</em>, then we can ask a question like the one about illusions quoted at the end of last week’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/our-thoughts-on-pnp/">post</a> on <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>: why would so many smart people have had the illusion that the universe is based on classical information? This may have quick answers: the theory of quantum information wasn’t yet appreciated; it shares many similarities with classical information theory; classical information <a href="https://www.informationphilosopher.com/introduction/physics/quantum_to_classical.html">remains</a> in the <a href="https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-02-5769">picture</a>.  Note that the Simons <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~phayden/simons/overview.pdf">initiative</a> <i>It From Qubit</i> has existed for some time.</p>
<p>
But then comes a second question. Richard Dawkins <a href="https://www.skeptics.com.au/resources/articles/the-information-challenge/">speaks</a> for many biologists in underscoring that the major open issues in the genesis of life concern the processing of information to build complex structures. If nature affords capability <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> to this processing, one would expect complex biological structures—in particular, our brains—to evolve to avail it. Well, Roger Penrose spearheaded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind">effort</a> to show that our brains employ distinctive quantum processes, but the physical side of his argument has been blunted by evidence. It could be that “quantum advantage” is not a life advantage. The classical falling-short of our grey matter would still be curious.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are your predictions for 2020? What are your <em>meta</em>-predictions for the coming decade—that is, which 8 predictions do you think Claire Cameron will post on Wednesday? It may help you to know that last month she wrote a science <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/61863-science-explain-cats-movie-creepy">article</a> on the movie <em>Cats</em>.</p>

    <title>TR20-005 |  Hardness Characterisations and Size-Width Lower Bounds for QBF Resolution | 

	Olaf Beyersdorff, 

	Joshua Blinkhorn, 

	Meena Mahajan</title>
    <summary>We provide a tight characterisation of proof size in resolution for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) by circuit complexity. Such a characterisation was previously obtained for a hierarchy of QBF Frege systems (Beyersdorff &amp; Pich, LICS 2016), but leaving open the most important case of QBF resolution. Different from the Frege case, our characterisation uses a new version of decision lists as its circuit model, which is stronger than the CNFs the system works with. Our decision list model is well suited to compute countermodels for QBFs.

Our characterisation works for both Q-Resolution and QU-Resolution, which we show to be polynomially equivalent for QBFs of bounded quantifier alternation.

Using our characterisation we obtain a size-width relation for QBF resolution in the spirit of the celebrated result for propositional resolution (Ben-Sasson &amp; Wigderson, J. ACM 2001). However, our result is not just a replication of the propositional relation - intriguingly ruled out  for QBF  in previous research (Beyersdorff et al., ACM ToCL 2018) - but shows a different dependence between size, width, and quantifier complexity.

We demonstrate that our new technique elegantly reproves known QBF hardness results and unifies previous lower-bound techniques in the QBF domain.</summary>

    <title>When does 2SAT have an integral relaxation?</title>
    <summary>In the 2-satisfiability problem, or 2SAT, the input is a system of constraints between pairs of Boolean variables, and the problem is to find a truth assignment satisfying all the constraints. Although the usual formulation writes the constraints as disjunctions (Boolean or), it’s convenient and equivalent to use implications instead, where each side of an implication can be either one of the variables or its negation. If you encode the variables as numbers, with for true and for false, then the negation of a variable is and the implication can be encoded as the linear inequality . If we forget the restriction that the values are or , this system of inequalities defines a convex polytope, which can be thought of as a relaxation of the given 2SAT problem. Each solution to the 2SAT problem corresponds to a vertex of this polytope but there might be other vertices as well, with fractional coordinates. We don’t want those; it’s more useful to have a polytope all of whose coordinates are integers, coming from solutions to the underlying 2SAT problem. When does this happen (without adding extra inequalities)?</summary>

When does this happen (without adding extra inequalities)?</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure the answer has been known, at least implicitly, for a long time, and that there are no new ideas in the rest of this post. See e.g. the answer to <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/a/46188/95">this very closely related question on relaxations of the vertex cover problem</a> and note that vertex cover can be formulated as 2SAT, with a variable per vertex and two constraints per edge of the input graph. But when I looked for it, I found it difficult to find references that give the answer explicitly. So here it is. The following conditions are equivalent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The given 2SAT instance has an integral relaxation.</li>
  <li>The given 2SAT instance has two solutions that are the complements of each other (each variable is true in one of the solutions and false in the other).</li>
  <li>The compatibility graph of the given 2SAT instance is bipartite.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, the compatibility graph is an undirected graph defined by Feder in “Network Flow and 2-Satisfiability” (<em>Algorithmica</em> 1994). It has a vertex for each literal (a variable or its negation). The two vertices for a variable and its negation are connected by an edge, called a “trivial edge”. Additionally,
for each implication , the two literals  and  cannot both be true, and we add an edge between them.</p>

<p>If the compatibility graph is bipartite, two-color it, make the vertices of one color be true, and make the vertices of the other color be false. Then this gives a solution to the 2SAT instance whose complement is also a solution. So the third condition implies the second condition.</p>

<p>The relaxation of any 2SAT instance contains the point whose coordinates all equal , and if the given instance has an integral relaxation then this point can be represented as a weighted average of integer solutions. An odd cycle in the compatibility graph would prevent that from being possible. For any point in the relaxation, and any literal, we consider the value of the literal to be either its coordinate value (if it represents a variable) or one minus that value (if it represents a negated variable). If some cycle has odd length , then each integer point in the weighted average could only have total value at most  on the literals of the cycle, so their weighted average would also be at most , less than the cycle’s total value of  in the all- solution. So the first condition implies the third condition.</p>

<p>Finally, suppose that there are two complementary solutions, and flip the variables if necessary so that these are the all-false and all-true assignments to the variables. (This flipping simplifies the problem without changing any of the three conditions.) Consider any fractional solution , and construct from it a probability distribution on truth assignments as follows: choose a uniformly random number , set to true the variables whose coordinate value is at least , and set to false the remaining variables.
All truth assignments generated in this way solve the 2SAT problem, because any violation of an implication constraint in the 2SAT problem would translate to a violation of the corresponding coordinate inequality constraint in the relaxation. The given fractional solution  is a weighted average of the resulting collection of 2SAT solutions, where the weight of a solution is the probability of generating it. Therefore, the second condition implies the first condition.</p>

<p>It would be great to know whether anyone’s actually reading the later updates, so I know whether to continue putting effort into them!</p>



<h2><a name="jan18">Saturday January 18</a></h2>



<p>Today I’m headed to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020">50th World Economic Forum in Davos</a>, where on Tuesday I’ll participate in a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/the-quantum-potential">panel discussion</a> on “The Quantum Potential” with Jeremy O’Brien of the quantum computing startup <a href="https://psiquantum.com/">PsiQuantum</a>, and will also host an ask-me-anything session about quantum computational supremacy and Google’s claim to have achieved it.</p>



<p>I’m well aware that this will be unlike any other conference I’ve ever attended: STOC or FOCS it ain’t.  As one example, also speaking on Tuesday—although not conflicting with my QC sessions—will be a real-estate swindler and reality-TV star who’s somehow (alas) the current President of the United States.  Yes, even while his impeachment trial in the Senate gets underway.  <em>Also</em> speaking on Tuesday, a mere hour and a half after him, will be TIME’s Person of the Year, 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg.</p>



<p>In short, this Davos is shaping up to be an epic showdown between two diametrically opposed visions for the future of life on Earth.  And your humble blogger will be right there in the middle of it, to … uhh … explain how quantum computers can sample probability distributions that are classically intractable unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level.  I feel appropriately sheepish.</p>



<p>Since the experience will be so unusual for me, I’m planning to <strong>“live-blog Davos”</strong>: I’ll be updating this post, all week, with any strange new things that I see or learn.  As a sign of my devotion to you, my loyal readers, I’ll even clothespin my nose and attend Trump’s speech so I can write about it.</p>



<p>And Greta: on the off chance that you happen to read <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, let me treat you to a vegan lunch or dinner!  I’d like to try to persuade you of just how essential nuclear power will be to a carbon-free future.  Oh, and if it’s not too much trouble, I’d also like a selfie with you for this blog.  (Alas, a friend pointed out to me that it would probably be easier to meet Trump: unlike Greta, he won’t be swarmed with thousands of fans!)</p>



<p>Anyway, check back here throughout the week for updates.  And if you’re in Davos and would like to meet, please shoot me an email.  And please use the comment section to give me your advice, suggestions, well-wishes, requests, or important messages for me to fail to deliver to the “Davoisie” who run the world.</p>



<h2><a name="jan19">Sunday January 19</a></h2>



<p>So I’ve arrived in Klosters, a village in the Swiss Alps close to Davos where I’ll be staying.  (All the hotels in Davos itself were booked by the time I checked.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4543" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image.png"/></figure>



<p>I’d braced myself for the challenge of navigating three different trains through the Alps not knowing German.  In reality, it was like a hundred times easier than public transportation at home.  Every train arrived at the exact right second at the exact platform that was listed, bearing the exact right number, and there were clear visible signs strategically placed at exactly the places where anyone could get confused.  I’d entered Bizarro Opposite World.  I’m surely one of the more absentminded people on earth, as well as one of the more neurotic about being judged by bystanders if I ever admit to being lost, and it was nothing.</p>



<p>Snow!  Once a regular part of my life, now the first I’d seen in several years.  Partly because I now live in Texas, but also because even when we take the kids back to Pennsylvania for ChanuChrismaNewYears, it no longer snows like it did when I was a kid.  If you show my 2-year-old, Daniel, a picture of snow-covered wilderness, he calls it a “beach.”  Daniel’s soon-to-be 7-year-old sister still remembers snow from Boston, but the memory is rapidly fading.  I wonder for how many of the children of the 21st century will snow just be a thing from old books and movies, like typewriters or rotary phones.</p>



<p>The World Economic Forum starts tomorrow afternoon.  In the meantime, though, I thought I’d give an update not on the WEF itself, but on the inflight movie that I watched on my way here.</p>



<p>I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2066051/">Rocketman</a>, the recent biopic/hagiography about Elton John, though as I watched I found that I kept making comparisons between Elton John and Greta Thunberg.</p>



<p>On the surface, these two <em>might</em> not seem to have a great deal of similarity.</p>



<p>But I gathered that they had this in common: while still teenagers, they saw a chance and they seized it.  And doing so involved taking inner turmoil and then succesfully externalizing it to the whole planet.  Making hundreds of millions of people feel the same emotions that they had felt.  If I’m being painfully honest (how often am I not?), that’s something I’ve always wanted to achieve and haven’t.</p>



<p>Of course, when some of the most intense and distinctive emotions you’ve ever felt revolved around the discovery of quantum query complexity lower bounds … yeah, it might be tough to find more people than could fill a room to relive <em>those</em> emotional journeys with you.  But a child’s joy at discovering numbers like Ackerman(100) (to say nothing of BB(100)), which are so incomprehensibly bigger than \( 9^{9^{9^{9^9}}} \) that I didn’t need to think twice about how many 9’s I put there?  Or the exasperation at those who, yeah, totally get that quantum computers aren’t known to give exponential speedups for NP-complete problems, that’s a really important clarification coming from the theory side, but still, let’s continue to base our entire business or talk or article around the presupposition that quantum computers <strong>do</strong> give exponential speedups for NP-complete problems?  Or even just the type of crush that comes with a ceaseless monologue about what an objectifying, misogynist pig you must be to experience it?  Maybe I could someday make people vicariously experience and understand <em>those</em> emotions–if I could only find the right words.</p>



<p>My point is, this is precisely what Greta did for the burgeoning emotion of existential terror about the Anthropocene—another emotion that’s characterized my life since childhood.  Not that I ever figured out anything to do about it, with the exception of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=278">Gore/Nader vote-swapping</a>.  By the standards of existential terrors, I consider this terror to be extraordinarily well-grounded.  If Steven Weinberg is scared, who among us has the right to be calm?</p>



<p>The obvious objection to Greta—why should anyone care what a histrionic teenager thinks about a complicated scientific field that thousands of people get PhDs in?—calls for a substantive answer.  So here’s mine.  Like many concerned citizens, I try to absorb some of the research on ocean warming or the collapse of ice sheets and the melting permafrost leading to even more warming or the collapse of ecosystems due to changes in rainfall or bushfires or climate migrations or whatever.  And whenever I do, I’m reminded of Richard Feynman’s remark, during the investigation of the Challenger disaster, that maybe it wasn’t all that interesting for the commission to spend its time reconstructing the exact details of which system caused which other system to malfunction at which millisecond, <strong>after the Space Shuttle had already started exploding.</strong>  The thing was hosed at that point.</p>



<p>Still, even after the 80s and 90s, there remained deep open questions about the eventual shape of the climate crisis, and foremost among them was: how do you get people to stop talking about this crisis in the language of intellectual hypotheticals and meaningless virtue-signalling gestures and “those crazy scientists, who knows what they’ll say tomorrow”?  How does one get people to revert to a more ancient language, the one that was used to win WWII for example, which speaks of courage and duty and heroism and defiance in the jaws of death?</p>



<p>Greta’s origin story—the one where the autistic girl spends months so depressed over climate inaction that she can’t eat or leave her room, until finally, no longer able to bear the psychic burden, she ditches school and carries a handmade protest sign to the front of the Swedish parliament—is not merely a prerequisite to a real contribution.  It <em>is</em> Greta’s real contribution (so far anyway), and by that I don’t mean to diminish it.  The idea was “trivial,” yes, but only in the sense that the wheel, Arabic numerals, or “personal computers will be important” were trivial ideas.  Greta modeled for the rest of the world how they, too, would probably feel about climate change were they able to sync up their lizard brains with their higher brains … and crucially, a substantial segment of the world was already primed to agree with her.  But it needed to see <em>one successful example</em> of a succesful sync between the science and the emotions appropriate to the science, as a crystal needs a seed.</p>



<p>The thesis of Rocketman is that Elton John’s great achievement was not only to invent a new character, but <em>actually to become that character</em>, since only by succesfully fusing the two could he touch the emotions of the masses.  In a similar way, Greta Thunberg’s great accomplishment of her short life has been to make herself into the human race’s first Greta Thunberg.</p>



<h2><a name="jan20">Monday January 20</a></h2>



<p>Happy 7th birthday to my daughter Lily!  (No, I didn’t miss her birthday party.  We did it on the 18th, right before I flew out.)</p>



<p>I think my goals for Davos have been downgraded from delivering a message of peace and nerd liberation to the world’s powerful, or even getting a selfie with Greta, to simply taking in a week in an environment that’s so alien to me.</p>



<p>Everything in Davos is based on a tiered system of badges, which determine which buildings you can get into to participate in the sessions.  I have a white badge, the highest tier, which would’ve set me back around <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/costs-of-davos-2011-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">$71,000</a> had WEF not thankfully waived its fees for academics.  I should mention that I’m also extremely underdressed compared to most of the people here, and that I spent much of my time today looking for free food.  It turns out that there’s pretty copious and excellent free food, although the sponsors sometimes ask you to leave your business card before you take any.  I don’t have a business card.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4546" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-2.png"/></figure>



<p>The above, for me, represents the true spirit of Davos: a conference at a Swiss ski resort that costs $71,000 to attend, held on behalf of the ideal of human equality.</p>



<p>But maybe I shouldn’t scoff.  I learned today about a war between Greece and Turkey that was averted only because the heads of the two countries talked it over at Davos, so that’s cool.  At the opening ceremony today, besides a beautiful orchestral rendition of “Ode to Joy,” there were a bunch of speeches about how Davos pioneered the entire concept of corporate social responsibility.  I suppose the critics might say instead that Davos pioneered the concept of corporate <em>whitewashing</em>—as with the wall-sized posters that I saw this afternoon, wherein a financial services corporation showcased a diverse cast of people each above their preferred pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them).  Amazing how pronouns make everything woke and social-justicey!  I imagine that the truth is somewhere between these visions.  Just like the easiest way for NASA to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4267">fake</a> a moon landing was actually to send humans to the moon, sometimes the easiest way to virtue-signal is actually to become more virtuous.</p>



<p>Tonight I went to a reception specifically for the academics at Davos.  There, for the first time since my arrival, I saw people who I knew (Shafi Goldwasser, Neha Narula…), and met someone who I’d known by reputation (Brian Schmidt, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of dark energy).  But even the people who I didn’t know were clearly “my people,” with familiar nerdy mannerisms and interests, and in some cases even a thorough knowledge of SlateStarCodex references.  Imagine visiting a foreign country where no one spoke your language, then suddenly stumbling on the first ones who did.  I found it a hundred times easier than at the main conference to strike up conversations.</p>



<p>Oh yeah, quantum computing.  This afternoon I hosted three roundtable discussions about  quantum computing, which were fun and stress-free — I spent <em>much</em> more of my mental energy today figuring out the shuttle buses.  If you’re a regular reader of this blog or my popular articles, or a watcher of my talks on YouTube, etc., then congratulations: you’ve gotten the same explanations of quantum computing for free that others may have paid $71,000 apiece to hear!  Tomorrow are my two “real” quantum computing sessions, as well as the speeches by both the Donald and the Greta (the latter being the much hotter ticket).  So it’s a big day, which I’ll tell you about after it’s happened.  Stay tuned!</p>



<h2><a name="jan21">Tuesday January 21</a></h2>



<p>PsiQuantum’s Jeremy O’Brien and I did the Davos quantum computing panel this morning (moderated by Jennifer Schenker).  You can watch our 45-minute panel <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/the-quantum-potential">here</a>.  For regular readers of this blog, the territory will be familiar, but I dunno, I hope someone enjoys it anyway!</p>



<p>I’m now in the Congress Hall, in a seat near the front, waiting for Trump to arrive.  I will listen to the President of the United States and not attract the Secret Service’s attention by loudly booing, but I have no intention to stand or applaud either.</p>



<p>Alas, getting a seat at Greta’s talk is looking like it will be difficult or impossible.</p>



<p>I was struck by the long runup to Trump’s address: the President of Switzerland gave a searing speech about the existential threats of climate change and ecosystem destruction, and “the politicians in many nations who appeal to fear and bigotry”—never mentioning Trump by name but making clear that she despised the entire ideology of the man people had come to hear.  I thought it was a nice touch.  Then some technicians spent 15 minutes adjusting Trump’s podium, then nothing happened for 20 minutes as we all waited for a tardy Trump, then some traditional Swiss singers did a performance on stage (!), and finally Klaus Schwab, director of the WEF, gave Trump a brief and coldly cordial introduction, joking about the weather in Davos. </p>



<p>And … now Trump is finally speaking.  Once he starts, I suddenly realize that I have no idea what new insight I expected from this.  He’s giving his standard stump speech, America has regained its footing after the disaster of the previous administration, winning like it’s never won before, unemployment is the lowest in recorded history, blah blah blah.  I estimate that less than half of the audience applauded Trump’s entrance; the rest sat in stony silence.  Meanwhile, some people were passing out flyers to the audience documenting all the egregious errors in Trump’s economic statistics.</p>



<p>Given the small and childish nature of the remarks (“we’re the best!  ain’t no one gonna push us around!”), it feels somehow right to be looking down at my phone, blogging, rather than giving my undivided attention to the President of the United States speaking 75 feet in front of me.</p>



<p>Ok, I admit I just looked up, when Trump mentioned America’s commitment to developing new technologies like “5G and quantum computing” (he slowly drew out the word “quantum”).</p>



<p>His whole delivery is strangely lethargic, as if he didn’t sleep well last night (I didn’t either).</p>



<p>Trump announced that the US would be joining the WEF’s “1 trillion trees” environmental initiative, garnering the only applause in his speech.  But he then immediately pivoted to a denunciation of the “doomsayers and pessimists and socialists who want to control our lives and take away our liberty” (he presumably meant people worried about climate change).</p>



<p>Now, I kid you not, Trump is expanding on his “optimism” theme by going on and on about the architectural achievements of Renaissance Florence.</p>



<p>You can watch Trump’s speech for yourself <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/special-address-by-donald-j-trump-president-of-the-united-states-of-america-5e6010c5e7">here</a>.</p>



<p>While I wasn’t able to get in to see Greta Thunberg in person, you can watch her (along with others) <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/averting-a-climate-apocalypse">here</a>.  I learned that her name is pronounced “toon-berg.”</p>


<p><!--EndFragment-->Having now listened to Greta’s remarks, I confess that I disagree with the content of what she says.  She explicitly advocates a sort of purity-based carbon absolutism—demanding that companies and governments immediately implement, not merely <em>net</em> zero emissions (i.e. offsetting their emissions by paying to plant trees and so forth), but zero emissions <em>period.  </em>Since she can’t possibly mean <em>literally</em> zero, I’ll interpret her to mean close to zero.  Even so, it seems to me that the resulting economic upheavals would provoke a massive backlash against whoever tried to enforce such a policy.  Greta also dismisses the idea of technological solutions to climate change, saying that we don’t have time to invent such solutions.  But of course, some of the solutions already exist—a prime example being nuclear power.  And if we no longer have time to nuclearize the world, then to a great extent, that’s the fault of the antinuclear activists—an unbelievable moral and strategic failure that may have doomed our civilization, and for which there’s never been a reckoning.</p>


<p>Despite all my disagreements, <em>if</em> Greta’s strident, uncompromising rhetoric helps push the world toward cutting emissions, then she’ll have to be counted as one of the greatest people who ever lived.  Of course, another possibility is the world’s leaders will applaud her and celebrate her moral courage, while not taking anything beyond token actions.</p>



<h2><a name="jan22">Wednesday January 22</a></h2>



<p>Alas, I’ve come down with a nasty cold (is there any other kind?).  So I’m paring back my participation in the rest of Davos to the stuff that really interests me.  The good news is that my quantum computing sessions are already finished!</p>



<p>This morning, as I sat in the lobby of the Congress Centre checking my email and blowing my nose, I noticed some guy playing a cello nearby.  Dozens were gathered around him — so many that I could barely see the guy, only hear the music.  After he was finished, I worked up the courage to ask someone what the fuss was about.  Turns out that the guy was Yo-Yo Ma.</p>



<p>The Prince Regent of Liechtenstein was explaining to one of my quantum computing colleagues that Liechtenstein does not have much in the way of quantum.</p>



<p>Speaking of princes, I’m now at a cybersecurity session with Shafi Goldwasser and others, at which the attendance might be slightly depressed because it’s up against Prince Charles.  That’s right: Davos is the conference where the heir apparent to the British throne <em>speaks in a parallel session</em>.</p>



<p>I’ve realized these past few days that I’m not very good at schmoozing with powerful people.  On the other hand, it’s possible that my being bad at it is a sort of mental defense mechanism.  The issue is that, the more I became a powerful “thought leader” who unironically used phrases like “Fourth Industrial Revolution” or “disruptive innovation,” the more I used business cards and LinkedIn to expand my network of contacts or checked my social media metrics … well, the less I’d be able to do the research that led to stuff like being invited here in the first place.  I imagine that many Davos regulars started out as nerds like me, and that today, coming to Davos to talk about “disruptive innovation” is a fun kind of semi-retirement.  If so, though, I’m not ready to retire just yet!  I still want to do things that are new enough that they don’t need to be described using multiple synonyms for newness.</p>



<p>Apparently one of the hottest tickets at Davos is a post-Forum Shabbat dinner, which used to be frequented by Shimon Peres, Elie Wiesel, etc.  Alas, not having known about it, I already planned my travel in a way that won’t let me attend it.  I feel a little like the guy in <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/local.theonion.com/local-jew-feels-left-out-of-worldwide-jewish-conspiracy-1819564292/amp">this Onion article</a>.</p>



<p>I had signed up for a session entitled What’s At Stake: The Arctic, featuring Al Gore.  As I waited for them to start letting people in, I suddenly realized that Al Gore was standing right next to me.  However, he was engrossed in conversation with a young woman, and even though I assumed she was just some random fan like I was, I didn’t work up the courage to interrupt them.  Only once the panel had started, with the woman on it two seats from Gore, did I realize that she was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanna_Marin">Sanna Marin</a>, the new Prime Minister of Finland (and at 34, the world’s second-youngest head of state).</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/whats-at-stake-the-arctic">watch the panel here</a>.  Briefly, the Arctic has lost about half of its ice cover, not merely since preindustrial times but since a few decades ago.  And this is not only a problem for polar bears.  It’s increasing the earth’s absorption of sunlight and hence significantly accelerating global warming, and it’s also screwing up weather patterns all across the northern hemisphere.  Of course, the Siberian permafrost is also thawing and releasing greenhouse gases that are even worse than CO2, further accelerating the wonderful feedback loop of doom.</p>



<p>I thought that Gore gave a masterful performance.  He was in total command of the facts—discoursing clearly and at length on the relative roles of CO2, SO2, and methane in the permafrost as well as the economics of oil extraction, less in the manner of thundering (or ‘thunberging’?) prophet than in the manner of an academic savoring all the non-obvious twists as he explains something to a colleague—and his every response to the other panelists was completely on point.</p>



<p>In 2000, there was indeed a bifurcation of the universe, and we ended up in a freakishly horrible branch.  Instead of something close to the best, most fact-driven US president one could conjure in one’s mind, we got something close to the worst, and then, after an 8-year interregnum just to lull us into complacency, we got something even worse than the worst.</p>



<p>The other panelists were good too.  Gail Whiteman (the scientist) had the annoying tic of starting sentence after sentence with “the science says…,” but then did a good job of summarizing what the science <em>does</em> say about the melting of the Arctic and the permafrost.</p>



<p>Alas, rather than trying to talk to Gore, immediately after the session ended, I headed back to my hotel to go to sleep.  Why?  Partly because of my cold.  But partly also because of incident immediately before the panel.  I was sitting in the front row, next to an empty seat, when a woman who wanted to occupy that seat hissed at me that I was “manspreading.”</p>



<p>If, on these narrow seats packed so tightly together that they were basically a bench, my left leg had strayed an inch over the line, I would’ve addressed the situation differently: for example, “oh hello, may I sit here?”  (At which point I would’ve immediately squeezed in.)  Amazingly, the woman didn’t seem to didn’t care that a different woman, the one to my right, <em>kept her pocketbook and other items on the seat next to her throughout the panel</em>, preventing anyone else from using the seat in what was otherwise a packed house.  (Is that “womanspreading”?)</p>



<p>Anyway, the effect of her comment was to transform the way I related to the panel.  I looked around at the audience and thought: “these activists, who came to hear a panel on climate change, are fighting for a better world.  And in their minds, one of the main ways that the world will be better is that it won’t contain sexist, entitled ‘manspreaders’ like me.”</p>



<p>In case any SneerClubbers are reading, I should clarify that I recognize an element of the irrational in these thoughts.  I’m simply reporting, truthfully, that they’re what bubbled up outside the arena of conscious control.  But furthermore, I feel like the fact that my brain works this way might give me some insight into the psychology of Trump support that few Democrats share—so much that I wonder if I could provide useful service as a Democratic political consultant!</p>



<p>I understand the mindset that howls: “better that every tree burn to the ground, every fish get trawled from the ocean, every coastal city get flooded out of existence, than that these sanctimonious hypocrites ‘on the right side of history,’ singing of their own universal compassion even as they build a utopia with no place for me in it, should get to enjoy even a second of smug self-satisfaction.”  I hasten to add that I’ve learned how to <em>override</em> that mindset with a broader, better mindset: I can jump into the abyss, but I can also climb back out, and I can even look down at the abyss from above and report what’s there.  It’s as if I’d captured some virulent strain of Ebola in a microbiology lab of the soul.  And if nearly half of American voters (more in crucial swing states) have gotten infected with that Ebola strain, then maybe my lab work could have some broader interest.</p>



<p>I thought about Scott Minerd, the investor on the panel, who became a punching bag for the other panelists (except for Gore, a politician in a <em>good</em> sense, who went out of his way to find points of agreement).  In his clumsy way, Minerd was making the same point that climate activists themselves correctly make: namely, that the oil companies need to be <em>incentivized</em> (for example, through a carbon tax) to leave reserves in the ground, that we can’t just trust them to do the noble thing and write off their own assets.  But for some reason, Minerd presented himself as a greedy fat-cat, raining on the dreams of the hippies all around him for a carbon-free future, so then that’s how the other panelists duly treated him (except, again, for Gore).</p>



<p>But I looked at the audience, which was cheering attacks on Minerd, and the Ebola in my internal microbiology lab said: “the way these activists see Scott Minerd is not far from how they see Scott Aaronson.  You’ll never be good enough for them.  The people in this room might or might not succeed at saving the world, but in any case they don’t want your help.”</p>



<p>After all, what was the <em>pinnacle</em> of my contribution to saving the world?  It was surely when I was 19, and created a website to defend the practice of NaderTrading (i.e., Ralph Nader supporters in swing states voting for Al Gore, while Gore supporters in safe states pledged to vote Nader on their behalf).  Alas, we failed.  We did help arrange a few thousand swaps, including a few hundred swaps in Florida, but it was 538 too few.  We did too little, too late.</p>



<p>So what would I have talked to Gore about, anyway?  Would I have reminded him of the central tragedy of his life, which was also a central tragedy of recent American history, just in order to babble, or brag, about a NaderTrading website that I made half a lifetime ago?  Would I have made up a post-hoc rationalization for why I work on quantum computing, like that I hope it will lead to the discovery of new carbon-capture methods?  Immediately after Gore’s eloquent brief for the survival of the Arctic and all life on earth, would I have asked him for an autograph or a selfie?  No, better to just reflect on his words.  At a crucial pivot point in history, Gore failed by a mere 538 votes, and I also failed to prevent the failure.  But amazingly, Gore <em>never gave up-</em>–he just kept on fighting for what he knew civilization needed to do—and yesterday I sat a few feet away while he explained why the rest of us shouldn’t give up either.  And he’s right about this—if not in the sense of the outlook being especially hopeful or encouraging right now, then surely in the sense of which attitude is the <em>useful</em> one to adopt.  And my attitude, which you might call “Many-Worlds-inflected despair,” might be epistemically sound but it definitely wasn’t useful.  What further clarifications did I need?</p>



<h2><a name="jan23">Thursday January 23</a></h2>



<p>I attended a panel discussion on quantum computing hosted by IBM.  The participants were Thomas Friedman (the New York Times columnist), Arvind Krishna (a senior Vice President at IBM), Raoul Klingner (director of  a European research organization), and Alison Snyder (the managing editor of Axios magazine).  There were about 100 people in the audience, more than at all of my Davos quantum computing sessions combined.  I sat right in front, although I don’t think anyone on the panel recognized me.</p>



<p>Ginni Rometty, the CEO of IBM, gave an introduction.  She said that quantum will change the world by speeding up supply-chain and other optimization problems.  I assume she was talking about the Grover speedup?  She also said that IBM is committed to delivering value for its customers, rather than “things you can do in two seconds that are not commercially valid” (I assume she meant Google’s supremacy experiment).  She asked for a show of hands of who knows absolutely nothing about the science behind quantum computing.  She then quipped, “well, that’s all of you!”  She may have missed two hands that hadn’t gone up (both belonging to the same person).</p>



<p>I accepted an invitation to this session firstly for the free lunch (which turned out to be delicious), and secondly because I was truly, genuinely curious to hear what Thomas Friedman, many of whose columns I’ve liked, had to teach me about quantum computing.  The answer turns out to be this: in his travels around the world over the past 6 years, Friedman has witnessed firsthand how the old dichotomy between right-wing parties and left-wing parties is breaking down everywhere (I assume he means, as both sides get taken over by populist movements?).  And this is just like how a qubit breaks down the binary dichotomy between 0’s and 1’s!  Also, the way a quantum computer can be in multiple states at once, is like how the US now has to be in multiple states at once in its relationship with China.</p>



<p>Friedman opened his remarks by joking about how he never took a single physics course, and had no idea why he was on a quantum computing panel at all.  He quickly added, though, that he toured IBM’s QC labs, where he found IBM’s leaders to be wonderful explainers of what it all means.</p>



<p>I’ll note that Friedman, the politics and Middle East affairs writer — not the two panelists serving the role of quantum experts — was the only one who mentioned, even in passing, the idea that the advantage of QCs depends on something called “constructive interference.”</p>



<p>Krishna, the IBM Vice President, explained why IBM rejects the entire concept of “quantum supremacy”: because it’s an irrelevant curiosity, and creating value for customers in the marketplace (for example by solving their supply-chain optimization problems) is the only test that matters.  No one on the panel expressed a contrary view.</p>



<p>Later, Krishna explained why quantum computers will never replace classical computers: because if you stored your bank balance on a quantum computer, one day you’d have $1, the next day $1000, the day after that $1 again, and so forth!  He explained how, where current supercomputers use the same amount of energy needed to power all of Davos to train machine learning models, quantum computers would use less than the energy needed to power a single house.  New algorithms do need to be designed to run neural networks quantumly, but fortunately that’s all being done as we speak.</p>



<p>I got the feeling that the businesspeople who came to this session felt like they got a lot more out of it than the businesspeople who came to my and Jeremy O’Brien’s session felt like they got out of ours.  After all, this session got across some big real-world takeaways—e.g., that if you don’t quantum, your business will be left in the dust, stuck with a single value at a time rather than exploring all values in parallel, and IBM can help you rather than your competitors win the quantum race.  It didn’t muddy the message with all the incomprehensible technicalities about how QCs only give exponential speedups for problems with special structure.</p>


<p><strong>Later Update:</strong><!--StartFragment--></p>


<p>Tonight I went to a Davos reception hosted by the government of Canada (<img alt="&#x1F1E8;&#x1F1E6;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1e8-1f1e6.png" style="height: 1em;"/>).  I’m not sure why exactly they invited me, although I have of course enjoyed a couple years of life “up north” (well, in Waterloo, so actually further south than a decent chunk of the US … you see that I do have a tiny speck of a Canadian in me?).</p>



<p>I didn’t recognize a single person at the reception.  So I just ate the food, drank beer, and answered emails.  But then a few people did introduce themselves (two who recognized me, one who didn’t).  As they gathered around, they started asking me questions about quantum computing: is it true that QCs could crack the classically impossible Traveling Salesman Problem?  That they try all possible answers in parallel?  Are they going to go commercial in 2-5 years, or have they already?</p>



<p>It might have been the beer, but for some reason I decided to launch an all-out assault of truth bombs, one after the next, with what they might have considered a somewhat emotional delivery.</p>



<p>OK fine, it wasn’t the beer.  That’s just who I am.</p>



<p>And then, improbably, I was a sort of localized “life of the party” — although possibly for the amusement / novelty value of my rant more than for the manifest truth of my assertions.   One person afterward told me that it was by far the most useful conversation he’d had at Davos.</p>



<p>And I replied: I’m flattered by your surely inflated praise, but in truth I should also thank you.   You caught me at a moment when I’d been thinking to myself that, if only I could make one or two people’s eyes light up with comprehension about the fallacy of a QC simply trying all possible answers in parallel and then magically picking the best one, or about the central role of <em>amplitudes</em> and <em>interference</em>, or about the “merely” quadratic nature of the Grover speedup, or about the specialized nature of the most dramatic known applications for QCs, or about the gap between where the experimentalists are now and what’s needed for error correction and hence true scalability, or about the fact that “quantum supremacy” is obviously not a sufficient condition for a QC to be useful, but it’s equally obviously a <em>necessary</em> condition, or about the fact that doing something “practical” with a QC is of very little interest unless the task in question is <em>actually harder for classical computers</em>, which is a question of great subtlety … I say, if I could make only two or four eyes light up with comprehension of these things, then on that basis alone I could declare that the whole trip to Davos was worth it.</p>



<p>And then one of the people hugged me … and that was the coolest thing that happened to me today.</p>



<h2><a name="jan24">Friday January 24</a></h2>



<p>I attended a second session with Al Gore, about the problem of the world filling up with plastic.  I learned that the world’s plastic waste is set to double over the next 15-20 years, and that a superb solution—indeed, it seems like a crime that it hasn’t been implemented already—-would be to set up garbage booms at the mouths of a few major rivers from which something like 80% of the plastic waste in the ocean gets there.</p>



<p>Anyway, still didn’t introduce myself.</p>



<p>I wrote before about how surprisingly clear and logical the trains to Davos were, even with multiple changes.  Unfortunately God’s mercy on me didn’t last.  All week, I kept getting lost in warren-like buildings with dozens of “secret passageways” (often literally behind unmarked doors) and few signs—not even exit signs.  In one case I missed a tram that was the only way out from somewhere because I arrived to the wrong side of the tram—and getting to the right side required entering a building and navigating another unmarked labyrinth, by which point the tram had already left.  In another case, I wandered through a Davos hotel for almost an hour trying to find an exit, ricocheting like a pinball off person after person giving me conflicting directions.  Only after I literally started ranting to a crowd: ”holy f-ck, is this place some psychological torture labyrinth designed by Franz Kafka?  Am I the only one?  Is it clear to all of you?  Please, WHERE IS THE F-CKING EXIT???” until finally some local took pity and walked me through the maze.  As I mentioned earlier, logistical issues like these made me about 5,000 times more anxious on this trip than the prospect of giving quantum computing talks to the world’s captains of industry.  I don’t recall having had a nightmare about lecturing even once—but I’ve had never-ending nightmares about <em>failing to show up</em> to give a lecture because I’m wandering endlessly through an airport or a research center or whatever, always the only one who’s lost.</p></div>

<h2>A mathematical context (of one corner of the work) and wish list: stability theory for groups.</h2>

<p>And (thanks Mikael de la Salle!) a recent Book by Gilles Pisier:<br/>
<a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~pisier/TPCOS.pdf">Tensor products of <em>C*</em>-algebras and operator spaces; </a><a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~pisier/TPCOS.pdf">The Connes-Kirchberg problem</a></p>
<p>The assertion of Connes’ embedding conjecture refuted in the MIP*=RE paper would imply several (<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/350559/1532">outrageous</a> :)) stronger conjectures that are still open. One is the conjecture of Connes that every group is “hyperlinear.” Another famous conjecture (an affirmative answer to a question posed by Gromov) is  that every group is sofic. As sofic groups are hyperlinear we can now expect (ever more than before) that non-sofic and even non hyperlinear groups will be found. Here is a rough short explanation what these conjectures are about. <del>(Kirchberg’s conjecture, is another group theoretic question of this nature.)</del></p>
<p>Every finite group is a permutation group and is a linear group. This is not the case for infinite groups and there are various interesting notions of “approximately-permutation-group” (this is “sofic”) and “approximately linear” (this is called “hyperlinear”).</p>
<p>Given a group Γ we want to find a sequence of functions <img alt="f_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_n"/></p>
<ol>
<li>From Γ to symmetric groups <img alt="S_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S_n"/>,</li>
<li>or from Γ to the unitary groups <em>U(n).</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Such that asymptotically as <em>n</em> grows these functions are “almost homomorphisms” with respect to certain metrics <em>DIST</em> on <img alt="S_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S_n"/> or <img alt="U(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="U(n)"/> respectively. This means that for every two elements</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="a,b \in \Gamma" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb+%5Cin+%5CGamma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="a,b \in \Gamma"/>,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="DIST( f_n(ab), f_n(a)f_n(b))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=DIST%28+f_n%28ab%29%2C+f_n%28a%29f_n%28b%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="DIST( f_n(ab), f_n(a)f_n(b))"/> tends to zero when <em>n</em> tends to infinity.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sofic group</strong> refers to the normalized Hamming metric for symmetric groups.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperlinear group</strong> refers to metrics given by the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt norm on the unitary groups</li>
<li><strong>MF-groups, </strong>Again the unitary group but the operator norm this time.</li>
</ol>
<p>And there are various other metrics that were also considered. The assertion of the famous embedding conjecture by Connes on von-Neumann algebras (now refuted by the new result) implies that every group is hyperlinear.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">A remaining wish list: Find a non sofic group; find a non-hyperlinear group; <del>refute  Kirchberg’s conjecture (if it was not already refuted)</del>.</span></strong></p>
<h2>Interactive proofs and some computational complexity background.</h2>
<h3>P, NP, IP, MIP</h3>
<p><em>Links: here are slides of  a great talk by Yael Kalai: <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/the-evolution-of-proofs-in-computer-science-yael-kalai.pptx">The evolution of proof in computer science;</a> an a <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2012/09/18/the-evolution-of-proofs/">blog post on this topic</a> by Yael Kalai, and a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/01/06/yael-tauman-kalais-icm2018-paper-my-paper-and-cryptography/">post here</a> about Yael’s 2018 ICM paper and lecture.</em></p>
<p>A decision problem is in P if there is a polynomial time algorithm (in terms of the input size) to test if the answer is yes or no.  A decision problem is in NP if there is a proof for a YES answer that can be verified in a polynomial time.</p>
<p>Here are two examples: The question if  graph has a perfect matching is in P. The question if  graph has an Hamiltonian cycle  is in NP. If the answer is yes a prover can give a proof that requires the verifier a polynomial number of steps to verify.</p>
<p>IP is a complexity class based on a notion of interactive proof where, based on a protocol for questions and answers,  the prover can convince the verifier (with arbitrary high probability) that the answer is yes. Following a sequence of startling developments Adi Shamir proved that IP is quite a large complexity space P-space.  When we consider several non-interacting provers (two provers suffice) the computational power denoted by MIP is even larger: László Babai, Lance Fortnow, and Cartsen Lund proved that MIP=NEXP!  NEXP is the class of decision problems where if the answer is yes a prover can give a proof that requires the verifier (at most) an exponential number of steps to verify.</p>
<h3>Enters quantum computation and entanglement</h3>
<p>We replace the model of classical computation with quantum computation. Each of the two provers, Prover1 and Prover2, have access to separate sets of <em>m</em> qubits but they  can prepare in advance a complicated quantum state on those <em>2m</em> qubits. When we run the verification protocol each prover has access only to its <em>m</em> qubits and, like in the classical case,  the two provers cannot communicate. These types of verification protocols represent the complexity class MIP*.  In 2012 and Tsuyoshi Ito and Thomas Vidick proved that MIP* contains NEXP. In <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/some-updates/">this 2012 post</a> I reported an unusual seminar we ran on the problem.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Interactive quantum lecture:</strong> We had an unususal quantum seminar presentation by Michael Ben-Or on the work <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">A multi-prover interactive proof for NEXP sound against entangled provers</a> by Tsuyoshi Ito and Thomas Vidick. Michael ran Vidick’s videotaped recent talk on the matter and from time to time he and Dorit acted as a pair of prover and the other audience as verifier. (Michael was one of the authors of the very first paper introducing multi-prover interactive proofs.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me mention also a related 2014 paper by Yael Kalai, Ran Raz, and Ron Rothblum: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/delegate-computations-power-no-signaling-proofs/">How to delegate computations: the power of no-signaling proofs.</a> They considered two provers that are limited by the “non-signaling principle” and showed that the power of interactive proofs is exactly EXP . (Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FiroQt6yWc">videotaped lecture</a> by Ran Raz.)</p>
<p>In April 2019, Anand Natarajan and John Wright uploaded a paper with a proof that MIP* contain NEEXP. (NEEXP is the class of decision problems where if the answer is yes a prover can give a proof that requires the verifier (at most) doubly exponential number of steps to verify.)</p>
<p>Here is a nice quote from the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-expand-the-frontier-of-verifiable-knowledge-20190523/">Harnett’s  quanta paper</a> regarding the Natarajan-Wright breakthrough:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some problems are too hard to solve in any reasonable amount of time. But their solutions are easy to check. Given that, computer scientists want to know: How complicated can a problem be while still having a solution that can be verified?</p>
<p>Turns out, the answer is: Almost unimaginably complicated.</p>
<p>In a paper released in April, two computer scientists <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dramatically increased the number of problems</a> that fall into the hard-to-solve-but-easy-to-verify category. They describe a method that makes it possible to check answers to problems of almost incomprehensible complexity. “It seems insane,” said <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thomas Vidick</a>, a computer scientist at the California Institute of Technology who wasn’t involved in the new work.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Now with the new result, I wonder if this bold  philosophical interpretation is sensible:  There is a shared quantum state that will allow two non-interacting provers (with unlimited computational power) to convince  a mathematician if a given mathematical statement has a proof, and also to convince a historian or a futurist about any question regarding the past or future evolution of the universe.</em></p>
<h3>What is RE?</h3>
<p>(I forgot to explain what RE is. Here is the description from the paper itself.)</p>
<p>RE is the class of recursively enumerable languages, i.e. languages <em>L</em> such that there<br/>
exists a Turing machine <em>M</em> such that <em>x ∈ L</em> if and only if <em>M</em> halts and accepts on input <em>x</em>. Note that, in addition to containing all decidable languages, this class also contains undecidable problems such as the Halting problem, which is to decide whether a given Turing machine eventually halts</p>
<h3>A little more information and links</h3>
<p>The negative answer to Tsirelson problem asserts roughly that there are types of correlations  that can be produced by an infinite quantum systems, but that can’t even be approximated by a finite system. Connes’ 1976 embedding conjecture (now refuted) from the theory of von Neumann algebras asserts that “Every  type <img alt="\Pi_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPi_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\Pi_1"/> von Neumann factor embeds in an ultrapower of a hyperfinite <img alt="\Pi_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPi_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\Pi_1"/> factor.”</p>
<p>The abstract of the new paper mentions a few other works that are important for the new proof.</p>

    <title>TR20-004 |  The Power of the Combined Basic LP and Affine Relaxation for Promise CSPs |

	Venkatesan Guruswami,

	Stanislav Zivny</title>
    <summary>In the field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), promise CSPs are an exciting new direction of study. In a promise CSP, each constraint comes in two forms: "strict" and "weak," and in the associated decision problem one must distinguish between being able to satisfy all the strict constraints versus not being able to satisfy all the weak constraints. The most commonly cited example of a promise CSP is the approximate graph coloring problem--which has recently seen exciting progress [BKO19, WZ20] benefiting from a systematic algebraic approach to promise CSPs based on "polymorphisms," operations that map tuples in the strict form of each constraint to tuples in the corresponding weak form.

In this work, we present a simple algorithm which in polynomial time solves the decision problem for all promise CSPs that admit infinitely many symmetric polymorphisms, that is the coordinates are permutation invariant. This generalizes previous work of the first two authors [BG19]. We also extend this algorithm to a more general class of block-symmetric polymorphisms. As a corollary, this single algorithm solves all polynomial-time tractable Boolean CSPs simultaneously. These results give a new perspective on Schaefer's classic dichotomy theorem and shed further light on how symmetries of polymorphisms enable algorithms. Finally, we show that block symmetric polymorphisms are not only sufficient but also necessary for this algorithm to work, thus establishing its precise power.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Scott’s preface:</strong> Imagine that every time you turned your blog over to a certain topic, you got denounced on Twitter and Reddit as a privileged douchebro, entitled STEMlord, counterrevolutionary bourgeoisie, etc. etc.  The sane response would simply be to quit blogging about that topic.  But there’s also an <em>in</em>sane (or masochistic?) response: the response that says, “but if everyone like me stopped talking, we’d cede the field by default to the loudest, angriest voices on all sides—thereby giving those voices exactly what they wanted.  To hell with that!”</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, while I was being attacked for sharing Steven Pinker’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4476">guest post</a> about NIPS vs. NeurIPS, I received a beautiful message of support from a PhD student in physical chemistry and quantum computing named <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/karen-morenz-189310112">Karen Morenz</a>.  Besides her strong words of encouragement, Karen wanted to share with me an <a href="https://medium.com/@kjmorenz/is-it-really-just-sexism-an-alternative-argument-for-why-women-leave-stem-cccdf066d8b1">essay</a> she had written on Medium about why too many women leave STEM.</p>



<p>Karen’s essay, I found, marshaled data, logic, and her own experience in support of an insight that strikes me as true and important and underappreciated—one that dovetails with what I’ve heard from many other women in STEM fields, including my wife <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana</a>.  So I asked Karen for permission to reprint her essay on this blog, and she graciously agreed.</p>



<p>Briefly: anyone with a brain and a soul wants there to be many more women in STEM.  Karen outlines a realistic way to achieve this shared goal.  Crucially, Karen’s way is <em>not</em> about shaming male STEM nerds for their deep-seated misogyny, their arrogant mansplaining, or their gross, creepy, predatory sexual desires.  Yes, you can go the shaming route (God knows it’s being tried).  If you do, you’ll probably snare many guys who really do deserve to be shamed as creeps or misogynists, along with many more who don’t.  Yet for all your efforts, Karen predicts, you’ll no more solve the original problem of too few women in STEM, than arresting the kulaks solved the problem of lifting the masses out of poverty.</p>



<p>For you still won’t have made a dent in the real issue: namely that, the way we’ve set things up, pursuing an academic STEM career demands fanatical devotion, to the exclusion of nearly everything else in life, between the ages of roughly 18 and 35.  And as long as that’s true, Karen says, the majority of talented women are going to look at academic STEM, in light of all the other great options available to them, and say “no thanks.”  Solving this problem might look like more money for maternity leave and childcare.  It might also look like re-imagining the academic career trajectory itself, to make it easier to rejoin it after five or ten years away.  Way back in 2006, I tried to make this point in a blog post called <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=87">Nerdify the world, and the women will follow</a>.  I’m grateful to Karen for making it more cogently than I did.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s Karen’s essay. –SA</p>



<h3><strong>Is it really just sexism?  An alternative argument for why women leave STEM</strong></h3>



<p>by Karen Morenz</p>



<p>Everyone knows that you’re not supposed to start your argument with ‘everyone knows,’ but in this case, I think we ought to make an exception:</p>



<p>Everyone knows that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) has a problem retaining women (see, for example <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283809613_Women_in_STEM_Family-Related_Challenges_and_Initiatives" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Jean, Payne, and Thompson 2015</a>). We pour money into attracting girls and women to STEM fields. We pour money into recruiting women, training women, and addressing sexism, both overt and subconscious. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491652/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">In 2011</a>, the United States spent nearly $3 billion tax dollars on STEM education, of which roughly one third was spent supporting and encouraging underrepresented groups to enter STEM (including women). And yet, women are still leaving at alarming rates.</p>



<p>Alarming? Isn’t that a little, I don’t know, alarmist? Well, <strong>let’s look at some stats.</strong></p>



<p>A recent report by the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0894845313483003" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">National Science Foundation (2011)</a> found that women received 20.3% of the bachelor’s degrees and 18.6% of the PhD degrees in physics in 2008. In chemistry, women earned 49.95% of the bachelor’s degrees but only 36.1% of the doctoral degrees. By comparison, in biology women received 59.8% of the bachelor’s degrees and 50.6% of the doctoral degrees. A <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recent article</a> in Chemical and Engineering News showed a chart based on a survey of life sciences workers by Liftstream and MassBio demonstrating how women are vastly underrepresented in science leadership despite earning degrees at similar rates, which I’ve copied below. The story is the same in academia, as you can see on the <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">second chart</a> — from comparable or even larger number of women at the student level, we move towards a significantly larger proportion of men at the more and more advanced stages of an academic career.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*X0Pt4nHwU9JiVN0RDyb1sQ.png"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/697/1*vx6M8mBvhk0pYtNq3B06fg.png"/></figure>



<p>Although 74% of women in STEM <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">report</a> “loving their work,” half (56%, in fact) leave over the course of their career — largely at the “mid-level” point, when the loss of their talent is most costly as they have just completed training and begun to contribute maximally to the work force.</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01511" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">A study by Dr. Flaherty</a> found that women who obtain faculty position in astronomy spent on average 1 year less than their male counterparts between completing their PhD and obtaining their position — but he concluded that this is because <strong>women leave the field at a rate 3 to 4 times greater than men</strong>, and in particular, if they do not obtain a faculty position quickly, will simply move to another career. So, women and men are hired at about the same rate during the early years of their post docs, but women stop applying to academic positions and drop out of the field as time goes on, pulling down the average time to hiring for women.</p>



<p>There are many more studies to this effect. At this point, <strong>the assertion that women leave STEM at an alarming rate after obtaining PhDs is nothing short of an established fact</strong>. In fact, it’s actually a problem across all academic disciplines, as you can see in <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this matching chart</a> showing the same phenomenon in humanities, social sciences, and education. The phenomenon has been affectionately dubbed the “leaky pipeline.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/571/0*koOEWDCY2BBSvZCN"/></figure>



<p><strong>But hang on a second, maybe there just aren’t enough women qualified for the top levels of STEM? Maybe it’ll all get better in a few years if we just wait around doing nothing?</strong></p>



<p>Nope, sorry. This <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">study</a> says that 41% of highly qualified STEM people are female. And also, it’s clear from the previous charts and stats that a significantly larger number of women are getting PhDs than going on the be professors, in comparison to their male counterparts. <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Laurie Glimcher</a>, when she started her professorship at Harvard University in the early 1980s, remembers seeing very few women in leadership positions. “I thought, ‘Oh, this is really going to change dramatically,’ ” she says. But 30 years later, “it’s not where I expected it to be.” Her experiences are similar to those of other leading female faculty.</p>



<p><strong>So what gives? Why are all the STEM women leaving?</strong></p>



<p>It is widely believed that sexism is the leading problem. A quick google search of “sexism in STEM” will turn up a veritable cornucopia of articles to that effect. And indeed, around 60% of women report experiencing some form of sexism in the last year (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361684315596162" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Robnett 2016</a>). So, that’s clearly not good.</p>



<p>And yet, if you ask leading women researchers like Nobel Laureate in Physics 2018, Professor Donna Strickland, or Canada Research Chair in Advanced Functional Materials (Chemistry), Professor Eugenia Kumacheva, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p06mrmnt" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">they</a> <a href="https://www.intermissionmagazine.ca/features/the-scientist-and-the-artist-conversations-with-eugenia-kumacheva-and-fiona-reid/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">say</a> that sexism was not a barrier in their careers. Moreover, extensive research has shown that sexism has overall decreased since Professors Strickland and Kumacheva (for example) were starting their careers. Even more interestingly, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361684315596162" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Rachael Robnett showed</a> that more mathematical fields such as Physics have a greater problem with sexism than less mathematical fields, such as Chemistry, a finding which rings true with the subjective experience of many women I know in Chemistry and Physics. However, as we saw above, women leave the field of Chemistry in greater proportions following their BSc than they leave Physics. On top of that, although 22% of women <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">report</a> experiencing sexual harassment at work, the proportion is the same among STEM and non-STEM careers, and yet women leave STEM careers at a much higher rate than non-STEM careers.</p>



<p>So,it seems that<strong> sexism can not fully explain why women with STEM PhDs are leaving STEM</strong>. At the point when women have earned a PhD, for the most part they have already survived the worst of the sexism. They’ve already proven themselves to be generally thick-skinned and, as anyone with a PhD can attest, very stubborn in the face of overwhelming difficulties. Sexism is frustrating, and it can limit advancement, but it doesn’t fully explain why we have so many women obtaining PhDs in STEM, and then leaving. In fact, at least in the U of T chemistry department, faculty hires are directly proportional to the applicant pool —although the exact number of applicants are not made public, from public information we can see that approximately one in four interview invitees are women, and approximately one in four hires are women. Our hiring committees have received bias training, and it seems that it has been largely successful. That’s not to say that we’re done, but it’s time to start looking elsewhere to explain why there are so few women sticking around.</p>



<p><strong>So why don’t more women apply?</strong></p>



<p>Well, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/14/many-women-in-stem-fields-expect-to-quit-within-five-years-survey-finds" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one truly brilliant researcher</a> had the groundbreaking idea of asking women why they left the field. When you ask women why they left, the number one reason they cite is<strong> balancing work/life responsibilities</strong> — which as far as I can tell is a euphemism for family concerns.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The</a> <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">research</a> <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">is in</a> <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this</a>. Women who stay in academia expect to marry later, and delay or completely forego having children, and if they do have children, plan to have fewer than their non-STEM counterparts (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sassler et al 2016</a>, <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Owens 2012</a>). Men in STEM have no such difference compared to their non-STEM counterparts; they marry and have children about the same ages and rates as their non-STEM counterparts (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sassler et al 2016</a>). Women leave STEM in droves in their early to mid thirties (<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Funk and Parker 2018</a>) — the time when women’s fertility begins to decrease, and risks of childbirth complications begin to skyrocket for both mother and child. Men don’t see an effect on their fertility until their mid forties. Of the 56% of women who leave STEM, 50% wind up self-employed or using their training in a not for profit or government, 30% leave to a non-STEM more ‘family friendly’ career, and 20% leave to be stay-at-home moms (<a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ashcraft and Blithe 2002</a>). Meanwhile, institutions with better childcare and maternity leave policies have twice(!) the number of female faculty in STEM (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/21/better-maternity-leave-could-help-universities-retain-women-study" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Troeger 2018</a>). In analogy to the affectionately named “leaky pipeline,” the challenge of balancing motherhood and career has been titled the “maternal wall.”</p>



<p><strong>To understand the so-called maternal wall better, let’s take a quick look at the sketch of a typical academic career.</strong></p>



<p>For the sake of this exercise, let’s all pretend to be me. I’m a talented 25 year old PhD candidate studying Physical Chemistry — I use laser spectroscopy to try to understand atypical energy transfer processes in innovative materials that I hope will one day be used to make vastly more efficient solar panels. I got my BSc in Chemistry and Mathematics at the age of 22, and have published 4 scientific papers in two different fields already (Astrophysics and Environmental Chemistry). I’ve got a big scholarship, and a lot of people supporting me to give me the best shot at an academic career — a career I dearly want. But, I also want a family — maybe two or three kids. Here’s what I can expect if I pursue an academic career:</p>



<p>With any luck, 2–3 years from now I’ll graduate with a PhD, at the age of 27. Academics are expected to travel a lot, and to move a lot, especially in their 20s and early 30s — all of the key childbearing years. I’m planning to go on exchange next year, and then the year after that I’ll need to work hard to wrap up research, write a thesis, and travel to several conferences to showcase my work. After I finish my PhD, I’ll need to undertake one or two post doctoral fellowships, lasting one or two years each, probably in completely different places. During that time, I’ll start to apply for professorships. In order to do this, I’ll travel around to conferences to advertise my work and to meet important leaders in my field, and then, if I am invited for interviews, I’ll travel around to different universities for two or three days at a time to undertake these interviews. This usually occurs in a person’s early 30s — our helpful astronomy guy, Dr. Flaherty, found the average time to hiring was 5 years, so let’s say I’m 32 at this point. If offered a position, I’ll spend the next year or two renovating and building a lab, buying equipment, recruiting talented graduate students, and designing and teaching courses. People work really, really hard during this time and have essentially no leisure time. Now I’m 34. Within usually 5 years I’ll need to apply for tenure. This means that by the time I’m 36, I’ll need to be making significant contributions in my field, and then in the final year before applying for tenure, I will once more need to travel to many conferences to promote my work, in order to secure tenure — if I fail to do so, my position at the university would probably be terminated. <strong>Although many universities offer a “tenure extension” in cases where an assistant professor has had a child, this does not solve all of the problems. </strong>Taking a year off during that critical 5 or 6 year period often means that the research “goes bad” — students flounder, projects that were promising get “scooped” by competitors at other institutions, and sometimes, in biology and chemistry especially, experiments literally go bad. You wind up needing to rebuild much more than just a year’s worth of effort.</p>



<p>At no point during this time do I appear stable enough, career-wise, to take even six months off to be pregnant and care for a newborn. Hypothetical future-me is travelling around, or even moving, conducting and promoting my own independent research and training students. As you’re likely aware, very pregnant people and newborns don’t travel well. And academia has a very individualistic and meritocratic culture. Starting at the graduate level, huge emphasis is based on independent research, and independent contributions, rather than valuing team efforts. This feature of academia is both a blessing and a curse. The individualistic culture means that people have the independence and the freedom to pursue whatever research interests them — in fact this is the main draw for me personally. But it also means that there is often no one to fall back on when you need extra support, and because of biological constraints, this winds up impacting women more than men.</p>



<p>At this point, I need to make sure that you’re aware of some basics of female reproductive biology. According to Wikipedia, the unquestionable source of all reliable knowledge, at age 25, my risk of conceiving a baby with chromosomal abnormalities (including Down’s Syndrome) is 1 in about 1400. By 35, that risk more than quadruples to 1 in 340. At 30, I have a 75% chance of a successful birth in one year, but by 35 it has dropped to 66%, and by 40 it’s down to 44%. Meanwhile, 87 to 94% of women report at least 1 health problem immediately after birth, and 1.5% of mothers have a severe health problem, while 31% have long-term persistent health problems as a result of pregnancy (defined as lasting more than six months after delivery). Furthermore, mothers over the age of 35 are at higher risk for pregnancy complications like preterm delivery, hypertension, superimposed preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418963/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cavazos-Rehg et al 2016</a>). Because of factors like these, pregnancies in women over 35 are known as “geriatric pregnancies” due to the drastically increased risk of complications. This tight timeline for births is often called the “biological clock” — if women want a family, they basically need to start before 35. Now, that’s not to say it’s impossible to have a child later on, and in fact some studies show that it has positive impacts on the child’s mental health. But it is riskier.</p>

<p>So, women with a PhD in STEM know that they have the capability to make interesting contributions to STEM, and to make plenty of money doing it. They usually marry someone who also has or expects to make a high salary as well. But this isn’t the only consideration. Such highly educated women are usually aware of the biological clock and the risks associated with pregnancy, and are confident in their understanding of statistical risks.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ria.ie/sites/default/files/report_final_version-1_0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Irish</a> say, “The common challenge facing young women is achieving a satisfactory work-life balance, especially when children are small. From a career perspective, this period of parenthood (which after all is relatively short compared to an entire working life) tends to coincide exactly with the critical point at which an individual’s career may or may not take off. […] All the evidence shows that it is at this point that women either drop out of the workforce altogether, switch to part-time working or move to more family-friendly jobs, which may be less demanding and which do not always utilise their full skillset.”</p>



<p>And in the <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Netherlands</a>, “The research project in Tilburg also showed that women academics have more often no children or fewer children than women outside academia.” Meanwhile in <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Italy</a> “On a personal level, the data show that for a significant number of women there is a trade-off between family and work: a large share of female economists in Italy do not live with a partner and do not have children”</p>



<p>Most jobs available to women with STEM PhDs offer greater stability and a larger salary earlier in the career. Moreover, most non-academic careers have less emphasis on independent research, meaning that employees usually work within the scope of a larger team, and so if a person has to take some time off, there are others who can help cover their workload. <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>By and large</strong></a><strong>, women leave to go to a career where they will be stable, well funded, and well supported, even if it doesn’t fulfill their passion for STEM — or they leave to be stay-at-home moms or self-employed.</strong></p>



<p>I would presume that if we made academia a more feasible place for a woman with a family to work, we could keep almost all of those 20% of leavers who leave to just stay at home, almost all of the 30% who leave to self-employment, and all of those 30% who leave to more family friendly careers (after all, if academia were made to be as family friendly as other careers, there would be no incentive to leave). Of course, there is nothing wrong with being a stay at home parent — it’s an admirable choice and contributes greatly to our society. <a href="https://www.salary.com/articles/stay-at-home-mom/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">One estimate</a> valued the equivalent salary benefit of stay-at-home parenthood at about $160,000/year. <a href="https://www.ssb.no/forskning/discussion-papers/_attachment/113165?_ts=13ea1e1e480" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Moreover</a>, children with a stay-at-home parent show long term benefits such as better school performance — something that most academic women would want for their children. <strong>But a lot of people only choose it out of necessity — about half of stay-at-home moms would prefer to be working </strong>(<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-017-9534-7" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ciciolla, Curlee, &amp; Luthar 2017</a>). When the reality is that your salary is barely more than the cost of daycare, then a lot of people wind up giving up and staying home with their kids rather than paying for daycare. In a heterosexual couple it will usually be the woman that winds up staying home since she is the one who needs to do things like breast feed anyways. And so we lose these women from the workforce.</p>



<p>And yet, somehow, during this informal research adventure of mine, most scholars and policy makers seem to be advising that we try to encourage young girls to be interested in STEM, and to address sexism in the workplace, with the implication that this will fix the high attrition rate in STEM women. But from what I’ve found, <strong>the stats don’t back up sexism as the main reason women leave</strong>. There is sexism, and that is a problem, and women do leave STEM because of it — but it’s a problem that we’re already dealing with pretty successfully, and it’s not why the majority of women who have already obtained STEM PhDs opt to leave the field. The whole family planning thing is huge and for some reason, almost totally swept under the rug — mostly because we’re too shy to talk about it, I think.</p>



<p>In fact, I think that the plethora of articles suggesting that the problem is sexism actually contribute to our unwillingness to talk about the family planning problem, because it reinforces the perception that that men in power will not hire a woman for fear that she’ll get pregnant and take time off. <strong>Why would anyone talk about how they want to have a family when they keep hearing that even the mere suggestion of such a thing will limit their chances of being hired?</strong> I personally know women who have avoided bringing up the topic with colleagues or supervisors for fear of professional repercussions. So we spend all this time and energy talking about how sexism is really bad, and very little time trying to address the family planning challenge, because, I guess, as the stats show, if women are serious enough about science then they just give up on the family (except for the really, really exceptional ones who can handle the stresses of both simultaneously).</p>



<p>To be very clear, I’m not saying that sexism is not a problem. What I am saying is that, thanks to the sustained efforts of a large number of people over a long period of time, we’ve reduced the sexism problem to the point where, at least at the graduate level, it is no longer the largest major barrier to women’s advancement in STEM. <strong>Hurray! </strong>That does not mean that we should stop paying attention to the issue of sexism, but does mean that <strong>it’s time to start paying more attention to other issues</strong>, like how to properly support women who want to raise a family while also maintaining a career in STEM.</p>



<p><strong>So what can we do to better support STEM women who want families?</strong></p>



<p>A couple of solutions have been tentatively tested. From a study mentioned above, it’s clear that <strong>providing free and conveniently located childcare makes a colossal difference to women’s choices of whether or not to stay in STEM</strong>, alongside extended and paid maternity leave. <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Another</a> popular and successful strategy was implemented by a leading woman in STEM, Laurie Glimcher, a past Harvard Professor in Immunology and now CEO of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. While working at NIH, <strong>Dr. Glimcher designed a program to provide primary caregivers (usually women) with an assistant or lab technician to help manage their laboratories while they cared for children</strong>. Now, at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, she has created a similar program to pay for a technician or postdoctoral researcher for assistant professors. In the academic setting, Dr. Glimcher’s strategies are key for helping to alleviate the challenges associated with the individualistic culture of academia without compromising women’s research and leadership potential.</p>



<p>For me personally, I’m in the ideal situation for an academic woman. I graduated my BSc with high honours in four years, and with many awards. I’ve already had success in research and have published several peer reviewed papers. I’ve faced some mild sexism from peers and a couple of TAs, but nothing that’s seriously held me back. My supervisors have all been extremely supportive and feminist, and all of the people that I work with on a daily basis are equally wonderful. Despite all of this support, I’m looking at the timelines of an academic career, and the time constraints of female reproduction, and honestly, I don’t see how I can feasible expect to stay in academia and have the family life I want. And since I’m in the privileged position of being surrounded by supportive and feminist colleagues, I can say it: I’m considering leaving academia, if something doesn’t change, because even though I love it, I don’t see how it can fit in to my family plans.</p>



<p><strong>But wait! All of these interventions are really expensive. Money doesn’t just grow on trees, you know!</strong></p>



<p>It doesn’t in general, but in this case it kind of does — well, actually, we already grew it. We spend billions of dollars training women in STEM. By not making full use of their skills, if we look at only the american economy, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0894845318784745" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">we are wasting about $1.5 billion USD per year</a> in economic benefits they would have produced if they stayed in STEM. So here’s a business proposal: let’s spend half of that on better family support and scientific assistants for primary caregivers, and keep the other half in profit. Heck, let’s spend 99% — $1.485 billion (in the states alone) on better support. That should put a dent in the support bill, and I’d sure pick up $15 million if I saw it lying around. Wouldn’t you?</p>



<p>By demonstrating that we will support women in STEM who choose to have a family, we will encourage more women with PhDs to apply for the academic positions that they are eminently qualified for. Our institutions will benefit from the wider applicant pool, and our whole society will benefit from having the skills of these highly trained and intelligent women put to use innovating new solutions to our modern day challenges.</p></div>
