    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dong Yeap Kang, Tom Kelly, Daniela Kühn, Abhishek Methuku, and Deryk Osthus have just uploaded a paper to the arXive, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04698">A proof of the Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture</a>. (I am thankful to Nati Linial and Ryan <span class="qu"><span class="gD">Alweiss for telling me about it.)</span></span></p>
<p>Here is one formulation of the conjecture:</p>
<p><strong>Erdős-Faber-Lovász Conjecture:</strong> Let <img alt="F" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="F"/> be a family of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-subsets of <img alt="\{1,2,\dots,n\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2Cn%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\{1,2,\dots,n\}"/>. Suppose that every two sets in <img alt="F" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="F"/> have at most one element in common, then <img alt="F" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="F"/> can be divided into at most <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> families so that every two sets in each of these families are disjoint.</p>
<p>Using some standard hypergraph jargon the conjecture can be stated as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Erdős-Faber-Lovász Conjecture: </strong>The chromatic index of any linear hypergraph on <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> vertices is at most <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/>.</p>
<p>Here a linear hypergraph is a hypergraph where every two edges share at most one vertex. The chromatic index of a hypergraph is the number of colors needed to color the edges so that  every two intersecting edges have distinct colors.</p>
<p>The new result asserts</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>  (Kang, Kelly, Kühn, Methuku, and Osthus): For every sufficiently large <em>n</em>, every linear hypergraph <em>H</em> on <em>n</em> vertices has chromatic index at most <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>A stability versions of this result, which confirm a prediction of Jeff Kahn, is also provided. Of course, it will be interesting to settle the conjecture for all values of n.</p>
<p>This is an amazing breakthrough! Congratulations!</p>

<h2>A little more</h2>
<p>Background and links: Here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Faber%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_conjecture">Wikipedea</a> article. We mentioned the conjecture in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/around-borsuks-conjecture-1-some-problems/">this post</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/around-borsuks-conjecture-3-how-to-save-borsuks-conjecture/">this one</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Matching and Fractional version</strong>. In 1982 Paul Seymour proved that any linear hypergraph <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="H"/> has a matching of size <img alt="e(H)/n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%28H%29%2Fn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="e(H)/n"/>. In 1992 Jeff Kahn and Paul Seymour proved that the fractional chromatic index of any linear hypergraph on <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> vertices is at most <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/>.</p>
<p><strong>Approximate version via the semi random method.</strong> In 1992 Jeff Kahn proved that chromatic index of any linear hypergraph on <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> vertices is at most <img alt="n(1+o(1))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%281%2Bo%281%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n(1+o(1))"/>. Kahn used the Rödl nibble (aka semi-random) method. Kahn extended the result to list-coloring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/jeffk.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20960" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/jeffk.png?w=640"/></a></h3>
<h3>Open problems</h3>
<p>There are many related open questions and some are mentioned in the paper. It will be interesting to prove EFL conjecture for all values of <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/>. EFL-conjecture extends to  beautiful generalization of Vizing’s theorem which is still open. Also the EFL-conjecture for <em>list coloring </em>is still open<em>. </em>See also this 1994 article by Jeff Kahn on <a href="http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1994.2/Main/icm1994.2.1353.1362.ocr.pdf">Hypergraphs matching, covering and coloring problems</a>.</p>
<p>Another interesting problem is:</p>
<p><strong>The restricted Larman’s conjecture:</strong> Let <img alt="F" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="F"/> be an intersecting family of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-subsets of <img alt="\{1,2,\dots,n\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2Cn%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\{1,2,\dots,n\}"/>.  Then <img alt="F" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="F"/> can be divided into at most <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> families so that every two sets in each of these families have at least <img alt="2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="2"/> elements in common.</p>

solutions to three fundamental combinatorial problems, two from the theory of
matroids and the third from graph theory. The input to the Weighted Diverse
Bases problem consists of a matroid $M$, a weight function
$\omega:E(M)\to\mathbb{N}$, and integers $k\geq 1, d\geq 0$. The task is to
decide if there is a collection of $k$ bases $B_{1}, \dotsc, B_{k}$ of $M$ such
that the weight of the symmetric difference of any pair of these bases is at
least $d$. This is a diverse variant of the classical matroid base packing
problem. The input to the Weighted Diverse Common Independent Sets problem
consists of two matroids $M_{1},M_{2}$ defined on the same ground set $E$, a
weight function $\omega:E\to\mathbb{N}$, and integers $k\geq 1, d\geq 0$. The
task is to decide if there is a collection of $k$ common independent sets
$I_{1}, \dotsc, I_{k}$ of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ such that the weight of the
symmetric difference of any pair of these sets is at least $d$. This is
motivated by the classical weighted matroid intersection problem. The input to
the Diverse Perfect Matchings problem consists of a graph $G$ and integers
$k\geq 1, d\geq 0$. The task is to decide if $G$ contains $k$ perfect matchings
$M_{1},\dotsc,M_{k}$ such that the symmetric difference of any two of these
matchings is at least $d$.
</p>
<p>We show that Weighted Diverse Bases and Weighted Diverse Common Independent
Sets are both NP-hard, and derive fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms
for all three problems with $(k,d)$ as the parameter.

    <title>Lattice reduction by cubification</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1610496000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Cyril Cayron <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04500">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Lattice reduction is a NP-hard problem well known in computer science and
cryptography. The Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) algorithm based on the
calculation of orthogonal Gram-Schmidt (GS) bases is efficient and gives a good
solution in polynomial time. Here, we present a new approach called
cubification that does not require the calculation of the GS bases. It relies
on complementary directional and hyperplanar reductions. The deviation from
cubicity at each step of the reduction process is evaluated by a parameter
called lattice rhombicity, which is simply the sum of the absolute values of
the metric tensor. Cubification seems to equal LLL; it even outperforms it in
the reduction of columnar matrices. We wrote a Python program that is ten times
faster than a reference Python LLL code. This work may open new perspectives
for lattice reduction and may have implications and applications beyond
crystallography.

two-sided preferences. Each agent has to be assigned to at most one program and
each program can accommodate multiple agents. However unlike the standard
setting of school choice, we do not have fixed upper quotas with programs as an
input -- instead we abstract it as a cost associated with every program. This
setting enables the programs to control the number of agents assigned to them
and is also applicable in the two-round setting (Gajulapalli et al., FSTTCS
2020) where largest stable extension is computed.
</p>
<p>In this setting, our goal is to compute a min-cost stable matching that
matches all the agents. We show that the problem is NP-hard even under very
severe restrictions on the instance. We complement our negative results by
presenting approximation algorithms for general case and a fast exponential
algorithm for a special case.

linearly embedded graphs. We present an algorithm that learns the abstract
structure of an embedded graph and models the specific embedding from a point
cloud sampled from it. We use tools and inspiration from computational
geometry, algebraic topology, and topological data analysis and prove the
correctness of the identified abstract structure under assumptions on the
embedding. The algorithm is implemented in the Julia package

simulations in this paper.

    <title>Locality Sensitive Hashing for Efficient Similar Polygon Retrieval</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1610496000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kaplan:Haim.html">Haim Kaplan</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Tenenbaum:Jay.html">Jay Tenenbaum</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04339">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is an effective method of indexing a set of
items to support efficient nearest neighbors queries in high-dimensional
spaces. The basic idea of LSH is that similar items should produce hash
collisions with higher probability than dissimilar items.
</p>
<p>We study LSH for (not necessarily convex) polygons, and use it to give
efficient data structures for similar shape retrieval. Arkin et al. represent
polygons by their "turning function" - a function which follows the angle
between the polygon's tangent and the $ x $-axis while traversing the perimeter
of the polygon. They define the distance between polygons to be variations of
the $ L_p $ (for $p=1,2$) distance between their turning functions. This metric
is invariant under translation, rotation and scaling (and the selection of the
initial point on the perimeter) and therefore models well the intuitive notion
of shape resemblance.
</p>
<p>We develop and analyze LSH near neighbor data structures for several
variations of the $ L_p $ distance for functions (for $p=1,2$). By applying our
schemes to the turning functions of a collection of polygons we obtain
efficient near neighbor LSH-based structures for polygons. To tune our
structures to turning functions of polygons, we prove some new properties of
these turning functions that may be of independent interest.
</p>
<p>As part of our analysis, we address the following problem which is of
independent interest. Find the vertical translation of a function $ f $ that is
closest in $ L_1 $ distance to a function $ g $. We prove tight bounds on the
approximation guarantee obtained by the translation which is equal to the
difference between the averages of $ g $ and $ f $.

    <title>Automated 3D solid reconstruction from 2D CAD using OpenCV</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1610496000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Ajay Bangalore Harish, Abhishek Rajendra Prasad <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04248">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>This work demonstrates the application of OpenCV towards feature extraction
from 2D engineering drawings. The extracted features are used in the
reconstruction of 3D CAD models in SCAD format and generation of 3D point cloud
data that is equivalent to LIDAR scan data. Several legacy designs in
mechanical and aerospace engineering are available as engineering drawings
rather than software generated CAD models. Even in civil engineering, many of
the earlier plans are available as drawings rather than BIM/CAD models. The
methods proposed in this work can help convert such drawings easily into 3D CAD
and BIM models using camera capture or scanned drawing data. The method
demonstrates the applicability for simple shapes and does not yet account for
the presence of hidden lines in CAD drawings. The developed codes are made
available as python Jupyter notebooks through Github.

is generated by a non-stochastic adversary rather than perturbed by random

adversarial sequence of integers, $x_1, x_2, \dots$, in a model where each
number $x_t$ can only be accessed through a single threshold query of the form
${1(x_t \leq q_t)}$. In this online comparison feedback model, we explore
estimation of general sample statistics, providing robust algorithms for
median, CDF, and mean estimation with nearly matching lower bounds. We conclude
with several high-dimensional generalizations.

    <title>TR21-005 |  Robust testing of low-dimensional functions | 

	Anindya De, 

	Elchanan Mossel, 

	Joe Neeman</title>
    <summary>A natural problem in high-dimensional inference is to decide if a classifier $f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \{-1,1\}$ depends on a small number of linear directions of its input data. Call a function $g: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \{-1,1\}$, a linear $k$-junta if it is completely determined by some $k$-dimensional subspace of the input space. A recent work of the authors showed that linear $k$-juntas are testable. Thus there exists an algorithm to distinguish between: 
1. $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \{-1,1\}$ which is a linear $k$-junta with surface area $s$, 
2. $f$ is $\epsilon$-far from any linear $k$-junta with surface area $(1+\epsilon)s$, where the query complexity of the algorithm is independent of the ambient dimension $n$.
  Following the surge of interest in noise-tolerant property testing, in this paper we prove a noise-tolerant (or robust) version of this result. Namely, we give an algorithm which given any $c&gt;0$, $\epsilon&gt;0$, distinguishes between 
1. $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \{-1,1\}$ has correlation at least $c$ with some linear $k$-junta with surface area $s$. 
2. $f$ has correlation at most $c-\epsilon$ with any linear $k$-junta with surface area at most $s$. The query complexity of our tester is $k^{\mathrm{poly}(s/\epsilon)}$.

  Using our techniques, we also obtain a fully noise tolerant tester with the same query complexity for any class $\mathcal{C}$ of linear $k$-juntas with surface area bounded by $s$. As a consequence, we obtain a fully noise tolerant tester with query complexity $k^{O(\mathrm{poly}(\log k/\epsilon))}$ for the class of intersection of $k$-halfspaces (for constant $k$) over the Gaussian space. Our query complexity is independent of the ambient dimension $n$. Previously, no non-trivial noise tolerant testers were known even for a single halfspace.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="http://ec21.sigecom.org/">The EC 2021 conference</a> invites proposals for tutorials and workshops to be held in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (ACM EC). EC’21 will be held either virtually or in a hybrid format. In the latter case, tutorial/workshop organizers will have the opportunity to decide whether to hold their event in person or remotely.</p>



<h3>Tutorials</h3>



<p>Tutorials provide an opportunity to educate the community about emerging topics of interest, or about topics from related fields that merit additional attention from the EC community.  A tutorial is an opportunity to invite colleagues and young researchers to get excited about a well-defined topic, to prepare them to dive into the literature and to guide them to the most exciting developments and open problems. Typically, tutorials run for half a day (3-3.5 hours) and consist of a series of presentations by experts in the field.</p>



<p>Tutorial proposals should contain:</p>



<ul><li>the title of the tutorial</li><li>the names, contact information, and short biographies of the organizers</li><li>a description of the tutorial theme</li><li>the organization/format of the tutorial</li><li>any related tutorials that have been run</li><li>required facilities for the tutorial</li></ul>



<p>Tutorial proposals should be emailed to <a href="mailto:ec21-tutorial-chairs@acm.org" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ec21-tutorial-chairs@acm.org</a>.</p>



<h3>Workshops</h3>



<p>Workshops provide an opportunity to bring together researchers to discuss emerging areas of research in an informal forum. Workshop schedules should be designed to promote discussion and debate. A workshop may include invited talks, contributed talks, panel discussions, poster sessions, open problem sessions, presentations of work in progress, or any other activities that stimulate new ideas for research. It is up to the workshop organizers to determine the format and technical content of each workshop and to solicit contributions, but we encourage workshops that devote some time to contributed content.</p>



<p>Workshop proposals should contain:</p>



<ul><li>the title of the workshop</li><li>the names, contact information, and short biographies of the organizers</li><li>the names of confirmed or candidate participants</li><li>a description of the workshop theme</li><li>the reviewing process for participants</li><li>the organization/format of the workshop</li><li>any previous versions of the workshop</li><li>required facilities for the workshop</li><li>the desired workshop length (half-day, full day, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>For accepted workshops, the desired length will be honored as closely as possible.</p>



<p>We especially encourage proposals that bring together participants with diverse backgrounds and experience.</p>



<p>Workshop proposals should be emailed to <a href="mailto:ec21-workshop-chairs@acm.org" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ec21-workshop-chairs@acm.org</a>.</p>



<h3>Key dates:</h3>



<p>March 1, 2021: Due date for submitting workshop or tutorial proposal</p>



<p>March 22, 2021: Tutorial &amp; workshop proposal accept/reject notifications</p>



<p>July 19, 2021: Conference Tutorials</p>



<p>July 20-22, 2021: Conference technical program</p>



<p>July 23, 2021: Conference Workshops</p>



<h3>Tutorial co-chairs</h3>



<p>Shengwu Li, Harvard University</p>



<p>Sigal Oren, Ben-Gurion University</p>



<h3>Workshop co-chairs</h3>



<p>Hu Fu, University of British Columbia</p>



<p>Annie Liang, Northwestern University</p>

    <title>The ACM History Committee call for proposals looks wrong</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> In November I (and prob everyone in the ACM) got an email that was a call for proposal from the ACM History committee. <a href="https://history.acm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ACM-fellowship_CFP_2021-final-1.pdf">Here</a> is a pointer to it. </p><p>One of the passages in it just seems wrong to me:</p><p><i>This fellowship program is designed to support research and/or curatorial projects related to ACM's professional and educational activities and/or to ACM's rich institutional history including its organization, SIG activities, and conferences. </i></p><p>I will give  examples of history projects that are interesting but do not fit the description. I challenge you to give me a history project that is interesting that does fit the bill. </p><p>1) Compare and contrast how NP-completeness developed in America and in the USSR. For the USSR side it would be an expansion of  Trakhtenbrot's article <a href="https://drdoane.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/survey_of_russian_approaches_to_perebor.pdf">here</a>. OH, no good, Leonid Levin was not a member of the ACM.</p><p>2) Measure how various CS fields have changed by looking at the topics on the CALL FOR PAPERS for a conference. This would be a MASSIVE expansion of my blog post on how CCC call for papers, changed , see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/05/how-has-structures-oh-i-mean-ccc.html">here</a>. OH, I could only do ACM conferences. STOC but not FOCS. Okay, it makes perfect sense to study only ACM conference. Oh wait. IT MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.</p><p>3) When did mathematicians begin looking at P vs NP seriously? (e.g.,  In  The Handbook of Mathematical Logic from 1977 only one article mentions P vs NP: Michael Rabin's article on Decidable theories mentioned that even decidable theories may take a long time to decide and noted the importance of the P vs NP problem). How did MATH and CS  interact early on and now? This would need  one to look at math journals. How many of those are ACM? I would guess very few. </p><p>4) When did engineers begin looking at P vs NP seriously, or even notice it? Same issue as the last item. </p><p>5) Looking at how Programming lang design has changed one would have to only look at conference and journals that were ACM. And for those that were ACM but then dropped ACM you might only be able to use them up to the cutoff year. </p><p>6) Which academic studies eventually lead to practical products people can use? This is a really broad topic so one could narrow it down to just academic studies that appeared in ACM journals or conferences. Is that a good way to narrow the focus? Spoiler alert: NO.</p><p>7) I recently filled out a survey about the future of theory and if it is insular (the topic of another post surely). Most of the questions were about ``STOC-FOCS'' The people who did the survey clearly do not care that one is ACM and one is IEEE. Does anyone? I ask non-rhetorically. </p><p>Despite the capitol letters, I am not so much mad as puzzled. So I ask non-rhetorically: </p><p>Q1) Did the ACM really mean for people to do history in a way where you can only use ACM materials? </p><p>Q2) If no then please rewrite the Call for Proposals. </p><p>Q3) If yes then give examples of studies that would be interesting. </p><p>I am not asking to be snarky, I really want to know. And I note that <i>interesting</i> is subjective. </p><p>(ADDED LATER- two historians who have worked with this kind of history left comments that indicate the grant is FINE with non-ACM stuff, so Q1 above seems to have the answer NO. Given that they should rewrite the call for proposal next time they do this. ALSO- the historians left pointers to VERY INTERESTING papers they wrote.) </p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR21-004 |  Junta Distance Approximation with Sub-Exponential Queries | 

	Vishnu Iyer, 

	Avishay Tal, 

	Michael Whitmeyer</title>
    <summary>Leveraging tools of De, Mossel, and Neeman [FOCS, 2019], we show two different results pertaining to the tolerant testing of juntas. Given black-box access to a Boolean function $f:\{\pm1\}^{n} \to \{\pm1\}$ we give a poly$(k, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query algorithm that distinguishes between functions that are $\gamma$-close to $k$-juntas and $(\gamma+\varepsilon)$-far from $k'$-juntas, where $k' = O(\frac{k}{\varepsilon^2})$. In the non-relaxed setting, we extend our ideas to give a  $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k}/\varepsilon)}$ (adaptive) query algorithm that distinguishes between functions that are $\gamma$-close to $k$-juntas and $(\gamma+\varepsilon)$-far from $k$-juntas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first subexponential-in-$k$ query algorithm for approximating the distance of $f$ to being a $k$-junta (previous results of Blais, Canonne, Eden,  Levi,  and  Ron [SODA, 2018] and De, Mossel, and Neeman [FOCS, 2019] required exponentially many queries in $k$). Our techniques are Fourier analytical and introduce the new notion of "normalized influences'' that might be of independent interest.</summary>

<p>A convex set K is centrally symmetric if <img alt="x \in K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="x \in K"/> implies that <img alt="-x \in K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-x+%5Cin+K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="-x \in K"/>.</p>
<h3><strong>Conjecture:</strong> Let P be a centrally symmetric d-polytope. Then P has at least 3ᵈ non-empty faces.</h3>
<p>Here we count P itself as a face.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Before we continue</strong> let me mention</span> <a href="https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/programs/current-trimester-program/interplay-high-dimensional-geometry-probability/interplay-high-dimensional-geometry-probability-winterschool/">a winter school on “The Interplay between High-Dimensional Geometry and Probability”,</a> <span style="color: #008000;">January 11-15. Among other exciting lectures Bo’az Klartag will give 3 lectures on Yuansi Chen’s work on the KLS conjecture, that we discussed in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/21/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-15-yuansi-chen-achieved-a-major-breakthrough-on-bourgains-slicing-problem-and-the-kannan-lovasz-and-simonovits-conjecture/">this post</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Now back to the 3ᵈ conjecture. </strong>A case of equality is the <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/>-dimensional cube <img alt="C_d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="C_d"/>.

<h3>Some comments</h3>
<p>Here are some points raised in the discussion and further comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are many cases of equality – all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanner_polytope"><em>Hanner polytopes</em></a>. Those are obtained from intervals by taking the two operations, a) Cartesian product, b) moving from a polytope P to its polar-dual P*, and apply them in all possible ways.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Nati asked if a <img alt="(2+\epsilon)^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282%2B%5Cepsilon%29%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(2+\epsilon)^d"/> lower bound is known. To the best of my knowledge even this is not known.</span></li>
<li>Gideon asked about the connections with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahler_volume">Mahler’s conjecture</a> that for every d-dimentional centrally symmetric body K, <img alt="vol(K)vol(K*) \ge 4^n/n!" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=vol%28K%29vol%28K%2A%29+%5Cge+4%5En%2Fn%21&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="vol(K)vol(K*) \ge 4^n/n!"/>  . Indeed the cases of equality are conjectured to be the same – the class of Hanner polytopes. (Mahler’s conjecture and its relations to combinatorics would deserve a separate post.) The recent paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870818303372?casa_token=YEJdSwTFFaIAAAAA:k-e1q7dtnSZslAg5ZZYtJJQrgLiCbDE7_uNBITsrrUxOkCc5A8ThPF5CPTIcD4HUhTcVlUqeaAM" id="1oYidvdGYaQJ"><span dir="ltr">Flag numbers and floating bodies</span>‏</a> by <span dir="ltr"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MqLwWBgAAAAJ&amp;hl=iw&amp;oi=sra">F Besau</a>, C Schütt, EM Werner looks very relevant.</span></li>
<li>For simplicial polytopes the conjecture follows from results of Stanley (1986) and is related t0 a result by Barany and Lovasz (1982).</li>
<li>The conjecture is related to a 1979 theorem of Figiel, Lindenstrauss, and Milman that asserts that for every centrally symmetric <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/> polytope <img alt="\log f_0(P) \log f_{d-1}(P) \ge \gamma d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+f_0%28P%29+%5Clog+f_%7Bd-1%7D%28P%29+%5Cge+%5Cgamma+d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\log f_0(P) \log f_{d-1}(P) \ge \gamma d"/>, for some universal constant <img alt="\gamma" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\gamma"/>.</li>
<li>A somewhat more general conjecture would be that the number of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-faces of the barycentric subdivision of <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="K"/> is always as large as the number of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-faces of the barycentric subdivision of <img alt="C_d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="C_d"/>. The case <img alt="k=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k=0"/> is the original conjecture and I regard the case <img alt="k=d-1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3Dd-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k=d-1"/> (sometimes referred to as the “flag-number conjecture”) as even closer to Mahler’s conjecture. See the paper by Schmidt and Ziegler, <a href="https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/groups/discgeom/ziegler/Preprintfiles/127PREPRINT.pdf">Ten Problems in Geometry.</a></li>
<li>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3661">this paper</a> by Raman Sanyal, Axel Werner, and Günter M. Ziegler, the conjecture is proved for <img alt="d \le 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%5Cle+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d \le 4"/>. The proof is rather involved and rely on an extension of the lower bound theorem. (It does not extend to polyhedral spheres.)  The paper also gives counterexamples for two much stronger conjectures that I made in my 1989 paper.</li>

<h3>Some further comments</h3>
<p><span id="more-20474"/></p>
<ol>
<li>Hanner polytopes form an exciting family of polytopes. They have the maximum Banach-Mazur distance from the Euclidean ball, and it is conjectured that only these polytopes attain this maximum. They also have the 2-3 Helly-property (namely every three pairwise intersecting translates have a point in common. It was proved by Lima and Jensen that this property holds only by Hanner polytopes!</li>
<li>The proof for the conjecture for d=4 involves the “extended lower bound inequality”.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Another conjecture of mine of a similar spirit is: a polyhedral d-manifold (more generally, a regular CW manifold) in dimension <em>d</em> which is not a sphere has at least <img alt="2^{(3d+4)/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%283d%2B4%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="2^{(3d+4)/2}"/> faces. (Including the empty face.)</span></li>
<li>Flag <img alt="(d-1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28d-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(d-1)"/>-dimensional spheres also have at least <img alt="3^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="3^d"/> faces. This follows from a theorem by Roy Meshulam.</li>
<li>Completely balanced <img alt="(d-1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28d-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(d-1)"/>-dimensional spheres also have at least <img alt="3^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="3^d"/> faces. (I think.) (What about zonotopes, you may ask.)</li>
<li>The class of spheres in items 4 and 5 are simplicial. So an extensions of these classes to classes of polyhedral spheres (and regular CW spheres) would be interesting.</li>
<li>d-Polytopes with no triangular 2-faces also have at least <img alt="3^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="3^d"/> non-empty faces this follows from a theorem of Blind and Blind.</li>
<li>Looking around in papers that referred to my old paper I discovered the following appealing class of polytopes and interesting conjecture about them. A polytope P is 2-level if for every facet F of P there is a hyperplane parallel to the hyperplane through F that contains all vertices not in F. The conjecture is that for such a d-polytope P, <img alt="f_0(P)f_{d-1}(P)\le d2^{d+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_0%28P%29f_%7Bd-1%7D%28P%29%5Cle+d2%5E%7Bd%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f_0(P)f_{d-1}(P)\le d2^{d+1}"/>. This conjecture was made in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01943">Enumeration of 2-level polytopes by</a>  Bohn,  Faenza,  Fiorini,  Fisikopoulos, Macchia, and Pashkovich. (<strong>Update:</strong> Giulia commented that the conjecture on 2-level polytopes by Bohn et al. was recently solved by Andrey Kupavskii and Stefan Weltge: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07153" rel="nofollow ugc">https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07153</a>.)</li>
<li>Interesting classes of polytopes arising from graphs that are very near the conjecture can be found in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5790" id="KdEkliExsEIJ"><span dir="ltr">Face numbers of centrally symmetric polytopes from split graphs</span>‏</a> by <span dir="ltr">Freij, Henze, Schmitt, and Ziegler.

</ol>
<p><strong>Update (Jan 12,2021):</strong> Looking at old correspondence with Ragnar Freij, Matthias Henze, and Günter Ziegler, I came across the following conjecture that related the flag number conjecture and Mahler’s conjecture. Let P be a centrally symmetric d-polytope. Let <img alt="1+m(P)=vol(K)/vol(K*)/ (4^d/d!)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Bm%28P%29%3Dvol%28K%29%2Fvol%28K%2A%29%2F+%284%5Ed%2Fd%21%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="1+m(P)=vol(K)/vol(K*)/ (4^d/d!)"/>, and let <img alt="1+fn(P)=mf(P)/(2^dd!)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Bfn%28P%29%3Dmf%28P%29%2F%282%5Edd%21%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="1+fn(P)=mf(P)/(2^dd!)."/> For a centrally symmetric $d$-polytope <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="P"/>, Mahler’s conjecture asserts that <img alt="m(P) \ge 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%28P%29+%5Cge+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="m(P) \ge 0"/> and the flag number conjecture asserts that <img alt="fn(P) \ge 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=fn%28P%29+%5Cge+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="fn(P) \ge 0"/>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Conjecture:</strong>  fn(<em>P</em>) ≥ 4 m(<em>P</em>)</h3>
<p>It is also conjectured that equality holds for Jensen’s polytopes of perfect graphs.</p>

    <title>TR21-003 |  Inverse-Exponential Correlation Bounds and Extremely Rigid Matrices from a New Derandomized XOR Lemma | 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Xin Lyu</title>
    <summary>In this work we prove that there is a function $f \in \textrm{E}^\textrm{NP}$ such that, for every sufficiently large $n$ and $d = \sqrt{n}/\log n$, $f_n$ ($f$ restricted to $n$-bit inputs) cannot be $(1/2 + 2^{-d})$-approximated by $\textrm{F}_2$-polynomials of degree $d$. We also observe that a minor improvement (e.g., improving $d$ to $n^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$) over our result will imply $\textrm{E}^\textrm{NP}$ cannot be computed by depth-$3$ $\textrm{AC}^0$-circuits of $2^{n^{1/2 + \varepsilon}}$ size, which is a notoriously hard open question in complexity theory. 
	
	Using the same proof techniques, we are also able to construct extremely rigid matrices over $\textrm{F}_2$ in $\textrm{P}^\textrm{NP}$. More specifically, we show that for every constant $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, there is a $\textrm{P}^\textrm{NP}$ algorithm which on input $1^n$ outputs an $n\times n$ $\textrm{F}_2$-matrix $H_n$ satisfying $\mathcal{R}_{H_n}(2^{\log^{1 - \varepsilon} n}) \ge (1/2 - \exp(-\log^{2/3 \cdot \varepsilon} n) ) \cdot n^2$, for every sufficiently large $n$. This improves the recent $\textrm{P}^\textrm{NP}$ constructions of rigid matrices in [Alman and Chen, FOCS 2019] and [Bhangale et al., FOCS 2020], which only gives  $\Omega(n^2)$ rigidity.
	
	The key ingredient in the proof of our new results is a new derandomized XOR lemma based on approximate linear sums, which roughly says that given an $n$-input function $f$ which cannot be $0.99$-approximated by certain linear sum of $s$ many functions in $\mathcal{F}$ within $\ell_1$-distance, one can construct a new function $\textrm{Amp}^f$ with $\widetilde{O}(n)$ input bits, which cannot be $(1/2+s^{\Omega(1)})$-approximated by $\mathcal{F}$-functions. Taking $\mathcal{F}$ to be a function collection containing low-degree $\textrm{F}_2$-polynomials or low-rank $\textrm{F}_2$-matrices, our results are then obtained by first using the algorithmic method to construct a function which is weakly hard against linear sums of $\mathcal{F}$ in the above sense, and then apply the derandomized XOR lemma to $f$.
	
	We obtain our new derandomized XOR lemma by giving a generalization of the famous hardcore lemma by Impagliazzo. Our generalization in some sense constructs a non-Boolean hardcore of a weakly hard function $f$ with respect to $\mathcal{F}$-functions, from the weak inapproximability of $f$ by any linear sum of $\mathcal{F}$ with bounded $\ell_p$-norm. This generalization recovers the original hardcore lemma by considering the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm. Surprisingly, when we switch to the $\ell_1$-norm, we immediately rediscover Levin's proof of Yao's XOR Lemma. That is, these first two proofs of Yao's XOR Lemma can be unified with our new perspective. For proving the correlation bounds, our new derandomized XOR lemma indeed works with the $\ell_{4/3}$-norm.</summary>

    <title>TR21-002 |  Fooling Constant-Depth Threshold Circuits | 

	Pooya Hatami, 

	William Hoza, 

	Avishay Tal, 

	Roei Tell</title>
    <summary>We present new constructions of pseudorandom generators (PRGs) for two of the most widely-studied non-uniform circuit classes in complexity theory. Our main result is a construction of the first non-trivial PRG for linear threshold (LTF) circuits of arbitrary constant depth and super-linear size. This PRG fools circuits with depth $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and $n^{1+\delta}$ wires, where $\delta = 2^{-O(d)}$, using seed length $O(n^{1-\delta})$ and with error $2^{-n^{\delta}}$. This tightly matches the best known lower bounds for this circuit class. As a consequence of our result, all the known hardness for LTF circuits has now effectively been translated into pseudorandomness. This brings the extensive effort in the last decade to construct PRGs and deterministic circuit-analysis algorithms for this class to the point where any subsequent improvement would yield breakthrough lower bounds.
    
Our second contribution is a PRG for De Morgan formulas of size $s$ whose seed length is $s^{1/3+o(1)} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon)$ for error $\epsilon$. In particular, our PRG can fool formulas of sub-cubic size $s=n^{3-\Omega(1)}$ with an exponentially small error $\epsilon=\exp({-n^{\Omega(1)}})$. This significantly improves the inverse-polynomial error of the previous state-of-the-art for such formulas by Impagliazzo, Meka, and Zuckerman (FOCS 2012), and again tightly matches the best currently-known lower bounds for this class.
    
In both settings, a key ingredient in our constructions is a pseudorandom restriction procedure that has tiny failure probability, but simplifies the function to a non-natural "hybrid computational model" that combines several computational models. As part of our proofs we also construct "extremely low-error" PRGs for related circuit classes; for example, we construct a PRG for the class of functions computable by an arbitrary function of $s$ linear threshold functions that can handle even the extreme setting of parameters $s=n/\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and $\epsilon=2^{-n/\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$.</summary>

<p>
Allan Lichtman correctly predicted the 2020 presidential election, based on a 7-6 edge in “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_the_White_House">keys</a>” to Joe Biden. His model, which he <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/78/11/7230">developed</a> in 1981 with the late Vladimir Keilis-Borok, simply says that the incumbent party will lose the presidential election if 6 or more keys go against them. It has been right in every election since 1984.</p>
<p>
Today we make some predictions for the new year, 2021.</p>
<p>
Lichtman has not ventured a prediction for today’s Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Last November 19, he penned an <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/526780-time-to-jettison-horse-race-polls">article</a> eviscerating the performance of poll aggregation in the November 3 election. We have considered writing a post about that and about statistical predictions during the pandemic, in the direction of taking more moderate assessments of how various polls, predictions, and policies have fared.</p>
<p>
Polls of today’s races currently show a 1–2 percentage point edge for the Democratic candidates, but there are multiple caveats: The difference is just about one standard deviation, well within the margin of error even after aggregation. The polls have gyrated with multiple lead flips this past month; two polls from the past few days collected <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/georgia-senate-polls/?cid=rrpromo">here</a> show both Republican candidates tied or ahead. Many pollsters have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-many-pollsters-are-sitting-out-the-georgia-runoffs/">avoided</a> these races, and the five most recent polls all have sample sizes well under 1,000. The count beginning tonight may show a zigzag blue-to-red-to-“blur” shift for reasons of which votes are tallied when that we discussed generally <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/03/the-election-night-time-warp/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
With that said, let us address non-election predictions.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Previous Predictions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Back in <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/06/predictions-for-2019/">2019</a> we made some predictions that were easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>No circuit lower bound <img alt="{1000n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1000n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1000n}"/> or better will be proved for SAT.</em> Well that’s a freebie. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A computer scientist will win a Nobel Prize.</em> No—indeed, less close than other years. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>At least five claims that <img alt="{{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%3D%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}}"/> and five that <img alt="{{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}}"/> will be made.</em> Gerhard Woeginger’s claims <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm">page</a> is still paused at 2016, so we can only judge from our own window of communications made to us or commented in the blog. All we can say is that the number in each case is “order-of” <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{5}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A “provably” secure crypto-system will be broken.</em> For this one we don’t have to check any claims. We just pocket the “yes” answer.
</li></ul>
<p>
We skipped 2020—maybe that was smart of us? Our point about predictions in 2019 was the importance of “<em>when</em>” as opposed to “<em>what</em>.” With regard to some predictions, we can take the pandemic is as a global postponement of “when.”</p>
<p>
We claim complete and ongoing timeliness with another 2019 prediction, however. In full, we wrote:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Quantum supremacy will be proved—finally.</em> But be careful: there is a problem with this whole direction. See the next section.
</li></ul>
<p>
The section two years ago talked about the difficulties of proving such a claim. A claim was duly made in October 2019, which we evaluated <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">here</a>, but arguments over “proof” have not abated. They have just recently been summarized by Gil Kalai <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/29/the-argument-against-quantum-computers-a-very-short-introduction/">here</a>, and also <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5159">here</a> by Scott Aaronson in regard to an independent <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6523/1460">claim</a> by researchers from USTC in China.</p>

Here are some new predictions for 2021. We will try and skip easy ones like the above. We will try to make some that are surprising. We’ve made predictions about evidence for life on exoplanets before; we do something different there too. We do not venture any about the course of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Dear TCS Students:</p>



<p>SIAM has today reopened the application portal for SODA21 Student Registration Waiver. The new deadline will be this Friday, January 8 at 11:59pm EST.</p>



<p>SODA21 will be held virtually on Jan. 10 – Jan. 13, 2021.</p>



<p>Please note that having paper(s) in SODA and its associated Symposiums is not a requirement. For this year’s application, the letter of recommendation from advisors is not required as well. The goal of the support from Google, Microsoft, and ACM is to increase opportunity for students to attend this premier TCS conference.</p>



<p>Looking forward to seeing you in SODA’21.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>ORIGINAL MESSAGE: Please see below for a message from Shang-Hua Teng, regarding the possibility of waivers for SODA 2021 registration for students.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Dear TCS students:<br/><br/>By now, it is hard to overestimate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic to society. However, like every challenge, it has created some opportunities. For example, essentially all major conferences in TCS this year have been transformed into virtual ones, making them more accessible to scholars/students across the world (of course at the expense of traditional interactions). <br/><br/>ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA21) will be held virtually this year, on Jan. 10 – 13, 2021. As you may know, this is the premier conference on algorithms .<br/><br/>See <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda21" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda21</a><br/><br/>Thanks to our industry partners and ACM SIGACT group, SODA has some funds for covering student registrations. I am writing to informing you this opportunity and encourage you to apply:<br/> See: <br/>1. <a href="https://awards.siam.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://awards.siam.org/</a> <br/>2. <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/lodging-and-support/travel-support/soda21-travel-support" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/lodging-and-support/travel-support/soda21-travel-support</a><br/>That deadline is Dec. 27, 2020. Like before, having papers in SODA is not prerequisite.<br/><br/>Shang-Hua Teng<br/>On Behalf of SODA Steering Committee<br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text"><a href="https://francisbach.com/optimization-is-as-hard-as-approximation/">Last month</a>, I showed how global optimization based only on accessing function values can be hard with no convexity assumption. In a nutshell, with limited smoothness, the number of function evaluations has to grow exponentially fast in dimension, which is a rather negative statement. On the positive side, this number does not grow as fast for highly smooth functions. However, optimal algorithms end up approximating the whole function to minimize, and <em>then</em> minimizing the approximation, which takes exponential time in general. In this post, I will describe very recent work with Alessandro Rudi and Ulysse Marteau-Ferey [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] that essentially <em>jointly</em> approximates the function and minimizes the approximation.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Our task for this post will be to minimize a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), for which we know the global minimizer is already located in a certain bounded set \(\Omega\) (typically a large ball). We can query values of \(f\) at any point in \(\Omega\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out it can be formulated as a convex optimization problem (there has to be a catch in this statement, stay tuned).</p>



<h2>All optimization problems are convex!</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the following minimization problem: $$\tag{1} \sup_{c \in \mathbb{R}} \ c \ \ \mbox{ such that } \ \ \forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) \geqslant c.$$ As illustrated below, this corresponds to finding the largest lower bound \(c\) on the function.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5352" height="203" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/f_above_c-1-1024x670.png" width="310"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Assuming \(f\) attains its global minimizer \(f_\ast\) in \(\Omega\), then the optimal value of the problem above is attained and is clearly \(f_\ast\), that is, the problem in Eq. (1) leads to the minimal value of \(f\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, each constraint in Eq. (1) is a linear constraint in \(c\), and the objective is linear. Hence we obtain a linear programming problem which is a particularly simple instance of a convex optimization problem. Thus, all optimization problems are convex!</p>



<p class="justify-text">The catch here is that the set of inequalities is dense, that is, in general, \(\Omega\) contains infinitely many elements, and thus the number of constraints is infinite.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Duality.</strong> It is worth deriving the convex optimization dual (being loose here in terms of regularity and integrability conditions). We add a Lagrange multiplier \(\mu(x) \geqslant 0\) for each of the constraints \(f(x) \, – c \geqslant 0\), and consider the Lagrangian<br/>$$ \mathcal{L}(c,\mu) = c + \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) \big( f(x) \, – c\big) dx.$$ Maximizing it with respect to \(c\) leads to the constraint \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) dx = 1\), that is, \(\mu\) represents a probability distribution, and the dual problem is $$ \inf_{\mu \in \mathbb{R}^\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) f(x) dx \ \ \mbox{ such that } \int_\Omega\! \mu(x) dx = 1 \mbox{ and } \forall x \in \Omega, \ \mu(x) \geqslant 0.$$ In words, we minimize the expectation of \(f\) with respect to all probability distributions on \(\Omega\) with densities. Here, the infimum is obtained from any probability measure that puts mass only on the minimizer of \(f\) on \(\Omega\). This measure is typically not absolutely continuous, and thus the infimum is not attained (no big deal).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5350" height="202" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/f_and_mu-1024x699.png" width="295"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This is also a convex optimization problem, with a linear objective function on the infinite-dimensional set of probability measures.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Overall, we get convex but (apparently) useless problems. We will first need an efficient way to represent non-negativity of functions (this will be applied to \(f(x) \, – c\)).</p>



<h2>Positivity with “sums of squares”</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now start to make some assumptions on the function \(f\) to be minimized. We will assume that it can be written as $$\forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) = \langle \phi(x), F \phi(x) \rangle,$$ for some feature vector \(\phi(x)\) in some Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\), and \(F\) a symmetric linear operator on \(\mathcal{H}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">We will need infinite dimensions later, but you can safely assume that \(\mathcal{H}\) is a classical Euclidean space (e.g., \(\mathbb{R}^{{\rm dim}(\mathcal{H})}\)), and that we have $$\forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) = \phi(x)^\top F \phi(x) = \sum_{i,j=1}^{{\rm dim}(\mathcal{H})} F_{ij} \phi(x)_i \phi(x)_j.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We will also assume that the constant function on \(\Omega\) can be represented as well, that is, there exists \(u \in \mathcal{H}\) such that \(\forall x \in \Omega, \ \langle u, \phi(x) \rangle = 1.\) This is to ensure that we can represent within the optimization problem above the function \(f(x) \, – c = \langle \phi(x), (F – c \, u \otimes u) \phi(x) \rangle\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical example is the set of polynomials of degree \(2r\) for which we can choose \(\phi(x)\) to be of dimension \(d+r \choose r\) and contain all monomials are degree less than \(r\). We will go infinite-dimensional and link this to kernels later in this post.</p>



<p class="justify-text">You may wonder why we are not simply modeling the function \(f\) with a classical formulation \(f(x) = \langle w, \phi(x) \rangle\). This is precisely to be able to enforce positivity.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Positivity through “sum-of-squares”.</strong> We can assume that the operator \(F\) is positive-semidefinite (which we will denote \(F \succcurlyeq 0\)), that is, all of its eigenvalues are non-negative, or, for all \(h \in \mathcal{H}\), \(\langle h, F h \rangle \geqslant 0\). Then this implies that the function \(f\) is pointwise positive. Thus:  $$ \tag{2} F \succcurlyeq 0 \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ \forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x)  = \langle \phi(x), F \phi(x) \rangle \geqslant 0. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We refer to such functions as “sum-of-squares”. Indeed, given the spectral decomposition of \(F\) as $$ F = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i h_i \otimes h_i, $$ with \(I\) a countable set, and \((h_i)_{i \in I}\) an orthonormal family in \(\mathcal{H}\), we have \(\lambda_i \geqslant 0\) for all \(i \in I\), and thus we can write $$ f(x) = \langle \phi(x), F \phi(x) \rangle = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i \langle \phi(x) , (h_i \otimes h_i) \phi(x) \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n \big( \sqrt{\lambda_i} \langle h_i , \phi(x) \rangle \big)^2.$$ That is, the function \(f\) is a sum of squares of functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A key question is whether the implication in Eq. \((2)\) can be reversed. In other words, <em>can we write all non-negative functions as sum-of-squares?</em> The answer will depend on the chosen feature map \(\phi: \Omega \to \mathcal{H}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Polynomials.</strong> For polynomials, the answer is known to be positive in dimension 1, but negative in higher dimensions (see the nice review in [<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2695736">2</a>]): that is, unless \(d=1\), or \(d=2\) and \(r=2\), there are polynomials of degree \(2r\) in dimension \(d\) that are non-negative but are not the sum of squares of polynomials. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Keeping in mind the difference being non-negative and being a sum of squares, let’s look how this can be used for global optimization of polynomials.</p>



<h2>Polynomial optimization with sums-of-squares</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider that \(f\) is a polynomial of degree \(2r\), and that \(\phi(x)\) is of dimension \(d+r \choose r\) and contain all monomials of degree less than \(r\). We consider representing the constraint \(f(x)\geqslant c\) in Eq. (1), as \(f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle\) for some positive-definite operator (here a matrix) \(A\). With the notations above, this is equivalent to \(F = c u \otimes u + A\) and \(A \succcurlyeq 0\). This leads to the following optimization problem (no localization set \(\Omega\) is used): $$ \tag{3} \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A \succcurlyeq 0} c \ \mbox{ such that } \ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle .$$ This in now a problem in finite dimension, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming">semidefinite programming</a> problem, and can thus a priori be solved in polynomial time in \(d+r \choose r\). See [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1052623400366802">3</a>, 4] for more details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, beyond the potentially large dimension of the convex problem when \(r\) and \(d\) grow, there is a major concern: is the problem in Eq. (3) equivalent to the one in Eq. (1)? This is true if and only if the polynomial \(f(x) \, – f_\ast\) is a a sum-of-squares, which given the discussion above may not happen as soon as \(d \geqslant 2\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to apply to all polynomials, the problem has to be changed. A simple reformulation is possible [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1052623400366802">3</a>] by assuming that the global minimum of \(f\) is attained within the set \(\Omega = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ x^\top x \leqslant R^2\}\) for some \(R &gt; 0\). It turns out (and this is a highly non-trivial fact) that all polynomials \(f(x) \) which are positive on \(\Omega\) can be written as \(f(x) = q(x) + ( R^2 – x^\top x ) p(x)\), where \(q(x)\) and \(p(x) \) are sum-of-squares polynomials. The only issue is that the degrees of \(p\) and \(q\) are not known in advance so a sequence (a so-called “hierarchy”) of problems have to be solved with increasing degrees, each providing a lower bound on \(f_\ast\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">When the degree is large enough so that the sum-of-squares representation exists for \(f – f_\ast\), then the following problem  $$ \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A, B \succcurlyeq 0} c \mbox{ such that } \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle + ( R^2 – x^\top x ) \langle \phi(x), B \phi(x) \rangle$$ is a semi-definite program, whose solution leads to \(c = f_\ast\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This remains a large semi-definite program whose order is not known in advance and for which complicated solvers are needed. I will now present our recent work where we go infinite-dimensional, and some of these issues are alleviated (but some others are created).</p>



<h2>Going infinite-dimensional</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider \(\phi(x)\) to be infinite-dimensional. In order to allow finite-dimensional manipulations of various objects, we consider feature maps which are obtained from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_kernel">positive-definite kernels</a>. More precisely, we consider the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev space</a> \(\mathcal{H}\) of functions on \(\Omega\) with all partial derivatives up to order \(s\) which are square-integrable. When \(s &gt; d/2\), then this is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, that is, there exists a positive-definite kernel \(k: \Omega \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) such that the feature map \(\phi(x) = k(\cdot,x)\) allows to access function values as \(h(x) = \langle h, \phi(x) \rangle\) for all \(h \in \mathcal{H}\). For the algorithm, we will only need access to the kernel; for example, for \(s = d/2+1/2\), we can choose the usual exponential \(k(x,y) = \exp( – \alpha \| x – y \|_2)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider the same problem as for polynomials, but with this new feature map: $$\tag{4} \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A \succcurlyeq 0} c \ \mbox{ such that } \ \forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle .$$ In order to have an exact reformulation, we need that there exists some \(A_\ast\) such that \(\forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x)  \, – f_\ast = \langle \phi(x), A_\ast \phi(x) \rangle\). It turns out to be true [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] with appropriate geometric conditions on \(x\) (such as isolated second-order strict global minimizers within \(\Omega\)) and regularity (at least \(s+3\) derivatives); see [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This is all very nice, but the problem in Eq. (4) is still an infinite-dimensional problem (note that we have gone from a continuum of inequalities to elements of a Hilbert space, but that’s not much of a gain). </p>



<h2>Controlled approximation through sampling</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now leverage classical and more recent techniques from kernel methods. The main idea is to subsample the set of equalities in Eq. (4), that is consider \(n\) points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \Omega\), and solve instead the regularized sampled problem $$\tag{5} \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A \succcurlyeq 0} c \ – \, \lambda \, {\rm tr}(A) \ \mbox{ such that }\  \forall i \in \{1,\dots,n\}, \ f(x_i) = c + \langle \phi(x_i), A \phi(x_i) \rangle , $$ where \(\lambda &gt; 0\) is a regularization parameter.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Approximation guarantees.</strong> Beyond computational considerations, how big does \(n\) need to be to obtain a value of \(c\) which is at most \(\varepsilon\) away from \(f_\ast\)? From <a href="https://francisbach.com/optimization-is-as-hard-as-approximation/">last post</a>, if \(f\) is \(m\)-times differentiable, we cannot have \(n\) smaller than \(\varepsilon^{-d/m}\). As shown in [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>], for points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \Omega\) selected uniformly at random, then \(n\) can be taken to of the order \(\varepsilon^{-d/(m – d/2 – 3)}\) for a well-chosen Sobolev space \(s\) and regularization parameter \(\lambda\). This is not the optimal rate \(\varepsilon^{-d/(m – d/2)}\) , but close when \(m\) and \(d\) are large.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Finite-dimensional algorithm.</strong> The problem in Eq. (5) is still infinite-dimensional. We can leverage a recent work, again with Ulysse Marteau-Ferey and Alessandro Rudi [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03926(opens in a new tab)">5</a>], that shows that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a> exists for this type of problems: the optimization for the operator \(A\) may be restricted to \(A\) of the form $$A = \sum_{i,j} C_{ij} \phi(x_i) \otimes \phi(x_j)$$ for a positive definite <em>matrix</em> \(C \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\). This leads to a semi-definite programming problem of size \(n\), whose running-time complexity is polynomial in \(n\) (e.g, \(O(n^{3.5})\)), with standard general-purpose toolboxes (such as <a href="http://cvxr.com/cvx/">CVX</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to tackle large values \(n\) which are larger than \(1000\), simple iterative algorithms can be designed (see [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] for a damped Newton algorithm which does not require any singular value decompositions, with complexity \(O(n^3)\) per iteration). Classical tools for efficient kernel methods, such as column sampling / Nyström method (see [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Bach13.pdf">6</a>, <a href="http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/5936-less-is-more-nystrom-computational-regularization.pdf">7</a>] and references therein) or random features (see [<a href="http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/6914-generalization-properties-of-learning-with-random-features.pdf">8</a>, <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-178/15-178.pdf">9</a>] and references therein), could also be used to avoid a cubic or quadratic complexity in \(n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Comparison with random search.</strong> Instead of solving the problem in Eq. (5), we could output the minimal value of \(f(x_i)\) for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\), which is exactly random search if the points \(x_i\) are random (this also happens to correspond to using \(\lambda=0\) in Eq. (5)). This can only achieve an error \(\varepsilon\) for \(n\) of order \(\varepsilon^{-d}\); in other words, it cannot leverage smoothness, while our algorithm can. The main technical reason is that subsampling inequalities provide weaker guarantees than subsampling equalities, and thus representing the non-negativity of a function through an equality (which our method essentially does) provides significant benefits.</p>



<h2>Duality</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As always in convex optimization, it is beneficial to look at dual problems. It turns out that iterative algorithms are easier to build for the finite-dimensional dual problem to Eq. (5). We rather look now at the dual of Eq. (4) and make the parallel with the primal original problem in Eq. (1) and its dual.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Introducing a Lagrange multiplier \(\mu(x)\) for the constraint \(f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle\) (this time not constrained to be non-negative because we have an equality constraint), we can form the Lagrangian $$\mathcal{L}(c,A,\mu) = c + \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) \big( f(x) \, – c \, – \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle \big) dx.$$ Maximizing with respect to \(c\) again leads to the constraint \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) dx = 1\), while minimizing with respect to \(A \succcurlyeq 0\) leads to the constraint \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) \phi(x) \otimes \phi(x) dx \succcurlyeq 0 .\) The dual problem thus becomes $$ \inf_{\mu \in \mathbb{R}^\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) f(x) dx \ \ \mbox{ such that } \int_\Omega\! \mu(x) dx = 1 \mbox{ and } \ \int_\Omega \mu(x) \phi(x) \otimes \phi(x)dx \succcurlyeq 0.$$ The impact of the representation of non-negative functions by quadratic forms in \(\phi(x)\) is to replace the non-negativity contraint on all \(\mu(x)\) by the positivity of the matrix \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) \phi(x) \otimes \phi(x)dx\), which is weaker in general, but equivalent if \(\phi(x)\) is “large” enough.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that the dual problem through a signed measure that should concentrate around the minimizers of \(f\) leads to a natural candidate \(\int_\Omega x \mu(x) dx\) for the optimizer (see more details in [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>], and a similar dual formulation for polynomials in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08566.pdf">10</a>]).</p>



<h2>Simulations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to highlight how the optimization method works, I will first present how it minimizes the multi-modal function in dimension \(d=2\) pictured below on \([-1,1]^2\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5384" height="367" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f3d_blog-1024x768.png" width="500"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We consider sampling a sequence of points \(x_1, x_2,\dots \in \mathbb{R}^2\) from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence">quasi-random sequence </a>(so that it fills the space more evenly that purely random). The random points are displayed in purple while the solution of our algorithm is displayed in red, with increasing numbers \(n\) of sampled points. On the right plot, the model \(c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle\) is displayed, showing that the model becomes more accurate as \(n\) grows.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5385" height="434" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gloptikernel_blog.gif" width="1196"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We also consider a problem in dimension \(d=8\), where we compare random sampling and our algorithm (“gloptikernel”), as \(n\) grows (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11978">1</a>] for the experimental set-up).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5383" height="302" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plot_blog_perf.png" width="362"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Clearly, the chosen baseline (random sampling) is rudimentary, though optimal up to logarithmic terms for non-smooth problems where only Lipschitz-continuity is assumed. We can also compare to gradient descent with random restarts (“random+GD” below, with the same overall number of function evaluations). As shown below, when the gradient information is robust, this baseline performs similarly (left plot), while when a high frequency component is added to the function (which makes the gradient information non reliable, right plot), the local descent algorithm needs more function evaluations.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5410" height="262" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/randomGD-1-1024x442.png" width="607"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">It would be interesting to compare this new algorithms to other global optimization algorithms based on function evaluations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES">CMA-ES</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization">Bayesian optimization</a>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I presented an algorithm for global optimization that can provably leverage smoothness with an algorithm which has a running time which is polynomial in the dimension and the number of function evaluations. For large smoothness factors, the number of such evaluations has a dependence on the precision \(\varepsilon\) which has no exponential dependence in dimension in the exponent (but still in the constants: we cannot optimize multivariate polynomials in polynomial time…).</p>



<p class="justify-text">These ideas can be extended in a number of ways.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>General relaxation tool for dense inequalities. </strong>We can generalize the previous developments to all problems with a continuum of constraints on a variable \(\theta\), such as, $$ \forall x \in \Omega, \ H(\theta,x) \geqslant 0.$$ The corresponding Lagrange multipliers also satisfy $$ \forall x \in \Omega, \ \mu(x) \geqslant 0$$ (there may be other ones like in the problem above). Now the question is: should we use the non-negative modelisation with quadratic forms in the primal or in the dual? Or equivalently, replace the non-negativity constraint by the positivity of the integral of \(\phi(x) \otimes \phi(x)\) in the dual or in the primal?</p>



<p class="justify-text">The answer depends on the expected smoothness of the function which is non-negative. In the optimization problem, we expect \(f(x) \, – c\) to be smooth at the optimum, while \(\mu(x)\) which is approximating a Dirac clearly isn’t; therefore, the choice is clear (at least in retrospect since we originally tried to model \(\mu(x)\) as a quadratic form…).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Constrained optimization.</strong> Following [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1052623400366802">3</a>], we can apply the same algorithmic technique to constrained optimization, by formulating the problem of minimizing \(f(x)\) such that \(g(x) &gt; 0\) as maximizing \(c\) such that \(f(x) = c + p(x) + g(x)q(x)\), and \(p, q\) non-negative functions. We can (at least in principle) then replace the non-negative constraints by \(p(x) = \langle \phi(x),A\phi(x)\rangle\) and \(q(x) =\langle \phi(x),B\phi(x)\rangle\) for positive operators \(A\) and \(B\). All this remains to be explored in more details.</p>

<p><strong>Almost Optimal Bounds for Sublinear-Time Sampling of k-Cliques: Sampling Cliques is Harder Than Counting</strong> by Talya Eden, Dana Ron, and Will Rosenbaum (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04090">arXiv</a>). In many settings, sampling and counting are tightly coupled; the classic example being permanent estimation and sampling random bipartite matchings.This paper investigates the problem of sampling uniform random cliques, and unearths an interesting separation of approximately uniform sampling from approximate counting. Let’s consider the fundamental problem of edge and triangle counting, in graphs of constant arboricity. This class, which contains all minor-closed families, has deep connections to clique counting; clique counting can be done in linear time for bounded arboricity graphs.) The input connected graph \(G\) has \(n\) vertices, \(m\) edges, and \(t\) triangles. We assume the standard query model, with uniform random vertices, neighbor, and degree queries. Our aim is to get \((1+\varepsilon)\)-approximations for \(m\) and \(t\) (in general, any \(k\)-clique count). It is known from previous work that edge estimation can be done in \(O(1)\) time and triangle estimation can be done in \(O(n/t)\) time (ignoring log and \(\varepsilon\) dependencies). Moreover, these bounds is optimal. Can one get similar bounds for approximately sampling a uniform random edge/triangle? Previous work of <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/8300/">Eden-Rosenbaum</a> achieve such a bound for sampling edges. Surprisingly, this paper shows that triangle sampling is fundamentally harder, and requires \(\Omega(n^{3/4}/\sqrt{t})\) queries. The main result gives a precise and optimal bound for uniform sampling \(k\)-cliques in graphs of arboricity \(\alpha\).  </p>



<p><strong>Testing and reconstruction via decision trees </strong>by Guy Blanc, Jane Lange, and Li-Yang Tan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08735">arXiv</a>). A property tester is an (sublinear) algorithm that distinguishes an object with a property from those that are far. Reconstruction is a much stronger sublinear algorithm, which actually provides query access to the closest object. Suppose we have query access to an \(n\)-variate Boolean function \(f\), and the property \(\mathcal{P}\) of interest is size-\(s\) decision trees. A reconstructor would give query access to a function \(g \in \mathcal{P}\), such that \(dist(f,g) = O(OPT_f)\), where \(OPT_f\) is the distance of \(f\) to \(\mathcal{P}\). Observe that a reconstructor automatically gives a distance estimator (just estimate \(dist(f,g)\) by random sampling). One of the main results of this paper is a (weaker, bicriteria) reconstructor, where \(g\) is guaranteed to have decision-tree complexity \(s^{O(\log^2s)}\). Each query to \(g\) is computed in \(poly(\log s, 1/\varepsilon)\cdot n\) time. This reconstructor leads to a number of testing results, and reconstructors for other properties like low Fourier degree. Another interesting result proven: if there exists an efficient reconstructor that gets \(g\) of size \(s\), then there exists an efficient proper learner for decision trees (a big open problem).</p>



<p><strong>Testing Product Distributions: A Closer Look </strong>by Arnab Bhattacharyya, Sutanu Gayen, Saravanan Kandasamy, and N. V. Vinodchandran (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14632">arXiv</a>). This paper is on distribution testing, where all distributions involved are promised to be <em>product distributions</em>. Let \(P, Q\) be distributions over \(\Sigma^n\), where \(Sigma\) is some (small) finite set. The problems studied are identity testing (\(Q\) is known/fixed, and one gets samples from unknown \(P\)) and closeness testing (both unknown). It is known from previous work that these problems can basically be solved with \(O(n|\Sigma|\varepsilon^{-2})\) samples. Note that the domain size is exponential in \(n\); thus, these bounds give an exponential improvement over identity/closeness testing in the vanilla (non-product) setting. Tolerant testing is of special significance here. Because the domain is so large, it makes sense to allow for some distance even in the “yes” case. The main result of this paper is to completely map out the complexities for identity/closeness testing where we wish to distinguish \(d_1(P,Q) &lt; \varepsilon_1\) from \(d_2(P,Q) &gt; \varepsilon_2\), where \(d_1, d_2\) are potentially different distance measures. For example, the paper considers total variation (TV), KL, Hellinger, and \(\chi^2\) distances. An important improvement achieved is for identity testing where \(d_1\) is Hellinger and \(d_2\) is TV distance: for certain values of \(\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2\), one can get a tester of optimal sample complexity \(O(\sqrt{n|\Sigma|})\). Previous bounds only gave a \(O(n|\Sigma|)\) sample complexity. There are a number of new lower bounds for different combinations of \(d_1, d_2\) distance pairs.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-001 |  Computation Over the Noisy Broadcast Channel with Malicious Parties | 

	Raghuvansh Saxena, 

	Gillat Kol, 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Dmitry Paramonov</title>
    <summary>We study the $n$-party noisy broadcast channel with a constant fraction of malicious parties. Specifically, we assume that each non-malicious party holds an input bit, and communicates with the others in order to learn the input bits of all non-malicious parties. In each communication round, one of the parties broadcasts a bit to all other parties, and the bit received by each party is flipped with a fixed constant probability (independently for each recipient). How many rounds are needed?

Assuming there are no malicious parties, Gallager gave an $\mathcal{O}(n \log \log n)$-round protocol for the above problem, which was later shown to be optimal. This protocol, however, inherently breaks down in the presence of malicious parties.

We present a novel $n \cdot \tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\sqrt{\log n}\right)$-round protocol, that solves this problem even when almost half of the parties are malicious. Our protocol uses a new type of error correcting code, which we call a locality sensitive code and which may be of independent interest. Roughly speaking, these codes map "close" messages to "close" codewords, while messages that are not close are mapped to codewords that are very far apart.

We view our result as a first step towards a theory of property preserving interactive coding, i.e., interactive codes that preserve useful properties of the protocol being encoded. In our case, the naive protocol  over the noiseless broadcast channel, where all the parties broadcast their input bit and output all the bits received, works even in the presence of malicious parties. Our simulation of this protocol, unlike Gallager's, preserves this property of the original protocol.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5224">last post</a> about covid vaccines felt like shouting uselessly into the void … at least until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Collison">Patrick Collison</a>, the cofounder of Stripe and a wonderful friend, massively signal-boosted the post by <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/patrickc/status/1345139269904474113">tweeting</a> it.  This business is of such life-and-death urgency right now, and a <em>shift in attitude</em> or a <em>hardening of resolve</em> by just a few people reading could have such an outsized effect, that with apologies to anyone wanting me to return to my math/CS/physics lane, I feel like a second post on the same topic is called for.</p>



<p>Here’s my main point for today (as you might have noticed, I’ve changed the tagline of this entire blog accordingly):</p>



<p><strong>Reasonable people can disagree about whether vaccination could have, or should have, started much earlier.  But now that we in the US <em>have</em> painstakingly approved two vaccines, we should all agree about the <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">urgent need to get millions of doses into people’s arms before they spoil!</span>  Sure, better the elderly than the young, better essential than inessential workers—but much more importantly, better today than tomorrow, and better anyone than no one!</strong></p>



<p>Israel, which <em>didn’t</em> do especially well in earlier stages of the pandemic, is now putting the rest of the planet to shame with vaccinations.  What Dana and I hear from our friends and relatives there confirms what you can read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/30/how-has-israel-launched-the-worlds-fastest-covid-vaccination-drive">here</a>, <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F01%2F01%2Fworld%2Fmiddleeast%2Fisrael-coronavirus-vaccines.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1mmRY74TuILhmj08gqlTM3bUlHjIgcl4bYpl788Z8Y8gPnVV9O3c9NdX8&amp;h=AT3_NCHDgesUdnhZASL2Q4v840iZjNdwl9PF_by1ekphfj74Aj558AJRN4jE_vLygxmdETWAzHpJjBv_WaTYvfOtdjuloJsQwU6HpitdfO4Mng8og-m9Y7PyXsvb2rWs3Q&amp;__tn__=%2CmH-R&amp;c[0]=AT2H2XioKIFzYeGiu0qeLpT21jx4aDKGvcu4ymay0B8b1AVIW0fPfMQW-jBEjojJvf8Q0p_387lyA7EGqh29PllsKvZUKAbVuBXyxet7VrpMc4bMIzHkSm2B35yFxWJ1zsyxtQesY6-dcQmt6s2PvpWSMIo">here</a>, and elsewhere.  Rabin Square in Tel Aviv is now a huge <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/01/world/01virus-israel-vaccine02/merlin_181829658_7892b3dd-561f-4678-8a02-29b507628ab6-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp">vaccination field site</a>.  Vaccinations are now proceeding 24/7, even on Shabbat—something the ultra-Orthodox rabbis are <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/293713">grudgingly tolerating</a> under the doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh#:~:text=Pikuach%20nefesh%20is%20the%20principle,of%20the%20Torah%20becomes%20inapplicable.">“pikuach nefesh”</a> (i.e., saving a life overrides almost every other religious obligation).  Israelis are receiving texts at all hours telling them when it’s their turn and where to go.  Apparently, after the nurses are finished with everyone who had appointments, rather than waste whatever already-thawed supply is left, they simply go into the street and <a href="https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1344735831655936001">offer the extra doses</a> to anyone passing by.</p>



<p>Contrast that with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/31/opinion/coronavirus-vaccines-expiring.html">historic fiasco</a>—yes, <em>another</em> historic fiasco—<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/americas-vaccine-rollout-disaster.html">now unfolding in the US</a>.  The Trump administration had pledged to administer 20 million vaccines (well, Trump originally said <em>100</em> million) by the end of 2020.  Instead, fewer than three million were administered, with the already-glacial pace slowing even further over the holidays.  Unbelievably, <em>millions of doses are on track to spoil this month, before they can be administered</em>.  The bottleneck is now not manufacturing, it’s not supply, it’s just pure bureaucratic dysfunction and chaos, lack of funding and staff, and a stone-faced unwillingness by governors to deviate from harebrained “plans” and “guidelines” even with their populations’ survival at stake.</p>



<p>Famously, the CDC urged that essential workers get vaccinated before the elderly, since even though their own modeling predicted that many more people from all ethnic groups would die that way, at least the deaths would be more equitably distributed.  While there <em>are</em> some good arguments to prioritize essential workers, an outcry then led to the CDC partially backtracking, and to many states just making up their own guidelines.  But we’re now, for real, headed for a scenario where none of these moral-philosophy debates turn out to matter, since the vaccines will simply spoil in freezers (!!!) while the medical system struggles to comply with the Byzantine rules about who gets them first.</p>



<p>While I’d <em>obviously</em> never advocate such a thing, one wonders whether there’s an idealistic medical worker, somewhere in the US, who’s willing to risk jail for vaccinating people without approval, using supply that would otherwise be wasted.  If <em>anything</em> could galvanize this sad and declining nation to move faster, maybe it’s that.</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>In my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5224">last post</a>, I invited people to explain to me where I went wrong in my naïve, simplistic, doofus belief that, were our civilization still capable of “WWII” levels of competence, flexibility, and calculated risk-tolerance, most of the world could have already been vaccinated by now.  In the rest of this post, I’d like to list the eight most important counterarguments to that position that commenters offered (at least, those that I hadn’t already anticipated in the post itself), together with my brief responses to them.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Faster approval wouldn’t have helped, since the limiting factor was just the time needed to ramp up the supply.</strong>  As the first part of this post discussed, ironically supply is <em>not</em> now the limiting factor, and approval even a month or two earlier could’ve provided precious time to iron out the massive problems in distribution.  More broadly, though, what’s becoming obvious is that we needed faster <em>everything</em>: testing, approval, manufacturing, and distribution.</li><li><strong>The real risk, with vaccines, is long-term side effects, ones that might manifest only after years.</strong>  What I don’t get is, if people genuinely believe this, then why are they OK with having approved the vaccines <em>last month</em>?  Why shouldn’t we have waited until 2024, or maybe 2040?  By that point, those of us who were still alive could take the covid vaccine with <em>real</em> confidence, at least that the dreaded side effects would be unlikely to manifest before 2060.</li><li><strong>Much like with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a>, there are limits to how much more money could’ve sped up vaccine manufacturing.</strong>   My problem is that, while this is undoubtedly true, I see no indication that we were anywhere close to those limits—or indeed, that the paltry ~$9 billion the US spent on covid vaccines was the output of <em>any</em> rational cost/benefit calculation.  It’s like: suppose an enemy army had invaded the US mainland, slaughtered 330,000 people, and shut down much of the economy.  Can you imagine Congress responding by giving the Pentagon a <em>1.3%</em> budget increase to fight back, reasoning that any more would run up against Amdahl’s Law?  That’s how much $9 billion is.</li><li><strong>The old, inactivated-virus vaccines often took years to develop, so spending years to test them as well made a lot more sense.</strong>  This is undoubtedly true, but is not a counterargument.  It’s time to rethink the whole vaccine approval process for the era of programmable mRNA, which is <em>also</em> the era of pandemics that can spread around the world in months.</li><li><strong>Human challenge trials wouldn’t have provided much information, because you can’t do challenge trials with old or sick people, and because covid spread so widely that normal Phase III trials were perfectly informative.</strong>  Actually, <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/">1DaySooner</a> had plenty of elderly volunteers and volunteers with preexisting conditions.  It bothers me how the impossibility of using those volunteers is treated like a law of physics, rather than what it is: another non-obvious moral tradeoff.  Also, compared to Phase III trials, it looks like challenge trials would’ve bought us at least a couple months and maybe a half-million lives.</li><li><strong>Doctors can’t think like utilitarians—e.g., risking hundreds of lives in challenge trials in order to save millions of lives with a vaccine—because it’s a slippery slope from there to cutting up one person in order to save ten with their organs.</strong>  Well, I think the <em>informed consent</em> of the challenge trial participants is a pretty important factor here!  As is their &gt;99% chance of survival.  Look, <em>anyone</em> who works in public health makes utilitarian tradeoffs; the question is whether they’re good or bad ones.  As someone who lost most of his extended family in the Holocaust, my rule of thumb is that, if you’re worrying every second about whether you might become Dr. Mengele, that’s a pretty good sign that you <em>won’t</em> become Dr. Mengele.</li><li><strong>If a hastily-approved vaccine turned out to be ineffective or dangerous, it could diminish the public’s trust in all future vaccines.</strong>  Yes, of course there’s such a tradeoff, but I want you to notice the immense irony: this argument effectively says we can condemn millions to die right now, out of concern for hypothetical <em>other</em> millions in the future.  And yet some of the people making this argument will then turn around and call <em>me</em> a callous utilitarian!</li><li><strong>I’m suffering from hindsight bias: it might be clear <em>now</em> that vaccine approval and distribution should’ve happened a lot faster, but experts had no way of knowing that in the spring.</strong>  <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4780">Here’s</a> my post from May 1, entitled “Vaccine challenge trials NOW!”  I was encouraged by the many others who said similar things still earlier.  Was it just a lucky gamble?  Had we been allowed to get vaccinated then, at least we could’ve put our bloodstreams where our mouths were, and profited from the gamble!  More seriously, I sympathize with the decision-makers who’d be on the hook had an early vaccine rollout proved disastrous.  But if we don’t learn a lesson from this, and ready ourselves for the <em>next</em> pandemic with an mRNA platform that can be customized, tested, and injected into people’s arms within at most 2-3 months, we’ll <em>really</em> have no excuse.</li></ol>

Peter Neumann, Professor of Mathematics at Queen’s College, Oxford University, passed away two weeks ago. Last Monday would have been his 80th birthday. </p>
<p>
Today we join others mourning in private and remembering in public, including the authors of these <a href="https://luit-pariya.blogspot.com/2020/12/eter-neumann-is-no-more.html">stories</a> and <a href="https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2020/12/24/memories-of-peter-neumann/">memories</a>, who are among Peter’s <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=28732">39</a> graduated doctoral students.<br/>
<span id="more-17937"/></p>
<p>
Peter died from Covid-19 while in a care home for long treatment of a stroke that had paralyzed his left side two years ago—something he <a href="https://www.queens.ox.ac.uk/academics/neumann">wrote</a> he could recover from “no earlier than late 2020.” From the number of people we know who have been touched closely by this kind of happening, my family included, we have a small statistical window on a great tragedy. The one resolution we can most make for the New Year is that it bring a resolution, so that the progression Covid 19-20-21 stops there.</p>
<p>
The two words that most define Peter for me are <em>genial</em> and <em>acute</em>. I knew him from the beginning of my time as a graduate student at Oxford under a Marshall Scholarship in 1981. Every “don” at Oxford is associated to one of the thirty-nine residential colleges or six private halls. I joined Merton College to associate with my advisor, Dominic Welsh, but also there was Peter Cameron, whose memories are linked above and who joined Merton’s faculty after earning his doctorate under Peter in 1971. Perhaps that contributed to why Peter—that is, Neumann—kept up spelling his name Πeter. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Kinderseminar </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Early in my first term, Peter invited me to join a special weekly seminar hosted by Πeter in his expansive room in Queen’s College. It was already called the <em>Kinderseminar</em>, for it was directed to the graduate students for experience reading current research papers and, importantly, presenting them. It always began at 11am and had flexible time after noon because college lunches at Oxford typically began at 12:20 or 12:30 for students and 1pm for fellows.</p>
<p>
It is hard to replicate the atmosphere anywhere I have seen in the US. There was at least one big comfy chair, in which I remember Peter’s student Sarah Rees almost disappearing, and other chairs brought in around a coffee table for tea and—much more often—coffee. And a roll of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McVitie's">McVitie’s</a> that was passed around. High windows let in enough light to work lamps-off except on the darkest days. Lugged to the head of the table when the time for chitchat was over was a portable chalkboard. Then began a masterclass in how to give a masterclass.</p>

We have already mentioned the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/09/27/a-dictionary-for-reading-proofs/">seminar</a> a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/">number</a> of <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/16/summer-reading-in-theory/">times</a> on this blog. Two of those mentions recall a lecture by Πeter himself on Évariste Galois, whose ulterior point was to warn the dangers of carelessly using phrases like “it is easy to see that…” in proofs. Well Galois, explained Πeter, was writing in haste the night before the duel that killed him, but most of us don’t have that excuse. Here is a preserved later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=xfJ4vwQ3vpo">lecture</a> by Πeter on Galois.</p>
<p>
The most recent of those posts featured Norman Biggs, who visited Oxford and took part in the seminar for some of my first year. My own first presentation in the seminar was on alternate proofs I’d found in my Princeton undergraduate thesis of theorems covered in a textbook by Biggs. He gave me the nice compliment of saying that if his text went to a second edition he could use my proofs. But Πeter—ah, Πeter took me aside afterward and pointed out my kinks in delivering them, including body positioning and organizing diagrams and algebra on the board. Encouragingly, of course.</p>
<p>
Also a regular was my fellow Mertonian and chess master Dugald Macpherson. Neither of us was the most illustrious chess player to enter that room, for grandmaster Colin McNab obtained his doctorate under Πeter shortly after I finished. I was more impressed by stories of playing first-class cricket in Jamaica by the visiting Ken Johnson. Thirty years later, when I emerged from my car in Princeton’s south campus parking lot and boarded a jitney going to the 2012 Alan Turing Centennial event covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/turings-tiger-birthday-party/">here</a>, there was Johnson—who is now a professor at Penn State. Other students I have particular memories of there are Muhammad Audu, Jacinta Covington, and Tim Penttila.</p>
<p>
One quirky memory was coming in on Tuesday, Oct. 25, 1983, to find everyone around a radio bringing bulletins of the US invasion of Grenada which had begun at local dawn. After some pointed anti-imperialist disapproval they did get into math, but my mind stayed on Grenada as I composed in my head a steel-drum melody and the first verse of a still-unfinished <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/Writing/GrenadaAfter.txt">song</a> about the event. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Another Memory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Because his OBE from Queen Elizabeth in 2008 says Peter not Πeter, I will revert to the former. This was cited for services to mathematics education. He not only won other prizes, he has a prize named after him: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Society_for_the_History_of_Mathematics#Neumann_Prize">Neumann Prize</a> by the British Society for the History of Mathematics. Peter served once as its president and also led the British Mathematical Association—whose logo spells its name with a lowercase <img alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\alpha}"/>.</p>

<p>
From various experiences I can aver that Peter took a <em>whole-person</em> approach to education. He followed the lives of his former students and I heard stories of social occasions in both Britain and France. He also wrote the Oxford Mathematical Institute’s <a href="https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/view_material/1160">guide</a> to TeX and LaTeX for students. </p>
<p>
In May, 1984, the Institute organized an outing to a Mathematics Day at the University of Warwick near Coventry, about 55 miles north of Oxford. Peter organized about a dozen for the trip—whether this was everyone coming from Oxford, and whether we had one shuttle or separate cars, I do not recall. </p>
<p>
What I do recall is that he did not simply take us to and from the workshop. He planned a picnic en-route at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollright_Stones">Rollright Stones</a>, which are along a road at the Oxon-Warks border. I had not previously seen a Celtic stone circle. He told stories of its history. I also believe that after the meeting we took a drive into Coventry with a brief stop to walk around the cathedral to see the damage from World War II, but it is possible I am conflating that with a time the Oxford chess team played a match in Coventry.</p>

</p><p/><h2> Instances and Problems in Ancient Complexity </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Peter carried the Neumann pedigree in group theory, for it was the specialty of both his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Neumann">mother</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Neumann">father</a>. He supervised another friend from Merton, Julia Tompson, in a thesis on the history of the Jordan-Hölder theorem. But I will discuss a contribution in which group theory is in the background—where I can put ideas from computational complexity in the foreground.</p>
<p>
Our May 2014 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/stoc-1500/">post</a> “STOC 1500” had a semi-serious intent of aligning famous classical problems of geometric (non-)constructibility with modern complexity theory. It has a fantasized keynote by the chess master and mathematician Luca Pacioli introducing the “<img alt="{\mathcal{NC=C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC%3DC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC=C}}"/>?” problem: using Euclid’s ruler and compass alone, can one trisect an angle, double a cube, or (going beyond <img alt="{\mathcal{NC}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC}}"/>) square a circle? Much as we’re at pains to say that “<img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>” does <em>not</em> stand for “non-polynomial,” the name “<img alt="{\mathcal{NC}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC}}"/>” does not stand for “non-constructible” but rather constructible by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neusis_construction">neusis</a>, meaning using fixed marks on a rotatable ruler. Of course, now we know that <img alt="{\mathcal{NC \neq C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC+%5Cneq+C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC \neq C}}"/>, a fact often attributed to Galois theory but, as Peter noted in his <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/~pleite/pub/artigos/neumann/reflections_on_reflection_on_spherical_mirror.pdf">paper</a>, provable from simpler considerations about field extensions.</p>
<p>
Both “Ancient Complexity” and computational complexity have a key distinction between <em>instances</em> and <em>problems</em>. Trisecting a <img alt="{90^\circ}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B90%5E%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{90^\circ}"/> angle is an easy instance. If <img alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\alpha}"/> is a <em>constructible angle</em>, then the angle <img alt="{\beta = 3\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta+%3D+3%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\beta = 3\alpha}"/> can be trisected—but the method is <em>ad hoc</em> to that instance, not a single algorithm that given only <img alt="{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\beta}"/> would efficiently discover how to trisect it. There are algorithms that work correctly on multiple angles but not on all of them.</p>
<p>
What is most different from computational complexity is that there are single instances that cannot be solved, such as <img alt="{\alpha = 60^\circ}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+60%5E%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\alpha = 60^\circ}"/>. It is not a case of a Euclid-based algorithm taking too long: no <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> algorithm can construct a <img alt="{20^\circ}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20%5E%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{20^\circ}"/> angle, period. This is akin to how a single string can be <em>incompressible</em> in Kolmogorov complexity, but without the latter’s dependence on a reference universal compression scheme.</p>
<p>
Another difference is problems, such as doubling the cube and squaring the circle, that essentially have only one instance. One can impose algebraic coordinates to represent different instances of them, but that is different from defining the coordinates from features of a given instance, as allowed when marking a ruler for <em>neusis</em>.  Peter’s paper speaks these problem/instance distinctions well.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Reflection Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen's_problem">problem</a> addressed in Peter’s paper was formulated by Ptolemy in the year 150. Given a circle <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/> and points <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a}"/> and <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b}"/>, both inside <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/> or both outside <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/>, construct a point <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{p}"/> on <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/> so that light starting from <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a}"/> will reflect at <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{p}"/> and go to <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b}"/>. When the points are inside, this is imagined as shooting a perfect billiard ball from <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a}"/> off a circular rim to hit <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b}"/>.</p>

<p/><p><br/>
There are two algorithms in <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> that correctly solve an infinite set of instances, namely points <img alt="{a',b'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%2Cb%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a',b'}"/> equidistant from the center <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{0}"/> of the circle.

The other (shown in the above figure) first finds the intersections of the rays from <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{0}"/> to <img alt="{a',b'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%2Cb%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a',b'}"/> with <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/>, bisects the line segment connecting them, and uses that to project outward to <img alt="{p'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{p'}"/>. The latter algorithm also works on points <img alt="{a'',b''}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%27%2Cb%27%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a'',b''}"/> that are collinear with the rays to <img alt="{a'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a'}"/> and <img alt="{b'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b'}"/>, respectively, while the former is correct for pairs taken from the lines through <img alt="{a'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a'}"/> and <img alt="{b'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b'}"/> that are parallel to <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{R}"/>.

Around the year 1020, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham presented a geometric algorithm that works in all cases, <a href="https://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Math/Aydin/Teach/128/AlHazenProblem.pdf">using</a> conic sections in ways equivalent to <em>neusis</em> and further <a href="http://nyjm.albany.edu/j/2000/6-8.pdf">characterized</a> this millennium by Roger Alperin of San José State. The problem was apparently not shown to be outside <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> until a 1965 <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27968003?refreqid=excelsior_b4edd5f21fda45f74dd56724556a7a87&amp;seq=1">paper</a> by Jack Elkin. </p>
<p>
After considering solvable cases like the above in his paper, Elkin ended by giving a single non-<img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> case, analogous to <img alt="{60^\circ}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B60%5E%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{60^\circ}"/> for the trisection problem. His example did show the general algebraic ingredients. What Peter did in his 1998 <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/~pleite/pub/artigos/neumann/reflections_on_reflection_on_spherical_mirror.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Obituaries/Al-Haytham_Telegraph/">evidently</a> <a href="https://www-jstor-org.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/stable/3620392">unaware</a> of Elkin’s, was to characterize all the <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/>-solvable cases and show that they form a set of measure zero. Thus, he gave a rigorous sense in which <em>almost all</em> instances of the reflection problem are not <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/>-solvable. The algebra and lemmas about field extensions and irreducibility are especially pretty in Peter’s paper.</p>

Discovering Alperin’s equivalences while writing this post leads me to re-pose this question from the “STOC 1500” <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/stoc-1500/">post</a>: is there a single problem that is <img alt="{\mathcal{NC}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC}}"/>-complete under <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/>-reductions?</p>

It somehow manages to be clunkier than either svn or git by themselves. I understand why svn’s linear history forces compromise, but mostly I tend to keep a linear history anyway. I just want git pull and push to work, but instead I have to learn new un-mnemonic commands (for which <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/images-git/7/78/Git-svn-cheatsheet.pdf">the cheatsheet of equivalences from svn to git-svn</a> was helpful). The only advantage over svn that I found was you have a local copy of the history, although in the comments David Bremner suggests more.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div>For the result of the year we go to all the way back to the "before times".</div><blockquote><div><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP*=RE</a> by Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright and Henry Yuen</div></blockquote><div>A follow up to last year's runner up <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">NEEXP in MIP*</a>, the new paper shows how to prove everything computable and beyond to a polytime verifier with two provers who cannot communicate but share entangled quantum bits. The result had a bit of a scare but <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/10/mip-re-redux.html">fixed up this fall</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>Honorary mention goes to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01409">beating the Christofides-Serdyukov approximation</a> for traveling salesman by Anna R.

The word of the year for academia is "virtual", virtual teaching, virtual research collaborations, virtual talks, virtual conferences, virtual panels and virtual job visits. For the most part the the pandemic hasn't really created new trends but accelerated trends already in place. Given the far lower costs in terms of time, money and the environment, how much of "virtual" will remain post-corona?</div><div><br/></div><div>Bill's published a new book on <a href="https://amzn.to/3avH9J9">muffin problems</a>, his second book in two years.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I hope everyone is enjoying a New Years’ as festive as the circumstances allow!</p>



<p>I’ve heard from a bunch of you awaiting my next post on the continuum hypothesis, and it’s a-comin’, but I confess the new, faster-spreading covid variant is giving me the same sinking feeling that Covid 1.0 gave me in late February, making it <em>really</em> hard to think about the eternal.  (For perspectives on Covid 2.0 from individuals who acquitted themselves well with their early warnings about Covid 1.0, see for example <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/12/26/seeing-the-new-covid-variant-smoke/">this by Jacob Falkovich</a>, or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CHtwDXy63BsLkQx4n/covid-12-24-we-re-f-ed-it-s-over">this by Zvi Mowshowitz</a>.)</p>



<p>So on that note: do you hold any opinions, on factual matters of practical importance, that most everyone around you sharply disagrees with?  Opinions that those who you respect consider ignorant, naïve, imprudent, and well outside your sphere of expertise?  Opinions that, nevertheless, you simply continue to hold, because you’ve learned that, <em>unless and until</em> someone shows you the light, you can no more will yourself to change what you think about the matter than change your blood type?</p>



<p>I try to have as few such opinions as possible.  Having run <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> for fifteen years, I’m acutely aware of the success rate of those autodidacts who think they’ve solved P versus NP or quantum gravity or whatever.  It’s basically zero out of hundreds—and why wouldn’t it be?</p>



<p>And yet there’s one issue where I feel myself in the unhappy epistemic situation of those amateurs, spamming the professors in all-caps.  So, OK, here it is:</p>



<p><strong>I think that, in a well-run civilization, the first covid vaccines would’ve been tested and approved by around March or April 2020, while mass-manufacturing simultaneously ramped up with <em>trillions</em> of dollars’ investment.  I think almost everyone on earth could have, and should have, already been vaccinated by now.  I think a faster, “WWII-style” approach would’ve saved millions of lives, prevented economic destruction, and carried negligible risks compared to its benefits.  I think this will be clear to future generations, who’ll write PhD theses exploring how it was possible that we invented multiple effective covid vaccines in mere days or weeks, but then simply <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">sat on those vaccines for a year</a>, ticking off boxes called “Phase I,” “Phase II,” etc. while civilization hung in the balance.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve said similar things, on this blog and elsewhere, since the beginning of the pandemic, but part of me kept expecting events to teach me why I was wrong.  Instead events—including the staggering cost of delay, the spectacular failures of institutional authorities to adapt to the scientific realities of covid, and the long-awaited finding that <em>all</em> the major vaccines safely work (some better than others), just like the experts predicted back in February—all this only made me more confident of my original, stupid and naïve position.</p>



<p>I’m saying all this—clearly enough that no one will misunderstand—but I’m also scared to say it.  I’m scared because it sounds too much like colossal <em>ingratitude</em>, like Monday-morning quarterbacking of one of the great heroic achievements of our era by someone who played no part in it.</p>



<p>Let’s be clear: the ~11 months that it took to get from sequencing the novel coronavirus, to approving and mass-manufacturing vaccines, is a world record, soundly beating the previous record of 4 years.  Nobel Prizes and billions of dollars are the <em>least</em> that those who made it happen deserve.  Eternal praise is especially due to those like <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mrna-coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-biontech?fbclid=IwAR0uTyPvEyhlia7tvlH3XFx8kVrCyx0A8IIy8ALVSrUJ8m7jV4b8E7mf-Ec">Katalin Karikó</a>, who risked their careers in the decades before covid to do the basic research on mRNA delivery that made the development of <em>these</em> mRNA vaccines so blindingly fast.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I could easily believe that there’s no one agent—neither Pfizer nor BioNTech nor Moderna, neither the CDC nor FDA nor other health or regulatory agencies, neither Bill Gates nor Moncef Slaoui—who could’ve unilaterally sped things up very much.  If one of them tried, they would’ve simply been ostracized by the other parts of the system, and they probably all understood that.  It might have taken a whole different civilization, with different attitudes about utility and risk.</p>



<p>And yet the fact remains that, historic though it was, a one-to-two-year turnaround time <em>wasn’t nearly good enough</em>.  Especially once we factor in the faster-spreading variant, by the time we’ve vaccinated everyone, we’ll already be a large fraction of the way to herd immunity and to the vaccine losing its purpose.  For all the advances in civilization, from believing in demonic spirits all the way to <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">understanding mRNA at a machine-code level of detail</a>, covid is running wild much like it would have back in the Middle Ages—partly, yes, because modern transportation helps it spread, but partly also because our political and regulatory and public-health tools have lagged so breathtakingly behind our knowledge of molecular biology.</p>



<p>What could’ve been done faster?  For starters, as I said back in March, we could’ve had <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/">human challenge trials</a> with willing volunteers, of whom there were tens of thousands.  We could’ve started mass-manufacturing months earlier, with funding commensurate with the problem’s scale (think trillions, not billions).  Today, we could give as many people as possible the first doses (which apparently already provide something like ~80% protection) before circling back to give the second doses (which boost the protection as high as ~95%).  We could <em>distribute the vaccines that are now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/30/covid-vaccine-delay/">sitting in warehouses, spoiling</a>, while people in the distribution chain take off for the holidays</em>—but that’s such low-hanging fruit that it feels unsporting even to mention it.</p>



<p>Let me now respond to three counterarguments that would surely come up in the comments if I didn’t address them.</p>



<ol><li><strong>The Argument from Actual Risk.</strong>  Every time this subject arises, someone patiently explains to me that, since a vaccine gets administered to billions of <em>healthy</em> people, the standards for its safety and efficacy need to be even higher than they are for ordinary medicines.  Of course that’s true, and it strikes me as an excellent reason not to inject people with a <em>completely</em> untested vaccine!  All I ask is that the people who are, or could be, harmed by a faulty vaccine, be weighed on the same moral scale as the people harmed by covid itself.  As an example, we know that the Phase III clinical trials were repeatedly halted for days or weeks because of a single participant developing strange symptoms—often a participant who’d received the placebo rather than the actual vaccine!  That person matters.  Any future vaccine recipient who might develop similar symptoms matters.  But <em>the 10,000 people who die of covid every single day we delay</em>, along with the hundreds of millions more impoverished, kept out of school, etc., matter equally.  If we threw them all onto the same utilitarian scale, would we be making the same tradeoffs that we are now?  I feel like the question answers itself.<br/></li><li><strong>The Argument from Perceived Risk.</strong>  Even <em>with</em> all the testing that’s been done, somewhere between 16% and 40% of Americans (depending on which poll you believe) say that they’ll refuse to get a covid vaccine, often because of anti-vaxx conspiracy theories.  How much higher would the percentage be had the vaccines been rushed out in a month or two?  And of course, if not enough people get vaccinated, then R<sub>0</sub> remains above 1 and the public-health campaign is a failure.  In this way of thinking, we need three phases of clinical trials the same way we need everyone to take off their shoes at airport security: it might not prevent a single terrorist, but the masses will be too scared to get on the planes if we don’t.  To me, this (if true) only underscores my broader point, that the year-long delay in getting vaccines out represents a failure of <em>our entire civilization</em>, rather than a failure of any one agent.  But also: people’s membership in the pro- or anti-vaxx camps is not static.  The percentage saying they’ll get a covid vaccine seems to have <em>already</em> gone up, as a formerly abstract question becomes a stark choice between wallowing in delusions and getting a deadly disease, or accepting reality and not getting it.  So while the Phase III trials were still underway—when the vaccines were already known to be safe, and experts thought it much more likely than not that they’d work—would it have been such a disaster to let Pfizer and Moderna sell the vaccines, for a hefty profit, <em>to those who wanted them</em>?  With the hope that, just like with the iPhone or any other successful consumer product, satisfied early adopters would inspire the more reticent to get in line too?<br/></li><li><strong>The Argument from Trump.</strong>  Now for the most awkward counterargument, which I’d like to address head-on rather than dodge.  If the vaccines had been approved faster in the US, it would’ve <em>looked</em> to many like Trump deserved credit for it, and he might well have been reelected.  And devastating though covid has been, Trump is plausibly worse!  Here’s my response: Trump has the mentality of a toddler, albeit with curiosity swapped out for cruelty and vindictiveness.  His and his cronies’ impulsivity, self-centeredness, and incompetence are likely responsible for at least ~200,000 of the 330,000 Americans now dead from covid.  But, yes, reversing his previous anti-vaxx stance, Trump <em>did</em> say that he wanted to see a covid vaccine in months, just like I’ve said.  Does it make me uncomfortable to have America’s worst president in my “camp”?  Only a little, because I have no problem admitting that sometimes toddlers are right and experts are wrong.  The solution, I’d say, is <em>not</em> to put toddlers in charge of the government!  As should be obvious by now—indeed, as should’ve been obvious back in 2016—that solution has some exceedingly severe downsides.  The solution, rather, is to work for a world where experts are unafraid to speak bluntly, so that it never <em>falls</em> to a mental toddler to say what the experts can’t say without jeopardizing their careers.</li></ol>



<p>Anyway, despite everything I’ve written, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410">considerations of Aumann’s Agreement Theorem</a> still lead me to believe there’s an excellent chance that I’m wrong, and the vaccines couldn’t realistically have been rolled out any faster.  The trouble is, I don’t understand <em>why</em>.  And I don’t understand why compressing this process, from a year or two to at most a month or two, shouldn’t be civilization’s most urgent priority ahead of the <em>next</em> pandemic.  So go ahead, explain it to me!  I’ll be eternally grateful to whoever makes me retract this post in shame.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Jan. 1, 2021):</span></strong> If you want a sense of the on-the-ground realities of administering the vaccine in the US, check out <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/12/31/covid-12-31-meet-the-new-year/">this long post by Zvi Mowshowitz</a>.  Briefly, it looks like in my post, I gave those in charge <em>way too much benefit of the doubt</em> <em>(!!)</em>.  The Trump administration pledged to administer 20 million vaccines by the end of 2020; instead it administered fewer than 3 million.  Crucially, this is not because of any problem with manufacturing or supply, but just because of pure bureaucratic blank-facedness.  Incredibly, even as the pandemic rages, most of the vaccines are sitting in storage, at severe risk of spoiling … and officials’ primary concern is not to administer the precious doses, but just to make sure no one gets a dose “out of turn.”  In contrast to Israel, where they’re now administering vaccines 24/7, including on Shabbat, with the goal being to get through the entire population as quickly as possible, in the US they’re moving at a snail’s pace and took off for the holidays.  In Wisconsin, a pharmacist intentionally spoiled hundreds of doses; in West Virginia, they mistakenly gave antibody treatments instead of vaccines.  There are no longer any terms to understand what’s happening other than those of black comedy.</p></div>

    <title>19th Century Precursors of Polynomial Methods</title>
    <summary>These days, I’m spending a lot of time revising my book about polynomial methods and incidences (an older draft is available here). This led me to the following conclusion: I am not sure what classifies a proof as a polynomial method. A Wikipedia page states “… the polynomial method is an algebraic approach to combinatorics problems that involves […]</summary>

    <title>TR20-193 |  Average-case rigidity lower bounds | 

	Xuangui Huang, 

	Emanuele Viola</title>
    <summary>It is shown that there exists $f : \{0,1\}^{n/2} \times \{0,1\}^{n/2} \to \{0,1\}$ in E$^\mathbf{NP}$ such that for every $2^{n/2} \times 2^{n/2}$ matrix $M$ of rank $\le \rho$ we have $\P_{x,y}[f(x,y)\ne M_{x,y}] \ge 1/2-2^{-\Omega(k)}$, where $k \leq \Theta(\sqrt{n})$ and $\log \rho \leq \delta n/k(\log n + k)$ for a sufficiently small $\delta &gt; 0$.  
This generalizes recent results which bound below the probability by $1/2-\Omega(1)$ or apply to constant-depth circuits.
The result is a step towards obtaining data-structure lower bounds for E$^\mathbf{NP}$: they would follow from a better trade-off between the probability bound and $\rho$.</summary>
