    <title>Sparse Euclidean Spanners with Tiny Diameter: A Tight Lower Bound</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1639699200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Le:Hung.html">Hung Le</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Milenkovic:Lazar.html">Lazar Milenkovic</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Solomon:Shay.html">Shay Solomon</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09124">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In STOC'95 [ADMSS95] Arya et al. showed that any set of $n$ points in
$\mathbb R^d$ admits a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with hop-diameter at most 2
(respectively, 3) and $O(n \log n)$ edges (resp., $O(n \log \log n)$ edges).
They also gave a general upper bound tradeoff of hop-diameter at most $k$ and
$O(n \alpha_k(n))$ edges, for any $k \ge 2$.
</p>
<p>The function $\alpha_k$ is the inverse of a certain Ackermann-style function
at the $\lfloor k/2 \rfloor$th level of the primitive recursive hierarchy,
where $\alpha_0(n) = \lceil n/2 \rceil, \alpha_1(n) = \left\lceil \sqrt{n}
\right\rceil, \alpha_2(n) = \lceil \log{n} \rceil, \alpha_3(n) = \lceil
\log\log{n} \rceil, \alpha_4(n) = \log^* n, \alpha_5(n) = \lfloor \frac{1}{2}
\log^*n \rfloor$, \ldots. Roughly speaking, for $k \ge 2$ the function
$\alpha_{k}$ is close to $\lfloor \frac{k-2}{2} \rfloor$-iterated log-star
function, i.e., $\log$ with $\lfloor \frac{k-2}{2} \rfloor$ stars.
</p>
<p>Whether or not this tradeoff is tight has remained open, even for the cases
$k = 2$ and $k = 3$. Two lower bounds are known: The first applies only to
spanners with stretch 1 and the second is sub-optimal and applies only to
sufficiently large (constant) values of $k$. In this paper we prove a tight
lower bound for any constant $k$: For any fixed $\epsilon &gt; 0$, any
$(1+\epsilon)$-spanner for the uniform line metric with hop-diameter at most
$k$ must have at least $\Omega(n \alpha_k(n))$ edges.

    <title>Non-Gaussian Component Analysis via Lattice Basis Reduction</title>

Kane</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09104">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) is the following distribution learning
problem: Given i.i.d. samples from a distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that is
non-gaussian in a hidden direction $v$ and an independent standard Gaussian in
the orthogonal directions, the goal is to approximate the hidden direction $v$.
Prior work \cite{DKS17-sq} provided formal evidence for the existence of an
information-computation tradeoff for NGCA under appropriate moment-matching
conditions on the univariate non-gaussian distribution $A$. The latter result
does not apply when the distribution $A$ is discrete. A natural question is
whether information-computation tradeoffs persist in this setting. In this
paper, we answer this question in the negative by obtaining a sample and
computationally efficient algorithm for NGCA in the regime that $A$ is discrete
or nearly discrete, in a well-defined technical sense. The key tool leveraged
in our algorithm is the LLL method \cite{LLL82} for lattice basis reduction.

    <title>Hierarchical Clustering: $O(1)$-Approximation for Well-Clustered Graphs</title>

clusters of successively smaller size, and is a fundamental problem in data
analysis. In this work we study the cost function for hierarchical clustering
introduced by Dasgupta, and present two polynomial-time approximation
algorithms: Our first result is an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for graphs of
high conductance. Our simple construction bypasses complicated recursive
routines of finding sparse cuts known in the literature. Our second and main
result is an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for a wide family of graphs that
exhibit a well-defined structure of clusters. This result generalises the
previous state-of-the-art, which holds only for graphs generated from
stochastic models. The significance of our work is demonstrated by the
empirical analysis on both synthetic and real-world data sets, on which our
presented algorithm outperforms the previously proposed algorithm for graphs
with a well-defined cluster structure.

NP-complete, and requires time $2^{\Omega(n/\log n)}$ unless the
Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails. Along the way, we give an elementary proof
that $n$-vertex graphs subdivided at least $2 \log n$ times have twin-width at
most 4. We also show how to encode trigraphs $H$ (2-edge colored graphs
involved in the definition of twin-width) into graphs $G$, in the sense that
every $d$-sequence (sequence of vertex contractions witnessing that the
twin-width is at most $d$) of $G$ inevitably creates $H$ as an induced
subtrigraph, whereas there exists a partial $d$-sequence that actually goes

problem with applications in operations research, combinatorial optimization,
quantum information science, and beyond. In this work, we propose variational
quantum algorithms for approximately solving SDPs. For one class of SDPs, we
provide a rigorous analysis of their convergence to approximate locally optimal
solutions, under the assumption that they are weakly constrained (i.e., $N\gg
M$, where $N$ is the dimension of the input matrices and $M$ is the number of
constraints). We also provide algorithms for a more general class of SDPs that
requires fewer assumptions. Finally, we numerically simulate our quantum
algorithms for applications such as MaxCut, and the results of these
simulations provide evidence that convergence still occurs in noisy settings.

graphs via delaying operations; a problem that captures real-world applications
varying from information flows to distribution schedules. In a temporal graph
there is a set of fixed vertices and the available connections between them
change over time in a predefined manner. We observe that, in some cases, the
delay of some connections can in fact decrease the time required to reach from
some vertex (source) to another vertex (target). We study how we can minimize
the maximum time a set of source vertices needs to reach every other vertex of
the graph when we are allowed to delay some of the connections of the graph.
For one source, we prove that the problem is W[2]-hard and NP-hard, when
parameterized by the number of allowed delays. On the other hand, we derive a
polynomial-time algorithm for one source and unbounded number of delays. This
is the best we can hope for; we show that the problem becomes NP-hard when
there are two sources and the number of delays is not bounded. We complement
our negative result by providing an FPT algorithm parameterized by the
treewidth of the graph plus the lifetime of the optimal solution. Finally, we
provide polynomial-time algorithms for several classes of graphs.

combination with an appropriate mixing ratio to load each truck that will yield
a maximum profit when sold to a set of local grain elevators. In this paper, we

finding the optimal solutions for the grain mixing problem remains hard. These

different graph and network analysis applications, such as modelling movement
or flow in networks. In essence, the RSP framework considers the
temperature-dependent Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution over paths in the network.
At low temperatures, the distribution focuses solely on the shortest or
least-cost paths, while with increasing temperature, the distribution spreads
over random walks on the network. Many relevant quantities can be computed
conveniently from this distribution, and these often generalize traditional
network measures in a sensible way. However, when modelling real phenomena with
RSPs, one needs a principled way of estimating the parameters from data. In
this work, we develop methods for computing the maximum likelihood estimate of
the model parameters, with focus on the temperature parameter, when modelling
phenomena based on movement, flow, or spreading processes. We test the validity
of the derived methods with trajectories generated on artificial networks as
well as with real data on the movement of wild reindeer in a geographic
landscape, used for estimating the degree of randomness in the movement of the
animals. These examples demonstrate the attractiveness of the RSP framework as
a generic model to be used in diverse applications.

similarity measure with a classical dynamic programming solution taking
quadratic time. Despite significant efforts, little progress was made in
improving the runtime. Even in the realm of approximation, not much was known
for linear time algorithms beyond the trivial $\sqrt{n}$-approximation. Recent
breakthrough result provided a $n^{0.497}$-factor approximation algorithm
[HSSS19], which was more recently improved to a $n^{0.4}$-factor one [BCD21].
The latter paper also showed a $n^{2-2.5\alpha}$ time algorithm which outputs a
$n^{\alpha}$ approximation to the LCS, but so far no sub-polynomial
approximation is known in truly subquadratic time.
</p>
<p>In this work, we show an algorithm which runs in $O(n)$ time, and outputs a
$n^{o(1)}$-factor approximation to LCS$(x,y)$, with high probability, for any
pair of length $n$ input strings.
</p>
<p>Our entire algorithm is merely an efficient black-box reduction to the
Block-LIS problem, introduced very recently in [ANSS21], and solving the
Block-LIS problem directly.

ACM '21] outlines the existence and the
fatal impact of collusion rings in academic peer reviewing. We introduce and
analyze the problem Cycle-Free Reviewing that aims at finding a review
assignment without the following kind of collusion ring: A sequence of
reviewers each reviewing a paper authored by the next reviewer in the sequence
(with the last reviewer reviewing a paper of the first), thus creating a review
cycle where each reviewer gives favorable reviews. As a result, all papers in
that cycle have a high chance of acceptance independent of their respective
scientific merit.
</p>
<p>We observe that review assignments computed using a standard Linear
Programming approach typically admit many short review cycles. On the negative
side, we show that Cycle-Free Reviewing is NP-hard in various restricted cases
(i.e., when every author is qualified to review all papers and one wants to
prevent that authors review each other's or their own papers or when every
author has only one paper and is only qualified to review few papers). On the
positive side, among others, we show that, in some realistic settings, an
assignment without any review cycles of small length always exists. This result
also gives rise to an efficient heuristic for computing (weighted) cycle-free
review assignments, which we show to be of excellent quality in practice.

we identify locations in an image that are critical for topology. By focusing
on these critical locations, we propose a new homotopy warping loss to train
deep image segmentation networks for better topological accuracy. To
efficiently identity these topologically critical locations, we propose a new
algorithm exploiting the distance transform. The proposed algorithm, as well as
the loss function, naturally generalize to different topological structures in
both 2D and 3D settings. The proposed loss function helps deep nets achieve
better performance in terms of topology-aware metrics, outperforming

    <title>Backpropagation ≠ Chain Rule</title>
    <summary>The chain rule is a fundamental result in calculus. Roughly speaking, it states that if a variable is a differentiable function of intermediate variables , and each intermediate variable is itself a differentiable function of , then we can compute the derivative as follows: Besides being a handy tool for computing derivatives in calculus homework, the chain rule is closely related to the backpropagation algorithm that is widely-used for computing derivatives (gradients) in neural network training. This blog post by Boaz Barak is a beautiful tutorial on the chain rule and the backpropagation algorithm. As in Barak’s post, the backpropagation algorithm is usually taught as an application of the chain rule in machine learning classes. This leads to a common belief that “backpropagation is just applying the chain rule repeatedly”. While this is in a sense true, we wish to point out in this blog post that this belief is over-simplifying and can lead to incorrect implementations of the backpropagation algorithm. It has been discussed in many blog posts that backpropagation is not just the chain rule, but we want to focus on a simple and basic difference here. Consider the “neural network” above: it consists of an input variable , [...]</summary>

<p>Besides being a handy tool for computing derivatives in calculus homework, the chain rule is closely related to the backpropagation algorithm that is widely-used for computing derivatives (gradients) in neural network training. This <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/11/03/yet-another-backpropagation-tutorial/">blog post</a> by Boaz Barak is a beautiful tutorial on the chain rule and the backpropagation algorithm.</p>



<p>As in Barak’s post, the backpropagation algorithm is usually taught as an application of the chain rule in machine learning classes. This leads to a common belief that “backpropagation is just applying the chain rule repeatedly”. While this is in a sense true, we wish to point out in this blog post that this belief is over-simplifying and can lead to incorrect implementations of the backpropagation algorithm. It has been discussed in many <a href="https://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2017/08/18/backprop-is-not-just-the-chain-rule/">blog</a> <a href="https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/optml/2018/04/28/backpropagation-is-not-just-the-chain-rule/">posts</a> that backpropagation is not just the chain rule, but we want to focus on a simple and basic difference here.</p>

<p>Consider the “neural network” above: it consists of an input variable <img alt="a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, an output variable <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and two intermediate variables <img alt="b_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="b_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The neural network describes <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as a function of <img alt="a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the following way:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\begin{aligned}b_1 = 2a,\ b_2 = 3a + b_1,\ c = 4b_1 + 5b_2.\end{aligned}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7Db_1+%3D+2a%2C%5C+b_2+%3D+3a+%2B+b_1%2C%5C+c+%3D+4b_1+%2B+5b_2.%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Using the chain rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a> twice, we can compute the derivative <img alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as follows:</p>

<p>In the calculations above, note the difference between partial and full derivatives. For example, the partial derivative <img alt="\frac{\partial b_2}{\partial a} = 3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_2%7D%7B%5Cpartial+a%7D+%3D+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, whereas the full derivative <img alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} b_2}{{\mathrm d} a} = 3\times 1 + 1\times 2 = 5" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_2%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D+%3D+3%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+2+%3D+5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Similarly, the partial derivative <img alt="\frac{\partial c}{\partial b_1} = 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_1%7D+%3D+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, whereas the full derivative <img alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} b_1} = 5\times 1 + 1\times 4 = 9" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_1%7D+%3D+5%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+4+%3D+9&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Intuitively, for every edge in the graph, we can compute the corresponding partial derivative locally (after the <em>forward pass</em>, to be precise), but a full derivative may require longer calculations.</p>



<p>Now it should be clear that equation <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> cannot be <em>directly</em> explained as the standard chain rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a>. The key difference is that in the chain rule, we need partial derivatives of a single variable w.r.t. multiple other variables, whereas in <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a>, we need partial derivatives of multiple variables w.r.t. the same variable.</p>



<p>Of course, one can prove the correctness of backpropagation using the chain rule in various ways, but the simple proof “backpropagation uses the standard chain rule at every step” is incomplete. Also, it is certainly possible to compute derivatives (gradients) on a neural network directly using the chain rule similarly to <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-2">(2)</a>, but in neural network training one typically wants to calculate the derivatives of a single output variable w.r.t. a large number of input variables, in which case backpropagation allows a more efficient implementation than using the standard chain rule directly.</p></div>

<p>A few hours ago <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/combinatorial_theory">the first issue of <em>Combinatorial Theory</em></a> was published. I am happy and proud to take part in this new endeavor. The editorial speaks for itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is the first issue of our new journal, </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. It is owned by mathematicians, dedicated to Diamond Open Access publishing with no fees for authors or readers, and committed to an inclusive view of the vibrant worldwide community in Combinatorics. The journal shares a similar scope with the long-running </em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A<em>(JCT A), owned by Elsevier. In 2020, almost all of the editors of JCT A resigned, deciding that it was the time to found a premier Combinatorics journal owned by mathematicians, not by a commercial publisher. Thus was born </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. That birth has allowed us to rethink how and what we publish. We are proud to have assembled a broad and diverse team of editors. We are also pleased with two new features in our editorial process: </em>doubly-anonymous refereeing<em> to mitigate implicit biases during peer review, and the inauguration of </em>Expository Article<em> submissions to encourage inclusion of valuable well-written expositions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also have warm feelings toward <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A</em> and the earlier <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory</em> (before it split to Ser A and Ser B), which was among the first journals of combinatorics, had important role for the development of our field, and which is still running under new editors.</p>

    <title>Near-Optimal Distributed Degree+1 Colouring</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If you are interested in graph colouring, and specifically in distributed algorithms for that classic problem, I strongly recommend the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00604" target="_blank">recent paper</a> posted by Magnús M. Halldórsson, Fabian Kuhn, Alexandre Nolin and Tigran Tonoyan. (For the record, three of the authors work, or have worked, in my department at Reykjavik University, so I am biased.) </p><p>The above-mentioned paper addresses the problem of finding a proper colouring of a graph when each node <i>v</i> has a palette of degree(<i>v</i>)+1 colours at its disposal. The paper resolves an open problem in distributed colouring and simplifies known results in doing so. As a byproduct of their results, the authors obtain improved streaming and sub-linear time algorithms.   See the paper for much more information on the context for this result and the technical details. </p><p>Congratulations to the authors!</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m on the ICALP 2022 program committee (PC) and was apparently the first to complain when I saw the draft call for papers, and I asked that the requirement that <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=17">submissions must be in LIPIcs style</a> be put to a vote.  Despite substantial support among the PC for not requiring the majority of authors to squander their time formatting in an exotic style submissions that will be rejected, the Supreme Court blocked the vote.  Their main rationale seems to be ensuring correspondence between submissions and proceedings.  Ironically, at the same time other conferences are allowing authors to publish in proceedings an <em>abridged </em>version of the (accepted) submission, to make it easier to publish the paper in a journal (which may not want to have a full version already in a conference).  We are at the nadir in history where human effort is systematically wasted to produce versions that do not even pretend to be useful for readers — only to check boxes.</p>



<p>When I was at the IAS and was briefed about logistics, I was stunned when they asked me if I type my own papers, or if I needed help with that.  I guess the next level will be if you need help with formatting your submissions.</p>



<p>Picture a 100-year old retired scientist who followed the field for 75 years, and who wants to make one more contribution.  Even though they are no match for the raw power of a 15-year old, their ability to draw connections almost makes up for it, and their perspective is invaluable to the community.  This scientist, whose equipment consists of a desktop from two human generations ago, miraculously held together and kept working through sheer love and intimate knowledge, is now being asked to format their paper in LIPIcs style… or to ask someone else to do it for them (talk about fostering collaboration).</p>



<p>Here’s a non-exclusive list of true, terrible things about conferences, most of which were discussed earlier on this blog (see tag <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia-tcs/">utopia-tcs</a>):</p>



<ol><li>Requiring submissions in proceedings format.</li><li>Pre-registering papers by a deadline different than the submission deadline.</li><li>Requiring authors to submit a separate 2-page summary of the paper.</li><li>Ultra-strict page limits, summary rejection for any deviation.</li><li>Suddenly being forced on a short notice to submit a dummy .pdf so that PC assignments can be made.</li><li>Extending the list of topics two days before the deadline.</li><li>Moving deadlines.</li><li>Forcing authors to check multiple times the call for papers and/or constantly monitor email for any of these last-minute changes.</li><li>In the lucky case of acceptance, following up with a barrage of emails involving minutiae such as underfull \hbox.</li><li>Writing “this only takes 60 seconds.”  For me (and, apparently, many others — otherwise why delay answering emails that take 10 seconds to answer?) attending to <em>any</em> task, following <em>any</em> instruction, even “blink” or “say yes” has a huge fix cost, maybe 30 minutes.  So I translate 60 seconds to 31 minutes.</li><li>Hosting the conference in places which are inconvenient, for the attendees and planet earth.</li><li>Hosting the conference at times which are inconvenient for the attendees.</li><li>Requiring in-person PC meetings whose outcome does not justify the costs.</li></ol>



<p>As usual, people in a position of power do not have much incentive to fight to change the very practices that put them in that position in the first place.  But even this cynical remark doesn’t tell the whole story, since the practices got <em>worse</em> with time, unlike the case of journals.  One impression I have is that people have gotten so used to buggy software, constant updates, and general techno slavery that they just accept all of this as another inevitable misery in life… and by far not the worst!  This last point is important, as I think a seeping philosophy that permeates much of the discussion and the decisions is that much more important things are at stake, so who cares about this?  If you really want to spend cycles fixing something, then what about X?  (It’s fun to think where you end up if you stretch this point.)  But another life is possible.</p>



<p>One day, I will throw in my two cents and launch a new journal.  Besides being electronic and free (like ToC) it will have the following features.</p>



<ol><li>Papers, if accepted, will appear in the authors’ chosen format.  No conversion, and no additional effort, will be required for publication.  All the effort will be exclusively directed at improving the content of the paper.</li><li>Submissions can be by pdf attachment or by overlay, but not only to arxiv: to *any* repository.  In particular, authors will not be required to get their paper to compile on the arxiv.</li><li>The identities of the reviewers will be made public (in case of acceptance).  This I am still debating, but so far I am leaning towards it.  The problem that this is trying to address is that while you get reputation points for being on a program committee or on an editorial board, you don’t get many for being an unknown journal referee who is actually supposedly doing the hard work or finally really checking the proofs.  Instead with public identities people can show off the hard work and their role in the community, as happens on more recent platforms like say stackexchange.</li><li>Authors will be free to submit anonymously, or not.  This choice will be made by the authors, not dictated by a committee.</li><li>And perhaps the most consequential thing that I am still debating, should all submissions be public? (Maybe not.)</li></ol>



<p/>



<p>To finish on a high note, a great thing about conferences is the fast turn-around.  It is really depressing — in other fields — to have to wait so long for any quantifiable feedback on your work, and this is definitely something which I liked about the TCS community.  But, to come back to the mood of the post, this good aspect (and others) of conferences can probably be kept while rethinking the not so good.  (For example, there could be a journal with deadlines similar to conferences, which is also what happens for grant proposals etc.)</p>

    <title>TR21-179 |  Smoothed Complexity of Learning Disjunctive Normal Forms, Inverting Fourier Transforms, and Verifying Small Circuits | 

	tatsuie tsukiji</title>
    <summary>This paper aims to derandomize the following problems in the smoothed analysis of Spielman and Teng. Learn Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), invert Fourier Transforms (FT), and verify small circuits' unsatisfiability. Learning algorithms must predict a future observation from the only $m$ i.i.d. samples of a fixed but unknown joint-distribution $P(G(x),y)$ to explain an $\eta$-noisy target. Inverters must retrieve the hidden parameter $\theta$. The smoothed analysis can weaken the adversarial distribution $P(x,y)$ by injecting an appropriate perturbation $G$ with larger min-entropy $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G)$.  We will establish 1--10 for planted functions (Goldreich's PRG) $f_\theta(x) = f(\theta \circ x_1,\ldots,\theta \circ x_d)$ with variables $x_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,2n-1\}$ plugged into $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor)\oplus x_i$ in 1--4, $\theta\circ x_i := \theta_i \cdot \lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor \cdot (-1)^{x_i}\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 5--6, and $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor) \cdot (-1)^{x_i} \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 7. 8--10 will verify the unsatisfiability of small circuits in the worst case analysis (i.e., $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$). Suppose $\log n \gg \log (ds/\varepsilon) + k$ in 1--4. Randomly pick an example $(X,Y)$ from the observed $m$ data in 4.

At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$, $\mathrm{Max}k\mathrm{CSP}$ of any $k$-variate predicate $f$ requires the sample size $\Omega(n^{(k-\epsilon)/2}) \le m \le \tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ to distinguish between $|\max_\theta P(y=f_\theta(x)) - \max_\theta P'(y=f_\theta(x))| \ge \Omega(1)$ and $P(x,y) \equiv P'(x,y)$ in $n^{O(k)}$ time by given access to both samplers $P(x,y)$ and $P'(x,y)$.
2. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log s$, the planted $s$-term DNF demands $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log s)}$ for $c$ less than 1, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log s + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than 1, to make $n^{O(\log s)}$-time PAC learning (even under a slight noise).
3. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log 1/\varepsilon$, the $\mathrm{planted}$ $\mathrm{AND}$ needs $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$ for $c$ less than $1$, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log(1/\varepsilon) + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than $1$, to make $(\eta+\varepsilon)$-accurate agnostic learning in $n^{O(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$-time.
4. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(\log s)$, the $\mathrm{monotone}$ $\mathrm{DNF}$ with expanding $s$-terms is PAC learnable from $m = n\cdot \mathrm{poly}(s)$ data with $\mathrm{Pr}[\lfloor{{X_{i}/2}}\rfloor, \lfloor{{X_{i'}/2}}\rfloor] \ge {1}/{n^{1+\epsilon}}$  in $n \cdot \tilde{O}(s^{\log d})$ time.
5. LPN and LWE over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p\ge n^{\Omega(1)}$ hiding small secrets $\forall i, |\theta_i| = O(1)$ are breakable in polynomial time. 
6. GapSVP$_{\tilde{O}(n^2)}$ is breakable within polynomial time.
7. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(n)$, any $2^{n/2}$ by $2^{n/2}$ matrix with sparsity $2^{n-n^{\epsilon}}$ demands $\exp(n^{\Omega(1)})$ size $\mathrm{PH^{cc}}$ protocol unless it is learnable from $m = \exp(n^{\epsilon})$ data in $\exp(n^{\epsilon})$ time.
8. $\mathrm{VP} \ne \mathrm{VNP}$ or $\forall k, \mathrm{quasi}$-$NP \not\subset \mathrm{NC}^k$.
9. $\mathrm{PIT} \in \mathrm{DTIME}[n^{\mathrm{poly}(\log \log n)}]$ or $\forall \epsilon, \forall k, \mathrm{NTIME}[2^{n^{\epsilon}}] \not\subset \mathrm{SIZE}[n^k]$.
10. $\mathrm{quasi}$-$\mathrm{NP} \not\subset \mathrm{TC}^0$.</summary>

    <title>Did Lane Hemaspaandra invent the Fib numbers?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> (I abbreviate Fibonacci by Fib throughout. Lane Hemaspaandra helped me with this post.) </p><p>We all learned that Fib invented or discovered the Fib Numbers:</p><p>f_0=1,</p><p>f_1=1, and</p><p>for all n\ge 2, f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}.</p><p>We may have learned that they come up in nature (NOT true, see <a href="https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/fibonacc.htm">here</a>) or that they were important in mathematics (questionable--see this blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/01/how-important-are-fib-numbers-in-math.html">here</a> which says no, but some comments give good counterarguments). You also learned that Fibonacci was the mathematician who first studied them. Also not true!  This one surprised me. </p><p>1) I came across this blog post: <a href="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2021/11/16/why-names-matter/">here</a> that says they were invented by Hemachandra first. Wow--I then recalled that Lane Hemaspaandra's birth surname  was Lane Hemachandra (he married Edith Spaan and they are now both Hemaspaandra). So naturally I emailed him to ask how a 20th-century person could invent something earlier than 1170. He told me a picture of him in the basement ages while he stays young. </p><p>2) It would be nice to say OH, let's call them Hemachandra numbers (would that be  easier than convincing the world to use tau instead of pi,? See <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">The Tau Manifesto</a>) and let students know that there were people other than Europeans who did math back then. But even that story is not as simple as it seems. Lane emailed me this article: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/fibfibs.pdf">here</a> that tells the whole muddled story. (In what follows I leave out the accents.)</p><p>Virahanka seems to be the formulator of the Fib recurrence, though not quite the numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry.  He did this between 600 and 800 AD.</p><p>Gopala, in work prior to 1135, was aware of Virhanka's work. In particular he know about the inductive rule. But he also set the initial values and generated numbers, so he was the first to have the sequence we now call the Fib numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry. </p><p>Hemachandra in 1150 also formulated them, independently.  His motivation was Sanskrit poetry.</p><p>(I will learn some Sanskrit poetry the next time I teach Discrete Math so I can give the students an application of the material!)</p><p>So does Virhanka win? Hardly:</p><p>Acarya Pingala's writings from the 5th or 6th century BC (YES- BC!) indicate that he knew about the Fib numbers in the context of (you guessed it!) Sanskrit poetry. </p><p>3) I would support changing the name of the Fib Numbers to the Pingala numbers. This is both good and bad news for Lane:</p><p>a) Bad news in that he does not get a sequence of number that shares his pre-marriage name.</p><p>b) Good news in that if I settled on Hemachandra numbers then Lane and Edith would have to decide if 0 or 1 or 2 of them want to change their name to Hemachandra. I would guess not--too complicated. Plus one name change in a life is enough. </p><p>4) The story (especially  the articles I pointed to) shows just how complicated history can get. Even a straightforward question like:</p><p><i>Who first formulated the Fib Numbers?</i></p><p>might not have a well-defined answer. Perhaps this is  the wrong question since if people formulate the concept independent of each other, they should all get some credit.  Even if the authors are 1000 years apart. </p><p><i>Side note</i>: Independent Discovery may be harder to assert now since, with the web,  Alice could have seen Bob's paper so it may be hard to call Alice's discovery independent. As I have mentioned before on this blog, my students have a hard time with the notion of Cook and Levin coming up with NP-completeness independently  since  surely one would have posted it and the other would have seen it. An era before posting was possible! Unimaginable to them. Sometimes even to me. </p></div>

    <title>TR21-177 |  Johnson Coverage Hypothesis: Inapproximability of k-means and k-median in $\ell_p$-metrics | 

	Vincent Cohen-Addad, 

	Karthik  C. S., 

	Euiwoong Lee</title>
    <summary>k-median and k-means are the two most popular objectives for clustering algorithms. Despite intensive effort, a good understanding of the approximability of these objectives, particularly in $\ell_p$-metrics, remains a major open problem. In this paper, we significantly improve upon the hardness of approximation factors known in literature for these objectives in $\ell_p$-metrics. 
 
We introduce a new hypothesis called the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis (JCH), which roughly asserts that the well-studied k-max coverage problem on set systems is hard to approximate to a factor greater than $1-\frac{1}{e}$, even when the membership graph of the set system is a subgraph of the Johnson graph. We then show that together with generalizations of the embedding techniques introduced by Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19), JCH implies hardness of approximation results for k-median and k-means in $\ell_p$-metrics for factors which are close to the ones obtained for general metrics. In particular, assuming JCH we show that it is hard to approximate the k-means objective:

$\bullet$ Discrete case: To a factor of 3.94 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.73 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.56 and 1.17 respectively, obtained under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).

$\bullet$ Continuous case: To a factor of 2.10 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.36 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.07 in the $\ell_2$-metric obtained under UGC (and to the best of our knowledge, the continuous case of k-means in $\ell_1$-metric was not previously analyzed in literature).
 
We also obtain similar improvements under JCH for the k-median objective. Additionally, we prove a weak version of JCH using the work of Dinur et al. (SICOMP'05) on Hypergraph Vertex Cover, and recover all the results stated above of Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19) to (nearly) the same inapproximability factors but now under the standard NP$\neq$P assumption (instead of UGC).

Finally, we establish a strong connection between JCH and the long standing open problem of determining the Hypergraph Turan number. We then use this connection to prove improved SDP gaps (over the existing factors in literature) for k-means and k-median objectives.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Gerhard Ringel considered in 1959 the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider a finite family of circles such that every point in the plane is included in at most two circles. What is the minimum number of colors needed to color the circles so that tangent circles are colored with different colors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ringel 1959 circle problem</strong> is the question if this minimum number of colors is bounded.</p>
<p>I mentioned the problem in a post about <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/04/13/coloring-problems-for-arrangements-of-circles-and-pseudocircles/">eight coloring problems for arrangements of circles and pseudocircles</a>, three years ago. (For another recently solved conjecture by Ringel see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/01/27/ringel-conjecture-solved-congratulations-to-richard-montgomery-alexey-pokrovskiy-and-benny-sudakov/">this post</a>.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05042">recent arXiv paper</a> James Davies, Chaya Keller, Linda Kleist, Shakhar Smorodinsky, and Bartosz Walczak solved the problem and showed that any finite number of colors does not suffices. In fact the proved considerably more. The paper is</p>
<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05042">A solution to Ringel circle problem,</a></h3>
<p>and here is the abstract</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We construct families of circles in the plane such that their tangency graphs have arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number. This provides a strong negative answer to Ringel’s circle problem (1959). The proof relies on a (multidimensional) version of Gallai’s theorem with polynomial constraints, which we derive from the Hales-Jewett theorem and which may be of independent interest.</p>
