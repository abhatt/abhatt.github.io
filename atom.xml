aims to design a sequence of motions that will bring the separate constituent
parts of a product into their final placement in the product. It is convenient
to study assembly planning in reverse order, where the following key problem,
assembly partitioning, arises: Given a set of parts in their final placement in
a product, partition them into two sets, each regarded as a rigid body, which
we call a subassembly, such that these two subassemblies can be moved
sufficiently far away from each other, without colliding with one another. The
basic assembly planning problem is further complicated by practical
consideration such as how to hold the parts in a subassembly together.
Therefore, a desired property of a valid assembly partition is that each of the
two subassemblies will be connected.
</p>
<p>We show that even an utterly simple case of the
connected-assembly-partitioning problem is hard: Given a connected set $A$ of
unit squares in the plane, each forming a distinct cell of the uniform integer
grid, find a subset $S\subset A$ such that $S$ can be rigidly translated to
infinity along a prescribed direction without colliding with $A\setminus S$,
and both subassemblies $S$ and $A\setminus S$ are each connected. We show that
this problem is NP-Complete, and by that settle an open problem posed by Wilson
et al. (1995) a quarter of a century ago.
</p>
<p>We complement the hardness result with two positive results for the
aforementioned problem variant of grid squares. First, we show that it is fixed
parameter tractable and give an $O(2^k n^2)$-time algorithm, where $n=|A|$ and
$k=|S|$. Second, we describe a special case of this variant where a connected
partition can always be found in linear time. Each of the positive results
sheds further light on the special geometric structure of the problem at hand.

    <title>An SPQR-Tree-Like Embedding Representation for Level Planarity</title>

embeddings of a biconnected planar graph. It is a key tool in a number of
constrained planarity testing algorithms, which seek a planar embedding of a
graph subject to some given set of constraints.
</p>
<p>We develop an SPQR-tree-like data structure that represents all level-planar
embeddings of a biconnected level graph with a single source, called the
LP-tree, and give a simple algorithm to compute it in linear time. Moreover, we
show that LP-trees can be used to adapt three constrained planarity algorithms
to the level-planar case by using them as a drop-in replacement for SPQR-trees.

    <title>On the Approximability of Robust Network Design</title>

consists in computing the capacity to be reserved on each network link such
that any demand vector belonging to a polyhedral set can be routed. The
objective is either to minimize congestion or a linear cost. And routing freely
depends on the demand.
</p>
<p>We first prove that the robust network design problem with minimum congestion
cannot be approximated within any constant factor.
</p>
<p>Then, using the ETH conjecture, we get a $\Omega(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$
lower bound for the approximability of this problem. This implies that the
well-known $O(\log n)$ approximation ratio established by R\"{a}cke in 2008 is
tight.
</p>
<p>Using Lagrange relaxation, we obtain a new proof of the $O(\log n)$
approximation. An important consequence of the Lagrange-based reduction and our
inapproximability results is that the robust network design problem with linear
reservation cost cannot be approximated within any constant ratio. This answers
a long-standing open question of Chekuri.
</p>
<p>Finally, we show that even if only two given paths are allowed for each
commodity, the robust network design problem with minimum congestion or linear
costs is hard to approximate within some constant $k$.

on pebble transducers. This notion is defined based on the difference between
the minimal length descriptional complexity of strings from the perspective of
finite-state transducers and pebble transducers. Our notion of pebble-depth
satisfies the three fundamental properties of depth: i.e. easy sequences and
random sequences are not deep, and the existence of a slow growth law. We also
compare pebble-depth to other depth notions based on finite-state transducers,
pushdown compressors and the Lempel-Ziv $78$ compression algorithm. We first
demonstrate how there exists a normal pebble-deep sequence even though there is
no normal finite-state-deep sequence. We next build a sequence which has a
pebble-depth level of roughly $1$, a pushdown-depth level of roughly $1/2$ and
a finite-state-depth level of roughly $0$. We then build a sequence which has
pebble-depth level of roughly $1/2$ and Lempel-Ziv-depth level of roughly $0$.

equilibrium stresses that are not necessarily positive, which correspond to
orthogonal drawings of $G^*$ that are not necessarily embeddings. We also give
a correspondence between equilibrium stresses and parallel drawings of the

paper, we strengthen this hardness by showing that for planar bipartite graphs,
the problem remains NP-hard. Moreover, for co-bipartite graphs and for line
graphs, the problem also remains NP-hard. On the positive side, we give an
algorithm deciding whether an input graph has a minimal separator of size at
least $k$ that runs in time $2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$. We further show that a
subexponential parameterized algorithm does not exist unless the Exponential
Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. Finally, we discuss a lower bound for polynomial
kernelizations of this problem.

$p = 1/n$, and the width of the transition window has been known since the
works of Luczak and Seierstad. They have established that as $n \to \infty$
when $p = (1 + \mu n^{-1/3})/n$, the asymptotic probability that the strongly
connected components of a random directed graph are only cycles and single
vertices decreases from 1 to 0 as $\mu$ goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.
</p>
<p>By using techniques from analytic combinatorics, we establish the exact
limiting value of this probability as a function of $\mu$ and provide more
properties of the structure of a random digraph around, below and above its
transition point. We obtain the limiting probability that a random digraph is
acyclic and the probability that it has one strongly connected complex
component with a given difference between the number of edges and vertices
(called excess). Our result can be extended to the case of several complex
components with given excesses as well in the whole range of sparse digraphs.
</p>
<p>Our study is based on a general symbolic method which can deal with a great
variety of possible digraph families, and a version of the saddle-point method
which can be systematically applied to the complex contour integrals appearing
from the symbolic method. While the technically easiest model is the model of
random multidigraphs, in which multiple edges are allowed, and where edge
multiplicities are sampled independently according to a Poisson distribution
with a fixed parameter $p$, we also show how to systematically approach the
family of simple digraphs, where multiple edges are forbidden, and where
2-cycles are either allowed or not.
</p>
<p>Our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations, and we
provide tables of numerical values for the integrals of Airy functions that
appear in this study.

radius of a rational polytope. This parameter is defined as the minimal
dilation factor that is needed for the lattice translates of the
correspondingly dilated polytope to cover the whole space. As our main result,
we describe a new algorithm for this problem, which is simpler, more efficient
and easier to implement than the only prior algorithm of Kannan (1992).
Motivated by a variant of the famous Lonely Runner Conjecture, we use its
geometric interpretation in terms of covering radii of zonotopes, and apply our
algorithm to prove the first open case of three runners with individual
starting points.

    <title>Online Hypergraph Matching with Delays</title>

ridesharing applications. In this model, users enter a marketplace
sequentially, and are willing to wait up to $d$ timesteps to be matched, after
which they will leave the system in favor of an outside option. A platform can
match groups of up to $k$ users together, indicating that they will share a
ride. Each group of users yields a match value depending on how compatible they
are with one another. As an example, in ridesharing, $k$ is the capacity of the
service vehicles, and $d$ is the amount of time a user is willing to wait for a
driver to be matched to them.
</p>
<p>We present results for both the utility maximization and cost minimization
variants of the problem. In the utility maximization setting, the optimal
competitive ratio is $\frac{1}{d}$ whenever $k \geq 3$, and is achievable in
polynomial-time for any fixed $k$. In the cost minimization variation, when $k
= 2$, the optimal competitive ratio for deterministic algorithms is
$\frac{3}{2}$ and is achieved by a polynomial-time thresholding algorithm. When
$k&gt;2$, we show that a polynomial-time randomized batching algorithm is $(2 -
\frac{1}{d}) \log k$-competitive, and it is NP-hard to achieve a competitive
ratio better than $\log k - O (\log \log k)$.

    <title>The Affiliate Matching Problem: On Labor Markets where Firms are Also Interested in the Placement of Previous Workers</title>

Dickerson</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11867">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In many labor markets, workers and firms are connected via affiliative
relationships. A management consulting firm wishes to both accept the best new
workers but also place its current affiliated workers at strong firms.
Similarly, a research university wishes to hire strong job market candidates
while also placing its own candidates at strong peer universities. We model
this affiliate matching problem in a generalization of the classic stable
marriage setting by permitting firms to state preferences over not just which
workers to whom they are matched, but also to which firms their affiliated
workers are matched. Based on results from a human survey, we find that
participants (acting as firms) give preference to their own affiliate workers
in surprising ways that violate some assumptions of the classical stable
marriage problem. This motivates a nuanced discussion of how stability could be
defined in affiliate matching problems; we give an example of a marketplace
which admits a stable match under one natural definition of stability, and does
not for that same marketplace under a different, but still natural, definition.
We conclude by setting a research agenda toward the creation of a centralized
clearing mechanism in this general setting.

constrained sampling-based motion planner. Learning proceeds by aligning
subspaces in the network with subspaces of the data. We combine both learned
constraints and analytically described constraints into the planner and use a
projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate ECoMaNN on its
representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of its
individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a
planner.

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: In high-dimensional statistical problems (including planted clique, sparse PCA, community detection, etc.), the class of “low-degree polynomial algorithms” captures many leading algorithmic paradigms such as spectral methods, approximate message passing, and local algorithms on sparse graphs. As such, lower bounds against low-degree algorithms constitute concrete evidence for average-case hardness of statistical problems. This method has been widely successful at explaining and predicting statistical-to-computational gaps in these settings. <br/>While prior work has understood the power of low-degree algorithms for problems with a “planted” signal, we consider here the setting of “random optimization problems” (with no planted signal), including the problem of finding a large independent set in a random graph, as well as the problem of optimizing the Hamiltonian of mean-field spin glass models. I will define low-degree algorithms in this setting, argue that they capture the best known algorithms, and explain new proof techniques for giving lower bounds against low-degree algorithms in this setting. The proof involves a variant of the so-called “overlap gap property”, which is a structural property of the solution space.<br/><br/>Based on joint work with David Gamarnik and Aukosh Jagannath, available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12063">arXiv:2004.12063</a>.</p></div>

<p>
Chai Wah Wu, Jonathan Lenchner, Charles Bennett, and Yuhai Tu are the moderators for the four days of the First IBM Research Workshop on the Informational Lens. The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/informational-lens-workshop-1/home">virtual workshop</a> begins Tuesday morning at 10:45 ET. The conference has free registration and of course is online. </p>
<p>
Today we preview the conference and discuss a few of the talks.</p>
<p>
The workshop’s name echoes the moniker “Through the Computational Lens” of <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/interdisciplinary-collaboration-at-simons">initiatives</a> led by the Simons Institute at Berkeley and used for a 2014 <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2015/computational-lens">workshop</a> organized by Avi Wigderson at IAS. A <a href="http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/computational-lens.html">prospectus</a> by the theory group at U.C. Berkeley led off with quantum computing. So will Tuesday’s talks, a full day on quantum by seven leaders we say more about below.</p>
<p>
Then the meeting will branch in some different directions from the computational-lens themes. The preface on the workshop website says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Viewing the world through an informational lens, and understanding constraints and tradeoffs such as energy and parallelism versus reliability and speed, will have profound consequences throughout technology and science. This includes not only mathematics and the natural sciences like physics and biology, but also social sciences such as psychology and linguistics. We aim to bring together leading researchers in science and technology from across the globe to discuss ideas and future research directions through the informational lens. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The other three days have talks that reach into all these areas, a dazzling array. We have made a collage of the twenty-six speakers currently listed on the schedule. Several faces are long familiar but others are novel to us.</p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Quantum Tuesday </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The opening morning has Alexander Holevo between Aram Harrow and Gil Kalai. Among many other accomplishments, Holevo is known for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo's_theorem">theorem</a> that implies that <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> qubits can yield at most <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> bits of classical information. In particular, any attempt to encode the edges of a general <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-vertex graph via entanglements between pairs among <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> qubits must be extremely lossy. He will talk about <em>quantum channels</em> and give a structure theorem for quantum Gaussian observables.</p>
<p>
We don’t have information yet on Aram’s talk. But Gil will update us on the state of his skepticism about the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing. This was the subject of the 2012 debate between Aram and Gil that <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/perpetual-motion-of-the-21st-century/">spanned</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/06/20/can-you-hear-the-shape-of-a-quantum-computer/">eight</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/quantum-supremacy-or-classical-control/">posts</a> on this blog. Here are Gil’s title and abstract:</p>
<p>
<font color="blue">Computational complexity, mathematical, and statistical aspects of NISQ computers.</font><br/>
<i>Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) Computers hold the key for important theoretical and experimental questions regarding quantum computers. In the lecture I will describe some questions about computational complexity, mathematics, and statistics which arose in my study of NISQ systems and are related to: <br/>
a) My general argument “against” quantum computers, <br/>
b) My analysis (with Yosi Rinot and Tomer Shoham) of the Google 2019 “huge quantum advantage” experiment. </i></p>
<p>
IBM have expressed their own skepticism of Google’s claims, which we mentioned in our own <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">review</a> of the experiment last year. IBM of course also have their own quantum computing initiative.</p>

<p>
We may hear about its state from Charlie Bennett, whose talk leads off the afternoon but has yet to be measured, along with the following talk by Isaac Chuang. Then will come Scott Aaronson. If “tomography” in his title sounds to you like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan">CAT scan</a>, you could consider this a “Schrödinger’s Cat” scan. Well, we should let Scott tell it—the 2018 paper he mentions is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01053">this</a>.</p>

<i>Given an unknown quantum state <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\rho}"/>, and a known list of two-outcome measurements <img alt="{E_1,...,E_M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_1%2C...%2CE_M%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E_1,...,E_M}"/>, “shadow tomography” is the task of estimating the probability that each <img alt="{E_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E_i}"/> accepts <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\rho}"/>, by carefully measuring only a few copies of <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\rho}"/>. In 2018, I gave the first nontrivial protocol for this task. In 2019, Guy Rothblum and I exploited a new connection between gentle measurement of quantum states and the field of differential privacy, to give a protocol that requires fewer copies of <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\rho}"/> in some cases, and has the additional advantage of being online (that is, the measurements are processed one at a time). Huge challenges remain in making shadow tomography practical with near-term devices; extremely recently Huang, Kueng, and Preskill took some promising steps in that direction. I’ll survey these developments and the challenges that remain.</i> </p>
<p>
Then Srinivasan Arunachalam, who also works at IBM T.J. Watson in Westchester, NY, will finish the day with another talk about inferring from samples:</p>
<p>
<font color="blue">Sample-efficient learning of quantum many-body systems.</font><br/>
<i>We study the problem of learning the Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body system given samples from its Gibbs (thermal) state. The classical analog of this problem, known as learning graphical models or Boltzmann machines, is a well-studied question in machine learning and statistics. In this work, we give the first sample-efficient algorithm for the quantum Hamiltonian learning problem. In particular, we prove that polynomially many samples in the number of particles (qudits) are necessary and sufficient for learning the parameters of a spatially local Hamiltonian in <img alt="{\ell_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell_2}"/>-norm. Our main contribution is in establishing the strong convexity of the log-partition function of quantum many-body systems, which along with the maximum entropy estimation yields our sample-efficient algorithm. Our work paves the way toward a more rigorous application of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body problems.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> B.Y.O.L. </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The workshop has lunch breaks as usual but they are not lunch breaks. Lunch is served at IBM T.J. Watson, and I (Ken) can vouch from times I have been hosted there by Jon Lenchner that the food is wonderful, but attendees will not be on hand to partake. I have known Jon since we were part of the New York area chess scene in the 1970s. Among Jon’s activities in the past five years have been directing IBM’s research center in Nairobi, Kenya, and helping the Toronto Raptors assemble a championship basketball team via player analytics. The latter is not technically related to my chess analytics, but we have greater shared interests in ideas for lower bounds on uniform complexity classes.</p>
<p>
Instead of physical lunch, the lunch breaks are moderated panel discussions. So you can bring your own lunch while watching and listening via IBM’s WebEx or other portal. Maybe there will be time for remote attendees to ask questions—though not with your mouth full, as our mothers would say. A few years ago, my department began running catered Friday lunch forums under the name “UpBeat,” but those too are now remote and B.Y.O.L.  As for the other thing the “L.” can stand for besides “lunch,” we can mention that the pandemic has rendered onsite restrictions moot.</p>
<p>
There will also be Q &amp; A and panel discussion sessions for 45 minutes after each day’s last talk. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Other Talks </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We wish we could attend all the talks. We imagine they will be available afterward as recordings, but especially when there is live Q &amp; A it is nice to experience them in the moment as at a physically intimate workshop. Rather than list all the speakers and titles here—you can find them on the abstracts <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/informational-lens-workshop-1/talk-abstracts">page</a>, after all—we will just highlight a few that catch our eye:</p>
<p>
<font color="red">Fun facts about polynomials, and applications to coding theory: Mary Wootters. </font><br/>
<i>Here are some (fun?) facts about polynomials you probably already know. First, given any three points, you can find a parabola through them. Second, if you look at any vertical “slice” of a paraboloid, you get a parabola. These facts, while simple, turn out to be extremely useful in applications! For example, these facts are behind the efficacy of classical Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes, fundamental tools for communication and storage. But this talk is not about those facts — it’s about a few related facts that you might not know. Given less than three points’ worth of information, what can you learn about a parabola going through those points? Are there things other than paraboloids that you can “slice” and always get parabolas? In this talk, I will tell you some (fun!) facts that answer these questions, and discuss applications to error correcting codes.</i></p>
<p>
<font color="blue">Punch Cards and the Difference Engine: William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. </font><br/>
<i>We discuss the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Difference_Engine">power</a> of the card concept. By storing a finite amount of data on a “punch card” we can structure data handling to be straightforward and safe. The machine we plan will be thousands of times slower than even the first vacuum-tube computers were. But our novel use of steam and punch cards does have merits: cards are physical and help solve security and also privacy issues.</i></p>
<p>
<font color="red">Reasoning about Generalization via Conditional Mutual Information: Lydia Zakynthinou. </font><br/>
<i>We provide a framework for studying the generalization properties of machine learning algorithms, which ties together existing approaches, using the unifying language of information theory. We introduce a new notion based on Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) which quantifies how well the input (i.e., the training data) can be recognized given the output (i.e., the trained model) of the learning algorithm. Bounds on CMI can be obtained from several methods, including VC dimension, compression schemes, and differential privacy, and bounded CMI implies various forms of generalization guarantees. In this talk, I will introduce CMI, show how to obtain bounds on CMI from existing methods and generalization bounds from CMI, and discuss the capabilities of our framework. Joint work with Thomas Steinke.</i></p>
<p>
<font color="blue">Rebooting Mathematics: Doron Zeilberger. </font><br/>
<i>Mathematics is what it is today due to the accidental fact that it was developed before the invention of the computer, and, with a few exceptions, continues in the same vein, by inertia. It is time to start all over, remembering that math, is, or at least should be, the math that can be handled by computers, keeping in mind that they are both discrete and finite.</i></p>
<p>
Oh wait, one of these talks is both less novel and more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Difference-Engine-Novel-William-Gibson/dp/0440423627">novel</a> than the others.  Can a virtual workshop have a virtual virtual talk?  The cards were arguably “the” informational lens for almost 100 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What have been your experiences with top-of-the-line virtual workshops? Our hats are off to the organizers of this one, and we are looking forward to it.</p>

    <title>Complexity of Scheduling Few Types of Jobs on Related and Unrelated Machines</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1601164800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kouteck=yacute=:Martin.html">Martin Koutecký</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/z/Zink:Johannes.html">Johannes Zink</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11840">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The task of scheduling jobs to machines while minimizing the total makespan,
the sum of weighted completion times, or a norm of the load vector, are among
the oldest and most fundamental tasks in combinatorial optimization. Since all
of these problems are in general NP-hard, much attention has been given to the
regime where there is only a small number $k$ of job types, but possibly the
number of jobs $n$ is large; this is the few job types, high-multiplicity
regime. Despite many positive results, the hardness boundary of this regime was
not understood until now.
</p>
<p>We show that makespan minimization on uniformly related machines
($Q|HM|C_{\max}$) is NP-hard already with $6$ job types, and that the related
Cutting Stock problem is NP-hard already with $8$ item types. For the more
general unrelated machines model ($R|HM|C_{\max}$), we show that if either the
largest job size $p_{\max}$, or the number of jobs $n$ are polynomially bounded
in the instance size $|I|$, there are algorithms with complexity
$|I|^{\textrm{poly}(k)}$. Our main result is that this is unlikely to be
improved, because $Q||C_{\max}$ is W[1]-hard parameterized by $k$ already when
$n$, $p_{\max}$, and the numbers describing the speeds are polynomial in $|I|$;
the same holds for $R|HM|C_{\max}$ (without speeds) when the job sizes matrix
has rank $2$. Our positive and negative results also extend to the objectives
$\ell_2$-norm minimization of the load vector and, partially, sum of weighted
completion times $\sum w_j C_j$.
</p>
<p>Along the way, we answer affirmatively the question whether makespan
minimization on identical machines ($P||C_{\max}$) is fixed-parameter tractable
parameterized by $k$, extending our understanding of this fundamental problem.
Together with our hardness results for $Q||C_{\max}$ this implies that the
complexity of $P|HM|C_{\max}$ is the only remaining open case.

    <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of \textsc{Maximum Degree Contraction} Problem</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1601164800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Saket Saurabh, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Tale:Prafullkumar.html">Prafullkumar Tale</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11793">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the \textsc{Maximum Degree Contraction} problem, input is a graph $G$ on
$n$ vertices, and integers $k, d$, and the objective is to check whether $G$
can be transformed into a graph of maximum degree at most $d$, using at most
$k$ edge contractions. A simple brute-force algorithm that checks all possible
sets of edges for a solution runs in time $n^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$. As our first
result, we prove that this algorithm is asymptotically optimal, upto constants
in the exponents, under Exponential Time Hypothesis (\ETH).
</p>
<p>Belmonte, Golovach, van't Hof, and Paulusma studied the problem in the realm
of Parameterized Complexity and proved, among other things, that it admits an
\FPT\ algorithm running in time $(d + k)^{2k} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)} =
2^{\mathcal{O}(k \log (k+d) )} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and remains \NP-hard
for every constant $d \ge 2$ (Acta Informatica $(2014)$). We present a
different \FPT\ algorithm that runs in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(dk)} \cdot
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. In particular, our algorithm runs in time
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k)} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, for every fixed $d$. In the same
article, the authors asked whether the problem admits a polynomial kernel, when
parameterized by $k + d$. We answer this question in the negative and prove
that it does not admit a polynomial compression unless $\NP \subseteq
\coNP/poly$.

    <title>A Case for Partitioned Bloom Filters</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1601164800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Almeida:Paulo_S=eacute=rgio.html">Paulo Sérgio Almeida</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11789">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In a partitioned Bloom Filter the $m$ bit vector is split into $k$ disjoint
$m/k$ sized parts, one per hash function. Contrary to hardware designs, where
they prevail, software implementations mostly adopt standard Bloom filters,
considering partitioned filters slightly worse, due to the slightly larger
false positive rate (FPR). In this paper, by performing an in-depth analysis,
first we show that the FPR advantage of standard Bloom filters is smaller than
thought; more importantly, by studying the per-element FPR, we show that
standard Bloom filters have weak spots in the domain: elements which will be
tested as false positives much more frequently than expected. This is relevant
in scenarios where an element is tested against many filters, e.g., in packet
forwarding. Moreover, standard Bloom filters are prone to exhibit extremely
weak spots if naive double hashing is used, something occurring in several,
even mainstream, libraries. Partitioned Bloom filters exhibit a uniform
distribution of the FPR over the domain and are robust to the naive use of
double hashing, having no weak spots. Finally, by surveying several usages
other than testing set membership, we point out the many advantages of having
disjoint parts: they can be individually sampled, extracted, added or retired,
leading to superior designs for, e.g., SIMD usage, size reduction, test of set
disjointness, or duplicate detection in streams. Partitioned Bloom filters are
better, and should replace the standard form, both in general purpose libraries
and as the base for novel designs.

    <title>An Asymptotically Fast Polynomial Space Algorithm for Hamiltonicity Detection in Sparse Directed Graphs</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bj=ouml=rklund:Andreas.html">Andreas Björklund</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11780">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present a polynomial space Monte Carlo algorithm that given a directed
graph on $n$ vertices and average outdegree $\delta$, detects if the graph has
a Hamiltonian cycle in $2^{n-\Omega(\frac{n}{\delta})}$ time. This asymptotic
scaling of the savings in the running time matches the fastest known
exponential space algorithm by Bj\"orklund and Williams ICALP 2019. By
comparison, the previously best polynomial space algorithm by Kowalik and
Majewski IPEC 2020 guarantees a $2^{n-\Omega(\frac{n}{2^\delta})}$ time bound.

<p>Our algorithm combines for the first time the idea of obtaining a fingerprint
of the presence of a Hamiltonian cycle through an inclusion--exclusion
summation over the Laplacian of the graph from Bj\"orklund, Kaski, and Koutis
ICALP 2017, with the idea of sieving for the non-zero terms in an
inclusion--exclusion summation by listing solutions to systems of linear
equations over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ from Bj\"orklund and Husfeldt FOCS 2013.

    <title>Fine-grained complexity of the list homomorphism problem: feedback vertex set and cutwidth</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1601164800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Piecyk:Marta.html">Marta Piecyk</a>, Paweł Rzążewski <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11642">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>For graphs $G,H$, a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ is an edge-preserving
mapping from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$. In the list homomorphism problem, denoted by
\textsc{LHom}($H$), we are given a graph $G$ and lists $L: V(G) \to 2^{V(H)}$,
and we ask for a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ which additionally respects the
lists $L$.
</p>
<p>Very recently Okrasa, Piecyk, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [ESA 2020] defined an
invariant $i^*(H)$ and proved that under the SETH $\mathcal{O}^*\left
(i^*(H)^{\textrm{tw}(G)}\right)$ is the tight complexity bound for
\textsc{LHom}($H$), parameterized by the treewidth $\textrm{tw}(G)$ of the
instance graph $G$. We study the complexity of the problem under dirretent
parameterizations. As the first result, we show that $i^*(H)$ is also the right
complexity base if the parameter is the size of a minimum feedback vertex set
of $G$.
</p>
<p>Then we turn our attention to a parameterization by the cutwidth
$\textrm{ctw}(G)$ of $G$. Jansen and Nederlof~[ESA 2018] showed that
\textsc{List $k$-Coloring} (i.e., \textsc{LHom}($K_k$)) can be solved in time
$\mathcal{O}^*\left (c^{\textrm{ctw}(G)}\right)$ where $c$ does not depend on
$k$. Jansen asked if this behavior extends to graph homomorphisms. As the main
result of the paper, we answer the question in the negative. We define a new
graph invariant $mim^*(H)$ and prove that \textsc{LHom}($H$) problem cannot be
solved in time $\mathcal{O}^*\left
((mim^*(H)-\varepsilon)^{\textrm{ctw}(G)}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$,
unless the SETH fails. This implies that there is no $c$, such that for every
odd cycle the non-list version of the problem can be solved in time
$\mathcal{O}^*\left (c^{\textrm{ctw}(G)} \right)$.
</p>
<p>Finally, we generalize the algorithm of Jansen and Nederlof, so that it can
be used to solve \textsc{LHom}($H$) for every graph $H$; its complexity depends
on $\textrm{ctw}(G)$ and another invariant of $H$, which is constant for
cliques.

longest common subsequence of permutations. Aldous and Diaconis, in their
paper, pointed that Ulam's metric had been introduced in the context of
questions concerning sorting and tossing cards. In this paper we define and
study Ulam's metric in highier dimensions: for dimension one the considered
object is a pair of permutations, for dimension k it is a pair of k-tuples of
permutations. Over encodings by k-tuples of permutations we define two dually
related hierarchies. Our very first motivation come from Murata at al. paper,
in which pairs of permutations were used as representation of topological
relation between rectangles packed into minimal area with application to VLSI
physical design. Our results concern hardness, approximability, and
parametrized complexity inside the hierarchies.

    <title>Dynamic Similarity Search on Integer Sketches</title>

searches, and it randomly maps data points in a metric space to strings of
discrete symbols (i.e., sketches) in the Hamming space. While traditional
hashing techniques produce binary sketches, recent ones produce integer
sketches for preserving various similarity measures. However, most similarity
search methods are designed for binary sketches and inefficient for integer
sketches. Moreover, most methods are either inapplicable or inefficient for
dynamic datasets, although modern real-world datasets are updated over time. We
propose dynamic filter trie (DyFT), a dynamic similarity search method for both
binary and integer sketches. An extensive experimental analysis using large
real-world datasets shows that DyFT performs superiorly with respect to
scalability, time performance, and memory efficiency. For example, on a huge
dataset of 216 million data points, DyFT performs a similarity search 6,000
times faster than a state-of-the-art method while reducing to one-thirteenth in
memory.

spanning forest (MSF), and approximate maximum (weight) matching in a
distributed setting. In particular, we focus on the Adaptive Massively Parallel
Computation (AMPC) model, which is a theoretical model that captures
MapReduce-like computation augmented with a distributed hash table.
</p>
<p>We show the first AMPC algorithms for all of the studied problems that run in
a constant number of rounds and use only $O(n^\epsilon)$ space per machine,
where $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$. Our results improve both upon the previous results in
the AMPC model, as well as the best-known results in the MPC model, which is
the theoretical model underpinning many popular distributed computation
frameworks, such as MapReduce, Hadoop, Beam, Pregel and Giraph.
</p>
<p>Finally, we provide an empirical comparison of the algorithms in the MPC and
AMPC models in a fault-tolerant distriubted computation environment. We
empirically evaluate our algorithms on a set of large real-world graphs and
show that our AMPC algorithms can achieve improvements in both running time and
round-complexity over optimized MPC baselines.

    <title>Algorithms for a Topology-aware Massively Parallel Computation Model</title>

homogeneity, i.e., every computing unit has the same computational capability,
and can communicate with every other unit with the same latency and bandwidth.
However, this strong assumption of a uniform topology rarely holds in practical
settings, where computing units are connected through complex networks. To
address this issue, Blanas et al. recently proposed a topology-aware massively
parallel computation model that integrates the network structure and
heterogeneity in the modeling cost. The network is modeled as a directed graph,
where each edge is associated with a cost function that depends on the data
transferred between the two endpoints. The computation proceeds in synchronous
rounds, and the cost of each round is measured as the maximum cost over all the
edges in the network.
</p>
<p>In this work, we take the first step into investigating three fundamental
data processing tasks in this topology-aware parallel model: set intersection,
cartesian product, and sorting. We focus on network topologies that are tree
topologies, and present both lower bounds, as well as (asymptotically) matching
upper bounds. The optimality of our algorithms is with respect to the initial
data distribution among the network nodes, instead of assuming worst-case
distribution as in previous results. Apart from the theoretical optimality of
our results, our protocols are simple, use a constant number of rounds, and we
believe can be implemented in practical settings as well.

theory, which is NP-hard. Since the underlying graphs are always changing in
numerous applications, computing a {MaxIS} over dynamic graphs has received
increasing attention in recent years. Due to the intractability to compute an
exact MaxIS or its good approximation over dynamic graphs, this paper studies
the problem to maintain a high-quality independent set, which is an
approximation of the MaxIS, over dynamic graphs. A framework based on swap
operations for resolving this problem is presented and two concrete update
algorithms based on one-swappable vertices and two-swappble vertex pairs are
designed. Both algorithms can compute high-quality independent sets over
dynamic graphs with $O(\Delta^3)$ time for general graphs and with $O(1)$ time
for bounded-degree graphs. Moreover, the lower bound of the size of the
solution maintained by our algorithms is derived if there is no swappable
vertex in it. Then the algorithms are extended under \textit{semi-external}
setting to maintained a high-quality independent set with limited memory
consumption. Extensive experiments are conducted over real graphs to confirm
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Edit distance is a classic measure of similarity between strings, with applications ranging from computational biology to coding. Computing edit distance is also a classic dynamic programming problem, with a quadratic run-time solution, often taught in the “Intro to Algorithms” classes. Improving this runtime has been a decades-old challenge, now ruled likely-impossible using tools from the modern area of fine-grained complexity. We show how to approximate the edit distance between two strings in near-linear time, up to a constant factor. Our result completes a research direction set forth in the breakthrough paper of [Chakraborty, Das, Goldenberg, Koucky, Saks; FOCS’18], which showed the first constant-factor approximation algorithm with a (strongly) sub-quadratic running time.</p>

Suppose, however, that the prover wishes to convince the verifier that $k$ separate inputs $x_1,\dots,x_k$ all belong to $\Pi$ (without revealing anything else). A naive way of doing so is to simply run the SZK protocol separately for each input. In this work we ask whether one can do better -- that is, is efficient batch verification possible for SZK?

We give a partial positive answer to this question by constructing a batch verification protocol for a natural and important subclass of SZK -- all problems $\Pi$ that have a non-interactive SZK protocol (in the common random string model). More specifically, we show that, for every such problem $\Pi$, there exists an honest-verifier SZK protocol for batch verification of $k$ instances, with communication complexity $poly(n) + k \cdot poly(\log{n},\log{k})$, where $poly$ refers to a fixed polynomial that depends only on $\Pi$ (and not on $k$). This result should be contrasted with the naive solution, which has communication complexity $k \cdot poly(n)$.

Our proof leverages a new NISZK-complete problem, called Approximate Injectivity, that we find to be of independent interest. The goal in this problem is to distinguish circuits that are nearly injective, from those that are non-injective on almost all inputs.</summary>

    <title>TR20-146 |  On the Hardness of Detecting Macroscopic Superpositions | 

	Scott Aaronson,

    <summary>When is decoherence "effectively irreversible"? Here we examine this central question of quantum foundations using the tools of quantum computational complexity. We prove that, if one had a quantum circuit to determine if a system was in an equal superposition of two orthogonal states (for example, the $|$Alive$\rangle$ and $|$Dead$\rangle$ states of Schrodinger's cat), then with only a slightly larger circuit, one could also $\mathit{swap}$ the two states (e.g., bring a dead cat back to life). In other words, observing interference between the $|$Alive$\rangle$and $|$Dead$\rangle$ states is a "necromancy-hard" problem, technologically infeasible in any world where death is permanent. As for the converse statement (i.e., ability to swap implies ability to detect interference), we show that it holds modulo a single exception, involving unitaries that (for example) map $|$Alive$\rangle$ to $|$Dead$\rangle$ but $|$Dead$\rangle$ to -$|$Alive$\rangle$. We also show that these statements are robust---i.e., even a $\mathit{partial}$ ability to observe interference implies partial swapping ability, and vice versa. Finally, without relying on any unproved complexity conjectures, we show that all of these results are quantitatively tight. Our results have possible implications for the state dependence of observables in quantum gravity, the subject that originally motivated this study.</summary>

    <title>TR20-145 |  An Improved Exponential-Time Approximation Algorithm for Fully-Alternating Games Against Nature | 

	Andrew Drucker</title>
    <summary>"Games against Nature" [Papadimitriou '85] are two-player games of perfect information, in which one player's moves are made randomly (here, uniformly); the final payoff to the non-random player is given by some $[0, 1]$-valued function of the move history.  Estimating the value of such games under optimal play, and computing near-optimal strategies, is an important goal in the study of decision-making under uncertainty, and has seen significant research in AI and allied areas [Hnich, Rossi, Tarim, Prestwich '11], with only experimental evaluation of most algorithms' performance.  The problem's PSPACE-completeness does not rule out nontrivial algorithms.  Improved algorithms with theoretical guarantees are known in various cases where the payoff function $F$ has special structure, and Littman, Majercik, and Pitassi [LMP'01] give a sampling-based improved algorithm for general $F$, for turn-orders which restrict the number of non-random player strategies.

We study the case of general $F$ for which the players strictly alternate with binary moves $(w_1, r_1, w_2, r_2, \ldots, w_{n/2}, r_{n/2})$---for which the approach of [LMP'01] does not improve over brute force.  We give a randomized algorithm to approximate the value of such games under optimal play, and to execute near-optimal strategies. Our algorithm achieves exponential savings over brute-force, making $2^{(1 - \delta) n}$ queries to $F$ for some absolute constant $\delta &gt; 0$, and certifies a lower bound $\hat{v}$ on the game value $v$ with additive expected error bounded as $E[v - \hat{v}] \leq \exp(-\Omega(n))$.  (On the downside, $\delta$ is tiny and the algorithm uses exponential space.)

Our algorithm is recursive, and bootstraps a "base case" algorithm for fixed-size inputs.  The method of recursive composition used, the specific base-case guarantees needed, and the steps to establish these guarantees are interesting and, we feel, likely to find uses beyond the present work.</summary>

    <title>Remembering 2000</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~FOCS2000/">FOCS 2000</a> took place in Redondo Beach, just south of Los Angeles, November 12-14. Certainly some great results such as the Reingold-Vadhan-Wigderson <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.2000.892006">Zig-Zag Graph Product Expander construction</a> that would lead to Omer Reingold's <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/02/favorite-theorems-connecting-in-log.html">Undirected Connectivity in Log Space</a>. Mostly though I remember the discussions about the presidential election held the week before and whether we might find out our next president during the conference. Spoiler alert: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida">We didn't</a>. </p><p>Consider the following viewpoints for a person X</p><p>1. Did X support Bush or Gore?</p><p>2. Did X interpret the rules of the election that Bush won or Gore won?</p><p>These should be independent events. Your interpretation of the rules should not depend on who you supported. But in fact they were nearly perfectly correlated. Whether you were a politician, a newspaper editorial page writer, a supreme court justice, a computer scientist or pretty much everyone else, if you supported Gore, you believed he won the election and vice-versa. Everyone had their logic why they were right and I'm sure my readers who remember that election still believe their logic was correct. </p><p>As this upcoming election gets messy, as it already has, take care with trying to justify your desired endgame by choosing the logic that makes it work. Would you use the same logic if the candidates were reversed? Everyone says "yes" but it's rarely true. Just like Mitch McConnell, you'll just find some excuse why the opposite situation is different. Trust me, my logic is impeccable. </p></div>

<p>The Ramsey number <em>r(t; ℓ)</em> is the smallest natural number <em>n</em> such that every ℓ-coloring of the edges of the complete graph <img alt="K_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="K_n"/> contains a monochromatic <img alt="K_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="K_t"/>. (<em>r(t;2)</em> is often denoted by<em> R(t,t)</em> and <em>r(t;3)</em> by R<em>(t,t,t)</em> etc.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem">Famously</a>, <em>R(3,3)=6</em>; <em>R(4,4)=18</em>;  and <em>R(3,3,3)=17</em>. Understanding <em>R(t,t)</em> is among the most famous problems in combinatorics. (Understanding if r(3; <em> ℓ</em>) is exponential or superexponential in<em> ℓ</em> is also a very famous problem.)</p>
<p>It is known since the 1940s that <img alt="t/2 +o(1) \le log_2 R(t,t) \le 2t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%2F2+%2Bo%281%29+%5Cle+log_2+R%28t%2Ct%29+%5Cle+2t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="t/2 +o(1) \le log_2 R(t,t) \le 2t"/>.</p>
<p>Lower bounds for <em>R(t,t)</em> where used by Lefmann in 1987 to give lower bounds on <em>r(t; ℓ)</em> for <em> ℓ</em>&gt;2.

Jason Rosenhouse is professor in the Department of Mathematics at James Madison University. His research focuses on algebraic graph theory and analytic number theory involving exponential sums.  The former includes a neat <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220620901_Expansion_Properties_Of_Levi_Graphs">paper</a> on expansion properties of a family of graphs associated to block designs, with two undergraduates among its authors.  But besides his “real” research, he has written a number of books on puzzles such as <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Jason+Rosenhouse&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">The Monty Hall Problem</a>: The Remarkable Story of Math’s Most Contentious Brain Teaser</i>. Soon his book <i><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Games-Your-Mind-History-Puzzles/dp/0691174075">Games for Your Mind</a>: The History and Future of Logic Puzzles</i> is to be published.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/revbook-1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-17626" height="150" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/revbook-1.png?w=103&amp;h=150" width="103"/></a></p>
<p>
Today Ken and I thought we would highlight his recent review of a book on math puzzles.<br/>
<span id="more-17612"/></p>
<p>
I have mixed feelings about puzzles. I like them, and am happy when I can understand their solution. I am even happier when I can solve them. I sometimes feel that I should spend my limited brain cycles on “real” problems. But puzzles are fun. </p>
<p>
Rosenhouse’s <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202009/rnoti-p1382.pdf">review</a> is in the recent <em>Notices of the AMS</em> on the book <i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/prb-36">Bicycles or Unicycles</a>: A Collection of Intriguing Mathematical Puzzles</i>. This book, the “Bicycle Book,” is authored by Daniel Velleman and Stan Wagon.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/maabook.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17617" height="145" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/maabook.jpg?w=101&amp;h=145" width="101"/></a></p>
<p>
Their book is a collection of <img alt="{3 \times 5 \times 7}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3+%5Ctimes+5+%5Ctimes+7%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3 \times 5 \times 7}"/> mathematical puzzles. Rosenhouse likes their book, which means a lot coming from an author of so many puzzle books himself. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Cool Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Rosenhouse presents this problem from the Bicycle Book. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> You are playing solitaire in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane, the lower corner of which is shown in Figure 1. You begin with a single checker on square a1. On each turn, a legal move consists of removing one checker from the board and then placing two new checkers in the cells immediately above and to the right of the original checker. If either of those two cells is occupied, then the move is illegal, and a different checker must be selected for removal. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/solitairepuzzle.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17618" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/solitairepuzzle.png?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
Show that you can never make all of the <img alt="{3 \times 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3+%5Ctimes+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3 \times 3}"/> lower-left squares empty. This is a complexity question. You describe a computation and assert that certain states cannot be reached. The challenge is two-fold: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The computation is nondeterministic. There can be more than one next state. <p/>
</li><li>
The computation can reach infinitely many states. The task is to prove that no reachable state has the lower nine squares empty.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Cool Solution </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I must admit I read the solution before I tried to solve the puzzle. I did find an alternative solution. It was not as clever as the one from the book. Let’s look at that solution first. </p>
<p>
The idea is to assign <i>magic</i> values to each square on the checkerboard. The value of a state is the sum over all the values of squares with a checker. We need these to hold: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The value of the initial square is <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
The value of a move leaves the total sum over all the checkers the same. <p/>
</li><li>
The value of the squares <b>not</b> in the lower <img alt="{3 \times 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3+%5Ctimes+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3 \times 3}"/> is less than <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>.

Ken remembers, as a teenager, seeing this puzzle in a collection by the master Martin Gardner, with the same proof. Ken thought of it again when considering problems in physics and combinatorics that involve defining an appropriate potential function as the first step. </p>

</p><p/><h2> An Uncool Solution </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Let <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> be the lower-right <img alt="{3 \times 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3+%5Ctimes+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3 \times 3}"/> corner board.

<p>
Let <img alt="{N(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N(t)}"/> be the number of checkers in <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> at time <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/>. Of course <img alt="{N(0)=1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%280%29%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N(0)=1}"/> and the checker is at <img alt="{(1,1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281%2C1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(1,1)}"/>.</p>

<p>
Suppose by way of contradiction that it is possible to make <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> empty. </p>
<p>
Our proof uses that the transition from <img alt="{N(t)&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%28t%29%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N(t)&gt;0}"/> to <img alt="{N(t+1)=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%28t%2B1%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N(t+1)=0}"/> requires that <img alt="{N(t)=1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%28t%29%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N(t)=1}"/>. That is <img alt="{N(t)=2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%28t%29%3D2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N(t)=2}"/> or even <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3}"/> is impossible. The rule cannot remove two or more checkers from <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> in one move. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/config33v2.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17622" height="97" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/config33v2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=97" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>
Let <img alt="{N(t)=1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%28t%29%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N(t)=1}"/> and <img alt="{N(t+1)=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%28t%2B1%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N(t+1)=0}"/>. So where is the checker? A simple case analysis shows it must be at <img alt="{(3,3)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%283%2C3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(3,3)}"/>. So now we know the last placement. But how did we get to this position? It is easy to see that it had to be previously at <img alt="{(3,2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%283%2C2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(3,2)}"/> or <img alt="{(2,3)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282%2C3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(2,3)}"/>. By symmetry we can assume was <img alt="{(3,2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%283%2C2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(3,2)}"/>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/config33v3.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17623" height="98" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/config33v3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=98" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>
Our goal to show that we cannot place one checker at <img alt="{(3,2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%283%2C2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(3,2)}"/> and no other in <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/>. A little analysis shows that it must be the case that the previous state was one checker at <img alt="{(3,1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%283%2C1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(3,1)}"/>. But it is impossible to place a checker there and avoid having more checkers. This yields a contradiction. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/config33v4.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17624" height="97" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/config33v4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=97" width="150"/></a></p>
<p/><h2> Another Solution </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We could use finite state automata theory to supply another solution. The obvious issue is the full game is played on an infinite checkerboard. But we can use a standard trick to reduce the state space to a finite one. Imagine we play the game on just <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/>. When we have a move that creates checkers outside of <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> just throw them away. It is simple to see that no move can place checkers inside <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/>. Thus if we cannot empty <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> in this finite version, then there is no way in the full game. </p>
<p>
Now the state space is bounded by <img alt="{2^{9}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B9%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{9}}"/>: each of the nine squares can have a checker or not. We know the initial state and we know the final state. So we can run a finite state search algorithm and decide the answer.</p>
<p>
The value of this solution is that it could handle more complex rules and larger squares. Well at least those within reason. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Other Puzzles </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Rosenhouse covers nine other puzzles in his review. In our meta review of his review we will cover just two more. </p>
<p>
The third puzzle in his review comes from the challenge to prove that each matrix in a certain family <img alt="{\{C_n\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7BC_n%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{C_n\}}"/> has determinant <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. The particular matrices <img alt="{C_{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C_{n}}"/> look like they could have some strange determinant, one that even varies with <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. The trick is to show that there are other families <img alt="{\{A_n\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7BA_n%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{A_n\}}"/> and <img alt="{\{B_n\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7BB_n%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{B_n\}}"/> of matrices, in which each matrix has determinant <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> and that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  C_n = A_n B_n. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C_n+%3D+A_n+B_n.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  C_n = A_n B_n. "/></p>
<p>Of course this immediately proves that <img alt="{C_{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C_{n}}"/> also have determinant <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. The challenge is kind of a factorization problem. </p>
<p>
Another puzzle is to prove that a number <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> is prime if and only if there is exactly one pair of positive integers <img alt="{m,n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%2Cn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m,n}"/> such that </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{1}{m} - \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{p}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bm%7D+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bp%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \frac{1}{m} - \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{p}. "/></p>
<p>This seems to be surprising in two ways: First who could think of this? Second who could think of this? Okay it should be why is it true? Indeed Rosenhouse says that the proof is complex. </p>
<p>
Rosenhouse adds that most puzzles in this book are less “bite-sized” than the ones typically posed by the master Gardner. This certainly goes for the title puzzle about whether a bicycle can possibly move along a curve—other than a straight line—that was made by a unicycle. It requires a foray into differential equations.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>

My “uncool solution” was left somewhat incomplete. Do you see how to complete the analysis?</p>

    <title>TR20-144 |  Toward Probabilistic Checking against Non-Signaling Strategies with Constant Locality | 

	Mohammad Jahanara, 

	Sajin Koroth, 

	Igor Shinkar</title>
    <summary>Non-signaling strategies are a generalization of quantum strategies that have been studied in physics over the past three decades. Recently, they have found applications in theoretical computer science, including to proving inapproximability results for linear programming and to constructing protocols for delegating computation. A central tool for these applications is probabilistically checkable proof (PCPs) systems that are sound against non-signaling strategies.

In this paper we show, assuming a certain geometrical hypothesis about noise robustness of non-signaling proofs (or, equivalently, about robustness to noise of solutions to the Sherali-Adams linear program), that a slight variant of the parallel repetition of the exponential-length constant-query PCP construction due to Arora et al. (JACM 1998) is sound against non-signaling strategies with constant locality.

Our proof relies on the analysis of the linearity test and agreement test (also known as the direct product test) in the non-signaling setting.</summary>

    <title>TR20-143 |  Characterizing Average-Case Complexity of PH by Worst-Case Meta-Complexity | 

	Shuichi Hirahara</title>
    <summary>We exactly characterize the average-case complexity of the polynomial-time hierarchy (PH) by the worst-case (meta-)complexity of GapMINKT(PH), i.e., an approximation version of the problem of determining if a given string can be compressed to a short PH-oracle efficient program.  Specifically, we establish the following equivalence:

  DistPH is contained in AvgP (i.e., PH is easy on average) if and only if GapMINKT(PH) is in P.

In fact, our equivalence is significantly broad: A number of statements on several fundamental notions of complexity theory, such as errorless and one-sided-error average-case complexity, sublinear-time-bounded and polynomial-time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, and PH-computable hitting set generators, are all shown to be equivalent.

Our equivalence provides fundamentally new proof techniques for analyzing average-case complexity through the lens of *meta-complexity* of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and resolves, as immediate corollaries, questions of equivalence among different notions of average-case complexity of PH: low success versus high success probabilities (i.e., a hardness amplification theorem for DistPH against uniform algorithms) and errorless versus one-sided-error average-case complexity of PH.

Our results are based on a sequence of new technical results that further develops the proof techniques of the author's previous work on the non-black-box worst-case to average-case reduction and unexpected hardness results for Kolmogorov complexity (FOCS'18, CCC'20, ITCS'20, STOC'20).  Among other things, we prove the following.

  1.  If GapMINKT(NP) is in P, then P = BPP.
  At the core of the proof is a new black-box hitting set generator construction whose reconstruction algorithm uses few random bits, which also improves the approximation quality of the non-black-box worst-case to average-case reduction without using a pseudorandom generator.

  2.  If GapMINKT(PH) is in P, then DistPH is contained in AvgBPP = AvgP.

  3.  If MINKT(PH) is easy on a 1/poly(n)-fraction of inputs, then GapMINKT(PH) is in P.
  This improves the error tolerance of the previous non-black-box worst-case to average-case reduction.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In his day, Agent 3203.7 had stopped people from trying to kill Adolf Hitler, Richard Nixon, and even, in the case of one unusually thoughtful assassin, Henry David Thoreau. But this was a new one on him.</p>



<p>“So…” drawled the seventh version of Agent 3203. His prosthetic hand crushed the simple 21st-century gun into fused metal and dropped it. “You traveled to the past in order to kill… of all people… Donald Trump. Care to explain why?”</p>



<p>The time-traveller’s eyes looked wild. Crazed. Nothing unusual. “How can you ask me that? You’re a time-traveler too! You know what he does!”</p>



<p>That was a surprising level of ignorance even for a 21st-century jumper. “Different timelines, kid. Some are pretty obscure. What the heck did Trump do in yours that’s worth taking your one shot at time travel to assassinate him of all people?”</p>



<p>“He’s destroying my world!”</p>



<p>Agent 3203.7 took a good look at where Donald Trump was pridefully addressing the unveiling of the Trump Taj Mahal in New Jersey, then took another good look at the errant time-traveler. “Destroying it how, exactly? Did Trump turn mad scientist in your timeline?”</p>



<p>“He’s President of the United States!”</p>



<p>Agent 3203.7 took another long stare at his new prisoner. He was apparently serious. “How did Trump become President in your timeline? Strangely advanced technology, subliminal messaging?”</p>



<p>“He was elected in the usual way,” the prisoner said bitterly.</p>



<p>Agent 3203.7 shook his head in amazement. Talk about shooting the messenger. “Kid, I doubt Trump was your timeline’s main problem.”</p>

    <title>Baseball can go on forever, it doesn't just seem that way</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> Most games have some way to make sure they cannot go on forever.</p><p>1) Chess: I had thought there was a 50-move rule and a 3-times-same-position rule, but its a byte more complicated than that, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_(chess)">here</a>. There is also a chess clock. Suffice to say, Chess can never on forever (though it may seem like it does). </p><p>2) NIM: Eventually all of the stones are gone. There may be more complicated versions where you can add some stones, but in those versions I suspect that there is some parameter that goes to 0.</p><p>3) Basketball, Football, Hockey, Soccer: These all have a clock so they are time limited. For overtime there are also rules that make sure the game cannot go on forever. Or maybe its just very rare: what if the Superb Owl (spelled that way to avoid lawsuits, see <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/1/31/18202037/super-bowl-53-ads-trademark-the-big-game-2019">here</a>) is tied 0-0 at the end of the four quarters and goes into overtime and... nobody scores... ever. Could the game go on forever or would the referees declare it a tie? In the regular season there are ties, but in the in the superb owl? Actually this may be more a problem in the playoffs since you need to determine who goes to the next round.</p><p>4) Take your favorite game. I would bet dollars to doughnuts (what an odd phrase---see <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bet_a_dollar_to_a_doughnut">here</a> for more about the phrase) that there is some mechanism to make sure the game ends. An exception that Darling pointed out to me: If in Gin Rummy both players are terrible then the game can go on forever. This is probably true for other games as well and actually makes the question into two questions (a) will a game terminate no matter what the players do, and (b) (not sure how to formalize) will a game terminate if both players are trying to win and are making reasonable moves.</p><p>You may have noticed that in item 3 I left out Baseball. There is no clock in baseball. So one way the game can go on forever is to have a tie and extra innings and nobody scores. I think the umpire has the authority to call it a tie. (Incidentally, the shortened baseball season has a new extra inning rule---each inning starts with a runner on second. See <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/reasons-new-extra-innings-rule-is-good">here</a>,) When Lance read an earlier version of this post he pointed me to 5 ways a game can go on forever, not counting the example I have later in this post. <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~gottlieb/tr/back-issues/1990s/1992/1-jan-scanned.pdf">Here</a> is where Lance found the question and answer (look on the first page under Speed Department for the question, and the very end of the second page for the answer). I also did my own writuep with more details, see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/baseballforever.pdf">here</a>.  Also of interest (though not if you were actually at the game this happened), the record for number of times a player has a foul with 2 strikes is 16, see <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brandon-belts-record-at-bat-pop-fly-2018-4">here</a>. </p><p> However, I came across an  example more obscure than any of those. </p><p>Here is what happened (and you can see the video of it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDyCRTlKllk">here</a>, though it really starts about a minute into it. Keep reading- it looks like its another post, but its part of this post: </p><div class="q-box qu-borderBottom qu-px--medium qu-py--small" style="border-bottom-style: solid; border-color: rgb(222, 224, 225);

margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Back in 2008, the Yankees drafted a pitcher named Pat Venditte. What made Venditte unusual is that he can throw with both hands. In other words, he’s a switch pitcher. When he was drafted, he was assigned to the Staten Island Yankees, a low A ball team.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block" style="direction: ltr; margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">In his first game (against the Mets farm team, the Brooklyn Cyclones), Venditte came in to pitch. After getting the first two batters out and giving up a single, he then faced Ralph Henriquez, was a switch hitter. What happened next resembled an Abbott and Costello comedy routine. Venditte would put the glove on one hand (he had a specially made glove that could be worn on either hand) and Henriquez would then step across the plate to bat from the other side. Venditte would then switch his glove hand again and Henriquez went back to the other side.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block" style="direction: ltr; margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Eventually, after much discussion, the umpires ruled that Henriquez would have to choose a batting side first, before Venditte had to commit. Henriquez was mad and, after he struck out, he slammed the bat against the ground in frustration.</p><p class="q-text qu-display--block" style="direction: ltr; margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The umpires were, in essence, winging it, because there was no rule to cover the situation. Eventually, the higher ups in baseball did write a rule to cover the situation — the opposite of the umpires’ decision.</p></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR20-142 |  Relaxed Locally Correctable Codes with Improved Parameters | 

	Vahid Reza Asadi, 

	Igor Shinkar</title>
    <summary>Locally decodable codes (LDCs) are error-correcting codes $C : \Sigma^k \to \Sigma^n$ that admit a local decoding algorithm that recovers each individual bit of the message by querying only a few bits from a noisy codeword. An important question in this line of research is to understand the optimal trade-off between the query complexity of LDCs and their block length. Despite importance of these objects, the best known constructions of constant query LDCs have super-polynomial length, and there is a significant gap between the best constructions and the known lower bounds in terms of the block length.

For many applications it suffices to consider the weaker notion of relaxed LDCs (RLDCs), which allows the local decoding algorithm to abort if by querying a few bits it detects that the input is not a codeword. This relaxation turned out to allow decoding algorithms with constant query complexity for codes with almost linear length. Specifically, [Ben+06] constructed an $O(q)$-query RLDC that encodes a message of length $k$ using a codeword of block length $n = O(k^{1+1/\sqrt{q}})$.

In this work we improve the parameters of [Ben+06] by constructing an $O(q)$-query RLDC that encodes a message of length $k$ using a codeword of block length $O(k^{1+1/{q}})$. This construction matches (up to a multiplicative constant factor) the lower bounds of [KT00; Woo07] for constant query LDCs, thus making progress toward understanding the gap between LDCs and RLDCs in the constant query regime.

In fact, our construction extends to the stronger notion of relaxed locally correctable codes (RLCCs), introduced in [GRR18], where given a noisy codeword the correcting algorithm either recovers each individual bit of the codeword by only reading a small part of the input, or aborts if the input is detected to be corrupt.</summary>
