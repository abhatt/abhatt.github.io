    <title>MIP* = RE Redux</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Everything pre-covid seems at least five years ago to me, so it's hard to believe that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE</a> is a 2020 result. To remind you, consider the model where we have two powerful provers put in separate rooms where they can't communicate (think suspects of a crime put in separate interrogation rooms). An computationally efficient verifier can ask them questions based on random coins. Thirty years ago, Laszlo Babai, Carsten Lund and myself <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01200056">showed</a> that every language in nondeterministic exponential time has proofs in this model.<div><br/></div><div>Now suppose the provers have entangled quantum bits. This question has a long history that culminates in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE paper</a> earlier this year by Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, Henry Yuen showing that every proof of any length can be proven in this model. Incredible!</div><div><br/></div><div>But wait, why is there a new version 2 dated last week? Turns out the MIP* = RE paper relied on a 2016 paper by Vidick which was later discovered to have a bug. No worries, as the authors of the MIP* = RE paper got around this issue by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">quantum analysis</a> of a low-degree test from that old Babai-Fortnow-Lund paper.</div><div><br/></div><div>Vidick's <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/">blog post</a> explains it all, including the angst of a major result falling apart temporarily.

    <title>A Weight-scaling Algorithm for $f$-factors of Multigraphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1601856000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Harold Gabow <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01102">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We discuss combinatorial algorithms for finding a maximum weight $f$-factor
on an arbitrary multigraph, for given integral weights of magnitude at most
$W$. For simple bipartite graphs the best-known time bound is $O(n^{2/3}\, m\,
\log nW)$ (\cite{GT89}; $n$ and $m$ are respectively the number of vertices and
edges). A recent algorithm of Duan and He et al. \cite{DHZ} for $f$-factors of
simple graphs comes within logarithmic factors of this bound, $\widetilde{O}
(n^{2/3}\, m\, \log W)$. The best-known bound for bipartite multigraphs is
$O(\sqrt {\Phi}\, m\, \log \Phi W)$ ($\Phi\le m$ is the size of the $f$-factor,
$\Phi=\sum_{v\in V}f(v)/2$). This bound is more general than the restriction to
simple graphs, and is even superior on "small" simple graphs, i.e.,
$\Phi=o(n^{4/3})$. We present an algorithm that comes within a $\sqrt {\log
\Phi}$ factor of this bound, i.e., $O(\sqrt {\Phi \log \Phi}\,m \,\log \Phi
W)$.
</p>
<p>The algorithm is a direct generalization of the algorithm of Gabow and Tarjan
\cite{GT} for the special case of ordinary matching ($f\equiv 1$). We present
our algorithm first for ordinary matching, as the analysis is a simplified
version of \cite{GT}. Furthermore the algorithm and analysis both get
incorporated without modification into the multigraph algorithm.
</p>
<p>To extend these ideas to $f$-factors, the first step is "expanding" edges
(i.e., replacing an edge by a length 3 alternating path). \cite{DHZ} uses a
one-time expansion of the entire graph. Our algorithm keeps the graph small by
only expanding selected edges, and "compressing" them back to their original
source when no longer needed. Several other ideas are needed, including a
relaxation of the notion of "blossom" to e-blossom ("expanded blossom").

shape in a repository with models belonging to the same class, which requires
shape descriptors to be capable of representing detailed geometric information
to discriminate shapes with globally similar structures. Moreover, 3D objects
can be placed with arbitrary position and orientation in real-world
applications, which further requires shape descriptors to be robust to rigid
transformations. The shape descriptions used in existing 3D shape retrieval
systems fail to meet the above two criteria. In this paper, we introduce a
novel deep architecture, RISA-Net, which learns rotation invariant 3D shape
descriptors that are capable of encoding fine-grained geometric information and
structural information, and thus achieve accurate results on the task of
fine-grained 3D object retrieval. RISA-Net extracts a set of compact and
detailed geometric features part-wisely and discriminatively estimates the
contribution of each semantic part to shape representation. Furthermore, our
method is able to learn the importance of geometric and structural information
of all the parts when generating the final compact latent feature of a 3D shape
for fine-grained retrieval. We also build and publish a new 3D shape dataset
with sub-class labels for validating the performance of fine-grained 3D shape
retrieval methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our
RISA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the fine-grained object
retrieval task, demonstrating its capability in geometric detail extraction.

    <title>Tight Approximation Guarantees for Concave Coverage Problems</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1601856000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Barman:Siddharth.html">Siddharth Barman</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Fawzi:Omar.html">Omar Fawzi</a>, Paul Fermé <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00970">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the maximum coverage problem, we are given subsets $T_1, \ldots, T_m$ of a
universe $[n]$ along with an integer $k$ and the objective is to find a subset
$S \subseteq [m]$ of size $k$ that maximizes $C(S) := \Big|\bigcup_{i \in S}
T_i\Big|$. It is a classic result that the greedy algorithm for this problem
achieves an optimal approximation ratio of $(1-e^{-1})$.
</p>
<p>In this work we consider a generalization of this problem wherein an element
$a$ can contribute by an amount that depends on the number of times it is
covered. Given a concave, nondecreasing function $\varphi$, we define
$C^{\varphi}(S) := \sum_{a \in [n]}w_a\varphi(|S|_a)$, where $|S|_a = |\{i \in
S : a \in T_i\}|$. The standard maximum coverage problem corresponds to taking
$\varphi(j) = \min\{j,1\}$. For any such $\varphi$, we provide an efficient
algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio equal to the Poisson concavity
ratio of $\varphi$, defined by $\alpha_{\varphi} := \inf_{x \in \mathbb{N}}
\frac{\mathbb{E}[\varphi(\text{Poi}(x))]}{\varphi(\mathbb{E}[\text{Poi}(x)])}$.
Complementing this approximation guarantee, we establish a matching NP-hardness
result when $\varphi$ grows in a sublinear way.
</p>
<p>As special cases, we improve the result of [Barman et al., IPCO, 2020] about
maximum multi-coverage, that was based on the unique games conjecture, and we
recover the result of [Dudycz et al., IJCAI, 2020] on multi-winner
approval-based voting for geometrically dominant rules. Our result goes beyond
these special cases and we illustrate it with applications to distributed
resource allocation problems, welfare maximization problems and approval-based
voting for general rules.

belongs to at least $k-2$ triangles of $H$. This notion has been introduced
around ten years ago in social network analysis and security, as a form of
cohesive subgraph that is rich of triangles and less stringent than the clique.
The \emph{trussness} of a graph is the maximum $k$ such that a $k$-truss
exists.
</p>
<p>The problem of computing $k$-trusses has been largely investigated from the
practical and engineering point of view. On the other hand, the theoretical
side of the problem has received much less attention, despite presenting
interesting challenges. The existing methods share a common design, based on
iteratively removing the edge with smallest support, where the support of an
edge is the number of triangles containing it.
</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is studying algorithmic aspects of graph trussness.
While it is possible to show that the time complexity of computing exactly the
graph trussness and that of counting/listing all triangles is inherently the
same, we provide efficient algorithms for estimating its value, under suitable
conditions, with significantly lower complexity than the exact approach. In
particular, we provide a $(1 \pm \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that is
asymptotically faster than the exact approach, on graphs which contain
$\omega(m \, polylog(n))$ triangles, and has the same running time on graphs
that do not. For the latter case, we also show that it is impossible to obtain
an approximation algorithm with faster running time than the one of the exact
approach when the number of triangles is $O(m)$, unless well known conjectures
on triangle-freeness and Boolean matrix multiplication are false.

deletions with $m$ edges in the initial version of $G$ and $n = |V|$, we
consider the problem of maintaining all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) in $G$.
</p>
<p>Whilst this problem has been studied in a long line of research [ACM'81,
FOCS'99, FOCS'01, STOC'02, STOC'03, SWAT'04, STOC'13] and the problem of
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate, weighted APSP was solved to near-optimal update
time $\tilde{O}(mn)$ by Bernstein [STOC'13], the problem has mainly been
studied in the context of oblivious adversaries, which assumes that the
adversary fixes the update sequence before the algorithm is started.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we make significant progress on the problem in the setting
where the adversary is adaptive, i.e. can base the update sequence on the
output of the data structure queries. We present three new data structures that
fit different settings:
</p>
<p>We first present a deterministic data structure that maintains exact
distances with total update time $\tilde{O}(n^3)$.
</p>
<p>We also present a deterministic data structure that maintains
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate distance estimates with total update time $\tilde
O(\sqrt{m} n^2/\epsilon)$ which for sparse graphs is $\tilde
O(n^{2+1/2}/\epsilon)$.
</p>
<p>Finally, we present a randomized $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate data structure
which works against an adaptive adversary; its total update time is $\tilde
O(m^{2/3}n^{5/3} + n^{8/3}/(m^{1/3}\epsilon^2))$ which for sparse graphs is
$\tilde O(n^{2+1/3})$.
</p>
<p>Our exact data structure matches the total update time of the best randomized
data structure by Baswana et al. [STOC'02] and maintains the distance matrix in
near-optimal time. Our approximate data structures improve upon the best data
structures against an adaptive adversary which have $\tilde{O}(mn^2)$ total
update time [JACM'81, STOC'03].

    <title>Splay trees on trees</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1601856000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Berendsohn:Benjamin_Aram.html">Benjamin Aram Berendsohn</a>, László Kozma <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00931">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Search trees on trees (STTs) are a far-reaching generalization of binary
search trees (BSTs), allowing the efficient exploration of tree-structured
domains. (BSTs are the special case in which the underlying domain is a path.)
Trees on trees have been extensively studied under various guises in computer
science and discrete mathematics.
</p>
<p>Recently Bose, Cardinal, Iacono, Koumoutsos, and Langerman (SODA 2020)
considered adaptive STTs and observed that, apart from notable exceptions, the
machinery developed for BSTs in the past decades does not readily transfer to
STTs. In particular, they asked whether the optimal STT can be efficiently
computed or approximated (by analogy to Knuth's algorithm for optimal BSTs),
and whether natural self-adjusting BSTs such as Splay trees (Sleator, Tarjan,
1983) can be extended to this more general setting.
</p>
<p>We answer both questions affirmatively. First, we show that a $(1 +
\frac{1}{t})$-approximation of the optimal STT for a given search distribution
can be computed in time $O(n^{2t + 1})$ for all integers $t \geq 1$. Second, we
identify a broad family of STTs with linear rotation-distance, allowing the
generalization of Splay trees to the STT setting. We show that our generalized
Splay satisfies a static optimality theorem, asymptotically matching the cost
of the optimal STT in an online fashion, i.e. without a priori knowledge of the
search distribution. Our results suggest an extension of the dynamic optimality
conjecture for Splay trees to the broader setting of trees on trees.

    <title>The Sparse Vector Technique, Revisited</title>

literature of differential privacy - the sparse vector technique [Dwork et al.,
STOC 2009]. Loosely speaking, this technique allows us to privately test
whether the value of a given query is close to what we expect it would be
(w.r.t. the input database), where we are allowed to test an unbounded number
of queries as long as their value is indeed close to what we expected. After
the first time in which this is not the case, the process halts. We present a
modification to the sparse vector technique that allows for a more fine-tuned
privacy analysis. As a result, in some cases we are able to continue with the
process of testing queries even after the first time in which the value of the
query did not meet our expectations.
</p>
<p>We demonstrate our technique by applying it to the shifting-heavy-hitters
problem: On every time step, each of n users gets a new input, and the task is
to privately identify all the current heavy-hitters. That is, on time step i,
the goal is to identify all data elements x such that many of the users have x
as their current input. We present an algorithm for this problem with improved
error guarantees over what can be obtained using existing techniques.
Specifically, the error of our algorithm depends on the maximal number of times
that a singe user holds a heavy-hitter as input, rather than the total number
of times in which a heavy-hitter exists.

problem with multiple knapsacks, heterogeneous constraints on which items can
be assigned to which knapsack, and rate-limiting constraints on the assignment
of items to knapsacks. This problem generalizes variations of the knapsack
problem and of the one-way trading problem that have previously been treated
separately, and additionally finds application to the real-time control of
electric vehicle (EV) charging. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves a
competitive ratio within an additive factor of one of the best achievable
competitive ratios for the general problem and matches or improves upon the
best-known competitive ratio for special cases in the knapsack and one-way
trading literatures. Moreover, our analysis provides a novel approach to online
algorithm design based on an instance-dependent primal-dual analysis that
connects the identification of worst-case instances to the design of
algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the proposed algorithm via trace-based
experiments of EV charging.

characteristic behind the validity and growing popularity of topological data
analysis in exploring real-world data. Central to this stability is the use of
Bottleneck distance which entails matching points between diagrams. Use of this
metric in practical studies has, however, been few and sparingly because of the
computational obstruction, especially in dimension zero where the computational
cost explodes with the growth of data size. We present LUM\'AWIG, a novel
efficient algorithm to compute dimension zero bottleneck distance between two
persistent diagrams which runs significantly faster and provides significantly
sharper approximates with respect to the output of the original algorithm than
any other available algorithm. We bypass the overwhelming matching problem in
previous implementations of the bottleneck distance, and prove that the zero
dimensional bottleneck distance can be recovered from a very small number of
matching cases. We show that LUM\'AWIG generally enjoys linear complexity as
shown by empirical tests. We also present an application that leverages
dimension zero persistence diagrams and the bottleneck distance to produce
features for classification tasks.

models while respecting data privacy. This technique is based on heterogeneous
devices that work together to iteratively train a model while never sharing
their own data. Given the synchronous nature of this training, the performance
of Federated Learning systems is dictated by the slowest devices, also known as
stragglers. In this paper, we investigate the problem of minimizing the
duration of Federated Learning rounds by controlling how much data each device
uses for training. We formulate this problem as a makespan minimization problem
with identical, independent, and atomic tasks that have to be assigned to
heterogeneous resources with non-decreasing cost functions while respecting
lower and upper limits of tasks per resource. Based on this formulation, we
propose a polynomial-time algorithm named OLAR and prove that it provides
optimal schedules. We evaluate OLAR in an extensive experimental evaluation
using simulation that includes comparisons to other algorithms from the state
of the art and new extensions to them. Our results indicate that OLAR provides
optimal solutions with a small execution time. They also show that the presence
of lower and upper limits of tasks per resource erase any benefits that
suboptimal heuristics could provide in terms of algorithm execution time.

<p>I’d like you to feel about the <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">impending destruction</a> of Virginia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a>, the same way you might’ve felt when the Taliban threatened to blow up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan">Bamyan Buddhas</a>, and then days later actually did blow them up.  Or the way you felt when human negligence caused wildfires that incinerated half the koalas in Australia, or turned the San Francisco skyline into an orange hellscape.  For that matter, the same way most of us felt the day Trump was elected.  I’d like you to feel in the bottom of your stomach the <em>avoidability</em>, and yet the finality, of the loss.</p>



<p>For thousands of kids in the DC area, especially first- or second-generation immigrants, TJHS represented a lifeline.  Score high enough on an entrance exam—something hard but<em> totally within your control</em>—and you could attend a school where, instead of the other kids either tormenting or ignoring you, they might teach you Lisp or the surreal number system.  Where you could learn humility instead of humiliation.</p>



<p>When I visited TJHS back in 2012 to give a quantum computing talk, I toured the campus, chatted with students, fielded their questions, and thought: so <em>this</em> is the teenagerhood—the ironically <em>normal</em> teenagerhood—that I was denied by living someplace else.  I found myself wishing that a hundred more TJHS’s, large and small, would sprout up across the country.  I felt like if I could further that goal then, though the universe return to rubble, my life would’ve had a purpose.</p>



<p>Instead, of course, our sorry country is destroying the few such schools that exist.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/nyregion/specialized-schools-nyc-deblasio.html">Stuyvesant and Bronx Science</a> in New York, and the Liberal Arts and Science Academy here in Austin, are also under mortal threat right now.  The numerous parents who moved, who arranged their lives, specifically so that these schools might later be available for “high-risk” kids were suckered.</p>



<p>Assuming you haven’t just emerged from 30 years in a Tibetan cave, you presumably know why this is happening.  As the <em>Washington Post</em>‘s Jay Matthews <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/americas-top-sat-school-makes-another-disputed-attempt-at-diversity/2020/10/03/1bef3db2-0261-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F2bf01fe%2F5f78a5d19d2fda0efb3d8031%2F5974cf76ade4e21a8497eeb1%2F42%2F62%2F2b179e7390f19bdba6f66f626ab37646">explains</a>, the Fairfax County School Board is “embarrassed” to have a school that, despite all its outreach attempts, remains only 5% Black and Latino—even though, crucially, the school <em>also</em> happens to be only 19% White (it’s now ~75% Asian).</p>



<p>You might ask: so then why doesn’t TJHS just institute affirmative action, like almost every university does?  It seems there’s an extremely interesting answer: <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/04/26/is-the-no-1-high-school-in-america-thomas-jefferson-fairfax-discrimination/">they did in the 1990s</a>, and Black and Hispanic enrollment surged.  But then the verdicts of court cases, brought by right-wing groups, made the school district fear that they’d be open to lawsuits if they continued with affirmative action, so they dropped it.  Now the boomerang has returned, and the School Board has decided on a more drastic remedy: namely, to eliminate the TJHS entrance exam entirely, and replace it by a lottery for anyone whose GPA exceeds 3.5.</p>



<p>The trouble is, TJHS without an entrance exam is no longer TJHS.  More likely than not, such a place would simply converge to become another of the thousands of schools across the US where success is based on sports, networking, and popularity.  And if by some miracle it avoided that fate, <em>still</em> it would no longer be available to most of the kids who‘d most need it.</p>



<p>So yes, the district is <strong>embarrassed</strong>—note that the<em> Washington Post</em> writer explains it as if that’s the most obvious, natural reaction in the world—to host a school that’s regularly ranked #1 in the US, with the highest average SATs and a distinguished list of alumni.  To avoid this embarrassment, the solution is (in effect) to burn the school to the ground.</p>



<p>In a world-historic irony, the main effect of this “solution” will be to <strong>drastically limit the number of Asian students, while drastically <em>increasing</em> (!!!) the number of White students</strong>.  The proportion of Black and Hispanic students is projected to increase a bit but remain small.  Let me say that one more time: in practice, TJHS’s move from a standardized test to a lottery will be<strong> overwhelmingly pro-White, anti-Asian, and anti-immigrant</strong>; only as a much smaller effect will it be pro-underrepresented-minority.</p>



<p>In spite of covid and everything else going on, hundreds of students and parents have been <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">protesting in front of TJHS</a> to try to prevent the school’s tragic and pointless destruction.  But it sounds like TJHS’s fate might be sealed.  The school board tolerated excellence for 35 more years than it wanted to; now its patience is at an end.</p>



<p>Some will say: sure, the end of TJHS is unfortunate, Scott, but why do you let this stuff <em>weigh</em> on you so heavily?  This is merely another instance of friendly fire, of good people fighting the just war against racism, and in <em>one</em> case hitting a target that, yeah, OK, probably should’ve been spared.  On reflection, though, I can accept that only insofar as I accept that it was “friendly fire” when Bolsheviks targeted the kulaks, or (much more comically, less importantly, and less successfully) when Arthur Chu, Amanda Marcotte, and a thousand other woke-ists targeted me.  With friendly fire like that, who needs enemy fire?</p>



<p>If you care about the gifted Black and Hispanic kids of Fairfax County, then like me, you should demand a change in the law to allow the reinstatement of affirmative action for them.  You should acknowledge that the issue lies there and not with TJHS itself.</p>



<p>I don’t see how you reach the point of understanding all the facts and still wanting to dismantle TJHS, over the desperate pleas of the students and parents, without a decent helping of <em>resentment</em> toward the kind of student who flourishes there—without a wish to see those uppity,  “fresh off the boat” Chinese and Indian grinds get dragged down to where they belong.  And if you tell me that such magnet programs need to end even though you yourself once benefitted from them—well, isn’t that more contemptible still?  Aren’t you knowingly burning a bridge you crossed so that a younger generation can’t follow you, basically reassuring the popular crowd that if they’ll only accept <em>you</em>, then there won’t be a hundred more greasy nerds in your tow?  And if, on some level, you already know these things about yourself, then the only purpose of this post has been to remind you of them.</p>

<p>As for the news that dominates the wires and inevitably preempts what I’ve written: <strong>I wish for his successful recovery, followed by his losing the election and spending the rest of his life in New York State prison</strong>.  (And I look forward to seeing how woke Twitter summarizes the preceding statement—e.g., “Aaronson, his mask finally off, conveys well-wishes to Donald Trump”…)</p>

machine learning algorithm that has traditionally been solved with heuristic
algorithms like Average-Linkage. Recently, Dasgupta reframed HC as a discrete
optimization problem by introducing a global cost function measuring the
quality of a given tree. In this work, we provide the first continuous
relaxation of Dasgupta's discrete optimization problem with provable quality
guarantees. The key idea of our method, HypHC, is showing a direct
correspondence from discrete trees to continuous representations (via the
hyperbolic embeddings of their leaf nodes) and back (via a decoding algorithm
that maps leaf embeddings to a dendrogram), allowing us to search the space of
discrete binary trees with continuous optimization. Building on analogies
between trees and hyperbolic space, we derive a continuous analogue for the
notion of lowest common ancestor, which leads to a continuous relaxation of
Dasgupta's discrete objective. We can show that after decoding, the global
minimizer of our continuous relaxation yields a discrete tree with a (1 +
epsilon)-factor approximation for Dasgupta's optimal tree, where epsilon can be
made arbitrarily small and controls optimization challenges. We experimentally
evaluate HypHC on a variety of HC benchmarks and find that even approximate
solutions found with gradient descent have superior clustering quality than
agglomerative heuristics or other gradient based algorithms. Finally, we
highlight the flexibility of HypHC using end-to-end training in a downstream
classification task.

    <title>Counting 4-Patterns in Permutations Is Equivalent to Counting 4-Cycles in Graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1601769600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Bartłomiej Dudek, Paweł Gawrychowski <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00348">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Permutation $\sigma$ appears in permutation $\pi$ if there exists a
subsequence of $\pi$ that is order-isomorphic to $\sigma$. The natural question
is to check if $\sigma$ appears in $\pi$, and if so count the number of
occurrences. We know that for any fixed length~k, we can check if a given
pattern of length k appears in a permutation of length n in time linear in n,
but being able to count all such occurrences in $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$
time would refute the exponential time hypothesis (ETH). This motivates a
systematic study of the complexity of counting occurrences for different
patterns of fixed small length k. We investigate this question for k=4. Very
recently, Even-Zohar and Leng [arXiv 2019] identified two types of 4-patterns.
For the first type they designed an $\~O(n)$ time algorithm, while for the
second they were able to provide an $\~O(n^{1.5})$ time algorithm. This brings
up the question whether the permutations of the second type are inherently
harder than the first type.
</p>
<p>We establish a connection between counting 4-patterns of the second type and
counting 4-cycles in a sparse undirected graph. By designing two-way reductions
we show that the complexities of both problems are the same, up to
polylogarithmic factors. This allows us to provide a reasonable argument for
why there is a difference in the complexities for counting 4-patterns of the
two types. In particular, even for the simpler problem of detecting a 4-cycle
in a graph on m edges, the best known algorithm works in $O(m^{4/3})$ time. Our
reductions imply that an $O(n^{4/3-\varepsilon})$ time algorithm for counting
occurrences would imply an exciting breakthrough for counting (and hence also
detecting) 4-cycles. In the other direction, by plugging in the fastest known
algorithm for counting 4-cycles, we obtain an algorithm for counting
occurrences of any 4-pattern in $O(n^{1.48})$ time.

operational processes, extracting models from event data, checking the
conformance between event data and normative models, and enhancing all aspects
of processes. Most approaches assume that event data is accurately capture
behavior. However, this is not realistic in many applications: data can contain
uncertainty, generated from errors in recording, imprecise measurements, and
other factors. Recently, new techniques have been developed to analyze event
data containing uncertainty; these techniques strongly rely on representing
uncertain event data through graph-based models explicitly capturing
uncertainty. In this paper, we present a novel approach to efficiently compute
a graph representation of the behavior contained in an uncertain process trace.
We present our new algorithm, analyze its time complexity, and report
experimental results showing order-of-magnitude performance improvements for
behavior graph construction.

    <title>Approximation of the Double Travelling Salesman Problem with Multiple Stacks</title>

with the collect and delivery of n commodities in two distinct cities, where
the pickup and the delivery tours are related by LIFO constraints. During the
pickup tour, commodities are loaded into a container of k rows, or stacks, with
capacity c. This paper focuses on computational aspects of the DTSPMS, which is
NP-hard.
</p>
<p>We first review the complexity of two critical subproblems: deciding whether
a given pair of pickup and delivery tours is feasible and, given a loading
plan, finding an optimal pair of pickup and delivery tours, are both polynomial
under some conditions on k and c.
</p>
<p>We then prove a (3k)/2 standard approximation for the MinMetrickDTSPMS, where
k is a universal constant, and other approximation results for various versions
of the problem.
</p>
<p>We finally present a matching-based heuristic for the 2DTSPMS, which is a
special case with k=2 rows, when the distances are symmetric. This yields a
1/2-o(1), 3/4-o(1) and 3/2+o(1) standard approximation for respectively
Max2DTSPMS, its restriction Max2DTSPMS-(1,2) with distances 1 and 2, and
Min2DTSPMS-(1,2), and a 1/2-o(1) differential approximation for Min2DTSPMS and
Max2DTSPMS.

    <title>Open Problem - Avoiding the Union Bound for Multiple Queries</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Background:</strong> Perhaps the best-studied problem in differential privacy is answering multiple counting queries.
The standard approach is to add independent, appropriately-calibrated (Laplace or Gaussian) noise to each query result and apply a composition theorem.
To bound the maximum error over the query answers, one takes a union bound over the independent noise samples.
However, this is <em>not</em> optimal.
The problem is to identify the optimal method (up to constant factors).</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Is there a randomized algorithm \(M : \{0,1\}^{n \times k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k\) that is differentially private<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1">1</a></sup> and satisfies
\[
\forall x \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times k} \quad \mathbb{E}\left[ \left\|M(x) - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right\|_\infty \right] \leq c \sqrt{k}
\]
for some constant \( c &gt; 0\) depending only on the privacy parameters?<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Adding independent Gaussian noise to each coordinate/query yields \(c \sqrt{k \log k}\) in place of \(c \sqrt{k}\) above. 
Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>] showed that the union bound can <em>almost</em> be avoided and obtained \(c \sqrt{k \log \log k}\) using correlated noise.
The algorithm is nonetheless based on independent Gaussian noise, with the added step of using the exponential mechanism to identify high-error answers and correct them.</p>

<p>Note that a \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) lower bound is known [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3158">BUV18</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>]. By [<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~bhaskara/files/privacy.pdf">BDKT12</a>] it suffices to consider mechanisms \(M\) that add <em>instance-independent noise</em>. That is, \(M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + Z\) where \(Z\) is some fixed noise distribution over \(\mathbb{R}^k\) that is independent of \(x\).</p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> For a positive solution, an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner at a sushi restaurant of your choice.
If the solution is an efficiently-sampleable distribution with a closed-form density, alcohol will be included.
For a negative solution, alcohol only.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

A very recent work by Ganesh and Zhao [<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~arunganesh/papers/generalizedgaussians.pdf">GZ20</a>] improves the best upper bound from \(c\sqrt{k \log \log k}\) to \(c\sqrt{k \log \log \log k}\).</p>

<p>Do you have more brothers than sisters? or more sisters than brothers? or the same number?</p>



<p>Then you separate the boys’s answers from the girls’s answers</p>



<p>Which of the following is true?</p>



<ol><li>The answers from boys will be tilted toward having MORE sisters and LESS brothers</li><li>The answers from boys will be tilted toward having MORE brothers and LESS sisters</li><li>There will be no (statistically significant) difference.      </li></ol>



<p><strong>The reason for answer 1 is</strong>: Since the ratio of boys/girls is 50/50, and you don’t count yourself in the answer, boys will tend to have more sisters and girls will tend to have more brothers</p>



<p><strong>The reason for answer 2 </strong>is: Some families are uneven and have more boys. In these families you will see more boys having more brothers than sisters and less girls having more brothers than sisters. Some families are uneven and have more girls. In these families you will see more girls having more sisters than brothers and less boys having more sisters than brothers. </p>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: Lifting theorems in complexity theory are a method of transferring lower bounds in a weak computational model into lower bounds for a more powerful computational model, via function composition. There has been an explosion of lifting theorems in the last ten years, essentially reducing communication lower bounds to query complexity lower bounds. These theorems only hold for composition with very specific “gadgets” such as indexing and inner product. <br/><br/> In this talk, we will present a generalization of the theorem lifting Nullstellensatz degree to monotone span program size by Pitassi and Robere (2018) so that it works for any gadget with high enough rank, in particular, for useful gadgets such as equality and greater-than. We will then explain how to apply our generalized theorem to solve three open problems: <br/>– We present the first result that demonstrates a separation in proof power for cutting planes with unbounded versus polynomially bounded coefficients. Specifically, we exhibit CNF formulas that can be refuted in quadratic length and constant line space in cutting planes with unbounded coefficients, but for which there are no refutations in subexponential length and subpolynomial line space if coefficients are restricted to be of polynomial magnitude.<br/>– We give the strongest separation to-date between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone Boolean circuits. Namely, we show that the classical GEN problem, which has polynomial-size monotone Boolean circuits, requires monotone Boolean formulas of size <img alt="2^{\Omega(n / \textrm{polylog} n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%5COmega%28n+%2F+%5Ctextrm%7Bpolylog%7D+n%29%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="2^{\Omega(n / \textrm{polylog} n)}"/>.<br/>– We give the first explicit separation between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone real formulas. Namely, we give an explicit family of functions that can be computed with monotone real formulas of nearly linear size but require monotone Boolean formulas of exponential size. Previously only a non-explicit separation was known.<br/><br/>This talk is based on joint work with Or Meir, Jakob Nordström, Toniann Pitassi, Robert Robere, and Marc Vinyals, available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02144" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02144</a> </p></div>

    <title>TR20-149 |  Robustly Self-Ordered Graphs: Constructions and Applications to Property Testing | 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Avi Wigderson</title>
    <summary>A graph $G$ is called {\em self-ordered}\/ (a.k.a asymmetric) if the identity permutation is its only automorphism.
Equivalently, there is a unique isomorphism from $G$ to any graph that is isomorphic to $G$. 
We say that $G=(V,E)$ is {\em robustly self-ordered}\/ if the size of the symmetric difference between $E$ and the edge-set of the graph obtained by permuting $V$ using any permutation $\pi:V\to V$ is proportional to the number of non-fixed-points of $\pi$.

We show that robustly self-ordered bounded-degree graphs exist (in abundance), and that they can be constructed efficiently, in a strong sense.
Specifically, given the index of a vertex in such a graph, it is possible to find all its neighbors in polynomial-time (i.e., in time that is poly-logarithmic in the size of the graph).

We provide two very different constructions, in tools and structure. 
The first, a direct construction, is based on proving a sufficient condition for robust self-ordering, 
which requires that an auxiliary graph, on {\em pairs|}\/ of vertices of the original graph, is expanding. 
In this case the original graph is (not only robustly self-ordered but) also expanding.
The second construction proceeds in three steps: It boosts the mere existence of robustly self-ordered graphs, 
which provides explicit graphs of sublogarithmic size, to an efficient construction of polynomial-size graphs, 
and then, repeating it again, to exponential-size(robustly self-ordered) graphs that are locally constructible.
This construction can yield robustly self-ordered graphs that are either expanders or highly disconnected, having logarithmic size connected components. 

We also consider graphs of unbounded degree, seeking correspondingly unbounded robustness parameters.
We again demonstrate that such graphs (of linear degree) exist (in abundance), and give an explicit construction. 
This turns out to require very different tools, and the definition and constructions of new pseudo-random objects. 
Specifically, we show that the construction of such graphs reduces to the construction of non-malleable two-source extractors 
with very weak parameters but with an additional natural feature. 
Next, we reduce the construction of such non-malleable two-source extractors to the construction of ``relocation-detecting'' codes. Loosely speaking, in such code permuting arbitrarily the coordinates of a random codeword yields a string that is far any other codeword. We conclude by showing how to construct relocation-detecting codes (of various types, including ones with constant rate).  

We demonstrate that robustly self-ordered bounded-degree graphs are useful towards obtaining lower bounds on the query complexity of testing graph properties both in the bounded-degree and the dense graph models.  
Indeed, their robustness offers efficient, local and distance preserving reductions from testing problems on ordered structures (like sequences) to the unordered (effectively unlabeled) graphs. 
One of the results that we obtain, via such a reduction, is a subexponential separation 
between the complexity of testing and tolerant testing of graph properties in the bounded-degree graph model.</summary>

    <title>TR20-148 |  Simple and fast derandomization from very hard functions: Eliminating randomness at almost no cost | 

	Roei Tell, 

	Lijie Chen</title>
    <summary>Extending the classical ``hardness-to-randomness'' line-of-works, Doron et al. (FOCS 2020) recently proved that derandomization with near-quadratic time overhead is possible, under the assumption that there exists a function in $\mathcal{DTIME}[2^n]$ that cannot be computed by randomized SVN circuits of size $2^{(1-\epsilon)\cdot n}$ for a small $\epsilon$.

In this work we extend their inquiry and answer several open questions that arose from their work. Our main result is that *derandomization with almost no time overhead is possible*, under a plausible hypothesis. Specifically, we show that probabilistic algorithms that run in time $T(n)$ can be deterministically simulated in time $n\cdot T(n)^{1+\epsilon}$, under a hypothesis that is formally incomparable to the one of Doron et al., but is arguably more standard: We assume that there exist non-uniformly secure one-way functions, and that for $\delta=\delta(\epsilon)$ and $k=k_T(\epsilon)$ there exists a problem in $\mathcal{DTIME}[2^{k\cdot n}]$ that is hard for algorithms that run in time $2^{(k-\delta)\cdot n}$ and use $2^{(1-\delta)\cdot n}$ bits of advice. We also show that the latter hypothesis (or, more accurately, a relaxation of it that we use) is in fact necessary to obtain the derandomization conclusion if one relies on a PRG construction (as is indeed our approach).

For sub-exponential time functions $T(n)=2^{n^{o(1)}}$ we further improve the derandomization time to $n^{1+\epsilon}\cdot T(n)$, under a mildly stronger hypothesis. We also show that *the multiplicative time overhead of $n$ is essentially optimal*, conditioned on a counting version of the non-deterministic strong exponential-time hypothesis (i.e., on $\# NSETH$). Nevertheless, we show that *in the average-case setting a faster derandomization is possible*: Under hypotheses similar to the ones in our main result, we show that for every $L\in\mathcal{BPTIME}[n^k]$ there exists a deterministic algorithm $A_L$ running in time $n^{\epsilon}\cdot n^{k}$ such that for every distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\{0,1\}^n$ samplable in time $n^k$ it holds that $\Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{D}}[A_L(x)=L(x)]\ge1-n^{-\omega(1)}$. 

Lastly, we present an alternative proof for the result of Doron et al. using a *proof paradigm that is both considerably simpler and more general*; in fact, we show how to simplify the analysis of any construction that ``extracts randomness from a pseudoentropic string''. We use this simpler proof to extend their result, deducing a mildly slower derandomization (i.e., with cubic or quadratic overhead) from weaker hardness assumptions (i.e., for SVN circuits that do not use randomness).</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h1/>



<p>A <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/01/14/a-masters-project/">recent post</a> on this blog concerned the posting of our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP*=RE</a> on the arXiv and gave a personal history of the the sequence of works that led to the result. Quite unfortunately (dramatically?) a few weeks after initial posting of the paper (and the blog post) John Wright discovered an important error in the proof of a key result in this sequence: my paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/140956622">Three-player entangled XOR games are NP-hard to approximate</a>, published in 2016 in a special issue of the SIAM journal on computing dedicated to selected papers from the FOCS’13 conference. While I did not mention this paper directly in the previous blog post, its main result, a proof of soundness of the Raz-Safra low-degree test against entangled-player strategies, is a key ingredient in the proof of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">quantum low-degree test</a>, itself a key ingredient in the MIP*=RE paper. (Strictly speaking the latter paper relies on an extension of my result to two-player games obtained in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03062">follow-up</a> with Natarajan. Since that paper re-used the flawed part of my earlier analysis in a black-box manner it is similarly impacted.) So then…?</p>



<h2 id="scientific-aspects">Scientific aspects</h2>



<p>I’ll start with the science. The result MIP*=RE, to the best of our knowledge, remains correct. In order to remove the dependence of the proof on the flawed paper we extended the soundness analysis of Babai, Fortnow and Lund (BFL)’s multilinearity test against entangled provers from my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">paper with Ito</a> to the case of multivariate polynomials of low individual degree. (This extension, for the case of classical provers, is already mentioned in the BFL paper.) We just posted a self-contained analysis of that test on the arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">here</a> and updated the MIP*=RE paper to account for the replacement (see v2.). The latter paper is currently under review; on this I will simply say that, as for all mathematical works, it is advised to wait until the outcome of the refereeing process is complete before declaring confidence in the validity of the result. For a more in-depth description of the changes made I refer to the introduction of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">new paper</a>.</p>



<p>Our analysis of the “low individual-degree test” mentioned in the preceding paragraph can be used to recover the main result of my SICOMP’16 paper in a weakened form. Since the proof is different and does not directly fix the error I have decided to withdraw the paper from SICOMP. For more details on the error itself and consequences to other works, such as the quantum low-degree test and the quantum games PCP, I refer to the <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/errata.pdf">short note</a> I wrote to accompany the withdrawal of the paper. The one-sentence summary is that essentially all subsequent results expressed in terms of “high” complexity classes such as QMA-EXP, NEEXP, etc., still hold, while “scaled-down” results on the hardness of entangled games can only be recovered by allowing a substantial weakening of parameters. In particular, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">quantum low-degree test</a> holds in its scaled-up version (testing exp(n) EPR pairs using poly(n) resources), but the scaled-down version requires polylog(n) communication to test n EPR pairs, instead of O(log n) as claimed.</p>



<h2 id="personal-aspects">Personal aspects</h2>



<p>In addition to notifying researchers in the area of the bug, my goal in writing this blog post is to help me exorcise the demon of having a large mistake in one of my papers. In doing so I was inspired by Scott Aaronson’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2854">blog post</a> on a similar topic. (I’ll admit that even just linking explicitly to his post helps reassure myself, a power which I believe was one of Scott’s aims in writing the post. So, thanks Scott, and allow me to pass it on!) The faulty paper is not based on a minor back-of-the-envelope observation; in fact it is one that I was quite proud of. The mistake in it is not small either; it’s a mistake that I cannot find any excuse for having made. Yet here I am: after having spent the past 6 months trying to find an alternative proof, I now strongly believe that the problem cannot be solved using the kind of techniques that I had imagined could do so. Whether the theorem statement is true or not, I don’t know; but at the moment I am unable to prove it. I have to accept that there is a bug.</p>



<p>As painful as it is I realize that I am writing this post from a relatively comfortable position. Who knows if I would have been able to do the same had we not been able to recover a full proof of MIP*=RE. Moreover, after having banged my head against the problem for 6 months straight (COVID helping, walls were never far) I am now able to see my failure in a more positive light: the story I told in the previous blog post is not yet closed; there is an open challenge for me to solve. It is a very personal challenge; having spent the past 6 months delineating it I have accumulated sufficient grounds on which to believe that it is an interesting one. I feel grateful for this.</p>



<p>Getting there wasn’t easy. So, even though I am writing from a place of comfort, I want to share the pain that the whole adventure has caused me. This simple acknowledgment is especially directed at younger readers: so that when it happens to you, you will remember this post and know that you’re not the only one. That it happens to others as well and that it is possible to face, accept, and move away from such errors. Of course you will try to fix it first. Here are some quick tips. While banging your head on the problem, make sure that your understanding increases every day. To start with, do you really understand why there is a mistake? Of course some step doesn’t go through, but what is the simplest form of the incriminated statement that fails? Can you write it down? Can you formulate and prove a weaker form of it? Probe the issue with examples. Try to isolate it as much as you can: take it outside of the paper and formulate an entirely self-contained version of it, stripped of all the baggage. Place it in as many different contexts that you can think of: do you still believe it, does it stand on its own? Again, make sure that you learn. Even if you’re not able to fix the claim, are you exploring a new technique, discovering a new perspective? If it didn’t work yesterday it probably won’t work today either: make sure that you always find something new to inject. When you can no longer do this, it is time to stop. So make sure to set yourself some near-term (how much to think about this on any given day) and long-term (when to admit defeat) limits. Always remember that problems are much more often solved in the shower or while walking the dog than at the desk. Finally, be ready to move on. Realize that as bad as it may seem to you, there are more important things in life. You can’t reduce yourself to this one problem: you’ll be stronger for accepting what happened than trying to bury it at all costs. If you don’t see this by yourself, try to talk about it. Explain the situation you’re in to your close non-academia friends, to your parents; practice on your pet first if it helps. You will realize, as I eventually did (although it took quite a while) that <em>it is ok</em>.</p>



<h2 id="social-aspects">Social aspects</h2>



<p>After the scientific and the personal aspects, let me end with the sociological. This is a semi-tangent but it is a good opportunity to discuss a topic that we scientists, possibly even more so us working in the “hard sciences” (as the French call “proof-based” disciplines), are insufficiently sensitized to. This is the topic of how science is made, and what is the reality of this “absolute truth” that we claim to discover and establish in our mathematical results.</p>



<p>My paper was posted on arXiv in 2013, it was accepted to the FOCS conference and published in its proceedings the same year, and it appeared in the journal SICOMP in 2016. Both publications were refereed. Since its posting the paper has been cited 47 times (google scholar) and its main result is used in an essential way in at least half a dozen papers (my best guess). 7 years later a big hole has been found in the proof. How did the “truth value of my result evolve in the process? Was it always wrong or was there a time where it had truth, in whatever appropriate sense of the word?</p>



<p>I realize that these questions can be given trivial answers—I know what is an axiom and what is a proof system. Yet I am trying to push myself, and my reader, to look a little deeper. An analogy might help. The situation brought to mind a book by French philosopher of science Bruno Latour, called (in its English translation) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Laboratory-Life-Construction-Scientific-Facts/dp/069102832X">Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts</a>. This is a wonderful book, which goes well beyond the classic misconceptions from Popper or even Kuhn; it should be mandatory reading for every scientist. In one of the early chapters of the book Latour makes a detailed study of how subsequent citations can collectively enshrine an initial claim based entirely on the citer’s conscious or unconscious biases in making use of the citation (i.e. in complete independence from any ground “truth” or “importance” of the cited work). An entertaining example of this can be found in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0306312714535679">this article</a>, which dissects the claim that “The myth from the 1930s that spinach is a rich source of iron was due to misleading information in the original publication: a malpositioned decimal point gave a 10-fold overestimate of iron content.” The example, pursued in great depth in the article, shows very well how one citation at a time the (spoiler: unjustified) claim is given more and more credibility until it eventually becomes a fact: from initial citations written in a tentative tone “according to Z, it could be that…” to more assertive citations “Z has shown that” by more and more well-known researchers in highly-read journals to pure fact (citation above). I highly recommend the article!</p>



<p>It is easy to dismiss this story as being the result of “sloppy” authors misrepresenting a “soft” claim whose truth value is not well-determined in the first place, being a statement about the world rather than about some hypothetical mathematical universe. Yet I believe that it is worth taking the time to examine with an open mind what exactly, if anything, distinguishes a claim about the iron content of spinach from the main “theorem” of my paper. From its initial posting on the arXiv to its presentation in a conference and its journal publication to the multiple citations it received through its use in subsequent works, and including multiple other considerations such as my own credibility (itself the result of so many other considerations) and the results base “believability”, when was the logical statement itself evaluated? Does it matter? Did the unchallenged existence of the result for 7 years impact the course of science? Or was it a mistake that was bound to be discovered and has no lasting consequences?</p>



<p>These are questions for the reader, that can be (and are probably better) asked in other contexts than the limited one of my result. Indeed there is a much broader point to all this, that I only meant to raise in an indirect manner. It is impossible to disregard the fact that our scientific work is grounded in cultural and societal effects, but we may disagree on the impact that this grounding has. We owe it to ourselves and to our readers (broadly interpreted—from colleagues to funding agencies to the broader public) to refuse to hide behind the thin veil of “hard science”, mathematics or logic, and educate ourselves to what it is that we really are doing.</p></div>

    <title>A Quote from Tesla which is very predictive in one way, and perhaps not in another way</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> Nikola Tesla, famous inventor, who lived 1856--1943 said the following:</p><p><br/></p><p>When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into</p><p>a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real</p><p>and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another</p><p>instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this but through television</p><p>and telephony, we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though</p><p>we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles;</p><p>and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be</p><p>amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to</p><p>carry one in his vest pocket.</p><p><br/></p><p>The `vest pocket' at the end really impressed me.</p><p><br/></p><p>By `a man will be able to carry one...' I don't know if he mean all people or if he actually </p><p>meant that women would not need such a device. If that is what he meant then,</p><p>while high marks for tech-prediction, low marks for social-prediction. </p><p><br/></p><p>This quote is SO right-on for technology that I offer the following challenge: Find other quotes from year X that were very predictive for year X+Y for a reasonably large Y.</p><p>ADDED LATER: I will give two answers to my own challenge:</p><p>1) On the TV show THE HONEYMOONERS, in 1955, Ralph Cramden predicts 3-Dim TV. I blogged about that <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/05/ralph-kramden-your-wait-is-over-3d-tv_05.html#comment-form">here</a></p><p>2) Did the TV show Get Smart foreshadow cell phones. Maxwell Smart's shoe-phone was portable but wearing it on his foot seems odd. It also used dial, not touch tone. Mel Brooks (co-creator of the series) points out that in the Pilot episode Max is enjoying a show and his phone goes off so he has to leave and take the call -- which was very strange then but standard now. So the show did predict one of the problems with cell phones, if not cell phones themselves. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: In high-dimensional statistical problems (including planted clique, sparse PCA, community detection, etc.), the class of “low-degree polynomial algorithms” captures many leading algorithmic paradigms such as spectral methods, approximate message passing, and local algorithms on sparse graphs. As such, lower bounds against low-degree algorithms constitute concrete evidence for average-case hardness of statistical problems. This method has been widely successful at explaining and predicting statistical-to-computational gaps in these settings. <br/>While prior work has understood the power of low-degree algorithms for problems with a “planted” signal, we consider here the setting of “random optimization problems” (with no planted signal), including the problem of finding a large independent set in a random graph, as well as the problem of optimizing the Hamiltonian of mean-field spin glass models. I will define low-degree algorithms in this setting, argue that they capture the best known algorithms, and explain new proof techniques for giving lower bounds against low-degree algorithms in this setting. The proof involves a variant of the so-called “overlap gap property”, which is a structural property of the solution space.<br/><br/>Based on joint work with David Gamarnik and Aukosh Jagannath, available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12063">arXiv:2004.12063</a>.</p></div>

<em>Some differences from the Computational Lens</em><br/>
<font color="#000000"/></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/ibmclmods.png"><img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-17638" height="193" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/ibmclmods.png?w=153&amp;h=193" width="153"/></a></p>
<p>
Chai Wah Wu, Jonathan Lenchner, Charles Bennett, and Yuhai Tu are the moderators for the four days of the First IBM Research Workshop on the Informational Lens. The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/informational-lens-workshop-1/home">virtual workshop</a> begins Tuesday morning at 10:45 ET. The conference has free registration and of course is online. </p>
<p>
Today we preview the conference and discuss a few of the talks.</p>
<p>
The workshop’s name echoes the moniker “Through the Computational Lens” of <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/interdisciplinary-collaboration-at-simons">initiatives</a> led by the Simons Institute at Berkeley and used for a 2014 <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2015/computational-lens">workshop</a> organized by Avi Wigderson at IAS. A <a href="http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/computational-lens.html">prospectus</a> by the theory group at U.C. Berkeley led off with quantum computing. So will Tuesday’s talks, a full day on quantum by seven leaders we say more about below.</p>
<p>
Then the meeting will branch in some different directions from the computational-lens themes. The preface on the workshop website says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Viewing the world through an informational lens, and understanding constraints and tradeoffs such as energy and parallelism versus reliability and speed, will have profound consequences throughout technology and science. This includes not only mathematics and the natural sciences like physics and biology, but also social sciences such as psychology and linguistics. We aim to bring together leading researchers in science and technology from across the globe to discuss ideas and future research directions through the informational lens. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The other three days have talks that reach into all these areas, a dazzling array. We have made a collage of the twenty-six speakers currently listed on the schedule. Several faces are long familiar but others are novel to us.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/c1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17639" height="225" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/c1.png?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Quantum Tuesday </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The opening morning has Alexander Holevo between Aram Harrow and Gil Kalai. Among many other accomplishments, Holevo is known for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo's_theorem">theorem</a> that implies that <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> qubits can yield at most <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> bits of classical information. In particular, any attempt to encode the edges of a general <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>-vertex graph via entanglements between pairs among <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> qubits must be extremely lossy. He will talk about <em>quantum channels</em> and give a structure theorem for quantum Gaussian observables.</p>
<p>
We don’t have information yet on Aram’s talk. But Gil will update us on the state of his skepticism about the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing. This was the subject of the 2012 debate between Aram and Gil that <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/perpetual-motion-of-the-21st-century/">spanned</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/06/20/can-you-hear-the-shape-of-a-quantum-computer/">eight</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/quantum-supremacy-or-classical-control/">posts</a> on this blog. Here are Gil’s title and abstract:</p>
<p>
<font color="blue">Computational complexity, mathematical, and statistical aspects of NISQ computers.</font><br/>
<i>Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) Computers hold the key for important theoretical and experimental questions regarding quantum computers. In the lecture I will describe some questions about computational complexity, mathematics, and statistics which arose in my study of NISQ systems and are related to: <br/>
a) My general argument “against” quantum computers, <br/>
b) My analysis (with Yosi Rinot and Tomer Shoham) of the Google 2019 “huge quantum advantage” experiment. </i></p>
<p>
IBM have expressed their own skepticism of Google’s claims, which we mentioned in our own <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">review</a> of the experiment last year. IBM of course also have their own quantum computing initiative.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/q.jpeg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17640" height="169" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/q.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=169" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
We may hear about its state from Charlie Bennett, whose talk leads off the afternoon but has yet to be measured, along with the following talk by Isaac Chuang. Then will come Scott Aaronson. If “tomography” in his title sounds to you like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan">CAT scan</a>, you could consider this a “Schrödinger’s Cat” scan. Well, we should let Scott tell it—the 2018 paper he mentions is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01053">this</a>.</p>
<p>
<font color="red">Shadow Tomography of Quantum States: Progress and Prospects. </font><br/>
<i>Given an unknown quantum state <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\rho}"/>, and a known list of two-outcome measurements <img alt="{E_1,...,E_M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_1%2C...%2CE_M%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{E_1,...,E_M}"/>, “shadow tomography” is the task of estimating the probability that each <img alt="{E_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{E_i}"/> accepts <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\rho}"/>, by carefully measuring only a few copies of <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\rho}"/>. In 2018, I gave the first nontrivial protocol for this task. In 2019, Guy Rothblum and I exploited a new connection between gentle measurement of quantum states and the field of differential privacy, to give a protocol that requires fewer copies of <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\rho}"/> in some cases, and has the additional advantage of being online (that is, the measurements are processed one at a time). Huge challenges remain in making shadow tomography practical with near-term devices; extremely recently Huang, Kueng, and Preskill took some promising steps in that direction. I’ll survey these developments and the challenges that remain.</i> </p>
<p>
Then Srinivasan Arunachalam, who also works at IBM T.J. Watson in Westchester, NY, will finish the day with another talk about inferring from samples:</p>
<p>
<font color="blue">Sample-efficient learning of quantum many-body systems.</font><br/>
<i>We study the problem of learning the Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body system given samples from its Gibbs (thermal) state. The classical analog of this problem, known as learning graphical models or Boltzmann machines, is a well-studied question in machine learning and statistics. In this work, we give the first sample-efficient algorithm for the quantum Hamiltonian learning problem. In particular, we prove that polynomially many samples in the number of particles (qudits) are necessary and sufficient for learning the parameters of a spatially local Hamiltonian in <img alt="{\ell_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\ell_2}"/>-norm. Our main contribution is in establishing the strong convexity of the log-partition function of quantum many-body systems, which along with the maximum entropy estimation yields our sample-efficient algorithm. Our work paves the way toward a more rigorous application of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body problems.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> B.Y.O.L. </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The workshop has lunch breaks as usual but they are not lunch breaks. Lunch is served at IBM T.J. Watson, and I (Ken) can vouch from times I have been hosted there by Jon Lenchner that the food is wonderful, but attendees will not be on hand to partake. I have known Jon since we were part of the New York area chess scene in the 1970s. Among Jon’s activities in the past five years have been directing IBM’s research center in Nairobi, Kenya, and helping the Toronto Raptors assemble a championship basketball team via player analytics. The latter is not technically related to my chess analytics, but we have greater shared interests in ideas for lower bounds on uniform complexity classes.</p>
<p>
Instead of physical lunch, the lunch breaks are moderated panel discussions. So you can bring your own lunch while watching and listening via IBM’s WebEx or other portal. Maybe there will be time for remote attendees to ask questions—though not with your mouth full, as our mothers would say. A few years ago, my department began running catered Friday lunch forums under the name “UpBeat,” but those too are now remote and B.Y.O.L.  As for the other thing the “L.” can stand for besides “lunch,” we can mention that the pandemic has rendered onsite restrictions moot.</p>
<p>
There will also be Q &amp; A and panel discussion sessions for 45 minutes after each day’s last talk. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Other Talks </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We wish we could attend all the talks. We imagine they will be available afterward as recordings, but especially when there is live Q &amp; A it is nice to experience them in the moment as at a physically intimate workshop. Rather than list all the speakers and titles here—you can find them on the abstracts <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/informational-lens-workshop-1/talk-abstracts">page</a>, after all—we will just highlight a few that catch our eye:</p>

<font color="red">Fun facts about polynomials, and applications to coding theory: Mary Wootters. </font><br/>
<i>Here are some (fun?) facts about polynomials you probably already know. First, given any three points, you can find a parabola through them. Second, if you look at any vertical “slice” of a paraboloid, you get a parabola. These facts, while simple, turn out to be extremely useful in applications! For example, these facts are behind the efficacy of classical Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes, fundamental tools for communication and storage. But this talk is not about those facts — it’s about a few related facts that you might not know. Given less than three points’ worth of information, what can you learn about a parabola going through those points? Are there things other than paraboloids that you can “slice” and always get parabolas? In this talk, I will tell you some (fun!) facts that answer these questions, and discuss applications to error correcting codes.</i></p>

<font color="blue">Punch Cards and the Difference Engine: William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. </font><br/>
<i>We discuss the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Difference_Engine">power</a> of the card concept. By storing a finite amount of data on a “punch card” we can structure data handling to be straightforward and safe. The machine we plan will be thousands of times slower than even the first vacuum-tube computers were. But our novel use of steam and punch cards does have merits: cards are physical and help solve security and also privacy issues.</i></p>

<font color="red">Reasoning about Generalization via Conditional Mutual Information: Lydia Zakynthinou. </font><br/>
<i>We provide a framework for studying the generalization properties of machine learning algorithms, which ties together existing approaches, using the unifying language of information theory. We introduce a new notion based on Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) which quantifies how well the input (i.e., the training data) can be recognized given the output (i.e., the trained model) of the learning algorithm. Bounds on CMI can be obtained from several methods, including VC dimension, compression schemes, and differential privacy, and bounded CMI implies various forms of generalization guarantees. In this talk, I will introduce CMI, show how to obtain bounds on CMI from existing methods and generalization bounds from CMI, and discuss the capabilities of our framework. Joint work with Thomas Steinke.</i></p>

<font color="blue">Rebooting Mathematics: Doron Zeilberger. </font><br/>
<i>Mathematics is what it is today due to the accidental fact that it was developed before the invention of the computer, and, with a few exceptions, continues in the same vein, by inertia. It is time to start all over, remembering that math, is, or at least should be, the math that can be handled by computers, keeping in mind that they are both discrete and finite.</i></p>
<p>
Oh wait, one of these talks is both less novel and more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Difference-Engine-Novel-William-Gibson/dp/0440423627">novel</a> than the others.  Can a virtual workshop have a virtual virtual talk?  The cards were arguably “the” informational lens for almost 100 years.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Edit distance is a classic measure of similarity between strings, with applications ranging from computational biology to coding. Computing edit distance is also a classic dynamic programming problem, with a quadratic run-time solution, often taught in the “Intro to Algorithms” classes. Improving this runtime has been a decades-old challenge, now ruled likely-impossible using tools from the modern area of fine-grained complexity. We show how to approximate the edit distance between two strings in near-linear time, up to a constant factor. Our result completes a research direction set forth in the breakthrough paper of [Chakraborty, Das, Goldenberg, Koucky, Saks; FOCS’18], which showed the first constant-factor approximation algorithm with a (strongly) sub-quadratic running time.</p>

    <summary>A statistical zero-knowledge proof (SZK) for a problem $\Pi$ enables a computationally unbounded prover to convince a polynomial-time verifier that $x \in \Pi$ without revealing any additional information about $x$ to the verifier, in a strong information-theoretic sense.

Suppose, however, that the prover wishes to convince the verifier that $k$ separate inputs $x_1,\dots,x_k$ all belong to $\Pi$ (without revealing anything else). A naive way of doing so is to simply run the SZK protocol separately for each input. In this work we ask whether one can do better -- that is, is efficient batch verification possible for SZK?

We give a partial positive answer to this question by constructing a batch verification protocol for a natural and important subclass of SZK -- all problems $\Pi$ that have a non-interactive SZK protocol (in the common random string model). More specifically, we show that, for every such problem $\Pi$, there exists an honest-verifier SZK protocol for batch verification of $k$ instances, with communication complexity $poly(n) + k \cdot poly(\log{n},\log{k})$, where $poly$ refers to a fixed polynomial that depends only on $\Pi$ (and not on $k$). This result should be contrasted with the naive solution, which has communication complexity $k \cdot poly(n)$.

Our proof leverages a new NISZK-complete problem, called Approximate Injectivity, that we find to be of independent interest. The goal in this problem is to distinguish circuits that are nearly injective, from those that are non-injective on almost all inputs.</summary>
