    <title>TR19-167 |  UTIME Easy-witness Lemma &amp;amp; Some Consequences | 

	Anant Dhayal, 

	Russell Impagliazzo</title>
    <summary>We prove an easy-witness lemma ($\ewl$) for unambiguous non-deterministic verfiers. We show that if $\utime(t)\subset\mathcal{C}$, then for every $L\in\utime(t)$, for every $\utime(t)$ verifier $V$ for $L$, and for every $x\in L$, there is a certificate $y$ satisfing $V(x,y)=1$, that can be encoded as a truth-table of a $\mathcal{C}$ circuit. Our technique is simple compared to the $\ntime$ $\ewl$s \cite{IKW02,Wil-ES13,MW18}, and yields fine-grained results in terms of the time and size parameters. It also works for all {\it typical} non-uniform circuit classes without any additional machinery. Using this $\ewl$ we prove a Karp-Lipton \cite{KL80} style theorem ($\klt$) for $\uexp$. We show that $\uexp\subset\size(poly)\implies\uexp=\ma$. We also prove similar $\ewl$ and $\klt$ for $\uexp\cap\couexp$ and $\fewexp$.

Circuit lower bound techniques that entail natural properties of Razborov and Rudich \cite{RR97} are called natural, and are known to contradict widely believed cryptographic assumptions in the course of proving strong lower bounds. Thus attempts have been made to understand un-natural techniques. Natural properties satisfy three conditions: usefulness, constructiveness, and largeness. Usefulness is unavoidable in any lower-bound technique. In \cite{Wil-NP16,Ig13} it was shown that obtaining $\nexp$ lower bounds is equivalent to obtaining $\pt$-constructive (with $\log n$ advice) properties.

In this paper we consider properties that avoid largeness. We introduce a new notion called unique properties, which is opposite to natural properties in the sense of largeness. A unique property contains exactly one element of each input length (that is a power of 2). We show that $\pt$-constructivity and uniqueness (opposite of largeness) both are unavoidable for certain lower bounds. We prove, $\uexp\cap\couexp\not\subset\mathcal{C}$ if and only if there is a $\pt$-constructive unique property against $\mathcal{C}$. We also establish equivalences between lower bounds against $\uexp$ (with and without advice), and the existence of different restrictions of $\pt$-constructive unique properties that use advice. 

The ``derandomization (of $\bpp$) from uniform/non-uniform lower bounds for $\Gamma$'' type of results are known for $\Gamma=\expo,\nexp,\nexp\cap\conexp,\rexp$ \cite{NW94,BFNW93,IW01,IKW02,Wil-NP16}. Using the above equivalences we obtain a super-set of these results that also includes the classes $\uexp,\uexp\cap\couexp,\zpexp$.  

One important application of the $\nexp$ $\ewl$ and $\klt$ is the connection between fast ($\sat$ and learning) algorithms and $\nexp$ lower bounds \cite{Wil-ES13,FK09,Ig13}. Using our $\utime$ $\ewl$ and $\klt$ we derive connections between fast unambiguous algorithms and $\utime$ lower bounds. Finally we show results that generalize the lower bound frameworks -- that work only for unrestricted Boolean circuits -- such that they work for any restricted typical circuit class. This will help us to get lower bounds against any typical circuit class from fast algorithms that work for that particular class (and not for the super-class of unrestricted Boolean circuits).</summary>

but also rank/select operations, are a fundamental building block in many
compressed data structures. Several recent applications need to represent
highly repetitive sequences, and classical statistical compression proves
ineffective. We introduce, instead, grammar-based representations for
repetitive sequences, which use up to 6% of the space needed by statistically
compressed representations, and support direct access and rank/select
operations within tens of microseconds. We demonstrate the impact of our
structures in text indexing applications.

Austrin,
Guruswami, and H\r{a}stad established, in precise terms, that the transition
from tractability to hardness occurs just after 2 [FOCS'14/SICOMP'17]. They
showed that the problem of distinguishing k-CNF formulas that are g-satisfiable
(i.e. some assignment satisfies at least g literals in every clause) from those
that are not even 1-satisfiable is NP-hard if $\frac{g}{k} &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ and
is in P otherwise. We study a generalisation of SAT on arbitrary finite
domains, with clauses that are disjunctions of unary constraints, and establish
analogous behaviour. Thus we give a dichotomy for a natural fragment of promise
constraint satisfaction problems (PCSPs) on arbitrary finite domains.

Andrea Rodríguez</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09044">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Representing the trajectories of mobile objects is a hot topic from the
widespread use of smartphones and other GPS devices. However, few works have
focused on representing trips over public transportation networks (buses,
subway, and trains) where a user's trips can be seen as a sequence of stages
performed within a vehicle shared with many other users. In this context,
representing vehicle journeys reduces the redundancy because all the passengers
inside a vehicle share the same arrival time for each stop. In addition, each
vehicle journey follows exactly the sequence of stops corresponding to its
line, which makes it unnecessary to represent that sequence for each journey.
</p>
<p>To solve data management for transportation systems, we designed a conceptual
model that gave us a better insight into this data domain and allowed us the
definition of relevant terms and the detection of redundancy sources among
those data. Then, we designed two compact representations focused on users'
trips (TTCTR) and on vehicle trips (AcumM), respectively. Each approach owns
some strengths and is able to answer some queries efficiently.
</p>
<p>We include experimental results over synthetic trips generated from accurate
schedules obtained from a real network description (from the bus transportation
system of Madrid) to show the space/time trade-off of both approaches. We
considered a wide range of different queries about the use of the
transportation network such as counting-based or aggregate queries regarding
the load of any line of the network at different times.

lower bound of dynamic bitvectors and offers improved time performance in
practice.

all vertices and edges of a graph.We study the complexity of exact and
parameterized algorithms for MDS, resolving some open questions. In particular,
we settle the problem's complexity parameterized by treewidth and pathwidth by
giving an algorithm running in time $O^*(5^{tw})$ (improving the current best
$O^*(6^{tw})$), as well as a lower bound showing that our algorithm cannot be
improved under the SETH, even if parameterized by pathwidth (improving a lower
bound of $O^*((2 - \varepsilon)^{pw})$).
</p>
<p>Furthermore, by using a simple but so far overlooked observation on the
structure of minimal solutions, we obtain branching algorithms which improve
both the best known FPT algorithm for this problem, from $O^*(4.172^k)$ to
$O^*(3.510^k)$, and the best known exponential-time exact algorithm, from
$O^*(2^n)$ and exponential space, to $O^*(1.912^n)$ and polynomial space.

according to a known probability distribution. The expanding search problem
asks for a search sequence of the vertices so as to minimize the expected time
for finding the target, where the time for reaching the next vertex is
determined by its distance to the region that was already searched. This
problem has numerous applications, such as searching for hidden explosives,
mining coal, and disaster relief. In this paper, we develop exact algorithms
and heuristics, including a branch-and-cut procedure, a greedy algorithm with a
constant-factor approximation guarantee, and a novel local search procedure
based on a spanning tree neighborhood. Computational experiments show that our
branch-and-cut procedure outperforms all existing methods for general instances
and both heuristics compute near-optimal solutions with little computational
effort.

nondominated extreme points in the outcome set of multi-objective mixed integer
linear programmes in any dimension. The method generalizes the well-known
dichotomic scheme to compute the set of nondominated extreme points in the
outcome set of a bi-objective programme based on the iterative solution of
weighted sum scalarizations. It uses as a main routine a convex hull algorithm.
The algorithm is illustrated with, and numerically tested on, instances of
multi-objective assignment and knapsack problems. Experimental results confirm
the computational efficiency of the approach. Finally, an implementation in
incremental polynomial time with respect to the number of computed nondominated
extreme points is possible, under the assumption that the lexicographic version
of the problem can be solved in polynomial time.

graphs induced by bichromatic (red and blue) points. These problems have been
widely studied for points in the Euclidean plane, and many of them are NP-hard.

collinear points and (ii) equidistant points on a circle. We show that almost
all of these problems can be solved in linear time in these constrained, yet

    <title>Streaming Frequent Items with Timestamps and Detecting Large Neighborhoods in Graph Streams</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1574294400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Konrad:Christian.html">Christian Konrad</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08832">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Detecting frequent items is a fundamental problem in data streaming research.
However, in many applications, besides the frequent items themselves, meta data
such as the timestamps of when the frequent items appeared or other
application-specific data that "arrives" with the frequent items needs to be
reported too.
</p>
<p>To this end, we introduce the Neighborhood Detection problem in graph
streams, which both accurately models situations such as those stated above,
and addresses the fundamental problem of detecting large neighborhoods or stars
in graph streams. In Neighborhood Detection, an algorithm receives the edges of
a bipartite graph $G=(A, B, E)$ with $|A| = n$ and $|B| = \text{poly}~n$ in
arbitrary order and is given a threshold parameter $d$. Provided that there is
at least one $A$-node of degree at least $d$, the objective is to output a node
$a \in A$ together with at least $\frac{d}{c}$ of its neighbors, where $c$ is
the approximation factor.
</p>
<p>We show that in insertion-only streams, there is a one-pass $\tilde{O}(n +
n^{\frac{1}{c}}d)$ space $c$-approximation streaming algorithm, for integral
values of $c \ge 2$. We complement this result with a lower bound, showing that
computing a $(c/1.01)$-approximation requires space $\Omega(n / c^2 +
n^{\frac{1}{c-1}}d / c^2)$, for any integral $c \ge 2$, which renders our
algorithm optimal for a large range of settings (up to logarithmic factors). In
insertion-deletion (turnstile) streams, we give a one-pass $c$-approximation
algorithm with space $\tilde{O}(\frac{dn}{c^2})$ (if $c \le \sqrt{n}$). We also
prove that this is best possible up to logarithmic factors.
</p>
<p>Our lower bounds are obtained by defining new multi-party and two-party
communication problems, respectively, and proving lower bounds on their
communication complexities using information theoretic arguments.

    <title>Online Spectral Approximation in Random Order Streams</title>

in the online setting. It is known in [Cohen et al. APPROX 2016] that we can
construct a spectral approximation of a given $n \times d$ matrix in the online
setting if an additive error is allowed. In this paper, we propose an online
algorithm that avoids an additive error with the same time and space
complexities as the algorithm of Cohen et al., and provides a better upper
bound on the approximation size when a given matrix has small rank. In
addition, we consider the online random order setting where a row of a given
matrix arrives uniformly at random. In this setting, we propose time and space
efficient algorithms to find a spectral approximation. Moreover, we reveal that
a lower bound on the approximation size in the online random order setting is
$\Omega (d \epsilon^{-2} \log n)$, which is larger than the one in the offline
setting by an $\mathrm{O}\left( \log n \right)$ factor.

Theory. We study the complexity of computing a PNE in Weighted Congestion Games
with affine and linear delays, where O(1)-approximate Nash equilibria can be
computed in polynomial time and the only known PLS-hardness results follow from
those for unweighted Congestion Games.
</p>
<p>We first show that it is PLS-complete to compute a PNE even in
single-commodity Weighted Network Congestion Games on series-parallel networks
with linear latencies, a result indicating that equilibrium computation for
Weighted Congestion Games can be significantly more difficult than their
unweighted counterparts. Note that for unweighted Congestion Games on
single-commodity series parallel networks with general latency functions, a PNE
can be computed by a simple greedy algorithm. For that reduction, we use
exponential coefficients on the linear latency functions. To investigate the
impact of weighted players only, we restrict the game so that the linear
latencies can only have polynomial coefficients. We show that it is
PLS-complete to compute a PNE in Weighted Network Congestion Games with all
edges having the identity function. For the latter, none of the known
PLS-complete problems seems as a natural initial problem for the reduction.
Hence, we consider the problem of finding a maximal cut in NodeMaxCut, a
natural special case of MaxCut where the weights of the edges are the product
of the weights of their endpoints. Via an involved reduction, we show that
NodeMaxCut is PLS-complete, so that we can use it as our initial problem. The
result and the reduction themselves are of independent interest and they may
have more implications in proving other complexity results related to PLS.

adversarial manipulations in both the rewards and the transition probabilities
of the underlying system. Existing efficient algorithms heavily rely on the
"optimism under uncertainty" principle which dictates their behavior and does
not allow flexibility to perform corruption-robust exploration. We address this
by (i) departing from the optimistic behavior, and (ii) creating a general
framework that incorporates the principle of action-elimination. (This
principle has been essential for corruption-robust exploration in multi-armed
bandits, a degenerate special case of episodic reinforcement learning.) Despite
constructing a lower bound for a straightforward implementation of
action-elimination, we provide a clean and modular way to transfer it to
episodic reinforcement learning. Our algorithm enjoys near-optimal guarantees
in the absence of adversarial manipulations, has performance that degrades
gracefully as the amount of corruption increases, and does not need to know
this amount. Our results shed new light on the broader question of robust
exploration, and suggest a way to address a rather daunting mismatch between
optimistic algorithms and algorithms with higher flexibility. To demonstrate
the applicability of our framework, we provide a second instantiation thereof,
showing how it can provide efficient guarantees for the stochastic setting,
despite doing almost uniform exploration across plausibly optimal actions.

Hamiltonian path between any two given vertices $s$ and $t$ in the graph, and
the longest $(s, t)$-path is a simple path with the maximum number of vertices
from $s$ to $t$ in the graph. A graph holds Hamiltonian connected property if
it contains a Hamiltonian $(s, t)$-path. These two problems are well-known
NP-complete for general supergrid graphs. An $O$-shaped supergrid graph is a
special kind of a rectangular grid graph with a rectangular hole. In this
paper, we first prove the Hamiltonian connectivity of $O$-shaped supergrid
graphs except few conditions. We then show that the longest $(s, t)$-path of an
$O$-shaped supergrid graph can be computed in linear time. The Hamiltonian and

(STOC 1994) and Chan (SoCG
2003) we study the bottleneck version of the Euclidean bounded-degree spanning
tree problem. A bottleneck spanning tree is a spanning tree whose largest
edge-length is minimum, and a bottleneck degree-$K$ spanning tree is a
degree-$K$ spanning tree whose largest edge-length is minimum. Let $\beta_K$ be
the supremum ratio of the largest edge-length of the bottleneck degree-$K$
spanning tree to the largest edge-length of the bottleneck spanning tree, over
all finite point sets in the Euclidean plane. It is known that $\beta_5=1$, and
it is easy to verify that $\beta_2\ge 2$, $\beta_3\ge \sqrt{2}$, and
$\beta_4&gt;1.175$.
</p>
<p>It is implied by the Hamiltonicity of the cube of the bottleneck spanning
tree that $\beta_2\le 3$. The degree-3 spanning tree algorithm of Ravi et al.
(STOC 1993) implies that $\beta_3\le 2$. Andersen and Ras (Networks,
68(4):302-314, 2016) showed that $\beta_4\le \sqrt{3}$. We present the
following improved bounds: $\beta_2\ge\sqrt{7}$, $\beta_3\le \sqrt{3}$, and
$\beta_4\le \sqrt{2}$. As a result, we obtain better approximation algorithms
for Euclidean bottleneck degree-3 and degree-4 spanning trees. As parts of our
proofs of these bounds we present some structural properties of the Euclidean
minimum spanning tree which are of independent interest.

    <title>TR19-166 |  Top-down induction of decision trees: rigorous guarantees and inherent limitations | 

	Guy Blanc, 

	Jane Lange, 

	Li-Yang Tan</title>
    <summary>Consider the following heuristic for building a decision tree for a function $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \{\pm 1\}$.  Place the most influential variable $x_i$ of $f$ at the root, and recurse on the subfunctions $f_{x_i=0}$ and $f_{x_i=1}$ on the left and right subtrees respectively; terminate once the tree is an $\varepsilon$-approximation of $f$.   We analyze the quality of this heuristic, obtaining near-matching upper and lower bounds:  

$\circ$ Upper bound: For every $f$ with decision tree size $s$ and every $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac1{2})$, this heuristic builds a decision tree of size at most $s^{O(\log(s/\varepsilon)\log(1/\varepsilon))}$. 

$\circ$ Lower bound: For every $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac1{2})$ and $s \le 2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}$, there is an $f$ with decision tree size $s$ such that this heuristic builds a decision tree of size $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log s)}$. 

We also obtain upper and lower bounds for monotone functions: $s^{O(\sqrt{\log s}/\varepsilon)}$ and $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt[4]{\log s }
)}$ respectively.  The lower bound disproves conjectures of Fiat and Pechyony (2004) and Lee (2009).

Our upper bounds yield new algorithms for properly learning decision trees under the uniform distribution.  We show that these algorithms---which are motivated by widely employed and empirically successful top-down decision tree learning heuristics such as ID3, C4.5, and CART---achieve provable guarantees that compare favorably with those of the current fastest algorithm (Ehrenfeucht and Haussler, 1989), and even have certain qualitative advantages. Our lower bounds shed new light on the limitations of these heuristics. 

Finally, we revisit the classic work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler.  We extend it to give the first uniform-distribution proper learning algorithm that achieves polynomial sample and memory complexity, while matching its state-of-the-art quasipolynomial runtime.</summary>

Xuejun Yang is a Senior Staff Engineer at FutureWei Technologies. He is the DFA on the 2011 <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi11-preprint.pdf">paper</a>, “Finding and Understanding Bugs in C Compilers.”</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss a clever idea from that paper.</p>
<p>
The paper was brought to our attention just now in a meaty <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/21/a-polemical-overreach/#comment-106276">comment</a> by Paul D. We thank him for it—the topic interests both of us. We don’t think Paul D. means to be anonymous, but in keeping with that we’ll give just a cryptic hint to his identity: The saying “a man on the make” is widely known, but for more than the millennium he has been the unique person in the world to whom it applies literally.  <b>Update 11/20</b>: Turns out we (I, Ken) were wrong about the identity, see <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/19/a-clever-way-to-find-compiler-bugs/#comment-106348">this</a>.</p>
<p>
Yang was made unique by being listed out of alphabetical order on the paper. This is notable because the most common practice in our field is to list alphabetically irrespective of prominence. Hence we’ve invented the term ‘DFA’ for “Designated” or “Distinguished” First Author. The other authors are Yang Chen, Eric Eide, and John Regehr, all from the University of Utah. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Topic </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Paul D.’s comment notes that there was evidence that verification methods could improve compiler correctness. By <i>compiler</i> we mean the program that transforms high level code into machine code. These programs are used countless times every day and their correctness is clearly very important. </p>
<p>
Their correctness is tricky for several reasons. The main one is that almost all compilers try to optimize code. That is when they transform code into instructions they try to rewrite or rearrange the instructions to yield better performance. Compilers have been doing this forever. The trouble is that changing instructions to increase performance is dangerous. The changes must not affect the values that are computed. If they are not done carefully they can actually make the answers faster, but incorrect. This is the reason correctness is tricky.</p>
<p>
Formal verification requires a lot of effort. The highest effort should go into mission-critical software. But compilers are mission-critical <em>already</em>, unless we know mission-critical software won’t be compiled on a particular one. Hence it is notable when formal verification makes a compiler more reliable. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Paper </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The idea in the paper Paul referenced is quite elegant. They built a program called Csmith. It operates as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Suppose that <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> is a compiler they wish to test. Then generate various legal C programs <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/>. For each of these let <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> be the answer that <img alt="{X(P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X(P)}"/> yields. Here <img alt="{X(P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X(P)}"/> is the compiled program. Then check whether <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> is correct. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
For example:  </p>
<pre>int foo (void) { 
    signed char x = 1; 
    unsigned char y = 255; 
    return x &gt; y; 
} 
</pre>
<p>
Some compilers returned <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, but the correct answer is <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>. There are further examples in a 2012 companion <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi12-preprint.pdf">paper</a> and these <a href="https://www.flux.utah.edu/download?uid=115&amp;slides=1&amp;type=pptx">slides</a> from an earlier version. The Csmith <a href="https://embed.cs.utah.edu/csmith/">homepage</a> has long lists of compiler bugs they found. </p>
<p>
Of course if <img alt="{X(P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X(P)}"/> crashes or refuse to compile <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> then the compiler is wrong. But what happens if <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> is computed. How does Csmith know if the answer is correct? This seems to be really hard. This correctness testing must be automated: the whole approach is based on allowing tons of random programs to be tested. They cannot assume that humans will be used to check the outputs.</p>
<p>
This is the clever idea of this paper. They assume that there are at least two compilers say <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/>. Then let <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> be the output of <img alt="{X(P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X(P)}"/> and let <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> be the output of <img alt="{Y(P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y(P)}"/>. The key insight is: </p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>If <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> is not equal to <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>, then one of the compilers is wrong</b>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A very neat and elegant idea. For software in general it is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_testing">differential</a> <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.83.445">testing</a>. </p>
<p>
This at least alerts when there are problems with some compilers and some programs. One can use this trick to discover programs that cause at least some compilers to have problems. This is extremely valuable. It allowed Csmith to discover hundreds of errors in production compilers—errors that previously were missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Smart Fuzzing </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzzing</a> is defined by Wikipedia as testing by “providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program.” An early historical example, Apple’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_testing">Monkey</a>” program, worked completely randomly. To ensure that the found bugs are <em>meaningful</em> and <em>analyzable</em>, Csmith needed a deeper, structured, “intelligent” design, not just the generation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayhem_(advertising_character)">Mayhem</a>.</p>
<p>
For one, Csmith needed to avoid programs <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> than do not have deterministic behavior. The formal C standards itemize cases in which compilers are allowed to have arbitrary, even self-inconsistent, behavior. There are lots of them in C. A bug with dubious code could be dismissed out of hand.</p>
<p>
For another, the probability that a program <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> built haphazardly by the original Csmith version would reveal bugs was observed to peak at about 80KB source-code size, about 1,000 lines across multiple pages. Those don’t make great examples. So Csmith has its own routines to compress bug instances it has found. Simple tricks are shortening numerical expressions to use only the bug-sensitive parts. Others are lifting local variables out of blocks and bypassing pointer jumps.</p>
<p>
A third goal is that the generator should branch out to all aspects of the language—in this case, C—not just the “grungy” parts that are ripe for finding compiler bugs. The paper talks about this at length. Regehr, who was Yang’s advisor, is also a blogger. His current <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1700">post</a>, dated November 4, is titled, “Helping Generative Fuzzers Avoid Looking Only Where the Light is Good, Part 1.” We guess that “Part 2” will go even more into details.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Formal Methods as Bugscreen </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Regarding the formally-verified CompCert compiler, Paul D. quoted from the <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi11-preprint.pdf">paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The striking thing about our CompCert results is that the middle-end bugs we found in all other compilers are absent. As of early 2011, the under-development version of CompCert is the only compiler we have tested for which Csmith cannot find wrong-code errors. This is not for lack of trying: we have devoted about six CPU-years to the task. The apparent unbreakability of CompCert supports a strong argument that developing compiler optimizations within a proof framework, where safety checks are explicit and machine-checked, has tangible benefits for compiler users. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This August 2019 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09334.pdf">paper</a> by Michaël Marcozzi, Qiyi Tang, Alastair Donaldson, and Cristian Cadar gives recent results involving Csmith and other tools. They have an interesting discussion on page 2, from which we excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In our experience working in the area […], we have found compiler fuzzing to be a contentious topic. Research talks on compiler fuzzing are often followed by questions about the importance of the discovered bugs, and whether compiler fuzzers might be improved by taking inspiration from bugs encountered by users of compilers “in the wild.” Some … argue that any miscompilation bug, whether fuzzer-found or not, is a ticking bomb that should be regarded as severe, or avoided completely via formal verification (in the spirit of CompCert). </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
They go on to say, however, that when a fully-developed compiler is used for non-critical software, the kinds of bugs typically found by fuzzing tend to have questionable importance. Their paper is titled, “A Systematic Impact Study for Fuzzer-Found Compiler Bugs.” </p>
<p>
So far they have found definite results that seem to have mixed implications. In their future-work section they note that they have evaluated the impact of bugs in compilers on the intended function of programs they compile, but not on possible security holes—which as we noted in our Cloudflare <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/03/08/is-computer-security-possible/">post</a> can come from (misuse of) simple code that is completely correct. This leads us further to wonder, coming full-circle, whether formal methods might help quantify the relative importance of aspects of a language and areas of a compiler to guide more-intelligent generation of test cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
The above comment is interesting, but perhaps finding obscure bugs is important. Perhaps such bugs could be used to attack systems. That is perhaps some one could use them to break into a system. Security may be compromised by any error, even an unlikely one to occur in the wild. </p>
<p>
What do you think?</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>By David Eppstein &amp; Vijay Vazirani</em></p>
<p>No, not to make theoreticians rich! Besides, who will buy your papers anyway? (Quite the opposite, you will be lucky if you can convince someone to take them for free, just for sake of publicity!) What we are proposing is a market in which no money changes hands – a matching market – for matching papers to conferences.</p>
<p>First, a short preamble on how the idea emerged.</p>
<p><strong>Preamble</strong> (by Vijay):  Soon after my recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLr6Ud5qmt4&amp;t=74s"><u>Simons talk</u></a> on Matching Markets, I sent its url to Al Roth. Obviously, I wasn’t expecting a return email. However, the perfect gentleman and ultimate scholar that Al is, he did reply, and mentioned that he did not like my “definition” of matching markets and said, “I guess I would say matching markets are markets because they aggregate information that is held by the participants, which is what markets do (even if they don’t use prices to do it..).” This hit me like lightening from the sky – suddenly it crystallized the innate intuition about markets which I had formed through work on algorithmic aspects of markets! I thanked Al profusely and added, “This definitely helps in me get the right perspective on the notion!”</p>
<p>About a week ago, while updating my talk for a seminar at Columbia University, I included this beautiful insight in it and then a thought occurred: Each PC meeting involves aggregation of information from a large number of agents: PC members as well as external experts. Hence, isn’t a conference a matching market? Excitedly, I sent this question to Al. He replied, “… the conference process, matching papers to conferences, is a market and a particular conference might be a marketplace … ”</p>
<p>When I returned home, my esteemed colleague, David Eppstein, stunned me by declaring that he had thought of a market relevant to our field in which no money changes hands. I immediately knew he was thinking of the conference process. But he got to it out of the blue … and not the long process it took me!</p>
<p><strong>Back to the idea:  </strong>In the past, matching markets have brought immense efficiency and order in allocation problems in which use of money is considered repugnant, the prime examples being matching medical residents to hospitals, kidney exchange, and assignment of students of a large city to its schools.</p>
<p>At present we are faced with massive inefficiencies in the conference process – numerous researchers are trapped in unending cycles of submit … get reject … incorporate comments … resubmit — often to the next deadline which has been conveniently arranged a couple of days down the road so the unwitting participants are conditioned into mindlessly keep coming back for more, much like Pavlov’s dog.</p>
<p>We are proposing a matching market approach to finally obliterate this madness. We believe such a market is feasible using the following ideas. No doubt our scheme will have some drawbacks; however, as should be obvious, the advantages far outweigh them.</p>
<p>First, for co-located symposia within a larger umbrella conference, such as the<br/>
conferences within ALGO or FCRC, the following process should be a no-brainer:</p>
<p>1). Ensure a common deadline for all symposia; denote the latter by <em>S.</em></p>
<p>2). Let <em>R</em> denote the set of researchers who wish to submit one paper to a symposium in this umbrella conference – assume that researchers submitting more than one paper will have multiple names, one for each submission. Each researcher will provide a strict preference order over the subset of symposia to which they wish to submit their paper. Let <em>G</em> denote the bipartite graph with vertex sets (<em>R, S</em>) and an edge (<em>r, s</em>) only if researcher <em>r</em> chose symposium <em>s.</em></p>
<p>3). The umbrella conference will have a large common PC with experts representing all of its symposia. The process of assigning papers to PC members will of course use <em>G</em> in a critical way.</p>
<p>Once papers are reviewed by PC members and external reviewers, each symposium will rank its submissions using its own criteria of acceptance. We believe the overhead of ranking each paper multiple times is minimal since that is just an issue of deciding how “on-topic” a paper is – an easy task once the reviews of the paper are available.</p>
<p>4). Finally, using all these preference lists, a researcher-proposing stable matching is computed using the Gale-Shapley algorithm. As is well-known, this mechanism will be dominant strategy incentive compatible for researchers.</p>
<p>With a little extra effort, a similar scheme can also be used for a group of conferences at diverse locations but similar times, such as some of the annual summer theory conferences, STOC, ICALP, ESA, STAC, WADS/SWAT, etc.</p>
<p> </p>

    <title>Fields used to be closer together than they are now. Good? Bad?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was a retired software Eng professor that I had heard two very non-controversial rumors about:<br/>
<br/>
1) He got his PhD in Numerical Analysis<br/>
<br/>
2) He got his PhD in Compiler Optimization.<br/>
<br/>
So I asked him which was true.<br/>
<br/>
The answer: Both! In those days you had to optimize your code to get your NA code to run fast enough.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot imagine that anymore. Or at least I cannot.<br/>
<br/>
Over time the fields of computer science advance more so its hard to be  master of more than one field.  But its not that simple: there has been work recently applying Machine Learning to... well<br/>
everything really. Even so, I think the trend is more towards separation. Or perhaps it oscillates.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT going to be the grumpy old man (Google once thought I was 70, see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/10/google-added-years-to-my-life.html">here</a>) who says things were better in my day when the fields were closer together. But I will ask the question:<br/>
<br/>
1) Are people more specialized new? While I think yes since each field has gotten more complicated and harder to master. There are exceptions: Complexity theory uses much more sophisticated mathematics then when I was a grad student (1980-1985), and of course Quantum Computing has lead to more comp sci majors knowing physics.<br/>
<br/>
2) Is it good for the field that people are specialized? I am supposed to say that it is terrible and that great advances are made when people are interdiscplinary. But there are many more small advances that are made by someone who has a mastery of one (or two) fields.<br/>
<br/>
3) The PhD Process and the Tenure Process encourage specialization. This I think IS bad since there are different modes of research that should all be respected.'<br/>

	Erik Waingarten</title>
    <summary>We give a nearly-optimal algorithm for testing uniformity of distributions supported on $\{-1,1\}^n$, which makes $\tilde O (\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2)$ queries to a subcube conditional sampling oracle (Bhattacharyya and Chakraborty (2018)). The key technical component is a natural notion of random restriction for distributions on $\{-1,1\}^n$, and a quantitative analysis of how such a restriction affects the mean vector of the distribution. Along the way, we consider the problem of mean testing with independent samples and provide a nearly-optimal algorithm.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>(see new update at end of post)</em></p>



<p>Around 1999, one of the first things I ever did in quantum computing theory was to work on a problem that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9811023">Fortnow and Rogers</a> suggested in a paper: is it possible to separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity)">P</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP">BQP</a> relative to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle">random oracle</a>?  (That is, without first needing to separate P from PSPACE or whatever in the real world?)  Or to the contrary: suppose that a quantum algorithm Q makes T queries to a Boolean input string X.  Is there then a classical simulation algorithm that makes poly(T) queries to X, and that approximates Q’s acceptance probability for <em>most</em> values of X?  Such a classical simulation, were it possible, would still be consistent with the existence of quantum algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%27s_problem">Simon’s</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s</a>, which are able to achieve exponential (and even greater) speedups in the black-box setting.  It would simply demonstrate the importance, for Simon’s and Shor’s algorithms, of global structure that makes the string X extremely <em>non</em>-random: for example, encoding a periodic function (in the case of Shor’s algorithm), or encoding a function that hides a secret string s (in the case of Simon’s).  It would underscore that superpolynomial quantum speedups depend on structure.</p>



<p>I never managed to solve this problem.  Around 2008, though, I noticed that a solution would follow from a perhaps-not-obviously-related conjecture, about <em>influences</em> in low-degree polynomials.  Namely, let p:R<sup>n</sup>→R be a degree-d real polynomial in n variables, and suppose p(x)∈[0,1] for all x∈{0,1}<sup>n</sup>.  Define the <i>variance</i> of p to be<br/>   Var(p):=E<sub>x,y</sub>[|p(x)-p(y)|],<br/>and define the <i>influence</i> of the i<sup>th</sup> variable to be<br/>   Inf<sub>i</sub>(p):=E<sub>x</sub>[|p(x)-p(x<sup>i</sup>)|].<br/>Here the expectations are over strings in {0,1}<sup>n</sup>, and x<sup>i</sup> means x with its i<sup>th</sup> bit flipped between 0 and 1.  Then the conjecture is this: there must be some variable i such that Inf<sub>i</sub>(p) ≥ poly(Var(p)/d) (in other words, that “explains” a non-negligible fraction of the variance of the entire polynomial).</p>



<p>Why would this conjecture imply the statement about quantum algorithms?  Basically, because of the seminal result of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9802049">Beals et al.</a> from 1998: that if a quantum algorithm makes T queries to a Boolean input X, then its acceptance probability can be written as a real polynomial over the bits of X, of degree at most 2T.  Given that result, if you wanted to classically simulate a quantum algorithm Q on most inputs—and if you only cared about query complexity, not computation time—you’d simply need to do the following:<br/>(1) Find the polynomial p that represents Q’s acceptance probability.<br/>(2) Find a variable i that explains at least a 1/poly(T) fraction of the total remaining variance in p, and query that i.<br/>(3) Keep repeating step (2), until p has been restricted to a polynomial with not much variance left—i.e., to nearly a constant function p(X)=c.  Whenever that happens, halt and output the constant c.<br/>The key is that by hypothesis, this algorithm will halt, with high probability over X, after only poly(T) steps.</p>



<p>Anyway, around the same time, Andris Ambainis had a major break on a different problem that I’d told him about: namely, whether randomized and quantum query complexities are polynomially related for all partial functions with permutation symmetry (like the collision and the element distinctness functions).  Andris and I decided to write up the two directions jointly.  The result was our 2011 paper entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0996">The Need for Structure in Quantum Speedups</a>.</p>



<p>Of the two contributions in the “Need for Structure” paper, the one about random oracles and influences in low-degree polynomials was clearly the weaker and less satisfying one.  As the reviewers pointed out, that part of the paper didn’t solve anything: it just reduced one unsolved problem to a new, slightly different problem that was <em>also</em> unsolved.  Nevertheless, that part of the paper acquired a life of its own over the ensuing decade, as the world’s experts in analysis of Boolean functions and polynomials began referring to the “Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture.”  Ryan O’Donnell, Guy Kindler, and many others had a stab.  I even got Terry Tao to spend an hour or two on the problem when I visited UCLA.</p>



<p>Now, at long last, Nathan Keller and Ohad Klein say they’ve proven the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture, in a preprint whose title is a riff on ours: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03748">“Quantum Speedups Need Structure.”</a></p>



<p>Their paper hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed, and I haven’t yet carefully studied it, but I <em>could</em> and <em>should</em>: at 19 pages, it looks very approachable and clear, if not as radically short as (say) <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229">Huang’s proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture</a>.  Keller and Klein’s argument subsumes all the earlier results that I knew would need to be subsumed, and involves all the concepts (like a real analogue of block sensitivity) that I knew would need to be involved somehow.</p>



<p>My plan had been as follows:<br/>(1) Read their paper in detail.  Understand every step of their proof.<br/>(2) Write a blog post that reflects my detailed understanding.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this plan did not sufficiently grapple with the fact that I now have two kids.  It got snagged for a week at step (1).  So I’m now executing an alternative plan, which is to jump immediately to the blog post.</p>



<p>Assuming Keller and Klein’s result holds up—as I expect it will—by combining it with the observations in my and Andris’s paper, one immediately gets an explanation for why no one has managed to separate P from BQP relative to a <em>random</em> oracle, but only relative to non-random oracles.  This complements the work of <a href="https://www.uncg.edu/mat/faculty/cdsmyth/thesis.pdf">Kahn, Saks, and Smyth</a>, who around 2000 gave a precisely analogous explanation for the difficulty of separating P from NP∩coNP relative to a random oracle.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the polynomial blowup is quite enormous: from a quantum algorithm making T queries, Keller and Klein apparently get a classical algorithm making O(T<sup>18</sup>) queries.  But such things can almost always be massively improved.</p>



<p>Feel free to use the comments to ask any questions about this result or its broader context.  I’ll either do my best to answer from the limited amount I know, or else I’ll pass the questions along to Nathan and Ohad themselves.  Maybe, at some point, I’ll even be forced to understand the new proof.</p>



<p>Congratulations to Nathan and Ohad!</p>



<p><strong><font color="red">Update (Nov. 20):</font></strong> Tonight I finally did what I should’ve done two weeks ago, and worked through the paper from start to finish.  Modulo some facts about noise operators, hypercontractivity, etc. that I took on faith, I now have a reasonable (albeit imperfect) understanding of the proof.  It’s great!</p>



<p>In case it’s helpful to anybody, here’s my one-paragraph summary of how it works.  First, you hit your bounded degree-d function f with a random restriction to attenuate its higher-degree Fourier coefficients (reminiscent of <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehudf/courses/anal09/LMN.pdf">Linial-Mansour-Nisan</a>).  Next, in that attenuated function, you find a small “coalition” of influential variables—by which we mean, a set of variables for which there’s <em>some</em> assignment that substantially biases f.  You keep iterating—finding influential coalitions in subfunctions on n/4, n/8, etc. variables.  All the while, you keep track of <em>the norm of the vector of all the block-sensitivities of all the inputs</em> (the authors don’t clearly explain this in the intro, but they reveal it near the end).  Every time you find another influential coalition, that norm goes down by a little, but by approximation theory, it can only go down O(d<sup>2</sup>) times until it hits rock bottom and your function is nearly constant.  By the end, you’ll have approximated f itself by a decision tree of depth poly(d, 1/ε, log(n)).  Finally, you get rid of the log(n) term by using the fact that f essentially depended on at most exp(O(d)) variables anyway. </p>



<p>Anyway, I’m not sure how helpful it is to write more: the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03748.pdf">paper itself</a> is about 95% as clear as it could possibly be, and even where it isn’t, you’d probably need to read it first (and, uh, know something about influences, block sensitivity, random restrictions, etc.) before any further clarifying remarks would be of use.  But happy to discuss more in the comments, if anyone else is reading it.</p></div>

    <title>TR19-164 |  Improved bounds for perfect sampling of $k$-colorings in graphs | 

	Siddharth Bhandari, 

	Sayantan Chakraborty</title>
    <summary>We present a randomized algorithm that takes as input an undirected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ and an integer $k &gt; 3\Delta$, and returns a random proper $k$-coloring of $G$. The 
 distribution of the coloring is perfectly uniform over the set of all proper $k$-colorings; the expected running time of the algorithm is $\mathrm{poly}(k,n)=\widetilde{O}(n\Delta^2\cdot \log(k))$. 
 This improves upon a result of Huber~(STOC 1998) who obtained polynomial time perfect sampling algorithm for $k&gt;\Delta^2+2\Delta$.
 Prior to our work, no algorithm with expected running time $\mathrm{poly}(k,n)$ was known to guarantee perfectly sampling for $\Delta = \omega(1)$ and for any $k \leq \Delta^2+2\Delta$. 
 
 Our algorithm (like several other perfect sampling algorithms including Huber's) is based on  the Coupling from the Past method. Inspired by the bounding chain approach pioneered independently by H\"aggstr\"om \&amp; Nelander~(Scand.{} J.{} Statist., 1999) and Huber~(STOC 1998), our algorithm is based on a novel bounding chain for the coloring problem.</summary>

    <title>TR19-163 |  Approximating the Distance to Monotonicity of Boolean Functions | 

	Ramesh Krishnan S. Pallavoor, 

	Sofya Raskhodnikova, 

	Erik Waingarten</title>
    <summary>We design a nonadaptive algorithm that, given a Boolean function $f\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ which is $\alpha$-far from monotone, makes poly$(n, 1/\alpha)$ queries and returns an estimate that, with high probability, is an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$-approximation to the distance of $f$ to monotonicity. Furthermore, we show that for any constant $\kappa &gt; 0,$ approximating the distance to monotonicity up to $n^{1/2 - \kappa}$-factor requires $2^{n^\kappa}$ nonadaptive queries, thereby ruling out a poly$(n, 1/\alpha)$-query nonadaptive algorithm for such approximations. This answers a question of Seshadhri (Property Testing Review, 2014) for the case of nonadaptive algorithms. Approximating the distance to a property is closely related to tolerantly testing that property. Our lower bound stands in contrast to standard (non-tolerant) testing of monotonicity that can be done nonadaptively with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries.

We obtain our lower bound by proving an analogous bound for erasure-resilient testers. An $\alpha$-erasure-resilient tester for a desired property gets oracle access to a function that has at most an $\alpha$ fraction of values erased. The tester has to accept (with probability at least 2/3) if the erasures can be filled in to ensure that the resulting function has the property and to reject (with probability at least 2/3) if every completion of erasures results in a function that is $\varepsilon$-far from having the property. Our method yields the same lower bounds for unateness and being a $k$-junta. These lower bounds improve exponentially on the existing lower bounds for these properties.</summary>

    <title>TR19-162 |  The Random-Query Model and the Memory-Bounded Coupon Collector | 

	Ran Raz, 

	Wei Zhan</title>
    <summary>We study a new model of space-bounded computation, the {\it random-query} model. The model is based on a branching-program over input variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. In each time step, the branching program gets as an input a random index $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$, together with the input variable $x_i$ (rather than querying an input variable of its choice, as in the case of a standard (oblivious) branching program). We motivate the new model in various ways and study time-space tradeoff lower bounds in this model.

Our main technical result is a quadratic time-space lower bound for zero-error computations in the random-query model, for XOR, Majority and many other functions. More precisely, a zero-error computation is a computation that stops with high probability and such that conditioning on the event that the computation stopped, the output is correct with probability~1. We prove that for any Boolean function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, with sensitivity $k$, any zero-error computation with time $T$ and space $S$, satisfies 
$T\cdot (S+\log n) \geq \Omega(n \cdot k)$. We note that the best time-space lower bounds for standard oblivious branching programs are only slightly super linear and improving these bounds is an important long-standing open problem.

To prove our results, we study a memory-bounded variant of the coupon-collector problem that seems to us of independent interest and to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before. We consider a zero-error version of the coupon-collector problem. In this problem, the coupon-collector could explicitly choose to stop when he/she is sure with zero-error that
all coupons have already been collected. We prove that any zero-error coupon-collector that stops with high probability in time $T$, and uses space $S$, satisfies $T\cdot (S+\log n) \geq \Omega(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of different coupons.</summary>

    <title>Puzzles of modern machine learning</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>It is often said that "we don’t understand deep learning" but it is not as often clarified what is it exactly that we don’t understand. In this post I try to list some of the "puzzles" of modern machine learning, from a theoretical perspective. This list is neither comprehensive nor authoritative.  Indeed, I  only started looking at these issues last year, and am very much in the position of not yet fully understanding the questions, let alone potential answers.
On the other hand, at the rate ML research is going, a calendar year corresponds to about 10 "ML years"…</p>
<p>Machine learning  offers many opportunities for theorists; there are many more questions than answers, and it is clear that a better theoretical understanding of what makes certain training procedures work or fail is desperately needed. Moreover, recent advances in software frameworks made it much easier to test out intuitions and conjectures. While in the past running training procedures might have required a Ph.D in machine learning, recently the "barrier to entry" was reduced to first to undergraduates, then to high school students, and these days it’s so easy that even theoretical computer scientists can do it <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>
<p>To set the context for this discussion, I focus on the task of supervised learning. In this setting we are given a <em>training set</em> <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/> of <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> examples of the form <img alt="(x_i,y_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_i%2Cy_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(x_i,y_i)"/> where <img alt="x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d"/> is some vector (think of it as the pixels of an image) and <img alt="y_i \in { \pm 1 }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i+%5Cin+%7B+%5Cpm+1+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="y_i \in { \pm 1 }"/> is some label (think of <img alt="y_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="y_i"/> as equaling <img alt="+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="+1"/> if <img alt="x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_i"/> is the image of a dog and <img alt="-1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="-1"/> if <img alt="x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_i"/> is the image of a cat). The goal in supervised learning is to find a <em>classifier</em> <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f"/> such that <img alt="f(x)=y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3Dy&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f(x)=y"/> will hold for many future samples <img alt="(x,y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(x,y)"/>.</p>
<p>The standard approach is to consider some parameterized family of classifiers, where for every vector <img alt="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m"/>  of parameters, we associate a classifier <img alt="f_\theta :\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow { \pm 1 }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta+%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed+%5Crightarrow+%7B+%5Cpm+1+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_\theta :\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow { \pm 1 }"/>. For example, we can fix a certain neural network architecture (depth, connections, activation functions, etc.) and let <img alt="\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta"/>  be the vector of weights that characterizes every network in this architecture. People then run some optimizing algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent with the objective function set as finding the vector <img alt="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m"/> that minimizes a <em>loss function</em> <img alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="L_S(\theta)"/>. This loss function can be the fraction of labels that <img alt="f_\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_\theta"/> gets wrong on the set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/> or a more continuous loss that takes into account the confidence level or other parameters of <img alt="f_\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_\theta"/> as well. By now this general approach has been successfully applied to a many classification tasks, in many cases achieving near-human to super-human performance.  In the rest of this post I want to discuss some of the questions that arise when trying to obtain a theoretical understanding of both the powers and the limitations of the above approach. I focus on deep learning, though there are still some open questions even for over-parameterized linear regression.</p>
<h2>The generalization puzzle</h2>
<p>The approach outlined above has been well known and  analyzed for many decades in the statistical learning literature. There are many cases where we can <em>prove</em> that a classifier obtained in this case has a small <em>generalization gap</em>, in the sense that if the training set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/> was obtained by sampling <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> independent and identical samples from a distribution <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/>, then the performance of a classifier <img alt="f_\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_\theta"/> on new samples from <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/> will be close to its performance on the training set.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these results all boil down to the Chernoff bound. Think of the random variables <img alt="X_1,\ldots,X_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1%2C%5Cldots%2CX_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="X_1,\ldots,X_n"/> where <img alt="X_i=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="X_i=1"/> if the classifier makes an error on the <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i"/>-th training example. The Chernoff bound tells us that  probability that  that <img alt="\sum X_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum+X_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\sum X_i"/> deviates by more than <img alt="\epsilon n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\epsilon n"/> from its expectation is something like <img alt="\exp(-\epsilon^2 n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28-%5Cepsilon%5E2+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\exp(-\epsilon^2 n)"/> and so as long as the total number of classifiers is less than <img alt="2^k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^k"/> for <img alt="k &lt; \epsilon^2 n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3C+%5Cepsilon%5E2+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="k &lt; \epsilon^2 n"/>, we can use a union bound over all possible classifiers to argue that if we make a <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p"/> fraction of errors on the training set, the probability we make an error on a new example is at  most <img alt="p+\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2B%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p+\epsilon"/>. We can of course "bunch together" classifiers that behave similarly on our distribution, and so it is enough if there are at most <img alt="2^{\epsilon^2 n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%5Cepsilon%5E2+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^{\epsilon^2 n}"/> of these equivalence classes. Another approach is to add a "regularizing term" <img alt="R(\theta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="R(\theta)"/> to the objective function, which amounts to restricting attention to the set of all classifiers <img alt="f_\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_\theta"/> such that <img alt="R(\theta) \leq \mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28%5Ctheta%29+%5Cleq+%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="R(\theta) \leq \mu"/> for some parameter <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mu"/>. Again, as long as the number of equivalence classes in this set is less than <img alt="2^{\epsilon^2 n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%5Cepsilon%5E2+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^{\epsilon^2 n}"/>, we can use this bound.</p>
<p>To a first approximation, the number of classifiers (even after "bunching together") is roughly exponential in the number <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m"/> of parameters, and so these results tell us that as long as the number of <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m"/> of parameters is smaller than the number of examples, we can expect to have a small <em>generalization gap</em> and can infer future performance (known as "test performance") from the performance on the set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/> (known as "train performance").
Once the number of parameters <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m"/> becomes close to or even bigger than the number of samples <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/>, we are in danger of "overfitting" where we could have excellent train performance but terrible test performance. Thus according to the classical statistical learning theory, the ideal number of parameters would be some number between <img alt="0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="0"/> and the number of samples <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m"/>, with the precise value governed by the so called "bias variance tradeoff".</p>
<p>This is a beautiful theory, but unfortunately the classical theorems yield vacous  results in the realm of modern machine learning, where we  often train networks with millions of parameters on a mere tens of thousands of examples. Moreover, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530">Zhang et al</a> showed that this is not just a question of counting  parameters better. They showed that modern deep networks can in fact "overfit" and achieve 100% success on the training set even if you gave them random or arbitrary labels.</p>
<p>The results above in particular show that we can find classifiers that perform great on the training set but perform terribly on the future tests, as well as classifiers that perform terrible on the training set but pretty good on future test. Specifically, consider an architecture that has the capacity to fit <img alt="20n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=20n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="20n"/> arbitrary labels, and suppose that we train it on a set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/> of <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> examples.  Then we can find a setting of parameters <img alt="\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta"/> that both fits the training set exactly (i.e.,  satisfies <img alt="f_\theta(x)=y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta%28x%29%3Dy&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_\theta(x)=y"/> for all <img alt="(x,y)\in S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29%5Cin+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(x,y)\in S"/>) but also satisfies that the additional constraint that <img alt="f_\theta(x)= -y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta%28x%29%3D+-y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_\theta(x)= -y"/> (i.e., the negation of the label <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="y"/>) for every <img alt="(x,y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(x,y)"/> in some additional set <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="T"/> of <img alt="19m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=19m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="19m"/> pairs.
(The set <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="T"/> is not part of the actual training set, but rather an "auxiliary set" that we simply use for the sake of constructing this counterexample; note that we can use <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="T"/> as means to generate the initial network which can then be fed into standard stochastic gradient descent on the set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/>.) The network <img alt="f_\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_\theta"/> fits its training set perfectly, but since it effectively corresponds to training with 95% label noise, it will  perform  worse than even a coin toss.</p>
<p>In an analogous way, we can find parameters <img alt="\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta"/> that completely fail on the training set, but fit correctly the additional "auxiliary set" <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="T"/>. This will correspond to the case of standard training with 5% label noise, which typically yields about 95% of the performance on the noiseless distribution.</p>
<p>The above insights  break the <strong>separation of concerns</strong> or separation of <strong>computational problems</strong> from <strong>algorithms</strong> which we theorists  like so much. Ideally, we would like to phrase the "machine learning problem" as a well defined optimization objective, such as finding, given a set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/>, the vector <img alt="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m"/> that mimimizes <img alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="L_S(\theta)"/>. Once phrased in this way, we can try to find with an algorithm that achieves this goal as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, modern machine learning does not currently lend itself to such a clean partition. In particular, since not all optima are equally good, we  <em>don’t  actually want</em> to solve the task of minimizing the loss function in a "black box" way. In fact, many of the ideas that make optimization faster such as accelaration, lower learning rate, second order methods and others, yield <em>worse</em>  generalization performance. Thus, while the objective function is somewhat correlated with generalization performance, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for it. This is a clear sign that we don’t really understand what makes machine learning work, and there is still much left to discover. I don’t know what machine learning textbooks in the 2030’s will contain, but my guess is that they would <em>not</em> prescribe running stochastic gradient descent on one of these loss functions. (Moritz Hardt counters that what we teach in ML today is not that far from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Classification-Scene-Analysis-Richard/dp/0471223611">1973 book of Duda and Hart</a>, and that by some measures ML moved <em>slower</em> than other areas of CS.)</p>
<p>The <em>generalization puzzle</em> of machine learning can be phrased as the question of understanding what properties of procedures that map a training set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/> into a classifier <img alt="\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta"/> lead to good generalization performance with respect to certain distributions. In particular we would like to understand what are the properties of natural  natural distributions and stochastic gradient descent that make the latter into such a map.</p>

<p>Yet another puzzle in modern machine learning arises from the fact that we are able to find the minimum of <img alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="L_S(\theta)"/> in the first place. A priori this is surprising since, apart from very special cases (e.g., linear regression with a square loss), the function <img alt="\theta \mapsto L_S(\theta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%5Cmapsto+L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta \mapsto L_S(\theta)"/> is in general <em>non convex</em>. Indeed, for almost any natural loss function, the problem of finding <img alt="\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta"/> that minimizes <img alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="L_S(\theta)"/> is NP hard.
However, if we look at the computational question in the context of the generalization puzzle above, it might not be as mysterious. As we have seen, the fact that the <img alt="\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta"/> we output is a global minimizer (or close to minimizer)  of <img alt="L_S(\cdot)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ccdot%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="L_S(\cdot)"/> is in some sense accidental and by far not the  the most important property of <img alt="\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta"/>. There are many minima of the loss function that  generalize badly, and many non minima that  generalize well.</p>
<p>So perhaps the right way to phrase the computational puzzle is as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"How come that we are able to use stochastic gradient descent to find the vector <img alt="\theta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\theta"/> that is output by stochastic gradient descent."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which when phrased like that, doesn’t seem like much of a puzzle after all.</p>
<h2>The off-distribution performance puzzle</h2>
<p>In the supervised learning problem, the training samples <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/> are drawn from the same distribution as the final test sample. But in any applications of machine learning, classifiers are expected to perform on samples that arise from very different settings. The image that the camera of a self-driving car observes is not drawn from ImageNet, and yet it still needs to (and often can) detect whether not it is seeing a dog or a cat (at which point it will break or accelerate, depending on whether the programmer was a dog or cat lover). Another insight to this question comes from a recent work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Recht et al</a>. They generated a new set of images that is very similar to the original ImageNet test set, but not identical to it. One can think of it as generated from a distribution <img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D'"/> that is close but not the same as the original distribution <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/> of ImageNet. They then checked how well do neural networks that were trained on the original ImageNet distribution <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/> perform on <img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D'"/>. They saw that while these networks performed significantly worse on <img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D'"/> than they did on <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/>, their performance on <img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D'"/> was <em>highly correlated</em> with their performance on <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/>. Hence doing better on <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/> did correspond to being better in a way that carried over to the (very closely related) <img alt="D'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D'"/>. (However, the networks did perform worse on $D’$ so off-distribution performance is by no means a full success story.)</p>
<p>Coming up with a theory that can supply some predictions for learning in a way that is not as tied to the particular distribution is still very much open. I see it as somewhat akin to finding a theory for the performance of algorithms that is somewhere between average-case complexity (which is highly dependant on the distribution) and worst-case complexity (which does not depend on the distribution at all, but is not always achievable).</p>
<h2>The robustness puzzle</h2>
<p>If the previous puzzles were about understanding why deep networks are surprisingly good, the next one is about understanding why they are surprisingly bad. Images of physical objects have the property that if we modify them in some ways,  such as perturbing them in  a small number of pixels or by few shades or rotating by an angle, they still correspond to the same object. Deep neural networks do not seem to "pick up" on this property.
Indeed, there are many examples of how tiny perturbations can cause a neural net to think that one image is another, and people have even <a href="https://youtu.be/piYnd_wYlT8">printed a 3D turtle</a> that most modern systems recognize as a rifle. (See this <a href="https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/">excellent tutorial</a>, though note an "ML decade" has already passed since it was published). This "brittleness" of neural networks can be a significant concern when we deploy them in the wild. (Though perhaps mixing up turtles and rifles is not so bad: I can imagine  some people that would normally resist regulations to protect the environment but would support them if they confused turtles with guns..)
Perhaps one reason for this brittleness is that neural networks can be thought of as a way of embedding a set of examples in dimension <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> into dimension <img alt="\ell" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\ell"/> (where <img alt="\ell" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\ell"/> is the number of neurons in the penultimate layer) in a way that will make the positive examples be linearly separable from the negative examples. Amplifying small differences can help in achieving such a separation, even if it hurts robustness.</p>
<p>Recent works have attempted to rectify this, by using a variants of the loss function where <img alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="L_S(\theta)"/> corresponds to the maximum error under all possible such perturbations of the data. A priori you would think that while robust training might come at a computational cost, statistically it would be a "win win" with the resulting classifiers not only being more robust but also overall better at classifying. After all, we are providing the training procedure with the additional information (i.e., "updating its prior") that the label should be unchanged by certain transformations, which should be equivalent to supplying it with more data. Surprisingly, the robust classifiers currently perform <em>worse</em> than standard trained classifiers on unperturbed data. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02175">Ilyas et al</a> argued that this may be because even if humans ignore information encoded in, for example, whether the intensity level of a pixel is odd or even, it does not mean that this information is not predictive of the label. Suppose that (with no basis whatsoever – just as an example) cat owners are wealthier than dog owners and hence cat pictures tend to be taken with higher quality lenses. One could imagine that a neural network would pick up on that, and use some of the fine grained information in the pixels to help in classification. When we force such a network to be robust it would perform worse. Distill journal published <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/">six discussion pieces</a> on the Ilyas et al paper. I like the idea of such "paper discussions" very much and hope it catches on in machine learning and beyond.</p>
<h2>The interpretability puzzle</h2>
<p>Deep neural networks are inspired by our brain, and it is tempting to try to understand their internal structure just like we try to understand the brain and see if it has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_cell">"grandmother neuron"</a>. For example, we could try to see if there is a certain neuron (i.e., gate) in a neural network that "fires" only when it is fed images with certain high level features (or more generally find vectors that have large correlation with the state at a certain layer only when the image has some features). This also of practical importance, as we increasingly use classifiers to make decisions such as whether to approve or deny bail, whether to prescribe to a patient treatment A or B, or whether a car should steer left or right, and would like to understand what is the basis for such decisions. There are beautiful visualizations of neural networks’ decisions and internal structures , but given the robustness puzzle above, it is unclear if these really capture the decision process. After all, if we could change the classification from a cat to a dog by perturbing a tiny number of pixels, in what sense can we explain <em>why</em> the network made this decision or the other.</p>
<h2>The natural distributions puzzle</h2>
<p>Yet another puzzle (pointed out to me by Ilya Sutskever) is to understand what is it about "natural" distributions such as images, texts, etc.. that makes them so amenable to learning via neural networks, even though such networks can have a very hard time with learning even simple concepts such as parities.
Perhaps this is related to the "noise robustness" of natural concepts which is related to being correlated with low degree polynomials.
Another suggestion could be that at least for text etc.., human languages are implicitly designed to fit neural network. Perhaps on some other planets there are languages where the meaning of a sentence completely changes depending on whether it has an odd or an even number of letters…</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The above are just a few puzzles that modern machine learning offers us. Not all of those might have answers in the form of mathematical theorems, or even well stated conjectures, but it is clear that there is still much to be discovered, and plenty of research opportunities for theoretical computer scientists. In this blog I focused on supervised learning, where at least the problem is well defined, but there are other areas of machine learning, such as transfer learning and generative modeling, where we don’t even yet know how to phrase the computational task, let alone prove that any particular procedure solves it. In several ways, the state of machine learning today seems to me as similar to the state of cryptography in the late 1970’s. After the discovery of public key cryptography, researchers has highly promising techniques and great intuitions, but still did not really understand even what security means, let alone how to achieve it. In the decades since, cryptography has turned from an art to a science, and I hope and believe the same will happen to machine learning.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The next TCS+ talk will take place this coming Wednesday, November 20th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 18:00 UTC). <strong>Jason Li</strong> from CMU will speak about “<em>The Karger-Stein Algorithm is Optimal for <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-cut</em>” (abstract below).</p>
<p>Please make sure you reserve a spot for your group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: In the <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-cut problem, we are given an edge-weighted graph and want to find the least-weight set of edges whose deletion breaks the graph into <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> connected components. Algorithms due to Karger-Stein and Thorup showed how to find such a minimum <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-cut in time approximately <img alt="O(n^{2k-2})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B2k-2%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(n^{2k-2})"/>. The best lower bounds come from conjectures about the solvability of the <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-clique problem and a reduction from <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-clique to <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-cut, and show that solving <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-cut is likely to require time <img alt="\Omega(n^k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28n%5Ek%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\Omega(n^k)"/>. Our recent results have given special-purpose algorithms that solve the problem in time <img alt="n^{1.98k + O(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1.98k+%2B+O%281%29%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="n^{1.98k + O(1)}"/>, and ones that have better performance for special classes of graphs (e.g., for small integer weights).</p></blockquote></div>
