<br/>Computer scientists tend to obsess about privacy and we've had a privacy/security debate for decades now. But now machine learning has really given us a whole new spin on what privacy protects and takes away.<br/>
<div>
<br/>
I take an open approach and basically allow Google to know everything about my life. Google knows where I've been--sometimes my Pixel asks me which store in a shopping center I visited and I give up that info. Google knows who I communicate with, what websites I visit, what music and movies I listen to and watch, all my photos, what temperature makes me comfortable and so on.<br/>
<br/>
What do I get? A Google ecosystem that knows me sometimes better than I know myself. Google works best when it learns and integrates. I get asked to download maps for trips Google knows I'm about to take. I have Google assistant throughout my house, in my phone, in my car and it tailor answers and sometimes even the questions that I need answers to. If anything I wish there was further integration, like Google Voice should ring my office phone only when I'm in the office.<br/>
<br/>
Georgia Tech now forces us to use Microsoft Exchange for email. Outlook is not a bad email program but its capabilities, especially for search, does not work as well and think of all that unused knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I trust Google to keep my information safe, with a random password and 2-factor encryption and even if someone would manage to break in they would find I'm a pretty boring person with an unhealthy obsession of opera (the musical form not the browser).<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't work for everyone and companies should make it easy to keep your info secure. But I say go use your machine learning on me and find ways to make my life easier and more fun, and sure send me some targeted ads as payment. The Internets will find a way to discover you anyway, might as well take advantage. </div></div>

    <title>TR19-007 |  Lower Bounds for Linear Decision Lists | 

	Arkadev Chattopadhyay, 

	Meena Mahajan, 

	Nikhil Mande, 

	Nitin Saurabh</title>
    <summary>We demonstrate a lower bound technique for linear decision lists, which are decision lists where the queries are arbitrary linear threshold functions.
We use this technique to prove an explicit lower bound by showing that any linear decision list computing the function $MAJ \circ XOR$ requires size $2^{0.18 n}$.  This completely answers an open question of Tur{\'a}n and Vatan [FoCM'97]. We also show that the spectral classes $PL_1, PL_\infty$, and the polynomial threshold function classes $\widehat{PT}_1, PT_1$,  are incomparable to linear decision lists.</summary>

randomized algorithm which works in expected $2^{O(\sqrt{n})}$ time. We first
give a simpler iterative variant of this algorithm, using Bland's rule from the
simplex algorithm, which uses exponentially less random bits than Ludwig's
version. Then, we show how to adapt this method to the algorithm of Gimbert and
Horn whose worst case complexity is $O(k!)$, where $k$ is the number of random
nodes. Our algorithm has an expected running time of $2^{O(k)}$, and works for
general random nodes with arbitrary outdegree and probability distribution on
outgoing arcs.

    <title>Stoquastic PCP vs. Randomness</title>

Grilo <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05270">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The derandomization of MA, the probabilistic version of NP, is a long
standing open question. In this work, we connect this problem to a variant of
another major problem: the quantum PCP conjecture. Our connection goes through
the surprising quantum characterization of MA by Bravyi and Terhal. They proved
the MA-completeness of the problem of deciding whether the groundenergy of a
uniform stoquastic local Hamiltonian is zero or inverse polynomial. We show
that the gapped version of this problem, i.e. deciding if a given uniform
stoquastic local Hamiltonian is frustration-free or has energy at least some
constant $\epsilon$, is in NP. Thus, if there exists a gap-amplification
procedure for uniform stoquastic Local Hamiltonians (in analogy to the gap
amplification procedure for constraint satisfaction problems in the original
PCP theorem), then MA = NP (and vice versa). Furthermore, if this gap
amplification procedure exhibits some additional (natural) properties, then P =
RP. We feel this work opens up a rich set of new directions to explore, which
might lead to progress on both quantum PCP and derandomization. As a small side
result, we also show that deciding if commuting stoquastic Hamiltonian is
frustration free is in NP.

    <title>On the Complexity of Exact Pattern Matching in Graphs: Binary Strings and Bounded Degree</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1547683200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Massimo Equi, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Grossi:Roberto.html">Roberto Grossi</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/M=auml=kinen:Veli.html">Veli Mäkinen</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05264">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Exact pattern matching in labeled graphs is the problem of searching paths of
a graph $G=(V,E)$ that spell the same string as the pattern $P[1..m]$. This
basic problem can be found at the heart of more complex operations on variation
graphs in computational biology, of query operations in graph databases, and of
analysis operations in heterogeneous networks, where the nodes of some paths
must match a sequence of labels or types. We describe a simple conditional
lower bound that, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, an $O(|E|^{1 - \epsilon} \,
m)$-time or an $O(|E| \, m^{1 - \epsilon})$-time algorithm for exact pattern
matching on graphs, with node labels and patterns drawn from a binary alphabet,
cannot be achieved unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (\seth) is
false. The result holds even if restricted to undirected graphs of maximum
degree three or directed acyclic graphs of maximum sum of indegree and
outdegree three. Although a conditional lower bound of this kind can be somehow
derived from previous results (Backurs and Indyk, FOCS'16), we give a direct
reduction from \seth for dissemination purposes, as the result might interest
researchers from several areas, such as computational biology, graph database,
and graph mining, as mentioned before. Indeed, as approximate pattern matching
on graphs can be solved in $O(|E|\,m)$ time, exact and approximate matching are
thus equally hard (quadratic time) on graphs under the \seth assumption. In
comparison, the same problems restricted to strings have linear time vs
quadratic time solutions, respectively, where the latter ones have a matching
\seth lower bound on computing the edit distance of two strings (Backurs and
Indyk, STOC'15).

transformed collection in O(n log {\sigma}) time using o(n log {\sigma}) bits
of working space on top of the input and output. Our result improves (on small

Beller et al., which required O(n) bits of extra working space. We also show
how to merge the BWTs of two collections of total size n within the same time

    <title>Beyond Uniform Reverse Sampling: A Hybrid Sampling Technique for Misinformation Prevention</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1547683200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Gunagmo Tong, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Du:Ding=Zhu.html">Ding-Zhu Du</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05149">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Online misinformation has been considered as one of the top global risks as
it may cause serious consequences such as economic damages and public panic.
The misinformation prevention problem aims at generating a positive cascade
with appropriate seed nodes in order to compete against the misinformation. In
this paper, we study the misinformation prevention problem under the prominent
independent cascade model. Due to the \#P-hardness in computing influence, the
core problem is to design effective sampling methods to estimate the function
value. The main contribution of this paper is a novel sampling method.
Different from the classic reverse sampling technique which treats all nodes
equally and samples the node uniformly, the proposed method proceeds with a
hybrid sampling process which is able to attach high weights to the users who
are prone to be affected by the misinformation. Consequently, the new sampling
method is more powerful in generating effective samples used for computing seed
nodes for the positive cascade. Based on the new hybrid sample technique, we
design an algorithm offering a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation. We
experimentally evaluate the proposed method on extensive datasets and show that
it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.

proof is really short, hinging on one key definition that is somewhat inspired
by Galois theory.

    <title>The Bayesian Prophet: A Low-Regret Framework for Online Decision Making</title>

subroutines for online decision-making, we develop a new framework for
designing online policies given access to an oracle providing statistical
information about an offline benchmark. Having access to such prediction
oracles enables simple and natural Bayesian selection policies, and raises the
question as to how these policies perform in different settings. Our work makes
two important contributions towards tackling this question: First, we develop a
general technique we call *compensated coupling* which can be used to derive
bounds on the expected regret (i.e., additive loss with respect to a benchmark)
for any online policy and offline benchmark; Second, using this technique, we
show that the Bayes Selector has constant expected regret (i.e., independent of
the number of arrivals and resource levels) in any online packing and matching
problem with a finite type-space. Our results generalize and simplify many
existing results for online packing and matching problems, and suggest a
promising pathway for obtaining oracle-driven policies for other online
decision-making settings.

    <summary>We show that any Boolean function with approximate rank $r$ can be computed by bounded error quantum protocols without prior entanglement of complexity $O( \sqrt{r} \log r)$. In addition, we show that any Boolean function with approximate rank $r$ and discrepancy $\delta$ can be computed by deterministic protocols of complexity $O(r)$, and private coin bounded error randomized protocols of complexity $O((\frac{1}{\delta})^2 + \log r)$. Our results yield lower bounds on approximate rank. We also obtain a strengthening of Newman's theorem with respect to approximate rank.</summary>

many operations contains a cube term and give both structural and algorithmic
results. We show that if such a clone has a cube term then it has a cube term
of dimension at most $N$, where the number $N$ depends on the arities of the
generators of the clone and the size of the basic set. For idempotent clones we
give a tight bound on $N$ that matches an earlier result of K. Kearnes and A.
Szendrei. On the algorithmic side, we show that deciding the existence of cube
terms is in P for idempotent clones and in EXPTIME in general.
</p>
<p>Since a clone contains a $k$-ary near unanimity operation if and only if it
contains a cube term and a chain of J\'onsson terms, our results can also be
also used to decide whether a given finite algebra has a near unanimity
operation.

manually, which is a tedious task that requires specific skills. In this paper,
we present a novel method for performing CFD directly on scanned 3D point
clouds. The proposed method builds an anisotropic volumetric tetrahedral mesh
adapted around a point-sampled surface, without an explicit surface
reconstruction step. The surface is represented by a new extended implicit
moving least squares (EIMLS) scalar representation that extends the definition
of the function to the entire computational domain, which makes it possible for
use in immersed boundary flow simulations. The workflow we present allows us to
compute flows around point-sampled geometries automatically. It also gives a
better control of the precision around the surface with a limited number of
computational nodes, which is a critical issue in CFD.

function is effectively computable then it is computable by a Turing machine.
</p>
<p>In the 1930s, when Church and Turing worked on their versions of the thesis,
there was a robust notion of algorithm. These traditional algorithms are known
also as classical or sequential. In the original thesis, effectively computable
meant computable by an effective classical algorithm. Based on an earlier
axiomatization of classical algorithms, the original thesis was proven in 2008.
</p>
<p>Since the 1930s, the notion of algorithm has changed dramatically. New
species of algorithms have been and are being introduced. We argue that the
generalization of the original thesis, where effectively computable means
computable by an effective algorithm of any species, cannot possibly be true.

\mathbb{Z}^d = S$, where $conv(S)$ denotes the convex hull of $S$. In this
paper, we consider the algorithmic problem of testing whether a given set $S$
of $n$ lattice points is digital convex. Although convex hull computation
requires $\Omega(n \log n)$ time even for dimension $d = 2$, we provide an
algorithm for testing the digital convexity of $S\subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ in $O(n
+ h \log r)$ time, where $h$ is the number of edges of the convex hull and $r$
is the diameter of $S$. This main result is obtained by proving that if $S$ is
digital convex, then the well-known quickhull algorithm computes the convex
hull of $S$ in linear time. In fixed dimension $d$, we present the first
polynomial algorithm to test digital convexity, as well as a simpler and more
practical algorithm whose running time may not be polynomial in $n$ for certain
inputs.

for which if there exist polynomial time constant factor approximation is not
clear. But what we know is that it is at least APX-hard. Most of the existing

    <title>Platoon Forming Algorithms for Intelligent Street Intersections</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>R. W. Timmerman, M. A. A. Boon <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04583">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study intersection access control for autonomous vehicles. Platoon forming
algorithms, which aim to organize individual vehicles in platoons, are very
promising. To create those platoons, we slow down vehicles before the actual
arrival at the intersection in such a way that each vehicle can traverse the
intersection at high speed. This increases the capacity of the intersection
significantly, offering huge potential savings with respect to travel time in
nowadays traffic.
</p>
<p>We propose several new platoon forming algorithms and provide an approximate
mean delay analysis for our algorithms. A comparison between the current day
practice at intersections (through a case study in SUMO) and our proposed
algorithms is provided. Simulation results for fairness are obtained as well,
showing that platoon forming algorithms with a low mean delay sometimes are
relatively unfair, indicating a potential need for balancing mean delay and
fairness.

    <title>On geometric complexity theory: Multiplicity obstructions are stronger than occurrence obstructions</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1547596800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Julian Dörfler, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/i/Ikenmeyer:Christian.html">Christian Ikenmeyer</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Panova:Greta.html">Greta Panova</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04576">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Geometric Complexity Theory as initiated by Mulmuley and Sohoni in two papers
(SIAM J Comput 2001, 2008) aims to separate algebraic complexity classes via
representation theoretic multiplicities in coordinate rings of specific group
varieties. The papers also conjecture that the vanishing behavior of these
multiplicities would be sufficient to separate complexity classes (so-called
occurrence obstructions). The existence of such strong occurrence obstructions
has been recently disproven in 2016 in two successive papers, Ikenmeyer-Panova
(Adv. Math.) and B\"urgisser-Ikenmeyer-Panova (J. AMS). This raises the
question whether separating group varieties via representation theoretic
multiplicities is stronger than separating them via occurrences. This paper
provides for the first time a setting where separating with multiplicities can
be achieved, while the separation with occurrences is provably impossible. Our
setting is surprisingly simple and natural: We study the variety of products of
homogeneous linear forms (the so-called Chow variety) and the variety of
polynomials of bounded border Waring rank (i.e. a higher secant variety of the
Veronese variety). As a side result we prove a slight generalization of
Hermite's reciprocity theorem, which proves Foulkes' conjecture for a new
infinite family of cases.

    <title>Zeroth-order Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization: Handling Constraints, High-Dimensionality and Saddle-Points</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Balasubramanian:Krishnakumar.html">Krishnakumar Balasubramanian</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Ghadimi:Saeed.html">Saeed Ghadimi</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06474">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, we propose and analyze zeroth-order stochastic approximation
algorithms for nonconvex and convex optimization, with a focus on addressing
constrained optimization, high-dimensional setting and saddle-point avoiding.
To handle constrained optimization, we first propose generalizations of the
conditional gradient algorithm achieving rates similar to the standard
stochastic gradient algorithm using only zeroth-order information. To
facilitate zeroth-order optimization in high-dimensions, we explore the
advantages of structural sparsity assumptions. Specifically, (i) we highlight
an implicit regularization phenomenon where the standard stochastic gradient
algorithm with zeroth-order information adapts to the sparsity of the problem
at hand by just varying the step-size and (ii) propose a truncated stochastic
gradient algorithm with zeroth-order information, whose rate of convergence
depends only poly-logarithmically on the dimensionality. We next focus on
avoiding saddle-points in non-convex setting. Towards that, we interpret the
Gaussian smoothing technique for estimating gradient based on zeroth-order
information as an instantiation of first-order Stein's identity. Based on this,
we provide a novel linear-(in dimension) time estimator of the Hessian matrix
of a function using only zeroth-order information, which is based on
second-order Stein's identity. We then provide an algorithm for avoiding
saddle-points, which is based on a zeroth-order cubic regularization Newton's
method and discuss its convergence rates.

    <p>The first sighting of one of my Wikipedia illustrations in a SODA talk goes to Michał Włodarczyk’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482.104">Losing treewidth by separating subsets</a>” (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101389040748549759"/>). It concerns removing few graph vertices to reach a subgraph with some desired property. If the optimal solution removes  vertices and graphs with the property have treewidth , then his solution removes  vertices and takes the same time as exactly solving  subproblems of size .</p>

Obvious highlights of the conference include Urmila Mahadev’s opening plenary talk on her verification protocol for quantum computation (which I blogged about <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3697">here</a>), and Avishay Tal’s upcoming plenary on his and Ran Raz’s oracle separation between BQP and PH (which I blogged about <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3827">here</a>).  If you care, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/online.ppt">here</a> are the slides for the talk I just gave, on the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09025">“Online Learning of Quantum States”</a> by me, Xinyi Chen, Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale, and Ashwin Nayak.  Feel free to ask in the comments about what else is going on.</p>



<p>I returned a few days ago from my whirlwind Australia tour, which included Melbourne and Sydney; a Persian wedding that happened to be held next to a pirate ship (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MY_Steve_Irwin">Steve Irwin</a>, used to harass whalers and adorned with a huge Jolly Roger); meetings and lectures graciously arranged by friends at <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/">UTS</a>; a quantum computing lab tour personally conducted by 2018 “Australian of the Year” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Simmons">Michelle Simmons</a>; three meetups with readers of this blog (or more often, readers of the <em>other</em> Scott A’s blog who graciously settled for the discount Scott A); and an excursion to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grampians_National_Park">Grampians National Park</a> to see wild kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, and emus.</p>



<p>But the thing that happened in Australia that provided the actual occassion for this post is this: I was interviewed by Adam Ford in Carlton Gardens in Melbourne, about quantum supremacy, AI risk, Integrated Information Theory, whether the universe is discrete or continuous, and to be honest I don’t remember what else.  You can watch the first segment, the one about the prospects for quantum supremacy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=BvVciA5iXH4">here on YouTube</a>.  My only complaint is that Adam’s video camera <em>somehow</em> made me look like an out-of-shape slob who needs to hit the gym or something.</p>



<p><strong><font color="red">Update (Jan. 16):</font></strong> Adam has now posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=397&amp;v=cscRdv57oRQ">second video on YouTube</a>, wherein I talk about my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/giqtm3.pdf">“Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine”</a> paper, my critique of Integrated Information Theory, and more.</p>



<p>And now Adam has posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi67h6v-6fc">yet a third segment</a>, in which I talk about small, lighthearted things like existential threats to civilization and the prospects for superintelligent AI.</p>



<p>Related to the “free will / consciousness” segment of the interview: the biologist Jerry Coyne, whose blog <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/">“Why Evolution Is True”</a> I’ve intermittently enjoyed over the years, yesterday <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2019/01/15/a-computer-scientist-finds-the-question-of-free-will-uninteresting-for-bad-reasons/">announced my existence to his readers</a>, with a post that mostly criticizes my views about free will and predictability, as I expressed them years ago in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp02OJVGG20">clip that’s on YouTube</a> (at the time, Coyne hadn’t seen GIQTM or my other writings on the subject).  Coyne also took the opportunity to poke fun at this weird character he just came across whose “life is devoted to computing” and who even mistakes tips for change at airport smoothie stands.  Some friends here at QIP had a good laugh over the fact that, for the world beyond theoretical computer science and quantum information, this is what 23 years of research, teaching, and writing apparently boil down to: an 8.5-minute video clip where I spouted about free will, and also my having been arrested once in a comic mix-up at Philadelphia airport.  Anyway, since then I had a very pleasant email exchange with Coyne—someone with whom I find myself in agreement much more often than not, and who I’d love to have an extended conversation with sometime despite the odd way our interaction started.</p></div>

    <title>do we ever only care about the decision problem? I know of only one case of that</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(I had been thinking of this for a post then Lance's post on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/01/search-versus-decision.html">search versus decision</a> inspired me to write up these thoughts.)<br/>
<br/>
When teaching NP-completeness we often say<br/>
<br/>
<i>The problem we really care about is, for example, given a weighted graph and two vertices s and t, find the optimal way to go from s to t while hitting every node. But its cleaner mathematically to look at the decision problem:</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
<i>{ (G,s,t,C) : there is a Ham Path from s to t that costs \le C }</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
<i>The search and decision are poly time equivalent, so its fine to just look at the decision. Indeed- if our interest in in lower bounds then clearly if Decision is hard then Find is Hard.</i><br/>
<br/>
But here are some questions about search vs decision in general, not just with regard to P vs NP.<br/>
<br/>
1) Is there ever a case where the real world actually cares about the decision version? I can think of just one- given a number is it PRIME is used in Crypto. The real world does not need the witness that its prime (or similar).  They  just want a prime.  Any other cases?<br/>
<br/>
2) How far apart can search and decision be? NP-decision and NP-search they are poly equivalent. In other domains can they be very far apart? For example, is FINDING a k-clique or k-ind set in a graph on 2^{2k} vertices require roughly n^k steps (go through all k-sets) or can we do much better? I suspect this is unknown but would be delighted if a commenter tells me otherwise.<br/>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Roy J. Glauber, Harvard physics professor for 65 years, longtime Keeper of the Broom at the annual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize">Ig Nobel</a> ceremony, and winner of a non-Ig Nobel, has died at age 93. Glauber is known for his work in quantum optics; roughly speaking, he developed a mathematical theory of the laser at about the same time that device was invented, circa 1960. His two main papers on the subject, published in <em>Physical Review</em> in 1963, did not meet with instant acclaim; the Nobel committee’s recognition of their worth came more than 40 years later, in 2005. A third paper from 1963, titled “<a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1703954">Time-dependent statistics of the Ising model</a>,” also had a delayed impact. It is the basis of a modeling algorithm now called Glauber dynamics, which is well known in the cloistered community of statistical mechanics but deserves wider recognition.</p>
<p>Before digging into the dynamics, however, let us pause for a few words about the man himself, drawn largely from the obituaries in the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/obituaries/roy-j-glauber-dead.html">New York Times</a></em> and the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/1/3/roy-glauber-harvard-professor-obituary/"><em>Harvard Crimson</em></a>.</p>
<p>Glauber was a member of the first class to graduate from the Bronx High School of Science, in 1941. From there he went to Harvard, but left in his sophomore year, at age 18, to work in the theory division at Los Alamos, where he helped calculate the critical mass of fissile material needed for a bomb. After the war he finished his degree at Harvard and went on to complete a PhD under Julian Schwinger. After a few brief adventures in Princeton and Pasadena, he was back at Harvard in 1952 and never left. A poignant aspect of his life is mentioned briefly in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149897/">2009 interview</a>, where Glauber discusses the challenge of sustaining an academic career while raising two children as a single parent.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here’s a glimpse of Glauber dynamics in action. Click the <em>Go</em> button, then try fiddling with the slider.</p>
<div id="glauber-viz" style="width: 600px; margin: 15px auto;">
	<canvas height="600px" id="glauber-canvas" width="600px"/><p/>
<div id="glauber-controls" style="display: flex; margin: auto;">
		<output class="slider-output" for="glauber-slider" id="glauber-temp" style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: bold; margin: auto 10px;">3.00</output><br/>
		<input id="glauber-slider" max="5.0" min="0.01" step="0.01" style="width: 300px; margin: auto 10px;" type="range" value="3.00"/><br/>
		<button id="glauber-go-button" style="width: 50px; margin: 10px;">Go</button>
	</div>
</div>
<p class="indent">In the computer program that drives this animation, the slider controls a variable representing temperature. At high temperature (slide the control all the way to the right), you’ll see a roiling, seething mass of colored squares, switching rapidly and randomly between light and dark shades. There are no large-scale or long-lived structures. Occasionally the end point is not a monochromatic field. Instead the panel is divided into broad stripes—horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. This is an artifact of the finite size of the lattice and the use of wraparound boundary conditions. On an infinite lattice, the stripes would not occur.At low temperature (slide to the left), the tableau congeals into a few writhing blobs of contrasting color. Then the minority blobs are likely to evaporate, and you’ll be left with an unchanging, monochromatic panel. Between these extremes there’s some interesting behavior. Adjust the slider to a temperature near 2.27 and you can expect to see persistent fluctuations at all possible scales, from isolated individual blocks to patterns that span the entire array.</p>
<p>What we’re looking at here is a simulation of a model of a ferromagnet—the kind of magnet that sticks to the refrigerator. The model was introduced almost 100 years ago by Wilhelm Lenz and his student Ernst Ising. They were trying to understand the thermal behavior of ferromagnetic materials such as iron. If you heat a block of magnetized iron above a certain temperature, called the Curie point, it loses all traces of magnetization. Slow cooling below the Curie point allows it to spontaneously magnetize again, perhaps with the poles in a different orientation. The onset of ferromagnetism at the Curie point is an abrupt phase transition.</p>
<p>Lenz and Ising created a <a href="http://bit-player.org/bph-publications/AmSci-2000-09-Hayes-Ising.pdf">stripped-down model of a ferromagnet</a>. In the two-dimensional version shown here, each of the small squares represents the spin vector of an unpaired electron in an iron atom. The vector can point in either of two directions, conventionally called <em>up</em> and <em>down</em>, which for graphic convenience are represented by two contrasting colors. There are \(100 \times 100 = 10{,}000\) spins in the array. This would be a minute sample of a real ferromagnet. On the other hand, the system has \(2^{10{,}000}\) possible states—quite an enormous number.</p>
<p>The essence of ferromagnetism is that adjacent spins “prefer” to point in the same direction. To put that  more formally: The energy of neighboring spins is lower when they are parallel, rather than antiparallel. <img alt="four possible orientations of two spins (up up, up down, down up, down down), with their corresponding energies" border="0" class="alignright" height="111" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ising-spin-pairs.png" style="margin-bottom: 0px;" width="262"/>For the array as a whole, the energy is minimized if all the spins point the same way, either up or down. Each spin contributes a tiny magnetic moment. When the spins are parallel, all the moments add up and the system is fully magnetized.</p>
<p>If energy were the only consideration, the Ising model would always settle into a magnetized configuration, but there is a countervailing influence: Heat tends to randomize the spin directions. At infinite temperature, thermal fluctuations completely overwhelm the spins’ tendency to align, and all states are equally likely. Because the vast majority of those \(2^{10{,}000}\) configurations have nearly equal numbers of <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> spins, the magnetization is negligible. At zero temperature, nothing prevents the system from condensing into the fully magnetized state. The interval between these limits is a battleground where energy and entropy contend for supremacy. Clearly, there must be a transition of some kind. For Lenz and Ising in the 1920s, the crucial question was whether the transition comes at a sharply defined critical temperature, as it does in real ferromagnets. A more gradual progression from one regime to the other would signal the model’s failure to capture important aspects of ferromagnet physics.</p>
<p>In his doctoral dissertation Ising investigated the one-dimensional version of the model—a chain or ring of spins, each one holding hands with its two nearest neighbors. The result was a disappointment: He found no abrupt phase transition. And he speculated that the negative result would also hold in higher dimensions. The Ising model seemed to be dead on arrival.</p>
<p>It was revived a decade later by Rudolf Peierls, who gave suggestive evidence for a sharp transition in the two-dimensional lattice. Then in 1944 Lars Onsager “solved” the two-dimensional model, showing that the phase transition does exist. The phase diagram looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the gagnetization v temperature phase diagram for the Ising model." border="0" class="centered" height="566" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/magnetization-v-temperature.png" width="640"/></p>
<p>As the system cools, the salt-and-pepper chaos of infinite temperature evolves into a structure with larger blobs of color, but the <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> spins remain balanced on average (implying zero magnetization) down to the critical temperature \(T_C\). At that point there is a sudden bifurcation, and the system will follow one branch or the other to full magnetization at zero temperature.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If a model is classified as <em>solved</em>, is there anything more to say about it? In this case, I believe the answer is yes. The solution to the two-dimensional Ising model gives us a prescription for calculating the probability of seeing any given configuration at any given temperature. That’s a major accomplishment, and yet it leaves much of the model’s behavior unspecified. The solution defines the probability distribution at equilibrium—after the system has had time to settle into a statistically stable configuration. It doesn’t tell us anything about how the lattice of spins reaches that equilibrium when it starts from an arbitrary initial state, or how the system evolves when the temperature changes rapidly.</p>
<p>It’s not just the solution to the model that has a few vague spots. When you look at the finer details of how spins interact, the model itself leaves much to the imagination. When a spin reacts to the influence of its nearest neighbors, and those neighbors are also reacting to one another, does everything happen all at once? Suppose two antiparallel spins both decide to flip at the same time; they will be left in a configuration that is still antiparallel. It’s hard to see how they’ll escape repeating the same dance over and over, like people who meet head-on in a corridor and keep making mirror-image evasive maneuvers. This kind of standoff can be avoided if the spins act sequentially rather than simultaneously. But if they take turns, how do they decide who goes first?</p>
<p>Within the intellectual traditions of physics and mathematics, these questions can be dismissed as foolish or misguided. After all, when we look at the procession of the planets orbiting the sun, or at the colliding molecules in a gas, we don’t ask who takes the first step; the bodies are all in continuous and simultaneous motion. Newton gave us a tool, calculus, for understanding such situations. If you make the steps small enough, you don’t have to worry so much about the sequence of marching orders.</p>
<p>However, if you want to write a computer program simulating a ferromagnet (or simulating planetary motions, for that matter), questions of sequence and synchrony cannot be swept aside. With conventional computer hardware, “let everything happen at once” is not an option. The program must consider each spin, one at a time, survey the surrounding neighborhood, apply an update rule that’s based on both the state of the neighbors and the temperature, and then decide whether or not to flip. Thus the program must choose a sequence in which to visit the lattice sites, as well as a sequence in which to visit the neighbors of each site, and those choices can make a difference in the outcome of the simulation. So can other details of implementation. Do we look at all the sites, calculate their new spin states, and then update all those that need to be flipped? Or do we update each spin as we go along, so that spins later in the sequence will see an array already modified by earlier actions? The original definition of the Ising model is silent on such matters, but the programmer must make a commitment one way or another.</p>
<p>This is where Glauber dynamics enters the story. Glauber presented a version of the Ising model that’s somewhat more explicit about how spins interact with one another and with the “heat bath” that represents the influence of temperature. It’s a theory of Ising <em>dynamics</em> because he describes the spin system not just at equilibrium but also during transitional stages. I don’t know if Glauber was the first to offer an account of Ising dynamics, but the notion was certainly not commonplace in 1963.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There’s no evidence Glauber was  thinking of his method as an algorithm suitable for computer implementation. The subject of simulation doesn’t come up in his 1963 paper, where his primary aim is to find analytic expressions for the distribution of <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> spins as a function of time. (He did this only for the one-dimensional model.) Nevertheless, Glauber dynamics offers an elegant approach to programming an interactive version of the Ising model. Assume we have a lattice of \(N\) spins. Each spin \(\sigma\) is indexed by its coordinates \(x, y\) and takes on one of the two values \(+1\) and \(-1\). Thus flipping a spin is a matter of multiplying \(\sigma\) by \(-1\). The algorithm for a updating the lattice looks like this:</p>
<blockquote><p class="undent">Repeat \(N\) times:</p>
<ol style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
<li>Choose a spin \(\sigma_{x, y}\) at random.</li>
<li>Sum the values of the four neighboring spins, \(S = \sigma_{x+1, y} + \sigma_{x-1, y} + \sigma_{x, y+1} + \sigma_{x, y-1}\). The possible values of \(S\) are \(\{-4, -2, 0, +2, +4\}\).</li>
<li>Calculate \(\Delta E = 2 \, \sigma_{x, y} \, S\), the change in interaction energy if \(\sigma_{x, y}\) were to flip.</li>
<li>If \(\Delta E \lt 0\), set \(\sigma_{x, y} = -\sigma_{x, y}\).</li>
<li>Otherwise, set \(\sigma_{x, y} = -\sigma_{x, y}\) with probability \(\exp(-\Delta E/T)\), where \(T\) is the temperature.</li>
</ol>
<p class="undent">Display the updated lattice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 4 says: If flipping a spin will reduce the overall energy of the system, flip it. Step 5 says: Even if flipping a spin raises the energy, go ahead and flip it in a randomly selected fraction of the cases. The probability of such spin flips is the Boltzmann factor \(\exp(-\Delta E/T)\). This quantity goes to \(0\) as the temperature \(T\) falls to \(0\), so that energetically unfavorable flips are unlikely in a cold lattice. The probability approaches \(1\) as \(T\) goes to infinity, which is why the model is such a seething mass of fluctuations at high temperature.</p>
<p>(If you’d like to take a look at real code rather than pseudocode—namely the JavaScript program running the simulation above—it’s <a href="https://github.com/bit-player/glauber">on GitHub</a>.)</p>
<p>Glauber dynamics belongs to a family of methods called Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC). The <a href="http://bit-player.org/bph-publications/AmSci-2013-03-Hayes-Markov.pdf">idea of Markov chains</a> was an innovation in probability theory in the early years of the 20th century, extending classical probability to situations where the the next event depends on the current state of the system. <a href="http://bit-player.org/bph-publications/AmSci-1993-03-Hayes-random-numbers.pdf">Monte Carlo algorithms</a> emerged at post-war Los Alamos, not long after Glauber left there to resume his undergraduate curriculum. He clearly kept up with the work of Stanislaw Ulam and other former colleagues in the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>Within the MCMC family, the distinctive feature of Glauber dynamics is choosing spins at random. The obvious alternative is to march methodically through the lattice by columns and rows, examining every spin in turn. <img alt="Blinking checkerboard" border="0" class="alignleft" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/blinking-checkerboard.png" style="margin-bottom: 0px;" width="210"/>That procedure can certainly be made to work, but it requires care in implementation. At low temperature the Ising process is very nearly deterministic, since unfavorable flips are extremely rare. When you combine a deterministic flip rule with a deterministic path through the lattice, it’s easy to get trapped in recurrent patterns. For example, a subtle bug yields the same configuration of spins on every step, shifted left by a single lattice site, so that the pattern seems to slide across the screen. Another spectacular failure gives rise to a blinking checkerboard, where every spin is surrounded by four opposite spins and flips on every time step. Avoiding these errors requires much fussy attention to algorithmic details. (My personal experience is that the first attempt is never right.)</p>
<p>Choosing spins by throwing random darts at the lattice turns out to be less susceptible to clumsy mistakes. Yet, at first glance, the random procedure seems to have hazards of its own. In particular, choosing 10,000 spins at random from a lattice of 10,000 sites does <em>not</em> guarantee that every site will be visited once. On the contrary, a few sites will be sampled six or seven times, and you can expect that 3,679 sites (that’s \(1/e \times 10{,}000)\) will not be visited at all. Doesn’t that bias distort the outcome of the simulation? No, it doesn’t. After many iterations, all the sites will get equal attention.</p>
<p>The nasty bit in all Ising simulation algorithms is updating pairs of adjacent sites, where each spin is the neighbor of the other. Which one goes first, or do you try to handle them simultaneously? The column-and-row ordering maximizes exposure to this problem: Every spin is a member of such a pair. Other sequential algorithms—for example, visiting all the black squares of a checkerboard followed by all the white squares—avoid these confrontations altogether, never considering two adjacent spins in succession. Glauber dynamics is the Goldilocks solution. Pairs of adjacent spins do turn up as successive elements in the random sequence, but they are rare events. Decisions about how to handle them have no discernible influence on the outcome.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Years ago, I had several opportunities to meet Roy Glauber. Regrettably, I failed to take advantage of them. Glauber’s office at Harvard was in the Lyman Laboratory of Physics, a small isthmus building connecting two larger halls. In the 1970s I was a frequent visitor there, pestering people to write articles for <em>Scientific American</em>. It was fertile territory; for a few years, the magazine found more authors per square meter in Lyman Lab than anywhere else in the world. But I never knocked on Glauber’s door. Perhaps it’s just as well. I was not yet equipped to appreciate what he had to say.</p>
<p>Now I can let him have the last word. This is from the introduction to the paper that introduced Glauber dynamics:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the mathematical problems of equilibrium statistical mechanics are great, they are at least relatively well-defined. The situation is quite otherwise in dealing with systems which undergo large-scale changes with time. The principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics remain in largest measure unformulated. While this lack persists, it may be useful to have in hand whatever precise statements can be made about the time-dependent hehavior of statistical systems, however simple they may be.</p></blockquote>

    <title>TR19-004 |  UG-hardness to NP-hardness by Losing Half | 

	Amey Bhangale, 

	Subhash Khot</title>
    <summary>The $2$-to-$2$ Games Theorem of [KMS-1, DKKMS-1, DKKMS-2, KMS-2] implies that it is NP-hard to distinguish between Unique Games instances with assignment satisfying at least  $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon)$ fraction of the constraints $vs.$ no assignment satisfying more than $\varepsilon$ fraction of the constraints, for every constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We show that the reduction can be transformed in a non-trivial way to give a stronger guarantee in the completeness case: For at least $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon)$ fraction of the vertices on one side, all the constraints associated with them in the Unique Games instance can be satisfied. 


We use this guarantee to convert the known UG-hardness results to NP-hardness. We show:

1. Tight inapproximability of approximating independent sets in a degree $d$ graphs within a factor of $\Omega\left(\frac{d}{\log^2 d}\right)$, where $d$ is a constant. 
2. NP-hardness of approximate Maximum Acyclic Subgraph problem within a factor of $\frac{2}{3}+\varepsilon$, improving the previous ratio of $\frac{14}{15}+\varepsilon$ by Austrin et al.[AMW15].
3. For any predicate $P^{-1}(1) \subseteq [q]^k$ supporting balanced pairwise independent distribution, given a $P$-CSP instance with value at least $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$, it is NP-hard to satisfy more than $\frac{|P^{-1}(1)|}{q^k}+\varepsilon$ fraction of constraints.</summary>

Baron Jean Bourgain and Sir Michael Atiyah passed away within the past three weeks. They became mathematical nobility by winning the Fields Medal, Atiyah in 1966 and Bourgain in 1994. Bourgain was created Baron by King Philippe of Belgium in 2015. Atiyah’s knighthood did not confer nobility, but he held the dynastic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Merit">Order of Merit</a>, which is limited to 24 living members and has had fewer than 200 total since its inception in 1902. Atiyah had been #2 by length of tenure after Prince Philip and ahead of Prince Charles. </p>
<p>
Today we discuss how they ennobled mathematics by their wide contributions.</p>
<p>
Bourgain was affiliated to IAS by the IBM John von Neumann Professorship. He had been battling cancer for a long time. Here is the middle section of the coat of arms he created for his 2015 investiture:</p>

The shield shows the beginning of an Apollonian circle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket">packing</a>, in which every radius is the reciprocal of an integer. This property continues as circles are recursively inscribed in the curvilinear regions—see this 2000 <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/03_02_appolonian.pdf">survey</a> for a proof. To quote Bourgain’s <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/jean-bourgain's-coat-arms">words</a> accompanying his design:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The theory of these [packings] is today a rich mathematical research area, at the interface of hyperbolic geometry, dynamics, and number theory. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Bourgain’s affinity to topics we hold dear in computing theory is shown by this 2009 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMWlv_1DqyM">talk</a> titled, “The Search for Randomness.” It covers not only PRNGs and crypto but also expander graphs and <em>succinctness</em> in quantum computing. He has been hailed for diversity in other mathematical areas and editorships of many journals. We will talk about a problem in analysis which he helped solve not by analytical means but by connecting the problem to additive combinatorics.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> From Analysis to Combinatorics </h2><p/>
<p>
</p><p>
Sōichi Kakeya posed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakeya_set">problem</a> of the minimum size of a subset of <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{R}^{2}}"/> in which a unit-length needle can be rotated through 360 degrees. Abram Besicovitch showed in 1928 that such sets can have Lebesgue measure <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/> for any <img alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0}"/>. He had already shown that one can achieve measure zero with a weaker property, which he had used to show a strong failure of Fubini’s theorem for Riemann integrals:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For all <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> there is a measure-zero subset of <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{R}^d}"/> that contains a unit line segment in every direction. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The surprise to many of us is that such strange sets would have important further consequences in analysis. A 2008 <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2008-45-01/S0273-0979-07-01189-5/S0273-0979-07-01189-5.pdf">survey</a> in the <em>AMS Bulletin</em> by Izabella Łaba, titled “From Harmonic Analysis to Arithmetic Combinatorics,” brings out breakthrough contributions by Bourgain to conjectures and problems that involve further properties of these sets, which seem to retain Kakeya’s name: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <b>Conjecture:</b> A Kakeya set in <img alt="{R^{d}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%5E%7Bd%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R^{d}}"/> must have Hausdorff dimension <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This and the formally weaker conjecture that the set must have Minkowski dimension <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> are proved in <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{R}^2}"/> but open for all <img alt="{d \geq 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd+%5Cgeq+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d \geq 3}"/>. Bourgain first proved that the <em>restriction conjecture</em> of Elias Stein, which is about extensions of the Fourier transform from certain subspaces of functions from <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{R}^d}"/> to <img alt="{\mathbb{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{C}}"/> to operators from <img alt="{L^q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%5Eq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L^q}"/> to <img alt="{L^p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%5Ep%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L^p}"/> functions on <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{R}^d}"/>, implies the Kakeya conjecture. It is likewise open for <img alt="{d,p \geq 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%2Cp+%5Cgeq+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d,p \geq 3}"/>. As Łaba writes, associated estimates “with <img alt="{p &gt; 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp+%3E+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p &gt; 2}"/> require deeper geometrical information, and this is where we find Kakeya sets lurking under the surface.” </p>
<p>
What Bourgain showed is that the restriction estimates place constraints on sets of lower Hausdorff dimension that force them to align “tubes” along discrete directions that can be approximated via integer lattices. This led to the following “key lemma”:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 1</b> <em> Consider subsets <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> of <img alt="{A \times B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Ctimes+B%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \times B}"/>, where <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> are finite subsets of <img alt="{\mathbb{Z}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{Z}^d}"/>, and define </em></p><em>

</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
To quote Łaba: “Bourgain’s approach, however, provided a way out. Effectively, it said that our hypothetical set would have <em>structure</em>, to the extent that many of its lines would have to be parallel instead of pointing in different directions. <em>Not a Kakeya set, after all.</em>” She further says:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Bourgain’s argument was, to this author’s knowledge, the first application of additive number theory to Euclidean harmonic analysis. It was significant, not only because it improved Kakeya bounds, but perhaps even more so because it introduced many harmonic analysts to additive number theory, including [Terence] Tao who contributed so much to the subject later on, and jump-started interaction and communication between the two communities. The Green-Tao theorem [on primes] and many other developments might have never happened, were it not for Bourgain’s brilliant leap of thought in 1998. </em>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Michael Atiyah </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Michael Atiyah was also much more than an analyst—indeed, he was first a topologist and algebraic geometer. He was also a theoretical physicist. Besides all these scientific hats, he engaged with society at large. After heading Britain’s Royal Society from 1990 to 1995, he became president of the <a href="https://pugwash.org/">Pugwash</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs">Conferences</a> on Science and World Affairs. This organization was founded by Joseph Rotblat and Bertrand Russell in the 1950s to avert nuclear war and misuse of science, and won the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>
The “misuse of science” aspect comes out separately in Atiyah’s 1999 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127049/">article</a> in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> titled, “Science for evil: the scientist’s dilemma.” It lays out a wider scope of ethical and procedural concerns than the original anti-war purpose. This is furthered in his 1999 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304691079_The_Social_Responsibility_of_Scientists">book</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230508606_15">chapter</a>, “The Social Responsibility of Scientists,” which laid out six points including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
First there is the argument of moral responsibility. If you create something you should be concerned with its consequences. This should apply as much to making scientific discoveries as to having children. <p/>
</li><li>
Scientists will understand the technical problems better than the average politician or citizen and knowledge brings responsibility. <p/>
</li><li>
[T]here is need to prevent a public backlash against science. Self-interest requires that scientists must be fully involved in public debate and must not be seen as “enemies of the people.”
</li></ul>
<p>
As he says in its abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In my own case, after many years of quiet mathematical research, working out of the limelight, a major change occurred when unexpectedly I found myself president of the Royal Society, in a very public position, and expected to act as a general spokesman for the whole of science. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Within physics and mathematics, he also ventured into a debate that comes closer to the theory-as-social-process topic we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/proofs-proofs-and-proofs/">have</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/01/11/why-do-we-need-cyber-security/">discussed</a> on this blog. In 1994 he led a collection of community <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404229">responses</a> to a 1993 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9307227">article</a> by Arthur Jaffe and Frank Quinn that began with the question, “Is speculative mathematics dangerous?” Atiyah replied by saying he agreed with many of their points, especially the need to distinguish between results based on rigorous proofs and heuristic arguments,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …But if mathematics is to rejuvenate itself and break exciting new ground it will have to allow for the exploration of new ideas and techniques which, in their creative phase, are likely to be as dubious as in some of the great eras of the past. …[I]n the early stages of new developments, we must be prepared to act in more buccaneering style. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Now we cannot help recalling his <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17NBICP6OcUSucrXKNWvzLmrQpfUrEKuY/view">claim</a> last September of heuristic arguments that will build a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, which we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/09/26/reading-into-atiyahs-proof/">covered</a> in <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/09/23/preview-of-the-atiyah-talk/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/09/21/the-specter-of-simpler-proofs/">posts</a>. As we stated in our New Year’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/06/predictions-for-2019/">post</a>, nothing more of substance has come to our attention. We do not know how much more work was done on the promised longer paper. We will move toward discussing briefly how his most famous work is starting to matter in algorithms and complexity.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Indexes and Invariants </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We will not try to go into even as much detail as we did for Kakeya sets about Atiyah’s signature contributions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_K-theory">topological</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-theory">K-theory</a>, physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah#Gauge_theory_(1977-1985)">gauge</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory">theory</a>, his celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah-Singer_index_theorem">index theorem</a> with Isadore Singer, and much else. But we can evoke reasons for us to be interested in the last. We start with the simple statement from the <a href="http://www.abelprize.no/c53865/binfil/download.php?tid=53804">essay</a> by John Rognes of Oslo that accompanied the 2004 Abel Prize award to Atiyah and Singer:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> Let <img alt="{P(f) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%28f%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P(f) = 0}"/> be a system of differential equations. Then </em></p><em>

Here the <em>analytical index</em> equals the dimension <img alt="{d_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d_k}"/> of the kernel of <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> minus the dimension <img alt="{d_c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d_c}"/> of the co-kernel of <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/>, which (again quoting Rognes) “is equal to the number of parameters needed to describe all the solutions of the equation, minus the number of relations there are between the expressions <img alt="{P(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P(f)}"/>.” The <em>topological index</em> has a longer laundry list of items in its definition, but the point is, <em>those items are usually all easily calculable</em>. It is further remarkable that in many cases we can get <img alt="{d_k - d_c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_k+-+d_c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d_k - d_c}"/> without knowing how to compute <img alt="{d_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d_k}"/> and <img alt="{d_c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d_c}"/> individually. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/obituaries/michael-atiyah-dead.html">obituary</a> quotes Atiyah from 2015:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> It’s a bit of black magic to figure things out about differential equations even though you can’t solve them. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
One thing it helps figure out is satisfiability. Besides cases where knowing the number of solutions does help in finding them, there are many theorems that needed only information about the number and the parameterization. </p>
<p>
We have an analogous situation in complexity theory with the lower bound theorem of Walter Baur and Volker Strassen, which we covered in this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/projections-can-be-tricky/">post</a>: The number of multiplication gates needed to compute an arithmetical function <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> is bounded below by a known constant times the log-base-2 of the maximum number of solutions to a system formed from the partial derivatives of <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> and a certain number of linear equations, over cases where that number is finite. Furthermore, both theorems front on algebraic geometry and geometric invariant theory, whose rapid ascent in our field was witnessed by a workshop at IAS that we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">covered</a> last June. That workshop mentioned not only Atiyah but also the further work in algebraic geometry by his student Frances Kirwan, who was contemporaneous with Ken while at Oxford. Thus we may see more of the kind of connections in which Atiyah delighted, as noted in <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/31190">current</a> <a href="https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/blog/laureate/sir-michael-francis-atiyah/">tributes</a> and the “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/mathematical-matchmaker-michael-atiyah-dreams-quantum-union/">matchmaker</a>” label which was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ICM2018/posts/1023543974470240">promoted</a> at last August’s ICM.</p>

I'm a bit disappointed that Michael describes al-Nayrizi's and Perigal's (families of) simple perfect squarings of the (flat square) torus as different. They are, in fact, identical—not just “congruent” or “equivalent” or “isomorphic”, but actually indistinguishable. They only look different because al-Nayrizi and Perigal cut the torus into a square in two different ways.<p/></div></div>
