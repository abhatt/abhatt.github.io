    <title>Congruency-Constrained TU Problems Beyond the Bimodular Case</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/N=auml=gele:Martin.html">Martin Nägele</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Santiago:Richard.html">Richard Santiago</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/z/Zenklusen:Rico.html">Rico Zenklusen</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03148">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A long-standing open question in Integer Programming is whether integer
programs with constraint matrices with bounded subdeterminants are efficiently
solvable. An important special case thereof are congruency-constrained integer
programs $\min\{c^\top x\colon Tx\leq b, \gamma^\top x\equiv r\pmod*{m},
x\in\mathbb{Z}^n\}$ with a totally unimodular constraint matrix $T$. Such
problems have been shown to be polynomial-time solvable for $m=2$, which led to
an efficient algorithm for integer programs with bimodular constraint matrices,
i.e., full-rank matrices whose $n\times n$ subdeterminants are bounded by two
in absolute value. Whereas these advances heavily relied on existing results on
well-known combinatorial problems with parity constraints, new approaches are
needed beyond the bimodular case, i.e., for $m&gt;2$.
</p>
<p>We make first progress in this direction through several new techniques. In
particular, we show how to efficiently decide feasibility of
congruency-constrained integer programs with a totally unimodular constraint
matrix for $m=3$. Furthermore, for general $m$, our techniques also allow for
identifying flat directions of infeasible problems, and deducing bounds on the
proximity between solutions of the problem and its relaxation.

Servedio</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03107">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We introduce a new notion of influence for symmetric convex sets over
Gaussian space, which we term "convex influence". We show that this new notion
of influence shares many of the familiar properties of influences of variables
for monotone Boolean functions $f: \{\pm1\}^n \to \{\pm1\}.$
</p>
<p>Our main results for convex influences give Gaussian space analogues of many
important results on influences for monotone Boolean functions. These include
(robust) characterizations of extremal functions, the Poincar\'e inequality,
the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem, a sharp threshold theorem of Kalai, a stability
version of the Kruskal-Katona theorem due to O'Donnell and Wimmer, and some
partial results towards a Gaussian space analogue of Friedgut's junta theorem.
The proofs of our results for convex influences use very different techniques
than the analogous proofs for Boolean influences over $\{\pm1\}^n$. Taken as a
whole, our results extend the emerging analogy between symmetric convex sets in
Gaussian space and monotone Boolean functions from $\{\pm1\}^n$ to $\{\pm1\}$

nonnegative-integer solvability of linear equations is in
nondeterministic-exponential-time while integer solvability is in

that, given a string $S [1..n]$ over the alphabet $\{1, \ldots, \sigma\}$ with
$\sigma = o (n / \log^{5 / 2} n)$, encodes $S$ in at most $n (H + 1) + o (n)$
bits, where $H$ is the empirical entropy of $S$, such that encoding and
decoding $S$ take $O (n)$ time. They also proved their bound on the encoding
length is optimal, even when the empirical entropy is high. Their algorithm is
impractical, however, because it uses complicated data structures. In this
paper we give an algorithm with the same bounds, except that we require $\sigma
= o (n^{1 / 2} / \log n)$, that uses no data structures more complicated than a
lookup table. Moreover, when Gagie and Nekrich's algorithm is used for optimal
adaptive alphabetic coding it takes $O (n \log \log n)$ time for decoding, but
ours still takes $O (n)$ time.

of d and k. It goes through the variables in random order and sets each
variable randomly to one of the d colors, excluding those colors that can be
ruled out by looking at few constraints at a time. We propose and analyze a
modification of PPSZ: whenever all but 2 colors can be ruled out for some
variable, immediately set that variable randomly to one of the remaining
colors. We show that our new "impatient PPSZ" outperforms PPSZ exponentially
for all k and all d &gt;= 3 on formulas with a unique satisfying assignment.

that asking if a given input automaton admits a synchronizing word in the

this problem for commutative automata over an arbitrary alphabet and automata

class contains, for example, the \v{C}ern\'y family of automata. We find that
for commutative input automata, the problem is always solvable in polynomial

over a binary alphabet and with a constraint language given by a partial
automaton with up to three states, the constrained synchronization problem is
also solvable in polynomial time.

Szwarcfiter <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02733">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We are interested in embedding trees T with maximum degree at most four in a
rectangular grid, such that the vertices of T correspond to grid points, while
edges of T correspond to non-intersecting straight segments of the grid lines.
Such embeddings are called straight models. While each edge is represented by a
straight segment, a path of T is represented in the model by the union of the
segments corresponding to its edges, which may consist of a path in the model
having several bends. The aim is to determine a straight model of a given tree
T minimizing the maximum number of bends over all paths of T. We provide a
quadratic-time algorithm for this problem. We also show how to construct
straight models that have k as its minimum number of bends and with the least
number of vertices possible. As an application of our algorithm, we provide an
upper bound on the number of bends of EPG models of graphs that are both VPT
and EPT.

subset (e.g., an independent set) are well investigated. In these problems,
some tokens are placed on a subset of vertices of the graph, and there are
three natural reconfiguration rules called ``token sliding,'' ``token
jumping,'' and ``token addition and removal''. In the context of computational
complexity of puzzles, the sliding block puzzles play an important role.
Depending on the rules and set of pieces, the sliding block puzzles
characterize the computational complexity classes including P, NP, and PSPACE.
The sliding block puzzles correspond to the token sliding model in the context
of combinatorial reconfiguration. On the other hand, a relatively new notion of
jumping block puzzles is proposed in puzzle society. This is the counterpart to
the token jumping model of the combinatorial reconfiguration problems in the
context of block puzzles. We investigate several variants of jumping block
puzzles and determine their computational complexities.

    <title>On the query complexity of connectivity with global queries</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1631059200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Arinta Auza, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Lee:Troy.html">Troy Lee</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02115">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the query complexity of determining if a graph is connected with
global queries. The first model we look at is matrix-vector multiplication
queries to the adjacency matrix. Here, for an $n$-vertex graph with adjacency
matrix $A$, one can query a vector $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ and receive the answer
$Ax$. We give a randomized algorithm that can output a spanning forest of a
weighted graph with constant probability after $O(\log^4(n))$ matrix-vector
multiplication queries to the adjacency matrix. This complements a result of
Sun et al.\ (ICALP 2019) that gives a randomized algorithm that can output a
spanning forest of a graph after $O(\log^4(n))$ matrix-vector multiplication
queries to the signed vertex-edge incidence matrix of the graph. As an
application, we show that a quantum algorithm can output a spanning forest of
an unweighted graph after $O(\log^5(n))$ cut queries, improving and simplifying
a result of Lee, Santha, and Zhang (SODA 2021), which gave the bound
$O(\log^8(n))$.
</p>
<p>In the second part of the paper, we turn to showing lower bounds on the
linear query complexity of determining if a graph is connected. If $w$ is the
weight vector of a graph (viewed as an $\binom{n}{2}$ dimensional vector), in a
linear query one can query any vector $z \in \mathbb{R}^{n \choose 2}$ and
receive the answer $\langle z, w\rangle$. We show that a zero-error randomized
algorithm must make $\Omega(n)$ linear queries in expectation to solve
connectivity. As far as we are aware, this is the first lower bound of any kind
on the unrestricted linear query complexity of connectivity. We show this lower
bound by looking at the linear query \emph{certificate complexity} of
connectivity, and characterize this certificate complexity in a linear
algebraic fashion.

algebra $\mathbf A$ satisfies $\Sigma$ locally on subsets of bounded size, in
order to decide, whether $\mathbf A$ satisfies $\Sigma$ (globally). This
local-global property is the main known source of tractability results for
deciding Maltsev conditions. In this paper we investigate the local-global
property for the existence of a $G$-term, i.e. an $n$-ary term that is
invariant under permuting its variables according to a permutation group $G
\leq$ Sym($n$). Our results imply in particular that all cyclic loop conditions
(in the sense of Bodirsky, Starke, and Vucaj) have the local-global property
(and thus can be decided in polynomial time), while symmetric terms of arity
$n&gt;2$ fail to have it.

    <title>Stretching Your Data With Taffy Filters</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1631059200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Apple:Jim.html">Jim Apple</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01947">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Popular approximate membership query structures such as Bloom filters and
cuckoo filters are widely used in databases, security, and networking. These
structures support two operations -- insert and lookup; lookup always returns
true on elements inserted into the structure, while it returns true with some
probability $\varepsilon \ll 1$ on elements not inserted into the structure.
These latter elements are called false positives. Compensatory for these false
positives, filters can be much smaller than hash tables that represent the same
set. However, unlike hash tables, cuckoo filters and Bloom filters must be
initialized with the intended number of inserts to be performed, and cannot
grow larger -- inserts beyond this number may fail or increase the false
positive probability. This paper presents designs and implementations of
filters than can grow without inserts failing and without increasing the false
positive probability, even if the filters are created with a small initial
size. The resulting code is open source and available for general use.

supports queries that return $f(x)$ for any $x \in S$. Retrieval data
structures can be used to implement a static approximate membership query data
structure (AMQ) (i.e., a Bloom filter alternative) with false positive rate
$2^{-r}$. The information-theoretic lower bound for both tasks is $r|S|$ bits.
While succinct theoretical constructions using $(1+o(1))r|S|$ bits were known,
these could not achieve very small overheads in practice because they have an
unfavorable space-time tradeoff hidden in the asymptotic costs or because small
overheads would only be reached for physically impossible input sizes. With
bumped ribbon retrieval (BuRR), we present the first practical succinct
retrieval data structure. In an extensive experimental evaluation BuRR achieves
space overheads well below $1\,\%$ while being faster than most previously used
retrieval data structures (typically with space overheads at least an order of
magnitude larger) and faster than classical Bloom filters (with space overhead
$\geq 44\,\%$). This efficiency, including favorable constants, stems from a
combination of simplicity, word parallelism, and high locality. We additionally
describe homogeneous ribbon filter AMQs, which are even simpler and faster at
the price of slightly larger space overhead.

    <title>Improving The Floyd-Warshall All Pairs Shortest Paths Algorithm</title>

Toroslu</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01872">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is the most popular algorithm for determining
the shortest paths between all pairs in a graph. It is very a simple and an
elegant algorithm. However, if the graph does not contain any negative weighted
edge, using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for every vertex as a source
vertex to produce all pairs shortest paths of the graph works much better than
the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for sparse graphs. Also, for the graphs with
negative weighted edges, with no negative cycle, Johnson's algorithm still
performs significantly better than the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for sparse
graphs. Johnson's algorithm transforms the graph into a non-negative one by
using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, then, applies the Dijkstra's algorithm. Thus,
in general the Floyd-Warshall algorithm becomes very inefficient especially for
sparse graphs. In this paper, we show a simple improvement on the
Floyd-Warshall algorithm that will increases its performance especially for the
sparse graphs, so it can be used instead of more complicated alternatives.

correlation clustering) problem, a classical graph clustering problem widely
used in machine learning and computer vision. Our algorithm consists of three
steps executed recursively: (1) Finding conflicted cycles that correspond to
violated inequalities of the underlying multicut relaxation, (2) Performing
message passing between the edges and cycles to optimize the Lagrange
relaxation coming from the found violated cycles producing reduced costs and
(3) Contracting edges with high reduced costs through matrix-matrix
multiplications.

<p>Our algorithm produces primal solutions and dual lower bounds that estimate
the distance to optimum. We implement our algorithm on GPUs and show resulting
one to two order-of-magnitudes improvements in execution speed without
sacrificing solution quality compared to traditional serial algorithms that run
on CPUs. We can solve very large scale benchmark problems with up to
$\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ variables in a few seconds with small primal-dual gaps. We

We develop SFCDecomp, a space filling curve based decomposition framework to
solve large instances of 3d printing problems efficiently by solving these
optimization subproblems independently. For the Buddha, our framework builds
toolpaths over a total of 799,716 nodes across 169 layers, and for the Bunny it
builds toolpaths over 812,733 nodes across 360 layers. Building on SFCDecomp,
we develop a multicriteria optimization approach for toolpath planning. We
demonstrate the utility of our framework by maximizing or minimizing tool path
edge overlap between adjacent layers, while jointly minimizing turn costs.
Strength testing of a tensile test specimen printed with tool paths that
maximize or minimize adjacent layer edge overlaps reveal significant
differences in tensile strength between the two classes of prints.

crossed at most once. However, there are 1-planar graphs which do not admit a
straight-line 1-planar drawing. We show that every 1-planar graph has a
straight-line drawing with a two-coloring of the edges, so that edges of the
same color do not cross. Hence, 1-planar graphs have geometric thickness two.
In addition, each edge is crossed by edges with a common vertex if it is
crossed more than twice. The drawings use high precision arithmetic with
numbers with O(n log n) digits and can be computed in linear time from a
1-planar drawing

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This month saw four papers. One on group testing, another on distribution testing, yet another which makes progress on testing problems on decision trees and the last one on graph property testing. Without further ado, let’s dive in.  </p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Group Testing with Non-identical Infection Probabilities</strong> by Mustafa Doger, Sennur Ulukus (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12418">arXiv</a>) Consider the classic group testing problem. Here the setup is the following. You are given a bunch of individuals from a population \(\mathcal{P}\). You have an infection vector which records the infection status of each individual in the population where the \(i\)-th individual is infected with probability \(p_i\). You want to recover all the infected individuals. You are allowed to group individuals together and you can test the entire group in a single shot. If the group tests negative, you are happy all the tested individuals are off the hook. Otherwise, if the group tests positive, you need more tests for further classification. This paper proposes a greedy way to build pools of individuals you would test. The pools are built adaptively: as in future pools are built using the knowledge of how the preceding tests fared. The key result in the paper upperbounds the number of tests performed in terms of the entropy of the infection vector.</p>

<p><strong>Uniformity Testing in the Shuffle Model: Simpler, Better, Faster</strong> by Clément L. Canonne, Hongyi Lyu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08987">arXiv</a>) Differentially private distribution testing as a research area has been gathering momentum steadily over the last few years. If you read our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/08/new-for-july-2021/">last month’s post</a>, you might recall there are a wide variety of models of DP each corresponding to a different “threat model”. The most stringent among the most explored models is the “local model”, the least stringent being the “central model” and there is an intermediate threat model, the so called “<a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2020/05/news-for-april-2020/">shuffle model</a>“. This paper simplifies the analysis of uniformity testing algorithm under the shuffle model and presents an algorithm with sample complexity \(O(k^{3/4})\) for testing uniformity over a support of size \([k]\). </p>



<p/>



<p><strong>On Learning and Testing Decision Tree</strong> by Nader H. Bshouty, Catherine A. Haddad-Zaknoon (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04587">arXiv</a>) In our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/01/news-for-december-2020/">December 2020</a> post, we covered a result of Blanc et al., which proves the following: Suppose you are given a boolean function \(f\) and the property \(\mathcal{P}\) of size-\(s\) decision trees. The result of Blanc et al gives you a function \(g \in \mathcal{P}\) with \(dist(f,g) = O(dist (f, \mathcal{P}))\) where \(g \in \) is guaranteed to have decision tree complexity \(s^{O(\log^2 s)}\). This result implies a bi-criteria tester for the following property: is \(f \in \mathcal{P}\) or is \(f\) \(\varepsilon\)-far from having decision tree complexity \(\phi(s) = s^{O(\log^3 s)}\). The current paper improves this result by presenting a property tester with \(\phi(s) = s^{O(\log^2 s)}\).   </p>



<p> </p>



<p><strong>The complexity of testing all properties of planar graphs, and the role of isomorphism</strong> by Sabyasachi Basu, Akash Kumar, C. Seshadhri (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10547">arXiv</a>) <em>(Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of this paper)</em>. This paper presents a result that I, in my biased opinion, find interesting. So, here is the setup. You are given a bounded degree planar graph. And I cook up some God-forsaken property and ask you to test it. Turns out, no matter how devilishly I cooked up the property, you can test in with \(\exp(O(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) queries. The nice happenstance is that you also have a matching lower bound of \(\exp(\Omega(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) queries! And interestingly, this lower bound is witnessed by the very natural property of testing isomorphism to a fixed graph which means that isomorphism is the hardest property of  planar graphs.</p></div>

Stochastic Games (SGs) lay the foundation for the study of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) and sequential agent interactions. In this paper,
we derive that computing an approximate Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) in a
finite-state discounted Stochastic Game within the exponential precision is
\textbf{PPAD}-complete. We adopt a function with a polynomially bounded
description in the strategy space to convert the MPE computation to a
fixed-point problem, even though the stochastic game may demand an exponential
number of pure strategies, in the number of states, for each agent. The
completeness result follows the reduction of the fixed-point problem to {\sc
End of the Line}. Our results indicate that finding an MPE in SGs is highly
unlikely to be \textbf{NP}-hard unless \textbf{NP}=\textbf{co-NP}. Our work
offers confidence for MARL research to study MPE computation on general-sum SGs
and to develop fruitful algorithms as currently on zero-sum SGs.

    <title>Guest Post on Solving (or trying to) Poly Diophantine Equations by Bogdan Grechuk</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Guest post by Bogdan Grechuk)

<p>
  
<br/>Motivated by Mathoverflow question
<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/316708/what-is-the-smallest-unsolved-diophantine-equation">here</a>
I have recently became interested in solving Polynomial Diophantine equations, that is, equations of the form

</p><center>P(x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>)=0</center>

<br/>for some polynomial P with integer coefficients. Because there are many such equations, I have decided to ask a computer to help me. 
 Our conversation is presented 
 <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/bogdio.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
  
<br/> Highlights of the conversation: the <i>height </i>of a polynomial over Z in many variables is what you get when you make all of the coefficients positive and plug in x=2. For example, the height of
  
  </p><center> x<sup>3</sup> - y<sup>4</sup> + 5</center> 
  
  <br/> is
  
  <center>2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 5 = 8 + 16 + 5 = 29.</center>
  
  <p>
  
 Note that, for all h, there are only a finite number of polynomials in many vars over Z with height h. With the help of my friend the computer we have looked at the equations with h=0,1,2,... and so on, and tried to  determine which ones have any integer solutions. As expected, the first equations were trivial, but at about h=22 we have started to meet quite interesting equations for which we needed help from  Mathoverflow to solve. The project is currently at h=29, with only one remaining open equation of this height.  Read the conversation with the computer, or my mathoverflow question

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Sept. 6):</span></strong> Alright, as promised in this post, I’ve now matched a reader’s generosity by donating $2,000 to <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/avow?refcode=20210827NARAL">NARAL’s Avow fund</a>, which is fighting for abortion rights for women in Texas.  Woke people on Twitter, I invite you/youse/y’all to figure out some creative ways to condemn me for that.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Normally, early fall is the time when I’d use this blog to advertise positions in quantum information and theoretical computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, for prospective PhD students, postdocs, and faculty.  This year, you might say, anyone trying to recruit academics to Texas has a … <em>teensy bit</em> of a PR problem.  We already had PR problems, first over the “failure by design” of our electrical grid in the winter, second over Governor Abbott’s battle against local mask mandates, which has made Texas the second-most notoriously covid-friendly state after Florida.</p>



<p>Now, of course, Texas has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/texas-republicans-abortion-ban-backfire/619956/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;fbclid=IwAR2nCtXtpXUQQ5SBTHJLtd8Fkc8DFwuNCA1gdi3weUBlRqMrU8oKR5YUhjE">effectively outlawed abortion</a>—well, after the 6<sup>th</sup> week, which is before many women even realize they’re pregnant, and when the fetus is still the size of a grain of rice and looks like this.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/6week.jpg"/></figure></div>



<p>There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and—this is the “novel” part—there’s a bounty system, with $10,000+ fines for anyone who helps in any way with an abortion, payable to anyone who snitches on them.  Texas has openly defied <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and, for the first time in half a century, has gotten five Supreme Court justices (three appointed by Donald Trump) to go along with it.  <em>Roe v. Wade</em> is <em>de facto</em> no longer the law of the United States.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/when.jpg"/><em>With a 15-week cutoff, a right to abortion would still functionally exist.  At 6 weeks, it no longer functionally exists.</em></figure></div>



<p>And as for our recruiting at UT Austin … I fear we might as well now be trying to recruit colleagues to <a href="https://ku.edu.af/">Kabul University</a>.  It’s like, imagine some department chair at Kabul U., this week, trying to woo a star female physicist from abroad: “Oh, don’t worry … you’ll get used to wearing a burqa in no time!  And the ban on being alone with unrelated males is actually a <em>plus</em> for you; it just means you’ll be freed from onerous teaching and committee assignments.  Best yet, I’ve received personal assurances from our local Taliban commander that you almost certainly won’t be stoned for your licentiousness and whoredom.  Err … no offense, those were his words, not mine.”</p>



<p>For five years, my recruiting pitches for UT Austin have often involved stressing how Austin is a famously hip, tolerant, high-tech, educated city—a “blueberry in the tomato soup,” as Rick Perry put it—and how Texas itself might indeed turn blue any election cycle, given the explosive growth of its metropolitan population, and how the crazy state politics is unlikely to affect an Austinite’s personal life—at least, by noticeably more than the crazy <em>national</em> politics would affect their personal life.  I can no longer make this pitch with a straight face, or certainly not to women.</p>



<p>Like, I’m lucky that none of the women in my close family have ever needed an abortion, and that if they did, it would be easy for them to travel out of Texas to get one.  But having carried to term two healthy but <a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/pregnancy-complications/hyperemesis-gravidarum/">difficult</a> pregnancies, my wife Dana has often stressed to me how insane she finds the very idea of being <em>forced</em> by the government to go through with such an ordeal.  If women considering moving to Texas feel likewise, I can’t argue with them.  More than that: if Texas continues on what half the country sees as a journey back to the Middle Ages, with no opt-outs allowed for the residents of its left-leaning urban centers, Dana and I will not be able to remain here, and many of our friends won’t either.</p>



<p>So why aren’t we packing our bags already?  Partly because the current situation is inherently, obviously unstable.  <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961">SB8</a> can’t long remain the law of Texas while <em>Roe v. Wade</em> remains the law of the United States: one of them has to give.  I confess to being confused about why some abortion provider in Texas, with funding from national pro-choice groups, hasn’t <em>already</em> broken the law, welcomed a lawsuit, and forced the courts to rule explicitly on whether <em>Roe v. Wade</em> still stands and why or why not, rather than gutting a core part of American jurisprudence literally under cover of night.  I’m also confused about why some solid blue state, like Massachusetts or Hawaii, isn’t right now passing a law that would let any citizen sue any other for carrying a firearm—thereby forcing the five Supreme Hypocrites, in striking down that law, to admit that they <em>don’t</em> believe after all that state laws get to trample what the Supreme Court has held to be constitutional rights, merely by outsourcing the enforcement to random vigilantes.</p>



<p>My best guess is that Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett are already plotting to replace <em>Roe</em> by something much more restrictive, albeit probably not <em>quite</em> as shockingly draconian as Texas’s current ban on all abortions after six weeks, nor <em>quite</em> as breathtakingly insane as its bounty system for anyone who snitches about abortions.  My best guess is that they saw last week’s ruling as a way to test the waters and soften the country up: if you’re going to rescind what multiple generations of Americans have grown up seeing as a fundamental right, best not to do it too suddenly.  My best guess is that Democrats will respond by making abortion a central campaign issue in 2022 and 2024, and that given the public’s <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx">58%-32% support</a> for <em>Roe</em>, the Democrats will do pretty well with that—to the point where, like the proverbial dog that finally catches the car, Republicans might come to regret actually sinking their jaws into <em>Roe</em>, rather than just conspicuously chasing it down the street for half a century.</p>



<p>I have friends who are sincere, thoughtful pro-lifers.  I admire, if nothing else, their principled dedication to a moral stance that regularly gets condemned in academia.  But I’d also say to them: even if <em>you</em> think of abortion as murder, a solid majority of Americans don’t, and it’s hard to see a stable way of getting what you want that skips the step where you change those Americans’ minds.  Indeed, there’s long been a pro-choice critique of <em>Roe</em>, which says that, by short-circuiting the political loosening of abortion restrictions that was already underway in the 70s, <em>Roe</em> fueled the growth of the radical right that’s now all but destroyed America.  For <em>Roe</em> falsely convinced pro-lifers that all they needed to do was seize control of the Supreme Court, by any means fair or foul, when what they <em>really</em> needed to do was convince the public.</p>



<p>And, let’s be honest, convincing the public means convincing them to adopt a religious as opposed to secular framework for morality.  (And not just <em>any</em> religious framework: Orthodox Jews, for example, while not exactly fans of abortion, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_abortion">fine</a> with it under many circumstances.  In the Jewish view, so the old classic goes, the fetus attains full personhood only after graduating medical school.)  Of the Americans who want abortion to be illegal in all or most cases, <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/views-about-abortion/">94%</a> are at least “fairly certain” that God exists, and 79% are “absolutely certain”—consistent with my experience of having met highly intelligent and articulate pro-lifers, but never <em>secular</em> ones.  Modulo <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/">Lizardman’s Constant</a>, virtually <em>all</em> pro-lifers have metaphysical commitments about God and the soul that presumably do some of the heavy lifting for them.  If the case for a blanket abortion ban can be made in terms that are compelling to a secular, rationalist, tradeoffs-based morality, no one seems to have done it yet.</p>



<p>From the standpoint of secular moral philosophy, my own opinion is that no one has ever improved on the <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/society/on-abortion-carl-sagan-ann-druyan/">searching analysis</a> of the abortion question that Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan published in 1990.  After painstakingly laying out scientific facts, moral hypotheticals, and commonsense principles, Sagan and Druyan ultimately conclude that the right question to ask is when the fetus develops something that’s<em> recognizably a human brain, processing thoughts and emotions</em>.  In practice, that probably means drawing a hard line at the end of the second trimester.  Coincidentally, that’s almost exactly where <em>Roe v. Wade</em> drew the line, but Sagan and Druyan’s reasoning is completely different: they reject <em>Roe</em>‘s criterion of viability outside the womb, as both morally irrelevant and contingent on medical technology.</p>



<p>Reasonable people could disagree with the details of Sagan and Druyan’s analysis.  But <em>if</em> we agree that</p>



<p>(1) a sperm and unfertizilied egg have a “personhood” of 0,</p>



<p>(2) a newborn baby has a “personhood” of 1, and</p>



<p>(3) whatever “personhood” is, it’s somehow tied to the gradual growth of neurons and dendrites in the physical universe, rather than to a mystical and discontinuous moment of ensoulment,</p>



<p>… then by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem">intermediate value theorem</a>, for all p∈(0,1), there’s going to be <em>some</em> stage of fetal development where the fetus has a personhood of p.  Which means that we’re going to be drawing a debatable line, making a compromise, just like the majority did in <em>Roe</em>.  To me, one of the strangest aspects of the abortion debate is how both sides came to view <em>Roe v. Wade</em> as the “pro-choice maximalist position,” forgetting how it itself was an attempted compromise between conflicting moral intuitions.</p>



<p>Another strange aspect of the debate is how the most visible representatives of both sides seem to have given up, decades ago, on actually<em> arguing</em> for their positions.  Maybe it’s because people simply threw up their hands in futility; or because all the ground had been covered with nothing left to say; or because the debate was so obviously entangled with religion, and we have a polite norm of not arguing about religion; or because both positions hardened into tribal identity markers, to be displayed rather than defended.  Whatever the reason, though, by the mid-90s everything became about border skirmishes one or two steps removed from the actual question: e.g., if the woman is under 18, should her parents be notified?  should she be shown pictures of her fetus and given a 24-hour waiting period in hopes she’ll reconsider?  is this judicial nominee hiding his or her anti-abortion views?</p>



<p>Now that Texas and five Supreme Court justices have launched a frontal assault on <em>Roe</em>—it’s impossible to see it any other way—it seems to me that the long armistice is over.  The pro-life side will have to make the case for its moral framework to a populace that will suddenly be paying more attention—and that includes tens of millions of Americans who hadn’t even been born the last time mainstream figures debated abortion head-on.  The pro-choice side can then counterargue for <em>its</em> moral framework.  If any pro-lifers are raring for this fight, I’ll point out that one of the most dramatic demographic changes, since the last time abortion was a “hot war,” has been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_religion_in_the_United_States#Demographics">doubling</a> in the percentage of Americans who are atheist, agnostic, or religiously unaffiliated.</p>



<p>Let me close this post with two things.</p>



<p>Firstly, if anyone is still unclear where I stand: over the next week, I will match <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers’ donations to <a href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/">NARAL</a> up to $2,000.  If you’d like to participate, just leave a comment with the amount you donated.  If I’ve argued with certain strains of feminism on this blog, that gives me all the <em>more</em> obligation to support the strains that I regard as fundamentally correct.</p>



<p>Secondly, come join us at the University of Kab … I mean Texas at Austin!  For grad students, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate/prospective-students/apply">see here</a>; for faculty, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/faculty/recruiting">see here</a>; for postdocs, email me a CV and recent publications and have two reference letters sent to me by December 31st.  In the US, the east coast is now being ravaged beyond recognition by hurricanes and the west coast by wildfires.  Here in Texas, all <em>we</em> have to deal with is extreme heat, a failing electrical grid, runaway covid, and now the ban on abortion.  Hook ’em Hadamards!</p></div>

    <title>Harvard Shopping Period, Here We Go Again</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was looking at today's Harvard Crimson, and noted that <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/9/3/save-shopping-week-petition/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Harvard's shopping period looks ready to be vanished again</a>.  Shopping period is that wonderful Harvard tradition where students don't preregister for classes, but instead they choose classes after the first week, after having a chance to go to a lecture or two and see how they like it.  I encourage students -- and faculty -- to push back against efforts that restrict student flexibility in choosing their classes.  While administrators hate it, I still think it's better for students to avoid strong forms of preregistration.   </p><p>In fact, I realized I've been fighting this fight for quite a while -- here's <a href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2008/02/more-on-shopping-period.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">something I wrote about when the administration under Larry Summers tried to get rid of it</a>, from this blog back in 2008, and here's a <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/10/17/preregistration-plan-slated-for-next-fall/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Crimson article from 2002</a>, where I spoke out against the plan for moving to preregistration that the blog post refers to. </p><p>More recently, in 2018-2019, I found myself on the <a href="https://courseregistration.fas.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Course Registration Committee"</a>, a committee that initially seemed similarly designed to find a way to move Harvard from shopping period to preregistration.  But a few of us on the committee made convincing arguments that shopping period had many benefits, and the disappearance of shopping period seemed at least somewhat further delayed, while a better solution was found. </p><p>Then the pandemic.  Shopping period seemed impossible in the chaos, and things were more ad hoc (although there was, last year, a push for "class previews" of some sort before the beginning of classes).  This seems to give an opening to remove shopping period again.   </p><p>I'm not saying there aren't ways to change the system to make it better.  I'm not blind to the issues of shopping period -- not having a determined class size before classes begin is problematic for some classes.  I believe the committee people who have continued to look at the issue are trying to make things better going forward.  But the push always seems to be to make a system which is easier for administrators, and somehow correspondingly that is worse for the students.  Students should have the flexibility to see classes and teachers before committing, which to me means either a shopping period, or a structure that allows them to easily change classes for the first couple of weeks with negligible overhead.  I suppose one could design an add/drop system with the flexibility I'd have in mind, but it never seems to work that way in practice -- students end up needing signatures and approvals of various flavors, because (I think) it's in the best interest of administrators to make it hard for students to change classes once classes begin.  (Having 60 people sign up for a class but then having 30 people leave in the first week is possibly worse than the shopping period approach of not having sign-ups before the class at all, but it's a lot easier to disincentivize students from switching out (or in) with a preregistration system, so that problem disappears, at the cost of student flexibility.)  </p><p>As an example of a "non-shopping" issue I've seen this semester, first-year students at Harvard first semester are "limited" to four classes.  (There may be a way to get an exception to this, but I understand it would be rare exception.)  So this semester, with no shopping period, first years have to choose their 4 classes -- without seeing them -- and then manage a confusing add/drop process if they don't like them.  The older students generally know how to play the game -- they sign up for 5 or even 6 classes (if they can) and drop the ones they don't like, because dropping is generally easier than adding.  But first years don't have that flexibility because the 4-course rule is enforced at signup.  (I advise some first year students, and this problem came up.)  </p><p>I'm sure many non-Harvard people reading this think the shopping period system sounds crazy, and maybe a few think Harvard students are bizarrely spoiled.  Perhaps they're right.  But I found as a student it was wonderful, and shaped my future in powerful ways by encouraging me to explore.  You walk into a class you thought you should take, and find the professor puts you to sleep;  or you get dragged to a class by a friend, and find an inspiring subject you had no idea you would like.  I believe my college experience would have been lessened significantly without shopping period.  </p><p>As a faculty member, shopping period is clearly a pain, but I think a manageable one.   Back in 2002-2003, the faculty pushed back against preregistration (<a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/3/12/faculty-blasts-preregistration-several-professors-fiercely/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">see this old Crimson article</a>), but it seems opinions have shifted over time;  many faculty seemed to have moved to thinking it's not worth it, which is probably in their own self-interest.  Having been on both sides, I'm still strongly in favor of shopping period.  I suppose if I ever get into administration I may see things differently.  </p><p>I hope there are (younger) defenders out there, in the students and faculty, to push to make sure any changes still favor student choice over administrative convenience, and lead to the best outcomes for students.  </p></div>

    <title>TR21-128 |  On the Complexity of Computing Markov Perfect Equilibrium in General-Sum Stochastic Games | 

	Xiaotie Deng, 

	Yuhao Li, 

	David Mguni, 

	Jun Wang, 

	Yaodong Yang</title>
    <summary>Similar to the role of Markov decision processes in reinforcement learning, Markov Games (also called Stochastic Games)lay down the foundation for the study of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and sequential agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce the solution concept, approximate Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE), to finite-state Stochastic Games repeated in the infinite horizon, and prove its $\mathbf{PPAD}$-completeness in computational complexity. Technically, we adopt a function with a polynomially bounded description in the strategy space to convert the MPE computation to a fixed-point problem, even though the stochastic game may demand an exponential number of pure strategies, in the number of states, for each agent. The completeness result follows the reduction of the fixed-point problem to \textsc{End of the Line}.


Past works on the stochastic games are mostly zero-sum MARL algorithms. A $P^{PPAD}$ algorithm for the general sum stochastic games in the finite horizon can be derived to establish an approximation algorithm for the general-sum stochastic games. That implies an approximate NE solution to the infinite-horizon setting. Such a possible extension suffers from three weaknesses: 1. the solution is time-dependent and hence not a perfect equilibrium; 2. the time-dependent solution suffers a weakness of noncredible threats; 3. the time complexity is not tight (lower bound $\mathbf{PPAD}$ and upper bound $P^{PPAD}$). Our result beats such a solution in all those three properties.</summary>

    <title>The hierarchy and GapP</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There is a great but little-known theorem from the early 90's by Seinosuke Toda and Mitsunori Ogihara (buried as Lemma 2.3 in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0221023">their paper</a>) that shows the polynomial-time hierarchy is randomly low for Gap-P.</p><p>Let M be a non-deterministic polynomial-time machine. #M(x) is the number of accepting paths of M on x. #P is the set of functions f such that f(x) = #M(x) for an NP machine M. </p><p>Gap-M(x) is the difference between the number of accepting and rejecting paths. Unlike #M(x), Gap-M(x) could be negative. Gap-P is the set of functions such that f(x)=Gap-M(x) for an NP machine M. Equivalently Gap-P is the difference of two #P functions. Gap-P <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0000(05)80024-8">inherits all the nice closure properties of #P</a> while being closed under negation and subtraction.</p><p><b>Theorem </b>(Toda-Ogihara): Let q be a polynomial and f be a function in Gap-P<sup>PH</sup>.

    <title>Congratulations, Dr. Maxwell!</title>
    <summary>I took part today in the successful dissertation defense of Will Maxwell, a student of Amir Nayyeri and Cora Borradaile at Oregon State University. Will has also visited me at UC Irvine, and I’ve worked with him on two papers, on low-stretch spanning trees and Hanoi graph treewidth. But his dissertation has a different focus, his work on generalizations of graph algorithms to higher-dimensional topological spaces.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I took part today in the successful dissertation defense of Will Maxwell, a student of Amir Nayyeri and Cora Borradaile at Oregon State University. Will has also visited me at UC Irvine, and I’ve worked with him on two papers, on <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/04/19/stretch-average-stretch.html">low-stretch spanning trees</a> and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/05/03/hanoi-vs-sierpinski.html">Hanoi graph treewidth</a>. But his dissertation has a different focus, his work on generalizations of graph algorithms to higher-dimensional topological spaces.</p>

<p>The main idea can be seen in Will’s paper “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2020.21">Minimum bounded chains and minimum homologous chains in embedded simplicial complexes</a>” (with Cora and Amir, at the 2020 Symposium on Computational Geometry), on topological generalizations of unweighted shortest paths in graphs. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_simplicial_complex">abstract simplicial complex</a> is just a family of finite sets closed under taking subsets, where we think of each set of \(d+1\) elements as defining a \(d\)-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex">simplex</a>. From this point of view, an undirected graph is just a 1-dimensional simplicial complex, with 1-element subsets for its vertices and 2-element subsets for its edges. A set of \(d\)-dimensional simplices is called a \(d\)-chain (in mod-2 homology), and its boundary is a chain one dimension lower. For instance, a path in a graph has its two endpoints as its boundary, and the shortest path problem asks for the minimum-cardinality 1-chain having two given points as its boundary. More generally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_inspection_problem">T-join problem</a> asks for a 1-chain having any given 0-chain as its boundary.</p>

<p>The SoCG paper generalizes this problem in two ways. You can either ask for the minimum <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-chain</span> with a given <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\((k-1)\)-chain</span> as boundary (the “minimum bounded chain” of the first part of the title), or you can ask for the minimum <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-chain</span> that shares a boundary with a given <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-chain</span> and belongs to the same homology class (the second part of the title). Both are \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete and hard to approximate, even for \(k\)-dimensional complexes that are embedded into \((k+1)\)-dimensional space (analogous to planar graphs). However, they can be approximated to within a \(\sqrt{\log n}\) approximation ratio, and solved exactly in fixed-parameter tractable time. Both the positive and negative results involve translations to and from minimum cut completion, the problem of finding a cut that is as close as possible to a given edge set, on a dual graph of the embedding of the complex.</p>

<p>This use of the dual prevents these algorithms from applying to abstract complexes that are not embedded. And testing whether a complex can be embedded into a space of one higher dimension is itself a hard problem: \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard for 2-complexes and undecidable for sufficiently higher dimensions. But it turns out that some abstract complexes can have duals even when they cannot be embedded: as Will’s dissertation observes, a dual graph exists whenever homology defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_matroid">cographic matroid</a> on the \(k\)-simplices, a condition that generalizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Lane%27s_planarity_criterion">Mac Lane’s planarity criterion</a> and can be tested in polynomial time.</p>

<p>A newer paper, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2021.69">Generalized max-flows and min-cuts in simplicial complexes</a>” (with Amir), appears at this year’s European Symposium on Algorithms. It performs a similar translation from the maximum flow and minimum cut problems on graphs to analogous problems on simplicial complexes. The generalized problems are defined in a way allowing them to be solved by linear programs, with the flow LP dual to the cut LP, so a version of the max flow min cut theorem applies automatically to this generalization. However, unlike graph max flow and min cut problems, the solutions are not always integral, and finding an optimal integral solution is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard.</p>

<p>The SoCG 2020 and ESA 2021 papers form two chapters in the dissertation, with a final chapter on a third direction of generalization that appears not to be public yet. After finalizing his dissertation, Will will be heading to Washington, DC to work as a Department of Defense researcher on (non-classified) applications of topological computation in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Will!</p>

    <title>The Third Annual “Why am I in Italy and you are not?” post</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I moved back to Italy exactly two years ago.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I moved back to Italy exactly two years ago. I was looking for some change and for new challenges and, man, talk about being careful what you wish for!</p>



<p>Last year was characterized by a sudden acceleration of Bocconi’s plans to develop a computer science group. From planning for a slow growth of a couple of people a year until, in 5-7 years, we could have the basis to create a new department, it was decided that a new computer science department would start operating next year — perhaps as soon as February 2022, but definitely, or at least to the extent that one can make definite plans in these crazy times, by September 2022.</p>



<p>Consequently, we went on a hiring spree that was surprisingly successful. Five computer scientists and four statistical physicists have accepted our offers and are coming between now and next summer. In computer science, Andrea Celli (who won the NeurIPS best paper award last year) and Marek Elias started today. Andrea, who is coming from Facebook London, works in algorithmic game theory, and Marek, who is coming TU Eindhoven, works in optimization. Within the next couple of weeks, or as soon as his visa issues are sorted out, Alon Rosen will join us from IDC Herzliya as a full professor. Readers of <em>in theory</em> may know Alon from his work on lattice-based cryptography, or his work on zero-knowledge, or perhaps his work on the cryptographic hardness of finding Nash equilibria. Two other computer science tenured faculty members are going to come, respectively, in February and September 2022, but I am not sure if their moves are public yet.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I have been under-spending my ERC grant, but perhaps this is going to change and some of my readers will help me out. </p>



<p>If you are interested in coming to Milan for a post-doc, do get in touch with me. A call will be out in a month or so.</p>



<p>After twenty years in Northern California, I am still readjusting to seasonal weather. September is among Milan’s best months: the oppressive heat of the summer gives way to comfortable days and cool nights, but the days are still bright and sunny. Currently, there is no quarantine requirement or other travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international travellers. If you want to visit, this might be your best chance until Spring Break (last year we had a semi-lockdown from late October until after New Year, which might very well happen again; January and February are not Milan’s best months; March features spectacular cherry blossoms, and it is again an ok time to visit).</p></div>

    <title>Since we will soon be back in the classroom, how was Zoom? Anything you want to maintain?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>UMCP will have all classes on campus this Fall. There is a Mask Mandate. All students and faculty have to get vaccinated unless they have a health or religious exception. 92% are vaccinated, which I interpret as people are NOT abusing the exceptions (though I still wish it was higher, and it may go higher). (ADED LATER- right after I posted this I got an email saying that UMCP is now up to 97%).  Those NOT vaccinated have to get tested - I think twice a week. </p><p>Now that we are back in the live-classroom, here are some thoughts about teaching on zoom. </p><p>I taught on zoom:</p><p>Spring 2020: The last half of both Ramsey Theory and Automata Theory(Reg, CFG,P,NP,Dec,Undec)</p><p>Fall 2021:  Cryptography </p><p>Spring 2021: Honors Discrete Math and Automata theory</p><p><br/></p><p>a) I taught in the usual time slot but I recorded the lecture so those who could not make it (more common during the pandemic) could still see it. Attendance was low, verbal interaction was low, but chat-interaction was very good. Looking into if we can do a chat in an in-person class. I was recording lectures before the pandemic and will keep doing so.</p><p>b) My exams were open-notes, open-book, open-web. That cuts down on ways they can cheat, though they can still phone-a-friend. Or ask their cat.  Unusual-but-correct answers can happen, as I discussed in <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/07/a-table-for-matrix-mortality-what-i.html#comment-form">this blog</a>.</p><p>c) I gave my muffin talk a few times on zoom. In person it goes very well as my enthusiasm is contagious.  On Zoom that affect is dampened so the audience was more sedate.  I gave it as a special lecture to High School students and to my REU students. Note that it was NOT part of a class so the usual motivation to learn it to do the HW is gone. Hence its more important they be excited about it. </p><p>d) In person I carefully make sure that I wear a funny T-shirt every day, and its a diff one, and usually a math one to (if possible) match the topic. On Zoom I did not bother, though I sometimes used wallpaper to match the topic. </p><p>e) I had to make up slides for Aut theory and for some of Discrete Math. For Crypto I already had slides. I like the slides I made up and will use them in the future. But see next point. </p><p>f) In Discrete Math I went  faster than usual- perhaps because its on slides, perhaps because there were less questions since it was on zoom, perhaps because Emily my  TA was so awesome that they had less questions. (She is very interested in education and did a guest post about the pandemic and education <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/04/a-guest-blog-on-pandemics-affect-on.html">here</a>.) As a result I actually learned and presented the proofs that (1) the e is irrational (my slides are <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/COURSES/250/S21/slides/etalk.pdf">here</a>) and that Liouville numbers are transcendental (my slides are <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/COURSES/250/S21/slides/ltalk.pdf">here</a>). While I enjoyed learning those theorems and I think the students understood them on some level, I will slow down next time.</p><p>g) Ramsey Theory: It is impossible to teach the Poly VDW theorem on slides, so I had to omit that part of the course. </p><p>h) Bottom Line: Did the students learn more? less? the same? My impression is that the students learned about the same, but really really didn't like it. And thats legit- that is NOT just students complaining. </p></div>

<p><strong>[Warning: spoilers follow!]</strong></p>



<p>Last week Dana and I watched the full first season of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81206259"><em>The Chair</em></a>, the Netflix drama that stars Sandra Oh as Ji-Yoon Kim, incoming chairwoman of the English department at the fictional Pembroke University.  As the rave reviews promised, I found the show to be brilliantly written and acted.  At times, <em>The Chair</em> made me think about that <em>other</em> academia-centered sitcom, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>, which I freely confess I also enjoyed.  But <em>The Chair</em> is much more highbrow (and more political), it’s about the humanities rather than STEM, and it’s mostly about academics who are older than the ones in <em>Big Bang</em>, both biologically and professionally.</p>



<p>I wouldn’t call <em>The Chair</em> “realistic”: the sets, stuffed with imposing bookshelves, paintings of great scholars, etc., look like how a TV producer might imagine university buildings, rather than the relatively humdrum reality.  But in less than three hours, the show tackles a staggering number of issues that will be recognizable and relevant to anyone in academia: cratering enrollments, a narrow-minded cost-cutting dean, a lack of free time and a desperate search for childcare, a tenure case that turns into a retention case, a woke scandal (about which more later), a faculty revolt against Ji-Yoon culminating in a vote of no confidence, and much more.  There’s also an elaborate side plot involving the actor (and real-life former literary scholar) David Duchovny, who portrays himself, being invited to lecture at Pembroke, which is <em>not</em> the sort of thing most academics have experience with, but which I suppose many viewers will enjoy.</p>



<p>The show is written at a high enough level that its stumbles are those of a daring acrobat.  In the main narrative arc of the first season, the writers set themselves an absurdly ambitious (and, I think, laudable) goal: namely, to dramatize a conflict between a free-spirited professor, and woke students trying to cancel that professor for a classroom “microaggression,” in a way that fully empathizes with both sides.  I don’t know if the show actually succeeds at this, but that’s partly because I don’t know if it’s <em>possible</em> to succeed.</p>



<p>To start with some background: in Pembroke’s English department, there are old, traditionalist white males, who give lectures extolling the Great Men of Literature, and who apparently still wield considerable power.  Meanwhile, critical theorists are presented as young, exciting upstarts bravely challenging the status quo.  People with recent experience of English departments should correct me if I’m wrong, but my sense is that this is pretty anachronistic—i.e., that the last powerful traditionalists in humanities departments were routed by the 80s or 90s at the latest, so that students in the Twitter-and-smartphone era (when <em>The Chair</em> is set) would be about as likely to encounter them as they would professors sitting around in charcoal suits smoking pipes.</p>



<p>There were also some of what felt to me like … intersectional oversights?  Ji-Yoon, being Korean-American, is repeatedly approached by Black female students and faculty as a “fellow woman of color,” with whom they can commiserate about the entrenched power of the department’s white males.  The show never examines how woke discourse has increasingly reclassified Asian-Americans as “white-adjacent”—as, for example, in the battles over gifted and magnet programs or admissions to Harvard.  Likewise, woke students are shown standing arm-in-arm with Pembroke’s Jewish community, to denounce (what we in the audience know to be) a phantom antisemitic incident.  Left unexplored is how, in the modern woke hierarchy, Jews have become just another kind of privileged white person (worse, of course, if they have ties to Israel).</p>



<p>This brings me to the first season’s central conflict, which revolves around Bill Dobson, a handsome middle-aged white male professor who’s revered as the department’s greatest genius on the basis of his earlier work, but who, after the death of his wife, is now washed-up, flippant, and frequently drunk or high.  In one class session, while lecturing about intellectuals who found the strength to resist fascism despite their own nihilistic impulses, Bill makes a Nazi salute and shouts “Heil Hitler!,” as a theatrical reminder to the students about the enormity of what those intellectuals were fighting.  Alas, a woke student captures that moment on their smartphone camera and shares it on social media.  The clip of Bill making the Heil salute goes viral, shorn of all exculpatory context.  Soon, crowds of students are waving placards and screaming “No Nazis at Pembroke!” outside the English building.  In a desperate effort to make his PR crisis go away, the dean initiates termination proceedings against Bill—the principles of academic freedom and even Bill’s tenure be damned.  Ji-Yoon, of course, as Bill’s chair, is caught smack in the middle of this.  It’s complicated even further by Ji-Yoon’s and Bill’s romantic feelings for each other, and further still by Bill’s role as the babysitter of Ji-Yoon’s adopted daughter.</p>



<p>As all of this unfolds, the show seems immensely interested in pinning the blame on Bill’s “tragic flaws,” minor though they seemed to me—mostly just pride and unseriousness.  (E.g., trying to lampoon the absurd charge of Nazism, Bill offhandedly mentions that he’s always wanted to visit Hitler’s mountain retreat, and on another occasion belts out “Springtime for Hitler” from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Producers_(1967_film)">The Producers</a></em>.)  The woke students, by contrast, are portrayed as earnest, understandably upset, and legitimately terrified about hate crimes on campus.  If they, too, have opportunistic motives to attack Bill, the show never examines them.</p>



<p>In one sentence, then, here’s my beef with <em>The Chair</em>: its script portrays a mob, step by step, destroying an innocent man’s life over nothing, and yet it wants me to feel the mob’s pain, and be disappointed in its victim for mulishly insisting on his innocence (even though he <em>is</em>, in fact, innocent).</p>



<p>With real-life woke controversies, there often lingers the question of whether the accused <em>might really be</em> a racist, fascist, sexual predator, or whatever else, adequate proof or no.  What’s different here is that we <em>know</em> that Bill Dobson is none of those things, we <em>know</em> he’s decent to his core, because the writers have painstakingly shown us that.  And yet, in a weird narrative pretzel, we’re nevertheless supposed to be mad at him, and to sympathize with the campaign to cancel him.</p>



<p>A casual perusal of other reviews of <em>The Chair</em> told me that these reactions were far from universal.  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+chair+reviews&amp;oq=the+chair+reviews&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i67i131i433j0i131i433i512l2j0i512l7.2011j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Here</a>, for example, is what one viewer wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I can appreciate that this is probably close to the reality that most women/of color experience in higher education. I enjoyed watching the scenes with Joan and Yaz [two female professors] the most but the rest was a drag. I couldn’t understand why Ji-Yoon was into Bill, or why <em>anyone</em> was into Bill. I found him to be an insufferable man-baby. That is such a turn off. So she’d put him straight but then still be pining for him. He wreaked [sic] of entitled, white male, tenured privilege and never showed any contrition for his actions or even awareness of their impact. i’m so tired of the “brilliant <strong>_</strong>” being used to justify coddling someone. And for the rest of the stuffy old patriarchal farts– boot them out! They weren’t good teachers and weren’t able to meet the needs of today’s students.</p></blockquote>



<p>I asked myself: <em>did this person watch the same show?</em>  It’s like, the script couldn’t possibly have been clearer about Bill’s character, the fact that he’s the polar opposite of the woke students’ mental construct.   And yet, if the show had drawn an unambiguous corollary from Bill’s goodness—namely, that the effort to cancel him is a moral travesty—then <em>The Chair</em> itself might have been denounced as conservative (or at least classical liberal) propaganda, and those who’d otherwise form its core viewership wouldn’t have watched.</p>



<p>So, if I were a literary critic like the ones on the show, I might argue that <em>The Chair</em> begs for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_and_the_Art_of_Writing">Straussian</a> interpretation.  Sure, there’s an “overt” reading, wherein Bill Dobson is done in by his own hubris, or wherein it’s a comedy of errors with no one to blame.  But then there’s also an “esoteric” reading, wherein Bill is the victim of an extremely specific modern-day collective insanity, one that future generations might look back on with little more ambivalence than we look back on McCarthyism.  The writers of <em>The Chair</em> might <em>hint</em> at this latter reading, through their sympathetic portrayal of Bill and the obviousness of the injustice done to him, but they can never make it too explicit, because of the political and cultural constraints under which they themselves operate.</p>



<p>Under this theory, it presumably falls to those slightly outside the world portrayed in <em>The Chair</em>—like, let’s imagine, a theoretical computer science blogger who himself was denounced for woke heresies to the point where he has little more to lose in that direction—to make the esoteric reading explicit.  Unless and until, of course, a second season comes along to undermine that reading entirely.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-127 |  Small Circuits Imply Efficient Arthur-Merlin Protocols | 

	Michael Ezra,

    <summary>The inner product function $\langle x,y \rangle = \sum_i x_i y_i \bmod 2$ can be easily computed by a (linear-size) ${AC}^0(\oplus)$ circuit: that is, a constant depth circuit with AND, OR and parity (XOR) gates. But what if we impose the restriction that the parity gates can only be on the bottom most layer (closest to the input)? Namely, can the inner product function be computed by an ${AC}^0$ circuit composed with a single layer of parity gates? This seemingly simple question is an important open question at the frontier of circuit lower bound research.
    
    In this work, we focus on a minimalistic version of the above question. Namely, whether the inner product function cannot be \emph{approximated} by a small $DNF$ augmented with a single layer of parity gates. Our main result shows that the existence of such a circuit would have unexpected implications for interactive proofs, or more specifically, for interactive variants of the Data Streaming and Communication Complexity models. In particular, we show that the existence of such a small (i.e., polynomial-size) circuit yields:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item An $O(d)$-message protocol in the Arthur-Merlin Data Streaming model for every $n$-variate, degree $d$ polynomial (over $\mathbb{GF}(2)$), using only $\widetilde{O}\left(d\right)\cdot\log(n)$ communication and space complexity. In particular, this gives an AM$[2]$ Data Streaming protocol for a variant of the well-studied triangle counting problem, with poly-logarithmic communication and space complexities.
       
        \item A $2$-message communication complexity protocol for any sparse (or low degree) polynomial, and for any function computable by an ${AC}^0(\oplus)$ circuit. Specifically, for the latter, we obtain a protocol with communication complexity that is poly-logarithmic in the size of the ${AC}^0(\oplus)$ circuit.
    \end{enumerate}</summary>
