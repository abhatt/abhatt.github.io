<h2>1. Generalization with weight decay regularization</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start our journey with the comfortable case where the training objective includes an explicit <em>weight decay</em> regularization (i.e. \(\ell_2\)-regularization on the parameters). Using the notations of the previous post, this consists in the following objective function on the space of probability measures on \(\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\):  $$ \underbrace{R\Big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Phi(w)d\mu(w)\Big)}_{\text{Data fitting term}} + \underbrace{\frac{\lambda}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Vert w \Vert^2_2d\mu(w)}_{\text{Regularization}} \tag{1}$$ where \(R\) is the loss and \(\lambda&gt;0\) is the regularization strength. Remember that a  neural network of finite width with \(m\) neurons is recovered with an empirical measure \(\mu = \frac1m \sum_{j=1}^m\delta_{w_j}\), in which case this regularization is proportional to the sum of the squares of all the parameters \(\frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^m \Vert w_j\Vert^2_2\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Variation norm.</strong> In the previous post, we have seen that the Wasserstein gradient flow of this objective function — an idealization of the gradient descent training dynamics in the large width limit — converges to a global minimizer \(\mu^*\) when initialized properly. An example of an admissible initialization is the hidden weights \(b_j\) distributed according to the uniform distribution \(\tau\) on the unit sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\subset \mathbb{R}^d\) and the output weights \(a_j\) uniform in \(\{-1,1\}\). What does this minimizer look like in predictor space when the objective function is as in Eq. (1) ? </p>



<p class="justify-text">To answer this question, we define for a predictor \(h:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}\), the quantity $$ \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} := \min_{\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})} \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Vert w\Vert^2_2 d\mu(w) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad h = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Phi(w)d\mu(w).\tag{2} $$ As the notation suggests, \(\Vert \cdot \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1}\) is a norm in the space of predictors. It is known as the <em>variation norm</em> [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cas.cz/~vera/publications/journals/I3Edin.pdf">3</a>]. We call \(\mathcal{F}_1\) the space of functions with finite norm, which is a Banach space. By construction, the learnt predictor \(h^* = \int \Phi(w)d\mu^*(w)\) is a minimizer of the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-regularized regression: $$ \min_{h:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}} R(h) + \lambda \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \tag{3}.$$ This \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-norm regularization shares similarity with \(\ell_1\) regularization [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6614.pdf">4</a>]. To see this, observe that the “magnitude” \(\vert a\vert \Vert b\Vert_2\) of a relu function \(x\mapsto a(b^\top x)_+\) with parameter \(w=(a,b)\) equals \(\Vert w\Vert^2_2/2\) if \(\vert a\vert = \Vert b\Vert_2\) and is smaller otherwise. Thus parameterizing the relus by their direction \(\theta = b/\Vert b\Vert_2\) and optimizing over their signed magnitude \(r(\theta) = a\Vert b\Vert_2\)  we have $$ \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} = \inf_{r:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to \mathbb{R}} \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} \vert r(\theta)\vert d\tau(\theta) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad h(x) = \int _{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} r(\theta) (\theta^\top x)_+ d\tau(\theta).\tag{4}$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Conjugate RKHS norm.</strong> The regression in the space \(\mathcal{F}_1\) is best understood when compared with the regression obtained by only training the output weights. We consider the same training dynamics with weight decay except that we fix the hidden weights to their initial value, where they are distributed according to the uniform distribution \(\tau\) on the sphere. In that case, the Wasserstein gradient flow also converges to the solution of a regularized regression as in Eq. (3) — this is in fact a convex problem —  but the regularizing norm is different and now defined as $$ \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_2}^2 := \min_{r:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to \mathbb{R}} \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} \vert r(\theta)\vert^2 d\tau(\theta) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad h(x) = \int _{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} r(\theta) (\theta^\top x)_+ d\tau(\theta).$$ We call \(\mathcal{F}_2\) the set of functions with finite norm. It can be shown to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space">Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</a> (RKHS), with kernel  $$ K(x,x’) = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (\theta^\top x)_+ (\theta^\top x’)_+ d\tau(\theta),$$ which has a closed form expression [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3628-kernel-methods-for-deep-learning.pdf">5</a>]. In this context, taking a finite width neural network corresponds to a random feature approximation of the kernel [<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.446.9306&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">6</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines">7</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Let us informally compare the properties of these spaces \(\mathcal{F}_1\) and \(\mathcal{F}_2\) (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8690">2</a>] for details):</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Approximation power.</strong> In high dimension, only very smooth functions have small \(\mathcal{F}_2\)-norm (in rough terms, the \(\lceil (d+3)/2\rceil\) first derivatives should be small). In contrast, there exists non-smooth functions with small \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-norm, an example being the relu function \(x\mapsto (\theta^\top x)_+\). Remarkably, if we define \(f(x)=g(Ux)\) where \(U\) is an orthogonal projection then \(\Vert f\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \leq  \Vert g\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_2}\). This shows in particular that \(\mathcal{F}_1\) contains \(\mathcal{F}_2\) and that \(\mathcal{F}_1\) is <em>adaptive</em> to lower dimensional structures.</li><li><strong>Statistical complexity.</strong> It could be feared that the good approximation properties of \(\mathcal{F}_1\) come at the price of being “too large” as a hypothesis space, making it difficult to estimate a predictor in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) from few samples. But, as measured by their Rademacher complexities, the unit ball of \(\mathcal{F}_1\) is only \(O(\sqrt{d})\) larger than that of \(\mathcal{F}_2\). By going from \(\mathcal{F}_2\) to \(\mathcal{F}_1\), we thus add some nicely structured predictors to our hypothesis space, but not too much garbage that could fit unstructured noise.</li><li><strong>Generalization guarantees.</strong> By combining the two previous points, it is possible to prove that supervised learning in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) breaks the curse of dimensionality when the output depends on a lower dimensional projection of the input: the required number of training samples only depends mildly on the dimension \(d\).</li><li><strong>Optimization guarantees.</strong> However \(\mathcal{F}_1\) has a strong drawback : there is no known algorithm that solves the problem of Eq. (3) in polynomial time. On practical problems, gradient descent seems to behave well, but in general only qualitative results such as presented in the previous post are known. In contrast, various provably efficient algorithms can solve regression in \(\mathcal{F}_2\), which is a classical kernel ridge regression problem [Chap. 14.4.3, <a href="https://doc.lagout.org/science/Artificial%20Intelligence/Machine%20learning/Machine%20Learning_%20A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective%20%5BMurphy%202012-08-24%5D.pdf">8</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In the plot below, we compare the predictor learnt by gradient descent for a 2-D regression with the square loss and weight decay, after training (a) both layers — which is regression in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) — or (b) just the output layer — which is regression in \(\mathcal{F}_2\). This already illustrates some distinctive features of both spaces, although the differences become more stringent in higher dimensions. In particular, observe that in (a) the predictor is the combination of few relu functions, which illustrates  the sparsifying effect of the \(L^1\)-norm in Eq. (4). To simplify notations, we do not include a bias/intercept in the formulas but our numerical experiments include it, so in this plot the input is of the form \(x=(x_1,x_2,1)\) and \(d=3\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4231" height="293" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/regularized-2.png" width="564"/>Predictor learnt by the gradient flow on the square loss with weight decay, when training (a) both layers (b) only the output layer.

<p class="justify-text">The qualitative picture is quite clear so far, but something is a bit unsettling: weight decay is often not needed to obtain a good performance in practice. Our line of reasoning however completely falls apart without such a regularization: if the objective function depends on the predictor only via its values on the training set, being a minimizer does not guarantee anything about generalization outside of the training set (remember that wide relu neural networks are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem">universal approximators</a>). Why does it still work in the unregularized case? There must be something in the algorithm…</p>



<h2>2. Implicit bias: linear classification</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This something is called the <em>implicit bias</em> : when there are several minimizers, the optimization algorithm makes a specific choice. In the unregularized case, the “quality” of this choice is a crucial property of an algorithm; much more crucial than, say, its convergence speed on the training objective. To gradually build our intuition of the implicit bias of gradient flows, let us put neural networks aside for a moment and consider, following Soudry, Hoffer, Nacson, Gunasekar and Srebro [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume19/18-188/18-188.pdf">9</a>], a linear classification task.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Gradient flow of the smooth-margin.</strong> Let \((x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n\) be a training set of \(n\) pairs of inputs \(x_i\in \mathbb{R}^d\) and outputs \(y_i\in \{-1,1\}\) and let us choose the exponential loss. The analysis that follows also apply to the logistic loss (which is the same as the cross-entropy loss after a sigmoid non-linearity) because only the “tail” of the loss matters, but it is more straightforward with the exponential loss. In order to give a natural “scale” to the problem, we  renormalize the empirical risk by taking minus its logarithm and consider the concave objective $$ F_\beta(a) = -\frac{1}{\beta}\log\Big( \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n \exp(-\beta y_i \ x_i^\top a) \Big).\tag{5}$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Here \(\beta&gt;0\) is a parameter that will be useful in a moment. For now, we take \(\beta=1\) and we note \(F(a)=F_1(a)\).  In this context, the <em>margin</em> of a vector \(a\in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the quantity \(\min_{i} y_i\ x_i^\top a\) which quantifies how far this linear predictor is from making a wrong prediction on the training set.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4274" height="386" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/max_margin-4.png" width="453"/>The margin of the linear predictor \(x \mapsto a^\top x\) with parameters \(a \in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}\) is the smallest distance of a training point to the decision boundary. We show here the max-margin predictor.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Obtained via simple manipulations, the inequalities  $$ \min_i y_i\ x_i^\top a \leq F_\beta(a) \leq \min_i y_i\ x_i^\top a +\frac{\log(n)}{\beta}, \tag{6}$$ suggest to call \(F_\beta\) the <em>smooth-margin</em> because, well, it is smooth and converges to the margin \(F_\infty(a) := \min_i y_i x_i^\top a\) as \(\beta\to \infty\). Let us look at the gradient flow in the ascent direction that maximizes the smooth-margin: $$ a'(t) = \nabla F(a(t))$$ initialized with \(a(0)=0\) (here the initialization does not matter so much). The path followed by this gradient flow is exactly the same as the gradient flow on the empirical risk: taking the logarithm only changes the time parameterization or, in practice, the step-size.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence to the max-margin.</strong> Assume that the data set is linearly separable, which means that the \(\ell_2\)-max-margin $$ \gamma := \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2 \leq 1} \min_i y_i x_i^\top a$$ is positive. In this case \(F\) is unbounded (indeed \(\lim_{\alpha \to \infty} F(\alpha a) =\infty\) whenever \(a\)  has a positive margin) and thus \(a(t)\) diverges. This is not an issue as such, since for classification, only the sign of the prediction matters.  This just means that the relevant question is not “where does \(a(t)\) converge?” but rather “towards which direction does it diverge?”. In other words, we are interested in the limit of \(\bar a(t):= a(t)/\Vert a(t)\Vert_2\) (in convex analysis, this is called the <em>cosmic limit</em> of \(a(t)\) [Chap. 3, <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540627722">10</a>], isn’t it beautiful ?).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The argument that follows is adapted from [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08246.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07300.pdf">12</a>] and can be traced back to [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/telgarsky13-supp.pdf">13</a>] for coordinate ascent. It can be shown by looking at the structure of the gradient (see the end of the blog post) that \(\Vert \nabla F(a)\Vert_2\geq \gamma\) for all \(a\in \mathbb{R}^d\). By the inequality of Eq. (6) and the gradient flow property \(\frac{d}{dt}F(a(t))=\Vert \nabla F(a(t))\Vert_2^2\), it follows $$\begin{aligned}\min_i y_i x_i^\top a(t) \geq F(a(t)) \  – \log(n) \geq \gamma \int_0^t \Vert \nabla F(a(s))\Vert_2ds -\log (n).\end{aligned}$$  For \(t&gt; \log(n)/\gamma^2\), this lower bound is positive. We can then divide the left-hand side by \(\Vert a(t)\Vert_2\) and the right-hand side by the larger quantity \(\int_0^t \Vert\nabla F(a(s))\Vert_2ds\), and we get $$\min_i y_i x_i^\top \bar a(t) \geq \gamma -\frac{\log(n)}{\int_0^t \Vert\nabla F(a(s))\Vert_2ds} \geq \gamma -\frac{\log(n)}{\gamma t}.$$ This shows that the margin of \(\bar a(t) := a(t)/\Vert a(t)\Vert_2\) converges to the \(\ell_2\)-max-margin at a rate \(\log(n)/\gamma t\). That’s it, the implicit bias of this gradient flow is exposed!</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stability to step-size choice.</strong> To translate this argument to discrete time, we need decreasing step-sizes of order \(1/\sqrt{t}\) which deteriorates the convergence rate to \(\tilde O(1/\sqrt{t})\), see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08246.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07300.pdf">12</a>]. In [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>], we proposed a different proof strategy (based on an online optimization interpretation of \(\bar a(t)\), as below) which recovers the same convergence rate \(O(1/\sqrt{t})\) with <em>exponentially larger</em> step-sizes. This suggests that these diverging trajectories are extremely robust to the choice of step-size.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration. </strong>In the figure below, we plot on the left the evolution of the parameter \(a(t)\) and on the right the predictor \(x\mapsto (x,1)^\top a(t)\) with \(x\in \mathbb{R}^2\). In parameter space, we apply the hyperbolic tangent to the radial component which allows to easily visualize diverging trajectories. This way, the unit sphere represents the <em>horizon</em> of \(\mathbb{R}^d\), i.e., the set of directions at infinity [Chap. 3 in <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540627722">9</a>]. We will use the same convention in the other plots below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4106" height="288" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/linear.gif" width="586"/>Implicit bias of gradient descent for a linear classification task with the exponential loss: (left) parameter space, (right) predictor space.</figure></div>



<h2>3. Implicit bias:  training only the output layer</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Despite its apparently restrictive setting, the previous result already tells us something about wide neural networks. Consider the situation touched upon earlier where we only train the output weights \(a_j\) and the hidden weights \(b_j\) are picked uniformly at random on the sphere. This corresponds to learning a linear classifier on top of the random feature \([(b_j^\top x)_+]_{j=1}^m\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">As we have just shown, if the training set is separable, the normalized gradient flow of the unregularized exponential loss (or logistic loss) converges to a solution to  $$ \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2 \leq 1}\min_i y_i \sum_{j=1}^m  a_j (b_j^\top x_i)_+.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">This is a random feature approximation for the unregularized kernel support vector machine problem in the RKHS \(\mathcal{F}_2\), which is recovered in the large width limit \(m\to \infty\):  $$\max_{\Vert h\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_2}\leq 1} \min_i y_i h(x_i).$$ Notice that if \(m\) is large enough, the linear separability assumption is not even needed anymore, because any training set is separable in \(\mathcal{F}_2\) (at least if all \(x_i\)s are distinct and if we do not forget to include the bias/intercept).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration.</strong> In the animation below, we plot on the left the evolution of the parameters and on the right the predictor for a 2-D classification task. In parameter space, each particle represents a neuron: their direction is fixed, their distance to \(0\) is their absolute weight and the color is red (+) or blue (-) depending on the sign of the weight. As above, the unit sphere is at infinity and the particles diverge. In predictor space, the markers represent the training samples of both classes, the color shows the predictor and the black line is the decision boundary. The fact that the predictor has a smooth decision boundary is in accordance with the properties of \(\mathcal{F}_2\) given above. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4275" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/film_output_comp-1.gif"/>Gradient descent on the output layer of a two-layer relu neural network with the exponential loss: (left) parameter space, (right) predictor space. <a href="https://github.com/lchizat/2020_implicitbias_blog/blob/master/exp_output.jl">[code]</a></figure></div>



<h2>4. Implicit bias: 2-homogeneous linear classifiers</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Although the analyses where neural networks behave like kernel methods are pleasant for us theoreticians because we are in conquered territory, they miss essential aspects of neural networks such as their adaptivity and their ability to learn a representation. Let us see if we can characterize the implicit bias of the gradient flow of the unregularized exponential loss when training <em>both</em> layers of the neural network.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>A 2-homogeneous linear model.</strong> From an optimization point of view, an important property of two layer relu neural networks is that \(\Phi(\alpha w)= \alpha^2 \Phi(w)\) for all \(\alpha&gt;0\), i.e., they are positively 2-homogeneous in the training parameters. In contrast, a linear model is 1-homogeneous in the parameters. This seemingly little difference leads to drastic changes in the gradient flow dynamics. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Let us again build our intuition with a simplified model that captures key aspects of the dynamics, namely the linear classification setting of above. This time, we take any initialization \(r(0)\in \mathbb{R}^d\) with positive entries and the gradient flow in the ascent direction of the function \( F(r\odot r)\) where \(\odot\) is the elementwise product between two vectors and \(F\) is defined in Eq. (5). This is just a trick to obtain a 2-homogeneous parameterization of a linear model. This gradient flow satisfies $$ r'(t) = 2 r(t)\odot \nabla F(r(t)\odot r(t)).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Normalized dynamics.</strong> Let us define \(\bar a(t):=(r(t)\odot r(t))/\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2\) the normalized predictor associated to our dynamics which, by definition, belongs to the simplex \(\Delta_d\), i.e., the set of nonnegative vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) that sum to one. Using the fact that \(\nabla F(\beta a) = \nabla F_\beta (a)\) for all \(\beta&gt;0\), we obtain $$\begin{aligned} \bar a'(t) &amp;= 2\frac{r(t)\odot r'(t)}{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2} -2 (r(t)^\top r'(t))\frac{r(t)\odot r(t)}{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^4}\\ &amp;=4\bar a(t) \odot \nabla F_{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2}(\bar a(t))\ – \alpha(t) \bar a(t)\end{aligned}$$ where \(\alpha(t)\) is the scalar such that \(\sum_{i=1}^d a’_i(t) =0\). Online optimization experts might have recognized that this is (continuous time) <em>online mirror ascent in the simplex</em> for the sequence of smooth-margin functions \(F_{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2}\). Notice in particular the multiplicative updates: they correspond to the entropy mirror function, and they are particularly well suited for optimization in the high dimensional simplex [Chap.4, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4980.pdf">14</a>].</p>



<p>What do we learn from this reformulation? </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>We can prove (by similar means) that if the data set is linearly separable then \(\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2\) diverges. So the sequence of functions \(F_{\Vert r\Vert_2^2}\) converges to the margin \(F_\infty\) which means that \(\bar a(t)\) just ends up optimizing the function \(F_\infty\). As a consequence, we have $$\lim_{t\to \infty} y_i x_i^\top \bar a(t) = \max_{a\in \Delta_d} \min_{i} y_i x_i^\top a.$$ This exposes another implicit bias of gradient flow. Notice the key difference with the implicit bias obtained with a linear parameterization: we obtain here the \(\ell_1\)-max-margin (over classifiers with non-negative entries) instead of the \(\ell_2\)-max-margin.  </li><li>Beyond exposing the implicit bias, this reformulation shows that \(\bar a(t)\) implicitly optimizes a sequence of smooth objectives which converge to the margin \(F_\infty\). Unknowingly, we have recovered the well-principled optimization method that consists in approximating a non-smooth objective with smooth functions [<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A_Files/Nesterov-2005.pdf">15</a>].</li><li>While the conclusion above was only formal, this point of view leads to rigorous proofs of convergence and convergence rates in discrete time in \(\tilde O(1/\sqrt{t})\) with a step-size in \(O(1/\sqrt{t})\), by  exploiting tools from online optimization, see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>].</li></ul>



<h2>5. Implicit bias: fully trained 2-layer neural networks</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Once again this argument about linear predictors applies to neural networks: if we train both layers but only the magnitude of the hidden weights and not their direction, then this is equivalent to learning a 2-homogeneous linear model on top of the random feature \([  a_j(0) (x_i^\top b_j(0))_+]_{j=1}^m\). If each feature appears twice with opposite signs — which is essentially the case in the large width limit — then the simplex constraint can be equivalently replaced by an \(\ell_1\)-norm constraint on the weights. Recalling the definition of the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-norm from Eq. (4), we thus obtain that, in the infinite-width limit, the normalized predictor converges to a solution to $$ \max_{\Vert h\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \leq 1} \min_i y_i h(x_i).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This result is correct, but it is not relevant. In contrast to functions in \(\mathcal{F}_2\), functions in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) <em>can not</em> in general be approximated with few <em>random</em> features in high dimension. In fact, lower bounds that are exponential in the dimension exist in certain settings [Sec. X, <a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/publications_files/UniversalApproximationBoundsForSuperpositionsOfASigmoidalFunction.pdf">16</a>]. They can be approximated with a small number of features but those need to be data-dependent: in that sense, it is necessary to learn a representation – here,  a distribution over the hidden weights — in order to learn in \(\mathcal{F}_1\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This raises the following question: do we obtain the same implicit bias when training both layers of the neural network, without fixing the direction of the input weights? In the following result, which is the main theorem of our paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04486">1</a>], we answer by the affirmative.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Theorem</strong> (C. and Bach [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04486">1</a>], informal). Assume that for some \(\sigma&gt;0\), the hidden weights \(b_j\) are initialized uniformly on the sphere of radius \(\sigma\) and the output weights \(a_j\) are uniform in \(\{-\sigma,\sigma\}\). Let \(\mu_t\) be the Wasserstein gradient flow for the unregularized exponential loss and \(h_t = \int \Phi(w)d\mu_t(w)\) be the corresponding dynamics in predictor space. Under some technical assumptions, the normalized predictor \(h_t/\Vert h_t\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1}\) converges to a solution to the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin problem: $$\max_{\Vert h\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \leq 1} \min_i y_i h(x_i).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Giving an idea of proof would be a bit too technical for this blog post, but let us make some remarks:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>The strength of this result is that although this dynamics could get trapped towards limit directions which are not optimal, this choice of initialization allows to avoid them all and to only converge to <em>global</em> minimizers of this max-margin problem. The principle behind this is similar to the global convergence result in the previous blog post. </li><li>The fact that optimizing on the direction of the hidden weights is compatible with the global optimality conditions of the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin problem is very specific to the structure of positively 2-homogeneous problems, and should not be taken for granted for other architectures of neural networks.</li><li>Although at a formal level this result works for any initialization that is diverse enough (such as the standard Gaussian initialization), the initialization proposed here yields dynamics with a better behavior for relu networks: by initializing the hidden and output weights with equal norms – a property preserved by the dynamics – we avoid some instabilities in the gradient. Also notice that this result applies to any scale \(\sigma&gt;0\) of the initialization (we’ll see an intriguing consequence of this in the next section).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration.</strong> In the figure below, we plot the training dynamics when both layers are trained. In parameter space (left), each particle represents a neuron: its position is \(\vert a_j\vert b_j\) and its color depends on the sign of \(a_j\).  Here again the unit sphere is at infinity. The inactive neurons at the bottom correspond to those with a bias that is “too negative” at initialization. We observe that all the other neurons gather into few clusters: this is the sparsifying effect of the \(L^1\)-norm in Eq. (4). In predictor space, we obtain a polygonal classifier, as expected for a \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin classifier. See the paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>] for experiments that illustrate the strengths of this classifier in terms of generalization.</p>

<h2>6. Lazy regime and the neural tangent kernel</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This blog post would not be complete without mentioning the <em>lazy regime</em>. This is yet another kind of implicit bias which, in our context, takes place when at initialization the weights have a large magnitude and the step-size is small. It was first exhibited in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8076-neural-tangent-kernel-convergence-and-generalization-in-neural-networks.pdf">17</a>] for deep neural networks (see also [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02054.pdf">18</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03962.pdf">19</a>]). Hereafter, we follow the presentation of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07956.pdf">20</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lazy training via scaling.</strong> This phenomenon is in fact very general so let us present it with a generic parametric predictor \(h(W)\) with differential \(Dh(W)\). We introduce a scaling factor \(\alpha&gt;0\) and look at the gradient flow of \(F(W) := R(\alpha h(W))\) with a step-size \(1/\alpha^2\), that is $$ W'(t) = \ – \frac{1}{\alpha}Dh(W(t))^\top \nabla R(\alpha h(W(t))),$$ with initialization \(W(0)\). In terms of the predictor \(\alpha h(W)\), this yields the dynamics $$\frac{d}{dt} \alpha h(W(t)) = \ – Dh(W(t))Dh(W(t))^\top \nabla R(\alpha h(W(t)).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Lazy training happens when we take \(\alpha\) large while making sure that \(\alpha h(W(0))\) stays bounded. In this case, we see that the parameters change at a rate \(O(1/\alpha)\), while the predictor changes at a rate independent of \(\alpha\). On any bounded time interval, in the limit of  a large \(\alpha\), the parameters only move infinitesimally, while the predictor still makes significant progress, hence the name <em>lazy training</em>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Equivalent linear model.</strong> Since the parameters hardly move, if we assume that \(Dh(W(0))\neq 0\) then we can replace the map \(h\) by its linearization \(W \mapsto h(W(0))+Dh(W(0))(W-W(0))\). This means that the training dynamics essentially follows the gradient flow of the  objective $$ R\big ( \alpha h(W(0)) + \alpha Dh(W(0))(W-W(0)) \big)$$ which is a convex function of \(W\) as soon as \(R\) is convex.</p>



<p class="justify-text">If this objective admits a minimizer that is not too far away from \(W(0)\), then \(W(t)\) converges to this minimizer. If in contrast all  the minimizers are too far away (think of the exponential loss where they are at infinity), then the parameters will eventually move significantly and the lazy regime is just a transient regime in the early phase of training.  Of course, all these behaviors can be quantified and made more precise, because this phenomenon brings us back to the realm of linear models. </p>



<p class="justify-text">What all of this has to do with two-layer neural networks? As it happens, this scale factor appears implicit in various situations for these models; let us detail two of them. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Neural networks with \(1/\sqrt{m}\) scaling.</strong> For two-layer neural networks, lazy training occurs if we define \(h = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \sum_{j=1}^m \Phi(w_j)\) instead of \(h=\frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \Phi(w_j)\) before taking the infinite width limit. Indeed:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>This induces a scaling factor \(\alpha = \sqrt{m} \to \infty\) compared to \(1/m\) which, as we have already seen, is the “correct” scaling that leads to a non-degenerate dynamics in parameter space as \(m\) increases. </li><li>Moreover, by the central limit theorem,  \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \sum_{j=1}^m \Phi(w_j(0)) = O(1)\) for typical random initializations of the parameters. So the initial predictor stays bounded.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">To take the Wasserstein gradient flow limit, the step-size has to be of order \(m\) (see previous blog post). So here we should take a step-size of order \(m/\alpha^2 = 1\). With such a step-size, all the conditions for lazy training are gathered when \(m\) is large. Intuitively, each neuron only moves infinitesimally, but they collectively produce a significant movement in predictor space.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Neural networks with large initialization.</strong> Coming back to our scaling in \(1/m\) and our Wasserstein gradient flow that is obtained in the large width limit, there is another way to enter the lazy regime: by increasing the variance of the initialization. </p>



<p class="justify-text">To see this, assume that \(h\) is a positively \(p\)-homogeneous parametric predictor, which means that \(h(\sigma W)=\sigma^p h(W)\) for all \(\sigma&gt;0\) and some \(p&gt;1\) (remember that this is true with \(p=2\) for our two-layer relu neural network). Take an initialization of the form \(W(0) = \sigma \bar W_0\) where \(\sigma&gt;0\) and \(h(\bar W_0)=0\) (which is also satisfied for our infinite width neural networks with the initialization considered previously). Consider the gradient flow of \(R(h(W))\) with step-size \(\sigma^{2-2p}\).   By defining \(\bar W(t) = W(t)/\sigma\) and using the fact that the differential of a p-homogeneous function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function#Positive_homogeneity">is (p-1)-homogeneous</a>, we have, on the one hand $$ \bar W'(t) = -\sigma^{-p} Dh(\bar W(t))^\top \nabla R(\sigma^p h(\bar W(t))), $$ and on the other hand $$\frac{d}{dt} \sigma^p h(\bar W(t)) =\  – Dh(\bar W(t))Dh(\bar W(t))^\top \nabla R(\sigma^p h(\bar W(t))).$$ So in terms of the dynamics \(\bar W(t)\), the situation is exactly equivalent to having a scaling factor \(\alpha=\sigma^p\). This implies that as the magnitude \(\sigma\) of the initialization increases, we enter the lazy regime, provided the step-size is of order \(\sigma^{2-2p}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Neural tangent kernel. </strong>What does the lazy regime tell us about the learnt predictor for two-layer neural networks? Assuming for simplicity that the predictor at initialization is \(0\), this regime amounts to learning a linear model on top of the feature \([(b_j^\top x)_+]_{j=1}^m\) — the derivative with respect to the output weights — concatenated with the feature \([x a_j 1_{b_j^\top x &gt; 0} ]_{j=1}^m\)  — the derivative with respect to the input weights. Compared to training only the output layer, this thus simply adds some features. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Assume for concreteness, that at initialization the hidden weights \(b_j\) are uniform on a sphere of large radius \(\sigma&gt;0\) and the output weights are uniform on \(\{-\kappa\sigma, \kappa\sigma\}\) where \(\kappa\geq 0\). For a large width and a large \(\sigma\), we enter the lazy regime which amounts to learning in a RKHS — let us call it \(\mathcal{F}_{2,\kappa}\) — that is slightly different from \(\mathcal{F}_2 = \mathcal{F}_{2,0}\), since its kernel \(K_\kappa\) contains another term: $$ K_\kappa(x,x’) = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (\theta^\top x)_+ (\theta^\top x’)_+d\tau(\theta) + \kappa^2 \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (x^\top x’) 1_{\theta^\top x &gt; 0}1_{\theta^\top x’ &gt; 0}d\tau(\theta). $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This kernel is called the Neural Tangent Kernel [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8076-neural-tangent-kernel-convergence-and-generalization-in-neural-networks.pdf">17</a>] and the properties of the associated RKHS have been studied in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12191.pdf">21</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9449-on-the-inductive-bias-of-neural-tangent-kernels.pdf">22</a>], where it is shown to include functions that are slightly less smooth than those of \(\mathcal{F}_2\) when \(\kappa\) increases. This is illustrated in the plot below, obtained by training a wide neural network with \(\sigma\) large (to reach the lazy regime) on the square loss, and various values of \(\kappa\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4213" height="287" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/interp-4.png" width="574"/>1-D regression with a wide two-layer relu neural network (gradient descent on square loss, in the lazy regime) with 4 training samples (black dots). At initialization, output weights have \(\kappa\) times the (large) magnitude of the hidden weights. This implicitly solves kernel ridgeless regression for a kernel that depends on \(\kappa\). <a href="https://github.com/lchizat/2020_implicitbias_blog/blob/master/exp_NTK.jl">[code]</a></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Two implicit biases in one shot.</strong> The attentive reader might have noticed that for large initialization scale \(\sigma\gg 1\), when training both layers on the unregularized exponential loss, two of our analyses apply:  lazy training — that leads to a max-margin predictor in \(\mathcal{F}_{2,\kappa}\) — and the asymptotic implicit bias — that leads to a max-margin predictor in \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\).  So, where is the catch? </p>



<p class="justify-text">There is none! Since the minimizers of this loss are at infinity, the lazy regime is just a transient phase and we will observe both implicit biases along the training dynamics! Take a look at the video below: we observe that in early phases of training, the neurons do not move while learning a smooth classifier — this is the lazy regime and the classifier approaches the \(\mathcal{F}_{2,\kappa}\)-max-margin classifier. In later stages of training, the neurons start moving and the predictor converges to a \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin classifier as stated by the main theorem. The predictor jitters a little bit during training because I have chosen rather aggressive step-sizes. As shown in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06738.pdf">23</a>], the transition between these two implicit biases can be well understood in some simpler models.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4219" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/film_lazy2sparse_ns_comp-1.gif"/>Training both layers with gradient descent for the unregularized exponential loss. The only difference with the previous video is that at initialization the variance \(\sigma^2\) is larger and the step-size smaller \(\approx \sigma^{-2}\). First the network learns a classifier in the lazy regime (a kernel max-margin classifier) and eventually converges to the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin classifier.

<h2>Discussion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I described how analyses of the training dynamics can help us understand the properties of the predictor learnt by neural networks even in the absence of an explicit regularization. Already for the simplest algorithm one can think of — gradient descent — we have found a variety of behaviors depending on the loss, the initialization or the step-size. </p>



<p class="justify-text">To achieve this description, the infinite width limit is of great help. It allows to obtain synthetic and precise characterizations of the learnt predictor, that can be used to derive generalization bounds. Yet, there are many interesting non-asymptotic effects caused by having a finite width.  In that sense, we were only concerned with the end of the curve of double descent [<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15849.full.pdf">24</a>].</p>

<h3>Lower bound on the gradient norm for linear classification with the exponential loss</h3>



<p class="justify-text">In the context of Section 2, we want to prove that \(\Vert \nabla F(a)\Vert_2\geq \gamma\). For this, let \(Z\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}\) be the matrix with rows \(y_i x_i\) and let \(\Delta_n\) be the simplex in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). We have by duality $$ \gamma = \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2\leq 1}\min_{p\in \Delta_n} p^\top Z a =   \min_{p\in \Delta_n} \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2\leq 1} a^\top Z^\top p = \min_{p\in \Delta_n} \Vert Z^\top p\Vert_2 .$$  Also, notice that \(\nabla F(a) = Z^\top p\) with \(p_i = \frac{e^{-y_ix_i^\top a}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{-y_{j}x_{j}^\top a}}\).

Given my experience with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">TCS+</a>, I volunteered to lend a hand with the organization and logistics. It’s been a journey (with some <a href="https://twitter.com/thegautamkamath/status/1273055827092549634">unusual technical challenges</a>), but I think we have something which I hope will be engaging and generally a lot of fun. In addition to the typical academic component, we also have a social component planned as well. We learnt from the work of others, including the <a href="https://www.acm.org/virtual-conferences">ACM virtual conferences guide</a>, <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020">ICLR 2020</a>, and <a href="https://www.daniellitt.com/blog/2020/4/20/wagon-lessons-learned">WAGON</a>. I may make some version of our logistics docs available to others after the conference, so others can learn from our experience as well. Anyway, read on for an announcement from me and the other General Chairs, Konstantin Makarychev, Yury Makarychev, and Madhur Tulsiani. See also the <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/">main STOC page</a> for a more complete list of credits.</p>

<p>Dear fellow theorists,</p>



<p>As you already know, STOC 2020 this year will be a virtual conference. If you are interested in attending the conference, but haven’t registered yet, <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/52nd-annual-acm-symposium-on-theory-of-computing-stoc-2020-/event-summary-ea5fa7861d1a476d82bc10f667a1c0f4.aspx">please do so soon</a> (students: $25, regular: $50). This will help us ensure we have capacity for various online events. </p>



<p>Upon registration, you should receive a confirmation email from CVENT, also containing access information for various conference events. Also, if you are a student looking to register for STOC but the cost is a burden, please email us at <a href="mailto:stoc2020@ttic.edu">stoc2020@ttic.edu</a>.</p>



<p><strong>How will the conference work?</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Videos</strong>: The videos for all conference talks are now available on YouTube, and can be accessed through the links in the <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/STOCprogram.html">conference program</a>. Registration is <em>not required</em> to view the talks on Youtube.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Slack</strong>: The conference has a Slack workspace, with one channel for every paper and workshop, and additional channels for information, announcements, social events, help, etc. The invitations for the Slack workspace will be sent to registered participants. Authors are also encouraged to monitor the channels for their papers. All access information for the conference will also be available here. The workspace is currently active, and will remain active for at least one week after the conference.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Zoom sessions</strong>: The conference will feature Zoom sessions with short presentations by the speakers. The total time for each paper is 10 minutes. Given that participants have access to the full talks by the speakers on Youtube, these can be thought of as being analogues of poster sessions. The workshops will also be held as separate sessions. The links for the Zoom session via information in the confirmation email.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Social events</strong>: The conference will include junior/senior “lunches”, breakout tables for impromptu and scheduled hangouts, and a group event using <a href="https://gather.town">gather.town</a>. The timings for the events can be found in the conference program. Sign-up links for various events will be sent to all registered participants – please do sign-up soon!</li></ul>



<p>See you all at (virtual) STOC 2020. Please do let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Supervised learning methods come in a variety of flavors. While local averaging techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">nearest-neighbors</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">decision trees</a> are often used with low-dimensional inputs where they can adapt to any potentially non-linear relationship between inputs and outputs, methods based on empirical risk minimization are the most commonly used in high-dimensional settings. Their principle is simple: optimize the (potentially regularized) risk on training data over prediction functions in a pre-defined set of functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When the set of a functions is a convex subset of a vector space with a finite-dimensional representation, with standard assumptions, the corresponding optimization problem is convex. This has the benefits of allowing a thorough theoretical understanding of the computational and statistical properties of learning methods, which often come with strong theoretical guarantees, in terms of running time [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4980">1</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/16M1080173">2</a>, <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">3</a>] or prediction performance on unseen data [<a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://static.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/all_of_statistics.pdf">5</a>]. In particular, the linear parameterization can be done either explicitly by building a typically large finite set of features, or implicitly through the use of kernel methods and then a series of dedicated algorithms and theories can be leveraged for efficient non-linear predictions [6, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines.pdf">7</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6978-falkon-an-optimal-large-scale-kernel-method.pdf">8</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, linearly-parameterized sets of functions do not include neural networks, which lead to state-of-the-art performance in most learning tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, speech processing, in particular through the use of deep and convolutional neural networks [<a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">9</a>].</p>



<h2>Two-layer neural networks with “relu” activations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The goal of this blog post is to provide some understanding of why supervised machine learning work for the simplest form of such models: $$ h(x) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m a_i ( b_i^\top x)_+ = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m a_i \max\{ b_i^\top x,0\},$$ where the input \(x\) is a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and \(m\) is the number of hidden neurons. The weights \(a_i \in \mathbb{R}\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), are the <em>output weights</em>, while the weights \(b_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), are the <em>input weights</em>. The rectified linear unit (“relu”) [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v15/glorot11a/glorot11a.pdf">10</a>] activation is used, and our results will depend heavily on its positive homogeneity (that is, for \(\lambda &gt; 0\), \((\lambda u)_+ = \lambda u_+\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3829" height="292" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nn_single_blog.png" width="407"/>Two-layer neural network in dimension \(d = 6\) with \(m=4\) hidden neurons, and a single output.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Note that this is an idealized and much simplified set-up for deep learning, as there is a single hidden-layer, no convolutions, no pooling, etc. As I will show below, this simple set-up is already complex to understand, and I believe it captures some of the core difficulties associated with non-convexity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The first question that one may come to after decades of research in learning theory is: <em>why is it so hard to analyze?</em>  </p>



<p class="justify-text">There are at least two major difficulties:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Non-linearity</strong>: the dependence on the input weights \(b_i\)’s is non-linear because of the activation function, typically leading to non-convex optimization problems.</li><li><strong>Overparameterization</strong>: The number \(m\) of hidden neurons is very large (often so large that the number of parameters \(m(d+1)\) exceeds the number of observations), which is hard in terms of optimization and potentially generalization to unseen data. </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we will leverage the overparameterization and take \(m\) tending to infinity (without any dependence on the number of observations), which will allow us to derive theoretical results. We will leverage two key properties of the problem:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Separability</strong> of the model in \(w_i = (a_i,b_i)\), that is, the prediction function \(h(x)\) is the sum of terms which are independently parameterized, as \(h = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(w_i)\), where \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathcal{F}\), with \(\mathcal{F}\) a space of functions. In our situation, \(p = d+1\) and: $$ \Phi(w)(x) = a (b^\top x)_+. $$ In other words,  there is no parameter sharing among hidden neurons. Unfortunately, this does not generalize to more than a single hidden layer.</li><li><strong>Homogeneity</strong>: the relu activation is positively homogeneous so that as as function of \(w = (a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d\), \(\Phi(w)(x) = a (b^\top x)_+\) is positively 2-homogeneous, that is, \(\Phi(\lambda w) = \lambda^2 \Phi(w)\) for \(\lambda &gt; 0\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In this sequence of two blog posts, following a recent trend in optimization and machine learning theory [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15849.full.pdf">12</a>], optimization and statistics cannot be separated and need to be tackled together. I will focus on gradient flows on empirical or expected risks.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I will cover optimization and how over-parameterization leads to global convergence for 2-homogeneous models, a recent result obtained two years ago with <a href="https://lchizat.github.io/">Lénaïc Chizat</a> [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>]. This requires tools from optimal transport which I will briefly describe (for more details, see, e.g., [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00567">14</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will focus on generalization capabilities and the several implicit biases associated with gradient descent in this context [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8559-on-lazy-training-in-differentiable-programming.pdf">15</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486">16</a>].</p>



<h2>Infinitely wide limit and probability measures</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Following the standard learning set-up, our goal will be to minimize with respect to the prediction function \(h\) the functional \(R\) defined as $$ R(h) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x,y)} \big[ \ell( y, h(x) ) \big],$$ where \(\ell(y,h(x))\) is the loss incurred by outputting \(h(x)\) when \(y\) is the true label. Even within deep learning, this loss is most often convex in its second argument, such as for least-squares or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification">logistic</a> losses. Thus, I will assume that \(R\) is convex.</p>



<p>The expectation can be considered in two scenarios:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Empirical risk</strong>: this corresponds to the situation where we have observations \((x_j,y_j)\), \(j=1,\dots,n\), coming from some joint distribution on \((x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\). Minimizing \(R\) then may not lead to any guarantee on unseen data unless some explicit or implicit regularization is used. In next blog post, I will consider the implicit regularization effect of gradient-based algorithms.</li><li><strong>Expected risk (or generalization performance)</strong>: The expectation is taken with respect to unseen data, and thus its value (or a gradient) cannot be computed. However, any training observation \((x_j,y_j)\) can lead to an unbiased estimate, and if single pass stochastic gradient is used, our guarantees will be on the expected risk.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">The main and very classical idea is to consider the minimization of $$ G(W) = G(w_1,\dots,w_m) = R \Big( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(w_i) \Big),$$ and see it as the minimization of $$ F(\mu) = R \Big( \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \Big),$$ with respect to a probability measure \(\mu\), with the equivalence for $$ \mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i),$$ where \(\delta(w_i)\) is the Dirac measure at \(w_i\). See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3852" height="93" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/diracs_measures-1-1024x156.png" width="615"/>Left: discrete probability measure. Right: measure with density.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) is large, we can represent any measure in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_measures#Weak_convergence_of_measures">weak sense</a> (that is, expectations of any continuous and bounded functions can be approximated). The benefits of considering the space of all measures instead of discrete measures have been used already in variety of contexts in machine learning, statistics and signal processing [<a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/publications_files/UniversalApproximationBoundsForSuperpositionsOfASigmoidalFunction.pdf">17</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2800-convex-neural-networks.pdf">18</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">19</a>]. In this blog post, the key benefit is that the set of measures in convex and \(h = \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \) is linear in the measure \(\mu\), so that our optimization problem has become convex.</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, (1) It does not buy much in practice, as the set of probability measures is infinite-dimensional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank&#x2013;Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe algorithms</a> can be used, but the choice of new neurons is a difficult optimization problem, NP-hard for the threshold activation function [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070685798">20</a>], with polynomial potentially high complexity for the relu activation [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v65/goel17a/goel17a.pdf">21</a>], and (2) this is not what is used in practice, which is (stochastic) gradient descent.</p>



<h2>Finite-dimensional gradient flow</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will consider the gradient flow $$\dot{W} = \ – m \nabla G(W),$$ (where \(m\) is added as a normalization factor to allow a well-defined limit when \(m\) tends to infinity). This is still not exactly what is used in practice, but, as explained in <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/">last month post</a>, this is a good approximation of gradient descent (if using the empirical risk, then leading to guarantees of global convergence on the empirical risk only), or stochastic gradient descent (if doing a single pass on the data, then leading to guarantees of global convergence on unseen data). This is a non-convex dynamics, with stationary points and local minima, even when \(m\) is large (see, e.g., [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/safran18a/safran18a.pdf">27</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Two main questions arise: (1) what does the gradient flow dynamics converge to when the number of neurons \(m\) tends to infinity, and (2) can we get any global convergence guarantees for the limiting dynamics?</p>



<h2>Mean-field limit and Wasserstein gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) tends to infinity, since we want to use the measure representation, we need to understand the effect of performing the gradient flow jointly on \(w_1,\dots,w_m\) on the measure $$ \mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i),$$ and see if we can take a limit when \(m\) tends to infinity. This process of taking limits is common in physics and often referred to as the “mean-field” limit, and has been considered in a series of recent works [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05438">22</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/33/E7665.full.pdf">23</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00915">24</a>]. To avoid too much technicality, I will assume that the map \(\Phi\) is sufficiently differentiable, which unfortunately exclude the relu activation; for dedicated results, see [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Gradient flows on metric spaces.</strong> In order to understand the dynamics in the space of probability measures, we need to take a step backward and realize that gradient flows can be defined for many functions \(f\) on any metric space \(\mathcal{X}\). Indeed, it can be seen as the limit of taking infinitesimal steps of length \(\gamma\), where each new iterate \(x_{k+1}\) (corresponding to the value at time \(k\gamma\)) is defined recursively from \(x_k\) as $$x_{k+1} \in \arg\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}}\  f(x) + \frac{1}{2\gamma} d(x,x_k)^2.$$ As shown in [<a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~sayan/ambrosio.pdf">25</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13373-017-0101-1.pdf">26</a>], with some form of interpolation, this defines a curve with prescribed values \(x_k\) at each \(\gamma k\), and when the step-size \(\gamma\) goes to zero, this curves “converges” to the gradient flow.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3960" height="212" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/euler-1024x520.png" width="419"/>Gradient flow in bold black, with interpolating curve in red from 14 points \(x_0,\dots,x_{13}\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">For the space \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\) with the Euclidean distance and a continuously differentiable function \(f\), we obtain that $$x_{k+1} = x_k – \gamma f'(x_k) + o(\gamma),$$ and we get the usual gradient flow associated to \(f\), and the scheme above is nothing less than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler discretization</a> that was described <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/">last month</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Vector space gradient flows on probability measures.</strong> Probability measures are a convex subset of measures with finite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_variation#Total_variation_of_probability_measures">total variation</a>, which is equal to the \(\ell_1\)-norm between densities when the two probability measures have densities with respect to the same base measure. It is a normed vector space for which we could derive our first type of gradient flow, which can be seen as a continuous version of Frank-Wolfe algorithm, where atoms are added one by one, until convergence.  </p>



<p class="justify-text">As mentioned above, the fact that atoms are created sequentially seems attractive computationally. However, (1) deciding which one to add is a computationally hard problem, and (2) the flow on measures cannot be approximated by a finite evolving set of “particles” (here hidden neurons each defined by a vector \(w \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Wasserstein gradient flows on probability measures.</strong> There is another natural distance here, namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric">Wasserstein distance</a> (sometimes called the Kantorovich–Rubinstein distance). In order to remain short, I will only define it between empirical measures $$\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i) \mbox{ and } \nu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(v_i)$$ with the same number of points. The squared 2-Wasserstein distance is obtained by minimizing $$\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \| w_j – v_{\sigma(j)} \|_2^2$$ over all permutations \(\sigma: \{1,\dots,m\} \to \{1,\dots,m\}\). See illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3886" height="171" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wasserstein-2-1024x307.png" width="573"/>Wasserstein distance between two empirical measures: (left) original observations of two empirical measures with \(m = 11\) points, (right) assigning all black points to red points by minimizing the sum of squared distances between assigned points.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This can be extended to any pair of probability measures, and used within gradient flows, it has a very natural decoupling property: if \(\mu\) is fixed, and \(\nu\) is within a small distance of \(\mu\) in Wasserstein distance, then the optimal permutation above will always be the same, that is, locally, the Wasserstein distance is a sum of squared Euclidean distances. Then, the Wasserstein gradient flow will lead to \(m\) independent local regular Euclidean gradient flows, which interact through the gradient term as: $$ \dot{w}_i = \ –  \nabla \Phi(w_i)  \nabla R\Big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi d\mu \Big),$$ where the Jacobian \(\nabla \Phi(w_i)\) is a linear operator from \(\mathcal{F}\) to \(\mathbb{R}^p\), and \( \nabla R: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathcal{F}\) the gradient operator of \(R\). Since \(\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i)\), the dynamics of each particle interacts through the gradient of \(R\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3890" height="225" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wasserstein_flows-1024x508.png" width="456"/>Gradient flow for \(m=7\) interacting particles.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The intuitive reasoning above is behind the formal result for the function $$ F(\mu) = R \Big( \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \Big),$$ that the limit of the Euclidean gradient flow on each particle when \(m\) tends to infinity, is exactly the Wasserstein gradient flow of \(F\). While I have proposed an intuitive explanation, this can be made more formal in particular through the use of partial differential equations on the density of the measure [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>] (see also nice <a href="http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~kcraig/math/curriculum_vitae_files/NIPS_120917.pdf">slides</a> from Katy Craig on Wasserstein gradient flows).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stationary points.</strong> Since \(R\) is assumed convex over the convex set of probability measures, all local minima of \(R\) are global, and we should expect the gradient flow to converge to global optimum from any initial measure. This is true for the gradient flow associated with the total variation metric. However this is not true for the Wasserstein gradient flow, for which stationary points which are not global minimizers exist (given that for discrete measures this corresponds to classical backpropagation, this is well known to anybody who has ever trained a neural network). Note that there exists a notion of convexity for Wasserstein gradient flows, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_convexity">geodesic convexity</a>, but the function \(F\) is not geodesically convex in general.</p>



<h2>Global convergence</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now describe the main result from our recent work with Lénaïc [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>]: under assumptions described below, for the function \(F\) defined above, if the Wasserstein gradient flow converges to a measure, this measure has to be a global minimum of \(F\) (note that we cannot prove it is always convergent).</p>



<p class="justify-text">On top of technical regularity assumptions that I will not describe here, we need two crucial broad assumptions:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Homogeneity</strong> of the function \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^{d+1} \to \mathcal{F}\). We need a condition of this form, since if \(R\) is a linear function, then \(F(\mu)\) is of the form \(F(\mu) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \psi(w)d\mu(w)\) with \(\psi(w) = R(\Phi(w))\), and the Wasserstein gradient flow will converge to a weighted some of Diracs at all local minimizers of \(\psi\), which is typically not a global minimizer.</li><li><strong>Initialization with positive mass in all directions</strong>. That is, \(w_i\)’s are uniformly distributed on the sphere or Gaussian, which is the de facto choice in practice. </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration</strong>. We illustrate the result above by considering \(R\) as the square loss and \(y\) being generated from \(x\) through a neural network with \(m_0=5\) neurons. When running the gradient flow above, as soon as \(m \geqslant 5\), the model is sufficiently flexible to attain zero loss, which is thus the global optimum of the cost function. However, the gradient flow may not reach it, as it gets trapped in a local optimum. Our theoretical result suggests that when \(m\) is large, we should converge to the original neurons, which we see below. The surprising (and still unexplained) phenomenon is that \(m\) does not need to be much larger than \(m_0\) to see practical global convergence.</p>

<h2>Discussion and open problems</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I described theoretical results showing the benefits of overparameterization: when the number of hidden neurons \(m\) tends to infinity, then the corresponding gradient flow converges to the global optimum of the cost function. The proof relies notably on homogeneity properties of the relu activation. </p>



<p class="justify-text">The main weakness of  this result is that is only <em>qualitative</em>: we cannot quantify how big \(m\) need to be to be close to the infinite width limit, or how fast the gradient flow converges to the global optimum. These are still open problems. Additional interesting areas of research are to extend these results to convolutional and/or deep networks.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we know that we can obtain global convergence, I will describe next month the generalization properties when interpolating the training data with an overparameterized relu network [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486">16</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>. I would like to thank Lénaïc Chizat for producing the nice figures and video of neural networks, proofreading this blog post, and making good clarifying suggestions.</p>

<p>In this post, we discuss three papers which propose solutions to this problem through the lens of <em>mechanism design</em>. The idea is to carefully design payments so that we received an unbiased sample, leading to a hopefully accurate estimate.</p>

<h2><strong>Model</strong></h2>

<p>We use <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> to denote agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>‘s data (e.g., her weight). We assume that each agent also has a personal cost <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>, representing her level of reluctance to reveal her data. Agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> is willing to reveal <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> if and only if she receives a payment of at least <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>. Our goal is to allocate higher payments to agents with higher <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>‘s, in order to get an unbiased sample. However, we also must obey an budget constraint: we cannot spend more than <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B"/> total. The solution is to transact non-deterministically: with some probability, offer to purchase an agent’s data. Agents with higher costs will receive higher payments, but lower transaction probabilities.</p>

<p>We assume that agents are drawn at random independently from some distribution. Our crucial assumption is that we known the marginal distribution of agent costs, which we denote <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}"/> (we will explore later what happens when this assumption is removed). However, we do not know the distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>, and that distribution can be arbitrarily correlated with <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}"/>. As mentioned above, one might expect agents with less “desirable” <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s may have higher costs, but one can imagine more complex correlations as well.</p>

<p>Our mechanisms consist of two parts: an <em>allocation rule</em> <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/>, and a <em>payment rule</em> <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>. Given <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>, the mechanism works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Ask each agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> to report <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>. Let <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/> denote the actual reported cost.</li><li>With probability <img alt="A(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A(c)"/>, we purchase the agent’s data and pay her <img alt="P(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c)"/>. With probability <img alt="1 - A(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+-+A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="1 - A(c)"/>, we do not buy the data, and no payment is made.</li><li>At the end, use the data we learned to form an estimate of the population average of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>. Let <img alt="\bar{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{z}"/> denote our estimate.</li></ol>

<p>In this model, agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>‘s expected utility for reporting <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/> is <img alt="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_i%28c%29+%3D+A%28c%29+%28P%28c%29+-+c_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)"/>.</p>

<p>We have four main requirements:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Truthfulness. </strong>It should be in each agent’s best interest to truthfully report <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>.</li><li><strong>Individual rationality. </strong>Agents should not receive negative utility if they are honest, i.e., we should have <img alt="P(c_i) \ge c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c_i%29+%5Cge+c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c_i) \ge c_i"/> for all <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>.</li><li><strong>Budget constrained. </strong>Our total expected payment should not exceed <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B"/>, i.e., <img alt="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Csum_i+A%28c_i%29+P%28c_i%29%5D+%5Cle+B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B"/>.</li><li><strong>Unbiased. </strong>Our estimate isn’t consistently too high or too low. Specifically, the expected value of our estimate should be equal to the true average, i.e., <img alt="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Cbar%7Bz%7D%5D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Bz_i%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]"/>.</li></ol>

<p>Lack of bias doesn’t mean that our estimate is accurate, however. To this end, our primary goal is to <strong>minimize the variance</strong>, subject to the mechanism obeying the four above criteria. We evaluate variance via a worst-case framework: given a mechanism, we wish minimize the variance with respect to the worst-case distribution of agents for that mechanism. The idea is that the distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s is not known to the mechanism, so we require it to perform well for all distributions.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1729" height="203" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/goal.jpg?w=970" width="438"/>Goal.</figure></div>

<p>When we refer to the “optimal” mechanism, we mean minimum variance, subject to being truthful, individually rational, budget constrained, and unbiased (henceforth TIBU).</p>

<p><strong>The Horvitz Thomspon Estimator</strong></p>

<p>Once we have learned the <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s, how do we actual form an estimate of the mean? Luckily for us, this question has a simple answer. If we restrict ourselves to linear unbiased estimators, there is a unique way to do this, known as the <em>Horvitz-Thompson estimator</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum%5Climits_i+%5Ccfrac%7Bz_i%7D%7BA%28c_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}"/></p>

<p>Thus our task is simply to choose <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>.</p>

<h2>Approach #1</h2>

<p>This model was first considered by Roth and Schoenebeck (2012). They are able to characterize a mechanism which is TIBU and has variance at most <img alt="1/n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="1/n"/> more than the optimal variance, where <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n"/> is the number of agents. However, they do make the strong assumption that <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> is either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Their approach relies on <em>Take-It-Or-Leave-It</em> mechanisms. Such a mechanism is defined by a distribution $G$ over the positive real numbers, and works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Each agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> reports a cost <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/>.</li><li>Sample a payment <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> from <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/>.</li><li>If <img alt="p \ge c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%5Cge+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p \ge c"/>, buy the agent’s data with payment <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/>. If <img alt="p &lt; c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3C+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p &lt; c"/>, do not buy the agent’s data.</li></ol>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" height="212" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDzLmHAWwAAEPkl.jpg" width="293"/></figure></div>

<p>This amounts to an allocation rule <img alt="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29+%3D+1+-+%5Ctext%7BPr%7D%5Bp%5Cge+c%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]"/>, and a payment rule <img alt="P(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c)"/> equal to the distribution <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/> conditioned on being at least <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/>. The authors show that these mechanisms are fully general, i.e., any allocation and payment rule can be implemented by a Take-It-Or-Leave-It mechanism.</p>

<p>The proof of their main result is primarily based on using the calculus of variations to optimize over the space of distributions <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/>. The paper contains some additional results, for example regarding an alternate model where we wish to minimize the budget, but that is outside the scope of this blog post.</p>

<h2>Approach #2</h2>

<p>Although the above result is a great step, it leaves room for improvement. First of all, the assumption that <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> is binary is quite strong, and does not apply to our running example of body weight. Secondly, their mechanism does not quite achieve the optimal variance. Chen et al. (2018) remedy both of these concerns. That is, they allow <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> to be any real number, and they characterize the TIBU mechanism with optimal variance. Their result also generalizes to more complex statistical estimates, not just the average <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>, and it holds for both continuous and discrete agent distributions.</p>

<p>The approach of Chen et al. (2018) is based on two primary ideas. First, they show that any monotone allocation rule (i.e., we are always less likely to purchase data from an agent with higher cost) can be implemented in a TIBU fashion by a unique payment rule. Thus we only need to identify the optimal allocation rule. (This is similar to the standard result from auction theory about implementable monotone allocation rules (Myerson 1981).)</p>

<p>The second idea is to view the problem as a zero-sum game between ourselves (the mechanism designer) and an adversary who chooses the distribution of agents. Given a distribution, we choose an allocation rule to minimize the variance, and given an allocation rule, the adversary chooses a distribution to maximize the variance.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" height="297" src="https://i2.wp.com/marketbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Zero-Sum-Game.jpg?fit=511%2C521&amp;ssl=1&amp;resize=1200%2C1223.4833659491" width="292"/></figure></div>

<p>The authors are able to solve for the equilibrium of this game and thus identify the TIBU mechanism with minimum possible variance.</p>

<h2>Approach #3</h2>

<p>Approach #2 gave us our desired result: a minimum variance mechanism subject to our four desired properties (TIBU), for any distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s. But we are still making a very strong assumption: that we know the distribution of agent costs.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1766" height="230" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/prior.png?w=500" width="427"/></figure></div>

<p>Chen and Zheng (2019) do away with this assumption in a follow-up paper. They consider a model where the mechanism has no prior information on the distribution of costs (or on the distribution of data), and $n$ agents arrive one-by-one in a uniformly random order. Each agent reports a cost, and we decide whether to buy her data, and what to pay her. In order to price well, we need to learn the cost distribution, but we must do this while simultaneously making irrevocable purchasing decisions. The main result is a TIBU mechanism with variance at most a constant factor worse than optimal.</p>

<p>The authors note that after each step <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>, the reported costs up to that point induce an empirical cost distribution <img alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}_i"/>. Using the results of Chen et al. (2018), we can determine the optimal mechanism for <img alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}_i"/>. The basic idea is to use that mechanism for the current step, learn a new agent cost <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/> (note that the agent reports <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/> regardless of whether we purchase her data) and then update our empirical distribution accordingly. (The authors actually end up using an approximately optimal allocation rule, but the idea is the same.) The mechanism also uses more budget in the earlier rounds, to make up for the pricing being less accurate.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>In this post, we considered the problem of surveying a sensitive attribute where an agent’s data may be correlated with their willingness to participate. We discussed three different approaches, all of which rely of giving higher payments to agents with higher costs, in order to incentivize them to participate and to obtain an unbiased estimate. The final approach was able to give a truthful, individually rational, budget feasible, and unbiased mechanism with approximately optimal variance, without making any prior assumptions on the distribution of agents.</p>

<p>However, all three of the approaches assume that agents cannot lie about the data. This is reasonable for some attributes, such as a body weight, where an agent can be asked to step onto a physical scale. However, requiring participants come in person to a particular location will certainly lead to less engagement. Furthermore, for other sensitive attributes, there may not be a verifiable way to obtain the data. Future work could investigate alternative models where this assumption is not necessary. For example, perhaps agents do not maliciously lie, but rather are simply inaccurate at reporting their own attributes. For example, research has demonstrated that people consistently over-report height and under-report weight (e.g., Gorber et al., 2007). Could a mechanism learn the pattern of inaccuracy and compensate for that to still obtain an unbiased estimate?</p>

    <title>Pride and Prejudice: From Research to Practice</title>
    <summary>Despite (or because of) being a devoted theoretician, I truly enjoy every occasion when theory influences practice. I therefore felt quite a bit of satisfaction when our rather recent work, in the context of algorithmic fairness (with Úrsula Hébert-Johnson, Michael P. Kim and Guy N. Rothblum), found an application for predicting COVID-19 complications. Researchers in Israel, in collaboration with Israel’s biggest health-care provider, adapted a refined model for predicting flu complications to a model for predicting COVID-19 complications.  At the time, only very limited data from China were available (marginal statistics).  This is where our work came in (following several past empiric studies of the method):  the team applied our algorithm to improve the accuracy of predictions across various subpopulations (as part of an immense research and engineering effort). Now that there is (unfortunately) more data, it seems that the predictor exhibited surprisingly good performance (surprising, due to the poor training data).  See a manuscript here, an interview here and a more technical talk here (starting at minute 36 roughly).

<p>But this is also an example of the gravity of decisions by researchers and software developers. Taking it to extreme, imagine a predictor that is used to determine which patients are denied treatment in an overwhelmed hospital. The booming research area of algorithmic fairness sees a very short turnover from research ideas (in many areas) to deployment. In an ideal world, it would have been much better to first have a couple of decades to develop the computational foundations of algorithmic fairness, before the practical need arose. But in the real world, the huge scale of algorithmic decision making creates immense demand for solutions. Industry, as well as policy and law makers are unlikely to wait decades or even years, nor is it clear that they should. From my perspective, this reality underscores the urgency for <em>principled</em> and <em>deliberate</em> research – rather than <em>hasty</em> research – continuously developing the foundations of algorithmic fairness and offering answers to real-world challenges.</p></div>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Submodular functions model the intuitive notion of diminishing returns. Due to their far-reaching applications, they have been rediscovered in many fields such as information theory, operations research, statistical physics, economics, and machine learning. They also enjoy computational tractability as they can be minimized exactly or maximized approximately.</p>



<p>The goal of this talk is simple. We see how a little bit of randomness, a little bit of greediness, and the right combination can lead to pretty good methods for offline, streaming, and distributed solutions. I do not assume any background on submodularity and try to explain all the required details during the talk.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Optimization algorithms often rely on simple intuitive principles, but their analysis quickly leads to a lot of algebra, where the original idea is not transparent. In last month <a href="https://francisbach.com/computer-aided-analyses/">post</a>, <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/">Adrien Taylor</a> explained how convergence proofs could be automated. This month, I will show how proof sketches can be obtained easily for algorithms based on gradient descent. This will be done using vanishing step-sizes that lead to <em>gradient flows</em>.</p>



<h2>Gradient as local information</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The intuitive principle behind gradient descent is the quest for <em>local</em> descent. We thus need to characterize the local behavior of the function we aim to optimize. This is what gradients are for.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I will consider minimizing a function \(f\) over \(\mathbb{R}^d\). Assuming \(f\) is differentiable, a first order Taylor expansion of \(f\) around a point \(x\) leads to $$f(x+\delta) = f(x) + \nabla f(x) ^\top \delta + o(\| \delta\|),$$ for any norm \(\| \cdot \|\) on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), where \(\nabla f(x) \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is  the gradient of \(f\) at \(x\), composed of partial derivatives of \(f\). Therefore, around \(x\), \(f\) is approximately affine.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since we have a local affine approximation around \(x\), we can look for the direction of steepest descent, that is, the unit norm vector \(u \in \mathbb{R}^d\) such that \(f\) decays the most along \(u\), that is such that $$  u^\top \nabla f(x)$$ is minimized. This steepest descent direction depends on the choice of norm (assuming that the gradient is not zero at \(x\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the \(\ell_2\)-norm, then minimizing \(u^\top \nabla f(x)\) such that \(\|u\|_2 = 1\), leads to $$ \displaystyle u = \ – \frac{\nabla f(x)}{ \| \nabla f(x) \|_2},$$ that is the steepest descent is along the negative gradient (see an illustration below). In this blog post I will only focus on this steepest descent direction. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3542" height="149" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gradient_contours-1024x358.png" width="428"/>Function \(f\) represented through its contour lines for values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Negative gradient \(– \nabla f(x)\) as the steepest descent direction at point \(x\), which is orthogonal to the contour lines.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">As as side note, for the \(\ell_1\)-norm, then minimizing \(u^\top \nabla f(x)\) such that \(\|u\|_1 = 1\), leads to $$u \in\  – \arg\max_{ v \in \{-e_1,\, e_1,\, -e_2,\, e_2,\dots,\, -e_d,\, e_d \}} v^\top \nabla f(x),$$ where \(e_i\) is the \(i\)-th canonical basis vector of \(\mathbb{R}^d\). Here the steepest descent is along a coordinate axis (along the positive or negative side), and this leads to various forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_descent">coordinate descent</a> (this will probably be a topic for another post). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that the negative gradient leads to the steepest descent direction (for the Euclidean norm), it is natural to use this as a direction for an iterative algorithm, an idea that dates back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy">Cauchy</a> in 1847 [<a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90190w/f406">1</a>] (see the nice summary by Claude Le Maréchal [<a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/documenta/vol-ismp/40_lemarechal-claude.pdf">2</a>]).</p>



<h2>From gradient descent to gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">Gradient descent</a> is the most classical iterative algorithm to minimize differentiable functions. It takes the form $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} \, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n})$$ at iteration \(n\), where \(\gamma &gt; 0 \) is a step-size.  </p>



<p class="justify-text">Gradient descent comes in many flavors, steepest, stochastic, pre-conditioned, conjugate, proximal, projected, accelerated, etc. There are lots of papers and books [e.g., 3, 4, 5] analyzing it in various settings.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, to simplify its analysis and setting the stage for later posts, I will present the gradient flow, which is essentially the limit of gradient descent when the step-size \(\gamma\) tends to zero.</p>



<p class="justify-text">More precisely, this is obtained by considering that our iterates \(x_n\) are sampled at each multiple of \(\gamma\), from a function \(X: \mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}^d\), as $$x_n = X(n\gamma).$$ We can then use a piecewise affine interpolation to define a function defined on all points. We then have for \(t = n\gamma\), $$X(t + \gamma) = x_{n+1} =x_{n} \, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n}) = X(t)\, – \gamma \nabla f(X(t)).$$ Dividing by \(\gamma\), we get $$ \frac{1}{\gamma} \big[ X(t + \gamma) \, – X(t) \big] = \, – \nabla f(X(t)).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\gamma\) tends to zero (and with simple additional regularity assumptions), the left hand side tends to the derivative of \(X\) at \(t\), and thus the function \(X\) tends to the solution of the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation">ordinary differential equation</a> $$ \dot{X}(t) = \ – \nabla f (X(t)).$$ See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3479" height="271" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logistic_2d_flow.gif" width="348"/>Gradient descent (with piece-wise affine interpolation between iterates) vs. gradient flow on the same time scale for a logistic regression problem.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Studying the gradient flow in lieu of the gradient descent recursions comes with pros and cons.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simplified analyses</strong>. The gradient flow has no step-size, so all the traditional annoying issues regarding the choice of step-size, with line-search, constant, decreasing or with a weird schedule are unnecessary. Moreover, the use of differential calculus makes proving properties really simple (see examples below). We can thus focus on the essence of the algorithm rather than on technicalities.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From (continuous) flow to actual (discrete) algorithms</strong>. A flow cannot be run on a computer as it is a continuous-time object. The traditional discretization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler method</a>, that exactly replaces the flow by a piecewise-affine interpolation of the gradient descent iterates, where as shown above, we see \(x_n\) as \(X(n\gamma)\), where \(\gamma\) is the time increment between two samples. Four interesting observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>No direct proof transfer</em> : While Euler discretization always provides an algorithm, the generic convergence proofs do not allow to transfer immediately continuous-time proofs to convergence results for the discrete analysis. A key difficulty is to set-up the step-size \(\gamma\). However, the analysis can often be mimicked, i.e., similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function">Lyapunov functions</a> can be used (see examples below).</li><li><em>Proximal algorithms</em> : Faced with non-continuous gradient functions, the <em>forward</em> version of Euler discretization \(x_{n+1} = x_{n} – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n})\) can be replaced by the <em>backward</em> version $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} \, –  \gamma \nabla f(x_{n+1}),$$ which is only implicit as it can be solved by minimizing $$ f(x) + \frac{1}{2\gamma}\|x-x_{n}\|_2^2,$$ thus leading to the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithme_proximal_(optimisation)">proximal point algorithm</a>. Forward-backward schemes can also be recovered when \(f\) is the sum of a smooth and a non-smooth term.</li><li><em>Stochastic gradient descent</em> : There are two ways to deal with stochastic gradient descent, leading to two very different continuous limits. Adding independent and identically distributed (for simplicity) zero-mean noise \(\varepsilon_n\) to the gradient leads to the recursion $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} – \gamma \big[ \nabla f(x_{n}) + \varepsilon_n\big] = x_{n}\, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n}) \,- \gamma \varepsilon_n,$$ where the noise is multiplied by the step-size \(\gamma\). Surprisingly, taking the limit when \(\gamma\) tends to zero leads to the deterministic gradient flow equation. A more detailed argument is presented at the end of post, but the main hand-waving reason is that the noise contribution vanishes because it is multiplied by the step-size. Note that this limiting behavior is consistent with a convergence to a minimizer of \(f\).</li><li><em>Convergence to a Langevin diffusion</em> : When instead the noise is added with magnitude proportional to the square root \(\sqrt{2 \gamma}\) of the step-size (which is asymptotically larger than \(\gamma\)), when \(\gamma\) tends to zero, and if the covariance of the noise is identity, we converge to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_process">diffusion process</a> which is the solution of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation">stochastic differential equation</a>: $$ dX(t) = \ – \nabla f(X(t)) + \sqrt{2} dB(t),$$ where \(B\) is a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>. Moreover, as \(t\) tends to infinity, \(X(t)\) happens to tend in distribution to a random variable with density proportional to \(\exp( – f(x) )\). See more details at the end of the post and in [6]. The difference in behavior is illustrated below.</li></ul>

The flow is deterministic and converges to a stationary point of \(f\) (here the global minimum), while the diffusion is stochastic and converges to a distribution (which is typically not a point mass)</figure></div>



<h2>Properties of gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The gradient flow $$ \dot{X}(t) = \ – \nabla f (X(t)) $$ is well-defined for a wide variety of conditions on the function \(f\). The most classical ones are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem">Lipschitz-continuity</a> of the gradient, or semi-convexity [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13373-017-0101-1.pdf">7</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most obvious property is that the function decreases along the flow; in other words, \(f(X(t))\) is decreasing, which is a simple consequence of $$ \frac{d}{dt} f(X(t)) =  \nabla f(X(t))^\top \frac{dX(t)}{dt} =\  – \| \nabla f (X(t) )\|_2^2 \leqslant 0.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">If \(f\) is bounded from below, then \(f(X(t))\) will always converge (as a non-increasing function which is bounded from below, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_convergence_theorem">here</a>). However, in general, \(X(t)\) may not always converge without any further assumptions, e.g., it may oscillate forever. This is however rare and there are a variety of sufficient conditions for convergence of gradient flows, that date back to Lojasiewicz [8], and are based on “Lojasiewicz inequalities” that state that for \(y\) and \(x\) close enough, \(|f(x) – f(y)|^{1-\theta} \leqslant C \| \nabla f(x)\|\) for some \(C &gt; 0 \) and \(\theta \in (0,1)\). These are satisfied for “sub-analytical functions”, that include most functions one can imagine [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/sdfe/reader/pii/S0022247X05006864/pdf">9</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Once \(X(t)\) converges to some \(X(\infty) \in \mathbb{R}^d\), assuming \(\nabla f\) is continuous, we must have \(\nabla f(X(\infty))=0\), that is, \(X(\infty)\) is a stationary point of \(f\). Among all stationary points (that can be local minima, local maxima, or saddle-points), the one to which \(X(t)\) converges to depends on \(X(0)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given any stationary point, one can look at the set of initializations that lead to it. Typically, only local minima are stable, that is, the attraction basins of other stationary points has typically zero Lebesgue measure (see, e.g., [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v49/lee16.pdf">10</a>]). See examples below. </p>



<p class="justify-text">We start with a simple function defined on the two-dimensional plane, with several local minima and saddle-points.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3490" height="401" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/plot_non_convex-1.png" width="511"/>Various gradient flows trajectories, starting from green points and ending in black points. Note the proximity of the three top starting points, all ending in different local minima. See the motion below.</figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3492" height="500" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logistic_2d_flow_noncvx-1.gif" width="519"/>Various gradient flows trajectories, in motion! All flows share the same time scale. Some seem “slower” than others (because the gradient norm is small).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Before moving on, I cannot resist presenting a “real” two-dimensional example that probably all skiers, hikers, and cyclists with some form of mathematical abilities have thought of, the topographic map. Here is an example below:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3751" height="458" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/glandon_croix_de_fer-1-1024x1024.jpg" width="458"/>Extract from <a href="https://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/">IGN</a> topographic map, around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Glandon">Col du Glandon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_la_Croix_de_Fer">Col de la Croix de Fer</a> (French Alps).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Given the topographic map, how would gradient descent or gradient flow perform? Clearly, this corresponds to a non convex function, but it is quite well-behaved, as following water flows will typically lead to sea level. I chose two starting points famous to cyclists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Glandon">Col du Glandon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_la_Croix_de_Fer">Col de la Croix de Fer</a>, and ran gradient descent with a small step-size (to approximate the gradient flow), without noise (left) and with noise (right), on the topographic map (thanks to <a href="http://recherche.ign.fr/labos/matis/cv.php?nom=Landrieu">Loïc Landrieu</a> for the data extraction).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3753" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flows_final_square_small-1024x394.png"/></figure>



<p class="justify-text">Without noise, the descent from la Croix de Fer ends up getting stuck quickly in a local minimum, while the one from Glandon goes down to the valley, but then is not able to follow the almost flat slope. When noise is added, the two flows go a bit lower, highlighting the benefits of noise to escape local minima.</p>



<h2>Gradient flows for optimization and machine learning</h2>



<p class="justify-text">There are (at least) two key questions in optimization and machine learning related to gradient flows: </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>When can we have global guarantees for convergence? That is, can we make sure that we choose an initialization point well enough to get the the global optimum <em>without knowing where the global optimum is</em>. A key difficulty is that the volume of the attraction basin of the global optimum can be made arbitrarily small, even for infinitely differentiable functions (imagine a function equal to zero everywhere except on a small ball where it is negative).</li><li>How fast can we get there? “there” can be a stationary point or a global optimum. This is an important question as mere convergence in the limit may be arbitrarily slow [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6707-gradient-descent-can-take-exponential-time-to-escape-saddle-points.pdf">11</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">An important class of function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function">convex functions</a>, where everything works out very well. We will study them below. Other functions will be studied in future posts.</p>



<h2>Convex functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now assume that the function \(f\) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function">convex</a> and differentiable. Within machine learning, this corresponds to objective functions encountered for supervised learning which are based on empirical risk minimization with a prediction function which is linearly parameterized, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are various definitions of convexity, which are based on global properties (the function is always “below its chords”, or it is always “above its tangents”) or local properties (the Hessian is always positive semi-definite). The one which we need here is to be above its tangents, that is, for any \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d\), $$f(x) \geqslant f(y)  + \nabla f(y)^\top ( x \, – y).$$ Applying this to any stationary point \(y\) such that \(\nabla f(y)=0\) shows that for all \(x\), \(f(x) \geqslant f(y)\), that is, \(y\) is a global minimizer of \(f\). This is the classical benefit of convexity: no need to worry about local minima.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another property we will need is the Lojasiewicz inequality, which is in particular satisfied when \(f\) is \(\mu\)-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function#Strongly_convex_functions">strongly convex</a> (that is, \(f – \frac{\mu}{2} \| \cdot \|_2^2\) is convex): $$ f(x) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{2 \mu} \| \nabla f (x)\|^2$$ for any minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(f\) and any \(x\). This property allows to go from a bound on the gradient norm to a bound on function values.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We then obtain the convergence rate <em>in one line</em> as follows (see more details in [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6711-integration-methods-and-optimization-algorithms.pdf">12</a>]): $$ \frac{d}{dt} \big[ f(X(t))\ – f(x_\ast) \big] =\  \nabla f(X(t))^\top \dot{X}(t) =  \ – \| \nabla f(X(t))\|_2^2 \leqslant \ – 2\mu  \big[ f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big]$$ using the Lojasiewicz inequality above, leading to by simple integration of the derivative of \(\log \big[ f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big]\): $$f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \exp( – 2\mu t ) \big[ f(X(0))\  – f(x_\ast) \big], $$ that is, the convergence is exponential and the characteristic time is proportional to \(1/\mu\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The gradient flow gives the main insight (exponential convergence); and applying the result above to \(t = \gamma n\), we seem to recover the traditional rate proportional to \(\exp( – \gamma \mu n)\); HOWEVER, this is only true asymptotically for \(\gamma\) tending to zero, and proving a result for gradient descent requires extra steps to deal with having a constant step-size. This requires typically \(\gamma \leqslant 1/L\), where \(L\) is the smoothness constant of \(f\), and the simplest proof happens to use the same structure (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04636">13</a>] and references therein, as well as [<a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=zvmmf&amp;paperid=7813&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng">14</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Without strong convexity, we have, using the tangent property at \(X(t)\) and \(x_\ast\): $$ \frac{d}{dt}\big[   \| X(t)\ – x_\ast \|^2 \big] = \ –   2 ( X(t) \ – x_\ast )^\top \nabla f(X(t)) \leqslant \ – 2 \big[ f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big],$$  leading to, by integrating from \(0\) to \(t\), and using the monotonicity of \(f(X(t))\): $$  f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t \big[ f(X(u)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big] du \leqslant \frac{1}{2t} \| X(0) \ – x_\ast \|^2 \ – \frac{1}{2t} \| X(t) \ – x_\ast \|^2.$$ We recover the usual rates in \(O(1/n)\), with \(t = \gamma n\), with the same caveat as above (the step-size needs to be bounded).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I covered the basic aspects of gradient flows, in particular their relationships with various forms of gradient descent, and their use in obtaining simple convergence justifications. Next months, I will cover extensions of the analyses above, in particular in terms of (1) acceleration for convex functions, where several flows and discretizations are interesting beyond the gradient flow and Euler method [12, 15], and (2) another class of functions which includes non-convex functions as encountered when learning with neural networks [16].</p>

<h2>Limits of stochastic gradient descent for vanishing step-sizes</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence to gradient flow. </strong>We consider fixed times \(t = n \gamma \) and \(s = m \gamma\), and we let \(\gamma\) tend to zero, with thus \(m\) and \(n\) tending to infinity. Starting from the recursion $$x_{n+1} = x_{n}\, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n})\  – \gamma \varepsilon_n,$$ we get the following by applying it \(m\) times: $$X(t+s) \ – X(t) = x_{n+m}-x_n = \ – \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \nabla f\Big(X\Big(t+\frac{sk}{m}\Big)\Big)\  – \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \varepsilon_{k+n}.$$ The term \(\displaystyle \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \nabla f\Big(X\Big(t+\frac{sk}{m}\Big)\Big)\) converges to \(\displaystyle \int_{t}^{t+s}\!\!\! \nabla f(X(u)) du\), while the term \(\gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \varepsilon_{k+n}\) has zero expectation and variance equal to \(\gamma^2 m = \gamma s \) times the variance of each \(\varepsilon_{k+n}\), and thus it tends to zero (since \(\gamma\) tends to zero). Thus, in the limit, $$X(t+s)\  – X(t) = \ – \int_{t}^{t+s} \!\!\! \nabla f(X(u)) du,$$ which is equivalent to the gradient flow equation.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence to diffusion.</strong> We consider the recursion $$x_{n+1} = x_{n}\,  – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n}) + \sqrt{2\gamma} \varepsilon_n.$$ With the same argument as above, we now get $$X(t+s) \ – X(t) = x_{n+m}-x_n =\ – \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \nabla f\Big(X\Big(t+\frac{sk}{m}\Big)\Big)\ – \sqrt{2\gamma} \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \varepsilon_{k+n}.$$ Now the second term has zero mean but a variance proportional to \(2s\) (<em>which does not go to zero when \(\gamma\) goes to zero</em>). We can then use when \(m\) tends to infinity the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process#Wiener_process_as_a_limit_of_random_walk">limit of the sum of independent variables as a Wiener process</a>, to get $$X(t+s)\ – X(t) =\  – \int_{t}^{t+s} \!\!\! \nabla f(X(u)) du + \sqrt{2} \big[ B(t+s)-B(t) \big].$$ The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4_diffusion#Invariant_measures">limiting distribution</a> of \(X(t)\) happens to be the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_measure">Gibbs</a> distribution, with density \(\exp(-f(x))\) (the factor of \(\sqrt{2}\) was added to avoid an extra constant factor in the Gibbs distribution). More on this in a future post.</p></div>

    <title>What’s Your Story?</title>
    <summary>Last quarter, I taught a course on research methods in TOC, which gave me an opportunity to think through many aspects of research. I was promoting a human-centric perspective on research: how to facilitate better research by addressing the conditions needed for an individual researcher and groups of researchers to succeed. As science is a communal effort, the communication of science is critical, and thus one of the topics we covered is oral presentations. There are plenty of resources about research talks, and mostly they emphasize form over matter. How many words in a slide? How many slides in a talk? how to and how not to use font colors? How to and how not to use animation? and so on. While all of these are important, I find that the failing of many research talks is on a much more basic level. Think back to a research talk you heard recently, or to one you heard a few months ago.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Last quarter, I taught <a href="https://omereingold.wordpress.com/cs-353-the-practice-of-theory-research/">a course on research methods</a> in TOC, which gave me an opportunity to think through many aspects of research. I was promoting a human-centric perspective on research: how to facilitate better research by addressing the conditions needed for an individual researcher and groups of researchers to succeed. As science is a communal effort, the communication of science is critical, and thus one of the topics we covered is oral presentations.</p>
<p>There are plenty of resources about research talks, and mostly they emphasize form over matter. How many words in a slide? How many slides in a talk? how to and how not to use font colors? How to and how not to use animation? and so on. While all of these are important, I find that the failing of many research talks is on a much more basic level.</p>
<p>Think back to a research talk you heard recently, or to one you heard a few months ago. You may remember how you felt and what you thought of the talk but what do you remember of this talk in terms of content? Most of us will find that we don’t remember much, I rarely do. Yet in our presentations, we often follow a research-paper-like mold and squeeze in many little details that are somehow important to us, forgetting that they will all vanish in our audience’s memory soon after (or completely missed in the first place). Giving a talk (writing a paper, writing a blog post etc.) is about communication: who is your audience? what are the limitation of the medium? what is the message you want to convey? Since so little stays with the audience long term, it makes sense to make sure that this little will be what seems most important for you to convey.</p>
<p>The idea I am promoting here is not new, and there are various techniques towards this goal. One (which I think Oded Goldreich shared with me), is to think of audience’s attention as a limited currency. Whenever you share a big idea you spend a big token and other ideas cost a smaller token. Imagine you have one or two big tokens and a few smaller tokens. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OFAhBw0OXs">Another approach</a>, emphasizes the notion of <strong>a premise</strong>. The idea promoted here is that a talk needs a premise and this should be the title of the talk. Furthermore, every slide needs a premise and it should be the title of the slide. A premise is a main idea and is a complete sentence. It is not unusual to find a slide titled “Analysis” or “Efficiency” but neither of these is a premise. “Problem X has an efficient algorithm” could be. The talk’s premise could help you distill what you want the audience to take out of your talk. It also helps shape the talk, as everything that doesn’t serve the premise shouldn’t be there. Note that each paper can provoke many different premises and thus many different talks.</p>
<p>Here I want to play with a different idea, that I find intriguing, even if it may seem a bit extreme. It will not be controversial that a good talk (and paper) tells a story. After all, humans understand and remember narratives. But could we take inspiration from the form of storytelling in fiction writing? A vast literature, classifies different kinds of stories and explores their templates (see for example <a href="http://storybistro.com/7-story-frameworks/">this short discussion</a>).  Can we find analogues to these types in scientific research talks?</p>
<p>The type of story that is easiest to relate to is the <strong>Quest/Hero’s Journey</strong> (think Lord of the Rings). These have several distinct ingredients: a call to adventure, tests, allies, enemies, ordeal, reward, victorious return. Some research talks that follow this template do it well and preserve a sense of suspense and excitement, others seem like a long list of problems and the tricks that the work uses to handle them.</p>
<p>I believe that many other story templates can find analogues is research talks as well. Here are my initial attempts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coming of age</strong> stories – this area of research previously only had naive ideas but this works brings significant depth.</li>
<li><strong>The Under<span style="color: #000000;">dog</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> (think David and Goliath): a modest technique that concurred a great challenge.</span></li>
<li><strong>Rags to Riches</strong> (think the Ugly Duckling): an area or technique that were not successful prove powerful.
<ul>
<li>Similarly: <strong>Rebirth</strong> (reinvention, renewal).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comedy</strong> (or the Clarity Tale) – conceptual works shedding a new perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Tragedy</strong> (or the Cautionary Tale) – Some impossibility results come to mind (couldn’t we view Arrow’s impossibility theorem as being tragic?)</li>
<li><strong>Redemption stories</strong>: the field so far has missed the point, was misleading or harmful, but this work makes amends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you suggest papers and a story type that could fit them?</p></div>

    <title>Reading in Private</title>
    <summary>(This blog post is based on joint work with Dima Kogan.) One of the great unsung perks of being a college student is having access to the university library.

<p>One of the great unsung perks of being a college student is having access to the university library. There is something thrilling about hunting down exactly the right reference deep in the stacks, or reading through the archived papers of a public figure from years back.</p>
<p>The pandemic has closed all of our libraries for the time being. Even so, through the fruits of computer science—databases, the Internet, e-readers, and so on—we can get access to much of the same information even when we are cooped up at home.</p>
<p>But for me, one of the true pleasures of using a library is the fact that I can browse through any book I want in complete privacy. If I want to go up to the stacks and read about tulip gardening, or road-bike maintenance, or strategies for managing anxiety, I can do that pretty much without anyone else knowing.</p>
<p>In contrast, if I go online today and search for “tulip gardening,” Google will take careful note of my interest in tulips and I will be seeing ads about gardening tools for months.</p>
<p>An ideal digital library would let us download and read books without anyone—not even the library itself—learning which books we are reading. How could we build such a privacy-respecting digital library?</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss the private-library problem and how <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">our recent work on private information retrieval</a> might be able to help solve it.</p>
<h3><b>The Private-Library Problem</b></h3>
<p>Let us define the problem a little more precisely. We will imagine a protocol running between a library, which holds the books, and a student, who wants to download a particular book.</p>
<p>Say that the library has <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> books—let’s call the books <img alt="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N)"/>. To keep things simple, let’s pretend that each book consists of just a single bit of information, so <img alt="x_i \in \{0,1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_i \in \{0,1\}"/> for all <img alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}"/>.</p>
<p>The student starts out holding the index <img alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}"/> of her desired book. To fetch the digital book from the library, the student and library exchange some messages. At the end of the interaction, we want the following two properties to hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Correctness.</b> The student should have her desired book (i.e., the bit <img alt="x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_i"/>).</li>
<li><b>Privacy. </b>The library should have not learned any information, in a cryptographic sense, about which book the student downloaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we have grossly simplified the problem: a real book is more than a single bit in length, book titles are not consecutive integers, maybe the student would like to find a book using a keyword search, etc. But even this simplified private-information-retrieval problem, which <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~bchor/PIR.pdf">Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan introduced</a> in the 90s, is already interesting enough.</p>
<h3><b>A simple but inefficient solution</b></h3>
<p>There is a simple solution to this problem: the student can just ask the library to send her the contents of all <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> books. This solution achieves both correctness and privacy, so what’s the problem? Are we done?</p>
<p>Well, there are two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of <b>communication</b> is large: Just to read a single book, the client must download the contents of the entire library! So this is terribly inefficient.</li>
<li>The amount of <b>computation</b> is large: Just to fetch a single book, the library must do work proportional to the size of the entire library. So “checking out” a book from this digital library will take a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Research on private information retrieval typically focuses on the first problem: how can we reduce the <i>communication</i> cost? Using a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2968443">variety</a> of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/646125">clever</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978429">techniques</a>, it is possible to drive down the communication cost to something very small—sub-polynomial or even logarithmic in the library size <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>.</p>
<p>But today we are interested in the <i>computational</i> burden on the library. Is there any way that the student can privately download a book from the library while requiring the library to do only <img alt="o(N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="o(N)"/> work in the process?</p>
<h3><b>Doing the hard work in advance</b></h3>
<p>To have both correctness and privacy, it seems that the library needs to touch each of the <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> books in the process of responding to each student’s request. And, in some sense, <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/malkin/BIM.ps">this is true</a>. So, to allow the library to run in time sublinear in <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>, we will have to tweak the problem slightly.</p>
<p>Our idea is to have the library do the <img alt="O(N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(N)"/>-time computation in an <b>offline phase</b>, which takes place <i>before</i> the student decides which book she wants to read. For example, this offline phase might happen overnight while the library’s servers would otherwise be idle.</p>
<p>Later on, once the student decides which book in the library she wants to read, the student and library can run a <img alt="o(N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="o(N)"/>-time <b>online phase</b> in which the student is able to retrieve her desired book. The total communication cost, in both offline and online phases, will be <img alt="o(N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="o(N)"/>.</p>
<p>So, by pushing the library’s expensive linear scan to an offline phase, the library can service the student’s request for a book in sublinear online time.</p>
<h3><b>Our offline/online private information retrieval scheme</b></h3>
<p>Let’s see how to construct such an offline/online scheme. To make things simple for the purposes of this post, let’s assume that the student has access to two non-colluding libraries that hold the same set of books. To be concrete, let’s call the two libraries “Stanford” and “Berkeley.”</p>
<p>The privacy property will hold as long as the librarians at Stanford and Berkeley don’t get together and share the information that they learned while running the protocol with the student. So Stanford and Berkeley here are “non-colluding.” (Equivalently, our scheme that protects privacy against an adversary that controls one of the two libraries—but not both.)</p>
<p/><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1670" style="width: 571px;"><img alt="Offline-online PIR" class=" wp-image-1670" height="365" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/offlineonline.png?w=300" width="561"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1670">In the offline phase, which happens before the student knows which book she wants to read, the Stanford library does linear work. In the online phase, which runs once the student has the index of her desired book, the Berkeley library runs in sublinear time. (We are suppressing log factors here.)</p></div><p/>
<p>Now, let’s describe an offline/online protocol by which the student can privately fetch a book from the digital library:</p>
<p><b>Offline Phase.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The student partitions the integers <img alt="\{1, .., N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C+..%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{1, .., N\}"/> into <img alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sqrt{N}"/> non-overlapping sets chosen at random, where each set has size <img alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sqrt{N}"/>. Call these sets <img alt="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+S_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}"/>.</li>
<li>The student sends these sets <img alt="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+S_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}"/> to Stanford (the first library). To reduce the communication cost here, the student can compress these sets using pseudorandomness.</li>
<li>For each set <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/>, the Stanford library computes the <i>parity</i> of all of the books indexed by set <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/> and returns the parity bits <img alt="(b_1, \dots, b_{\sqrt{N}})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28b_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+b_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="(b_1, \dots, b_{\sqrt{N}})"/> to the student. In other words, if the books are <img alt="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N) \in \{0,1\}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_N%29+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N) \in \{0,1\}^n"/>, then <img alt="b_j = \sum_{k \in S_j} x_k \bmod 2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk+%5Cin+S_j%7D+x_k+%5Cbmod+2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="b_j = \sum_{k \in S_j} x_k \bmod 2"/>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total communication in this phase is only <img alt="O(\sqrt{N})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{N})"/> bits and the student and the Stanford library can run this step <i>before</i> the student decides which book she wants to read.</p>
<p><b>Online Phase.</b> Once the student decides that she wants to read book <img alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}"/>, the student and Berkeley (the second library) run the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The student finds the set <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/> that contains the index <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> of her desired book.</li>
<li>The student flips a coin that is weighted to come up heads with some probability <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/>, to be fixed later.</li>
<li>If the coin lands <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heads</span>:
<ul>
<li>The student sends <img alt="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cgets+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i\}"/> to the Berkeley library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the coin lands <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tails</span>:
<ul>
<li>The student samples <img alt="i' \gets_R S_j \setminus \{i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27+%5Cgets_R+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i' \gets_R S_j \setminus \{i\}"/>.</li>
<li>The student sends <img alt="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i'\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cgets+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%27%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i'\}"/> to the Berkeley library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Berkeley library receives the set <img alt="S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Csubseteq+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}"/> from the student. The Berkeley library returns the contents of all books whose indices appear in set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S"/> to the student.</li>
<li>Now, the student can recover its desired book as follows:
<ul>
<li>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heads</span>: the student now has the parity of the books in <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/> (from the offline phase) and the value of all books in <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/> that are not book <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>. This is enough to recover the contents of book <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>.</li>
<li>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tails</span>: <img alt="i \in S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i \in S"/>. In this case the Berkeley library has sent the contents of book <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> to the student in the online phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before we fix the weight <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> of the coin, we see that the protocol satisfies <b>correctness</b>, since no matter how the coin lands the client recovers its desired book. Also, the total communication cost is <img alt="O(\sqrt{N} \log N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D+%5Clog+N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{N} \log N)"/> bits, which is sublinear as we had hoped. Finally, the <b>online computation cost</b> is also sublinear: the Berkeley library just needs to return <img alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sqrt{N}"/> books to the client, which it can do in time roughly <img alt="O(\sqrt{N})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{N})"/>.</p>
<p>The last matter to address is <b>privacy</b>. Again, we are assuming that the adversary controls only one of the two libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the offline phase, the student’s message to the Stanford library is independent of <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>, so the protocol is perfectly private with respect to Stanford.</li>
<li>In the online phase, we must be more careful. It turns out that if we choose the weight <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> of the coin as <img alt="p = 1 - (\sqrt{N} - 1)/N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+1+-+%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D+-+1%29%2FN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p = 1 - (\sqrt{N} - 1)/N"/>, then the set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S"/> that the student sends to UC Berkeley in the online phase is just a uniformly random size-<img alt="(\sqrt{N}-1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="(\sqrt{N}-1)"/> subset of <img alt="\{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{1, \dots, N\}"/>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Open problems</b></h3>
<p>So, the student can privately fetch a book from our digital libraries in sublinear online time. What else is left to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting rid of the need for two non-colluding libraries is a clear next step. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">Our work</a> has some results along these lines, but they pay a price either in (a) asymptotic efficiency or in (b) the strength of the cryptographic assumptions required.</li>
<li>A beautiful paper of <a href="https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~beimel/Papers/BIM.pdf">Beimel, Ishai, and Malkin</a> shows that if the library can store its collection of books using a special type of error-correcting encoding, the <b>total</b> computational time at the libraries (not just the online time) can be sublinear in <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>. As far as we know, these schemes are not concretely efficient enough to use in practice. Could they be made so?</li>
<li>Privacy is just one of the many pleasures of using a physical library. During this period of confinement, I also miss the smell of the books, the beauty of light filtering through the stacks, and the peacefulness of thinking in a study carrel. Can a digital library ever give us these things too?</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these questions catch your fancy, please check out <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">our Eurocrypt paper</a> for more background, pointers, and results.</p>
<p>Don Knuth <a href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf">has reportedly said</a> “Using a great library to solve a specific problem… Now <i>that</i> […] is real living.” With better digital libraries, maybe we could all live a little bit more during these challenging days.</p></div>

<p><b>1. CDF Estimation for Discrete, Univariate Distributions </b></p>
<p>Suppose we have a distribution <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> over the ordered, discrete domain <img alt="{\{1,\dots,D\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{1,\dots,D\}}"/> and let <img alt="{\mathcal{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{P}}"/> be the family of all such distributions. The CDF of the distribution is the function <img alt="{\Phi_{P} : \{1,\dots,D\} \rightarrow [0,1]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi_%7BP%7D+%3A+%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5B0%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi_{P} : \{1,\dots,D\} \rightarrow [0,1]}"/> given by</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle \| f(X) - f(X') \|_2^2 \leq \frac{2 \log(D)}{n^2}. \ \ \ \ \ (5)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5C%7C+f%28X%29+-+f%28X%27%29+%5C%7C_2%5E2+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac%7B2+%5Clog%28D%29%7D%7Bn%5E2%7D.+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%285%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \| f(X) - f(X') \|_2^2 \leq \frac{2 \log(D)}{n^2}. \ \ \ \ \ (5)"/></p>
<p>Thus, we can use the Gaussian mechanism:</p>

<p>As we will argue, there exists a matrix <img alt="{A \in {\mathbb R}^{2D \times 2D}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%5E%7B2D+%5Ctimes+2D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \in {\mathbb R}^{2D \times 2D}}"/> such that <img alt="{\Phi_{X} = A \cdot f(X_{1 \cdots n})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi_%7BX%7D+%3D+A+%5Ccdot+f%28X_%7B1+%5Ccdots+n%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi_{X} = A \cdot f(X_{1 \cdots n})}"/>.

<p>This shows hierarchical decomposition of the domain <img alt="{\{1,\dots,8\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2C8%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{1,\dots,8\}}"/> using 14 intervals.

<p><b> 1.2. Why Restrict the Domain? </b></p>
<p>A drawback of the estimator we constructed is that it only applies to distributions of finite support <img alt="{\{1,2,\dots,D\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{1,2,\dots,D\}}"/>, albeit with a relatively mild dependence on the support size. If privacy isn’t a concern, then no such restriction is necessary, as the bound <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#eqdkw">(2)</a> applies equally well to any distribution over <img alt="{{\mathbb R}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\mathbb R}}"/>. Can we construct a differentially private estimator for distributions with infinite support?</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the answer to this question is no! Any differentially private estimator for the CDF of the distribution has to have a rate that depends on the support size, and cannot give non-trivial rates for distributions with infinite support.</p>

<p>We emphasize that this theorem shouldn’t meet with too much alarm, as <img alt="{\log^* D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%5E%2A+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\log^* D}"/> grows remarkably slowly with <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/>. There are differentially private CDF estimators that achieve very mild dependence on <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/> [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNS13">BNS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNSV15">BNSV15</a>], including one nearly matching the lower bound in Theorem <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#thmcdf-lb">2</a>. Moreover, if we want to estimate a distribution over <img alt="{{\mathbb R}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\mathbb R}}"/>, and are willing to make some mild regularity conditions on the distribution, then we can approximate it by a distribution with finite support and only increase the rate slightly. However, what Theorem <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#thmcdf-lb">2</a> shows is that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to private CDF estimation that achieves similar guarantees to the empirical CDF. That is, the right algorithm has to be tailored somewhat to the application and the assumptions we can make about the distribution.</p>
<p><b>2. More Private Statistics </b></p>
<p>Of course, the story doesn’t end here! There’s a whole wide world of differentially private statistics beyond what we’ve mentioned already. We proceed to survey just a few other directions of study in private statistics.</p>
<p><b> 2.1. Parameter and Distribution Estimation </b></p>
<p>A number of the early works in differential privacy give methods for differentially private statistical estimation for i.i.d. data. The earliest works [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DN03">DN03</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DN04">DN04</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BDMN05">BDMN05</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DMNS06">DMNS06</a>], which introduced the Gaussian mechanism, among other foundational results, can be thought of as methods for estimating the mean of a distribution over the hypercube <img alt="{\{0,1\}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{0,1\}^d}"/> in the <img alt="{\ell_\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell_\infty}"/> norm. Tight lower bounds for this problem follow from the tracing attacks introduced in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BUV14">BUV14</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSUV15">DSSUV15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BSU17">BSU17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17a">SU17a</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>]. A very recent work of Acharya, Sun, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ20">ASZ20</a>] adapts classical tools for proving estimation and testing lower bounds (lemmata of Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam) to the differentially private setting. Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>] give tight minimax lower bounds for the weaker guarantee of selecting the largest coordinates of the mean, which were refined by Cai, Wang, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CWZ19">CWZ19</a>] to give lower bounds for sparse mean-estimation problems.</p>
<p>Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith introduced the highly general sample-and-aggregate paradigm, which they apply to several learning problems (e.g., learning mixtures of Gaussians) [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#NRS07">NRS07</a>]. Later, Smith [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Smi11">Smi11</a>] showed that this paradigm can be used to transform any estimator for any asymptotically normal, univariate statistic over a bounded data domain into a differentially private one with the same asymptotic convergence rate.</p>
<p>Subsequent work has focused on both relaxing the assumptions in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Smi11">Smi11</a>], particularly boundedness, and on giving finite-sample guarantees. Karwa and Vadhan investigated the problem of Gaussian mean estimation, proving the first near-optimal bounds for this setting [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KV18">KV18</a>]. In particular, exploiting concentration properties of Gaussian data allows us to achieve non-trivial results even with unbounded data, which is impossible in general. Following this, Kamath, Li, Singhal, and Ullman moved to the multivariate setting, investigating the estimation of Gaussians and binary product distributions in total variation distance [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KLSU19">KLSU19</a>]. In certain cases (i.e., Gaussians with identity covariance), this is equivalent to mean estimation in <img alt="{\ell_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell_2}"/>-distance, though not always. For example, for binary product distribution, one must estimate the mean in a type of <img alt="{\chi^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\chi^2}"/>-distance instead. The perspective of distribution estimation rather than parameter estimation can be valuable. Bun, Kamath, Steinke, and Wu [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BKSW19">BKSW19</a>] develop a primitive for private hypothesis selection, which they apply to learn any coverable class of distributions under pure differential privacy. Through the lens of distribution estimation, their work implies an upper bound for mean estimation of binary product distributions that bypasses lower bounds for the same problem in the empirical setting. In addition to work on mean estimation in the sub-Gaussian setting, such as the results discussed earlier, mean estimation has also been studied under weaker moment conditions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BS19">BS19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KSU20">KSU20</a>]. Beyond these settings, there has also been study of estimation of discrete multinomials, including estimation in Kolmogorov distance [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNSV15">BNSV15</a>] and in total variation distance for structured distributions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DHS15">DHS15</a>], and parameter estimation of Markov Random Fields [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ZKKW20">ZKKW20</a>].</p>
<p>A different approach to constructing differentially private estimators is based on robust statistics. This approah begins with the influential work of Dwork and Lei [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DL09">DL09</a>], which introduced the propose-test-release framework, and applied to estimating robust statistics such as the median and interquartile range. While the definitions in robust statistics and differential privacy are semantically similar, formal connections between the two remain relatively scant, which suggests a productive area for future study.</p>
<p><b> 2.2. Hypothesis Testing </b></p>
<p>An influential work of Homer et al. [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#HSRDTMPSNC08">HSRDTMPSNC08</a>] demonstrated the vulnerability of classical statistics in a genomic setting, showing that certain <img alt="{\chi^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\chi^2}"/>-statistics on many different variables could allow an attacker to determine the presence of an individual in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Motivated by these concerns, an early line of work from the statistics community focused on addressing these issues [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#VS09">VS09</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#USF13">USF13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#YFSU14">YFSU14</a>].</p>
<p>More recently, work on private hypothesis testing can be divided roughly into two lines. The first focuses on the minimax sample complexity, in a line initiated by Cai, Daskalakis, and Kamath [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CDK17">CDK17</a>], who give an algorithm for privately testing goodness-of-fit (more precisely, a statistician might refer to this problem as one-sample testing of multinomial data). A number of subsequent works have essentially settled the complexity of this problem [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ18">ASZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADR18">ADR18</a>], giving tight upper and lower bounds. Other papers in this line study related problems, including the two-sample version of the problem, independence testing, and goodness-of-fit testing for multivariate product distributions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ18">ASZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADR18">ADR18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADKR19">ADKR19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMUZ19">CKMUZ19</a>]. A related paper studies the minimax sample complexity of property <em>estimation</em>, rather than testing of discrete distributions, including support size and entropy [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AKSZ18">AKSZ18</a>]. Other recent works in this vein focus on testing of simple hypotheses [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMTZ18">CKMTZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>]. In particular [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>] proves an analogue of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma for differentially private testing of simple hypotheses. A paper of Awan and Slavkovic [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AS18">AS18</a>] gives a universally optimal test when the domain size is two, however Brenner and Nissim [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BN14">BN14</a>] shows that such universally optimal tests cannot exist when the domain has more than two elements. A related problem in this space is private change-point detection [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMTZ18">CKMTZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKLZ19">CKLZ19</a>] — in this setting, we are given a time series of datapoints which are sampled from a distribution, which at some point, changes to a different distribution. The goal is to (privately) determine when this point occurs.</p>
<p>Complementary to minimax hypothesis testing, a line of work [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#WLK15">WLK15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#GLRV16">GLRV16</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KR17">KR17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KSF17">KSF17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CBRG18">CBRG18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SGGRGB19">SGGRGB19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKSBG19">CKSBG19</a>] designs differentially private versions of popular test statistics for testing goodness-of-fit, closeness, and independence, as well as private ANOVA, focusing on the performance at small sample sizes. Work by Wang et al. [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#WKLK18">WKLK18</a>] focuses on generating statistical approximating distributions for differentially private statistics, which they apply to hypothesis testing problems.</p>
<p><b> 2.3. Differential Privacy on Graphs </b></p>
<p>There is a significant amount of work on differentially private analysis of graphs. We remark that these algorithms can satisfy either edge or node differential privacy. The former (easier) guarantee defines a neighboring graph to be one obtained by adding or removing a single edge, while in the latter (harder) setting, a neighboring graph is one that can be obtained by modifying the set of edges connected to a single node. The main challenge in this area is that most graph statistics can have high sensitivity in the worst-case.</p>
<p>The initial works in this area focused on the empirical setting, and goals range from counting subgraphs [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KRSY11">KRSY11</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS13">BBDS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KNRS13">KNRS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CZ13">CZ13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#RS16">RS16</a>] to outputting a privatized graph which approximates the original [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#GRU12">GRU12</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS12">BBDS12</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Upa13">Upa13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AU19">AU19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#EKKL20">EKKL20</a>]. In contrast to the setting discussed in most of this series, it seems that there are larger qualitative differences between the study of empirical and population statistics due to the fact that many graph statistics have high worst-case sensitivity, but may have smaller sensitivity on typical graphs from many natural models.</p>
<p>In the population statistics setting, recent work has focused on parameter estimation of the underlying random graph model. So far this work has given estimators for the <img alt="{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta}"/>-model [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KS16">KS16</a>] and graphons [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BCS15">BCS15</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BCSZ18">BCSZ18</a>]. Graphons are a generalization of the stochastic block model, which is, in turn, a generalization of the Erdös-Rényi model. Interestingly, the methods of Lipschitz-extensions introduced in the empirical setting by [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS13">BBDS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KNRS13">KNRS13</a>] are the main tool used in the statistical setting as well. While the first works on private graphon estimation were not computationally efficient, a recent focus has been on obviating these issues for certain important cases, such as the Erdös-Rényi setting [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU19">SU19</a>].</p>

<p>Differentially private statistics is a very lively research area, and has seen a lot of activity in the last couple years. While the phrasing is a slight departure from previous work which focused on estimation with worst-case datasets, it turns out that the differences are often superficial. In a short series of blog posts, we hope to educate readers on some of the recent advancements in this area, as well as shed light on some of the connections between the old and the new. We’ll describe the settings, cover a couple of technical examples, and give pointers to some other directions in the area.

<p><b>1. Introduction </b></p>
<p>Statistics and machine learning are now ubiquitous in data analysis. Given a dataset, one immediately wonders what it allows us to infer about the underlying population. However, modern datasets don’t exist in a vacuum: they often contain sensitive information about the individuals they represent. Without proper care, statistical procedures will result in gross violations of privacy. Motivated by the shortcomings of ad hoc methods for data anonymization, Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith introduced the celebrated notion of differential privacy [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DMNS06">DMNS06</a>].</p>
<p>From its inception, some of the driving motivations for differential privacy were applications in statistics and the social sciences, notably disclosure limitation for the US Census. And yet, the lion’s share of differential privacy research has taken place within the computer science community. As a result, the specific applications being studied are often not formulated using statistical terminology, or even as statistical problems. Perhaps most significantly, much of the early work in computer science (though definitely not all) focus on estimating some property <em>of a dataset</em> rather than estimating some property <em>of an underlying population</em>.</p>
<p>Although the earliest works exploring the interaction between differential privacy and classical statistics go back to at least 2009 [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#VS09">VS09</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#FRY10">FRY10</a>], the emphasis on differentially private statistical inference in the computer science literature is somewhat more recent. However, while earlier results on differential privacy did not always formulate problems in a statistical language, statistical inference was a key motivation for most of this work. As a result many of the techniques that were developed have direct applications in statistics, for example establishing minimax rates for estimation problems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this series of blog posts is to highlight some of those results in the computer science literature, and present them in a more statistical language. Specifically, we will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tight minimax lower bounds for privately estimating the mean of a multivariate distribution over <img alt="{{\mathbb R}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\mathbb R}^d}"/>, using the technique of <em>tracing attacks</em> developed in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BUV14">BUV14</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSUV15">DSSUV15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BSU17">BSU17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17a">SU17a</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KLSU19">KLSU19</a>].
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Upper bounds for estimating a distribution in Kolmogorov distance, using the ubiquitous <em>binary-tree mechanism</em> introduced in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DNPR10">DNPR10</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CSS11">CSS11</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, we hope to encourage computer scientists working on differential privacy to pay more attention to the applications of their methods in statistics, and share with statisticians many of the powerful techniques that have been developed in the computer science literature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b> 1.1. Formulating Private Statistical Inference </b></p>
<p>Essentially every differentially private statistical estimation task can be phrased using the following setup. We are given a dataset <img alt="{X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX+%3D+%28X_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+X_n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)}"/> of size <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>, and we wish to design an algorithm <img alt="{M \in \mathcal{M}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M \in \mathcal{M}}"/> where <img alt="{\mathcal{M}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{M}}"/> is the class of mechanisms that are both:</p>
<ol>
<li>differentially private, and</li>
<li>accurate, either in expectation or with high probability, according to some task-specific measure.</li>
</ol>
<p>A few comments about this framework are in order. First, although the accuracy requirement is stochastic in nature (i.e., an algorithm might not be accurate depending on the randomness of the algorithm and the data generation process), the privacy requirement is worst-case in nature. That is, the algorithm must protect privacy for every dataset <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>, even those we believe are very unlikely.</p>
<p>Second, the accuracy requirement is stated rather vaguely. This is because the notion of accuracy of an algorithm is slightly more nuanced, depending on whether we are concerned with <em>empirical</em> or <em>population</em> statistics. A particular emphasis of these blog posts is to explore the difference (or, as we will see, the lack of a difference) between these two notions of accuracy. The former estimates a quantity of the observed dataset, while the latter estimates a quantity of an unobserved distribution which is assumed to have generated the dataset.</p>
<p>More precisely, the former can be phrased in terms of empirical loss, of the form:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle \min_{M \in \mathcal{M}}~\max_{X \in \mathcal{X}}~\mathop{\mathbb E}_M(\ell(M(X), f(X))), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cmin_%7BM+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D%7E%5Cmax_%7BX+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D%7D%7E%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D_M%28%5Cell%28M%28X%29%2C+f%28X%29%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \min_{M \in \mathcal{M}}~\max_{X \in \mathcal{X}}~\mathop{\mathbb E}_M(\ell(M(X), f(X))), "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{\mathcal{M}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{M}}"/> is some class of <em>randomized estimators</em> (e.g., differentially private estimators), <img alt="{\mathcal{X}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{X}}"/> is some class of <em>datasets</em>, <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> is some quantity of interest, and <img alt="{\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell}"/> is some <em>loss function</em>. That is, we’re looking to find an estimator that has small expected loss on <em>any dataset</em> in some class.</p>
<p>In contrast, statistical minimax theory looks at statements about population loss, of the form:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle \min_{M \in \mathcal{M}}~\max_{P \in \mathcal{P}}~\mathop{\mathbb E}_{X \sim P, M}(\ell(M(X),f(P))), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cmin_%7BM+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D%7E%5Cmax_%7BP+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D%7E%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D_%7BX+%5Csim+P%2C+M%7D%28%5Cell%28M%28X%29%2Cf%28P%29%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \min_{M \in \mathcal{M}}~\max_{P \in \mathcal{P}}~\mathop{\mathbb E}_{X \sim P, M}(\ell(M(X),f(P))), "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{\mathcal{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{P}}"/> is some family of <em>distributions</em> over datasets (typically consisting of i.i.d. samples). That is, we’re looking to find an estimator that has small expected loss on random data from <em>any distribution</em> in some class. In particular, note that the randomness in this objective additionally includes the data generating procedure <img alt="{X \sim P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX+%5Csim+P%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X \sim P}"/>.</p>
<p>These two formulations are formally very different in several ways. First, the empirical formulation requires an estimator to have small loss on <em>worst-case</em> datasets, whereas the statistical formulation only requires the estimator to have small loss <em>on average</em> over datasets drawn from certain distributions. Second, the statistical formulation requires that we estimate the unknown quantity <img alt="{f(P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(P)}"/>, and thus necessitates a solution to the non-private estimation problem. On the other hand, the empirical formulation only asks us to estimate the known quantity <img alt="{f(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(X)}"/>, and thus if there were no privacy constraint it would always be possible to compute <img alt="{f(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(X)}"/> exactly. Third, typically in the statistical formulation, we require that the dataset is drawn i.i.d., which means that we are more constrained when proving lower bounds for estimation than we are in the empirical problem.</p>
<p>However, in practice (more precisely, in the practice of doing theoretical research), these two formulations are more alike than they are different, and results about one formulation often imply results about the other formulation. On the algorithmic side, classical statistical results will often tell us that <img alt="{\ell(f(X),f(P))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28f%28X%29%2Cf%28P%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell(f(X),f(P))}"/> is small, in which case algorithms that guarantee <img alt="{\ell(M(X),f(X))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28M%28X%29%2Cf%28X%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell(M(X),f(X))}"/> is small also guarantee <img alt="{\ell(M(X),f(P))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28M%28X%29%2Cf%28P%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell(M(X),f(P))}"/> is small.</p>
<p>Moreover, typical lower bound arguments for empirical quantities are often statistical in nature. These typically involving constructing some simple “hard distribution” over datasets such that no private algorithm can estimate well on average for this distribution, and thus these lower bound arguments also apply to estimating population statistics for some simple family of distributions. We will proceed to give some examples of estimation problems that were originally studied by computer scientists with the empirical formulation in mind. These results either implicitly or explicitly provide solutions to the corresponding population versions of the same problems—our goal is to spell out and illustrate these connections.</p>

The proof of this lower bound is based on <em>robust tracing attacks</em>, also called <em>membership inference attacks</em>, which were developed in a chain of papers [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BUV14">BUV14</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSUV15">DSSUV15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BSU17">BSU17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17a">SU17a</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KLSU19">KLSU19</a>]. We remark that this lower bound is almost identical to the minimax bound for mean estimation proven in the much more recent work of Cai, Wang, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CWZ19">CWZ19</a>], but it lacks tight dependence on the parameter <img alt="{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta}"/>, which we discuss in the following remark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Remark 3</b> <em> The choice of <img alt="{\delta = 1/n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3D+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta = 1/n}"/> in <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#eqRd-minimax">(2)</a> may look strange at first. For the upper bound this choice is arbitrary—as we will see, we can upper bound the rate for any <img alt="{\delta &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta &gt; 0}"/> at a cost of a factor of <img alt="{O(\log(1/\delta))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog%281%2F%5Cdelta%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\log(1/\delta))}"/>. The lower bound applies only when <img alt="{\delta \leq 1/n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cleq+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta \leq 1/n}"/>. Note that the rate is qualitatively different when <img alt="{\delta \gg 1/n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cgg+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta \gg 1/n}"/>. However, we emphasize that <img alt="{(\epsilon,\delta)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cepsilon%2C%5Cdelta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(\epsilon,\delta)}"/>-differential privacy is not a meaningful privacy notion unless <img alt="{\delta \ll 1/n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cll+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta \ll 1/n}"/>. In particular, the mechanism that randomly outputs <img alt="{\delta n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta n}"/> elements of the sample satisfies <img alt="{(0,\delta)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%280%2C%5Cdelta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(0,\delta)}"/>-differential privacy. However, when <img alt="{\delta \gg 1/n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cgg+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta \gg 1/n}"/>, this mechanism completely violates the privacy of <img alt="{\gg 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgg+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\gg 1}"/> person in the dataset. Moreover, taking the empirical mean of these <img alt="{\delta n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta n}"/> samples gives rate <img alt="{d/\delta n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%2F%5Cdelta+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d/\delta n}"/>, which would violate our lower bound when <img alt="{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta}"/> is large enough. On the other hand, we would expect the minimax rate to become slower when <img alt="{\delta \ll 1/n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cll+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta \ll 1/n}"/>. This expectation is, in fact, correct, however the proof we present does not give the tight dependence on the parameter <img alt="{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta}"/>. See [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17a">SU17a</a>] for a refinement that can obtain the right dependence on <img alt="{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta}"/>, and [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CWZ19">CWZ19</a>] for the details of how to apply this refinement in the i.i.d. setting. </em></p>

<p><b>Tracing Attacks.</b></p>
<p>Before giving the formal proof, we will try to give some intuition for the high-level proof strategy. The proof can be viewed as constructing a <em>tracing attack </em>[<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSU17">DSSU17</a>] (sometimes called a <em>membership inference attack</em>) of the following form. There is an attacker who has the data of some individual <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> chosen in one of the two ways: either <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> is a random element of the sample <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>, or <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> is an independent random sample from the population <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/>. The attacker is given access to the true distribution <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> and the outcome of the mechanism <img alt="{M(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M(X)}"/>, and wants to determine which of the two is the case. If the attacker can succeed, then <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/> cannot be differentially private. To understand why this is the case, if <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> is a member of the dataset, then the attacker should say <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> is in the dataset, but if we consider the adjacent dataset <img alt="{X'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X'}"/> where we replace <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> with some independent sample from <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/>, then the attacker will now say <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> is independent of the dataset. Thus, <img alt="{M(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M(X)}"/> and <img alt="{M(X')}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%28X%27%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M(X')}"/> cannot be close in the sense required by differential privacy.</p>
<p>Thus, the proof works by constructing a test statistic <img alt="{Z = Z(M(X),Y,P),}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ+%3D+Z%28M%28X%29%2CY%2CP%29%2C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Z = Z(M(X),Y,P),}"/> that the attacker can use to distinguish the two possibilities for <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/>. In particular, we show that there is a distribution over populations <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> such that <img alt="{\mathop{\mathbb E}(Z)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D%28Z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathop{\mathbb E}(Z)}"/> is small when <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> is independent of <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>, but for <em>every</em> sufficiently accurate mechanism <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/>, <img alt="{\mathop{\mathbb E}(Z)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D%28Z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathop{\mathbb E}(Z)}"/> is large when <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> is a random element of <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>.</p>
<p><b>Proof of Theorem <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#thmmean-lb">5</a>.</b></p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The third Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place next Friday, April 17th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC).  <strong>Shachar Lovett</strong> from UC San Diego will speak about “<em>The power of asking more informative questions about the data</em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Many supervised learning algorithms (such as deep learning) need a large collection of labelled data points in order to perform well. However, what is easy to get are large amounts of unlabelled data. Labeling data is an expensive procedure, as it usually needs to be done manually, often by a domain expert. Active learning provides a mechanism to bridge this gap. Active learning algorithms are given a large collection of unlabelled data points. They need to smartly choose a few data points to query their label. The goal is then to automatically infer the labels of many other data points.</p>



<p>In this talk, we will explore the option of giving active learning algorithms additional power, by allowing them to have richer interaction with the data. We will see how allowing for even simple types of queries, such as comparing two data points, can exponentially improve the number of queries needed in various settings. Along the way, we will see interesting connections to both geometry and combinatorics, and a surprising application to fine grained complexity.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I want to illustrate how computers can be great allies in designing (and verifying) convergence proofs for first-order optimization methods. This task can be daunting, and highly non-trivial, but nevertheless usually unavoidable when performing complexity analyses. A notable example is probably the convergence analysis of the stochastic average gradient (SAG) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2388.pdf">1</a>], whose original proof was computer assisted.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To this end, we will mostly spend time on what is referred to as <em>performance estimation problems</em> (PEPs), introduced by Yoel Drori and Marc Teboulle [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-013-0653-0">2</a>]. Performance estimation is also closely related to the topic of <em>integral quadratic constraints</em> (IQCs), introduced in the context of optimization by Laurent Lessard, Benjamin Recht and Andrew Packard [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1009597">3</a>]. In terms of presentations, IQCs  leverages control theory, whereas PEPs might seem more natural in the optimization community. This blog post essentially presents PEPs from the point of view of [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>], instantiated on a running example.</p>



<h2>Overview, motivations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">First-order methods for continuous optimization belong to the large panel of algorithms that are usually approached via worst-case analyses. In this context, analyses rely on combining inequalities (that are due to assumptions on the problem classes), in potentially long, non-intuitive, and technical, proofs. For the insiders, those proofs all look very similar. For the outsiders, those proofs all look rather repelling, technical (long pages of chained inequalities), probably not interesting, and like computer codes: usually intuitive mostly for their authors.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In what follows, I want to show how (and why) those proofs are indeed all very similar. On the way, I want to emphasize how those combinations of inequalities are related to the “true essence” of worst-case analyses (which rely on computing worst-case scenarios), and to provide examples on how to constructively obtain them.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We take the stand of illustrating the PEP approach on a single iteration of gradient descent, as it essentially contains all necessary ingredients to understand the methodology in other contexts as well. Certain details of the following text are (probably unavoidably) a bit technical. However, going through the detailed computations is not essential, and the text should contain the necessary ingredients for understanding the essence of the methodology.</p>



<h2>Running example: gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us consider a naive, but standard, example: unconstrained convex minimization $$x_\star= \underset{x\in\mathbb{R}^d}{\mathrm{arg min}} f(x)$$with gradient descent: \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k)\). Let us assume \(f(\cdot)\) to be continuously differentiable, to have a \(L\)-Lipschitz gradient (a.k.a., \(L\)-smoothness), and to be \(\mu\)-strongly convex. Those functions satisfy, for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d\):<br/>– strong convexity, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Definition 2.1.2]: $$\tag{1}f(x) \geqslant      f(y)+\langle{\nabla f(y)}; {x-y}\rangle+\tfrac{\mu}{2} \lVert x-y\rVert^2,$$- smoothness, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Theorem 2.1.5]: $$\tag{2} f(x) \leqslant      f(y)+\langle{\nabla f(y)}; {x-y}\rangle+\tfrac{L}{2}\lVert x-y\rVert^2.$$Let us recall that in the case of twice continuously differentiable functions, smoothness and strong convexity amount to requiring  that $$\mu I \preccurlyeq \nabla^2 f(x) \preccurlyeq L I,$$ for some \(0&lt; \mu&lt;L&lt; \infty\) and for all \(x\in\mathbb{R}^d\) (in other words, all eigenvalues of \(\nabla^2 f(x)\) are between \(\mu\) and \(L\)). In what follows, we denote by \(\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}\) the class of \(L\)-smooth \(\mu\)-strongly convex functions (irrespective of the dimension \(d\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" height="204" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/SmoothStronglyConvex.png" width="473"/>Figure 1: the blue function is \(L\)-smooth and \(\mu\)-strongly convex (it is possible to create respectively global upper and lower quadratic bounds from every \(x\in\mathbb{R}^d\) with respectively curvatures \(L\) and \(\mu\)).</figure></div>
</div></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this context, convergence of gradient descent can be studied in many ways. Here, for the sake of the example, we will do it in terms of two base quantities: distance to optimality \(\lVert x_k-x_\star\rVert\), and function value accuracy \(f(x_k)-f(x_\star)\). There are, of course, infinitely many other possibilities, such as gradient norm \(\rVert \nabla f(x_k)\lVert\), Bregman divergence \(f(x_\star)-f(x_k)-\langle{\nabla f(x_k)};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle\), or even best function value observed throughout the iterations \(\min_{0\leq i\leq k} \{f(x_i)-f(x_\star)\}\): the reader can adapt the lines below for his/her favorite criterion. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For later reference, let us provide another inequality that is known to  hold for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d\) for any \(L\)-smooth \( \mu\)-strongly convex function: <br/>– bound on inner product, see, e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>,  Theorem 2.1.11]: $$\langle{\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)};{x-y}\rangle  \geqslant        \tfrac{1}{L+\mu} \lVert{\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)}\rVert^2+\tfrac{\mu  L}{L+\mu}\lVert{x-y}\rVert^2.\tag{3}$$ In the case \(\mu=0\) this inequality is known as “cocoercivity”. This (perhaps mysterious) inequality happens to play an important role in convergence proofs.</p>



<h3>A standard convergence result</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start by stating two known results along with their simple proofs (see, e.g.,  [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Theorem 2.1.14] or [6, Section 1.4.2, Theorems 2 &amp; 3]):<br/>– convergence in distance:  $$\begin{array}{rl}    \rVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\lVert^2&amp;= \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2+\gamma^2\lVert{\nabla f(x_k)}\rVert^2-2\gamma\langle{\nabla f(x_k)};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle \\ \     &amp; \leqslant      \left(1-\tfrac{2\gamma L \mu}{L+\mu}\right)\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2+\gamma\left(\gamma-\tfrac2{L+\mu}\right)\lVert{\nabla f(x_k)}\rVert^2, \end{array} $$ where the second line follows from smoothness and strong convexity of \(f\) via the bound (3) on the inner product (with \(x=x_k\) and \(y=x_\star\)). For the particular choice \(\gamma=\tfrac2{L+\mu}\), the second term on the right hand side disappears, and we end up with<br/>     $$\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^2\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,$$ which, following from \(0&lt;\mu&lt;L&lt;\infty\), satisfies \(0&lt; \tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}&lt;1\), hence proving linear convergence of gradient descent in this setup, by recursively applying the previous inequality: $$ \lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{2k}\lVert{x_0-x_\star}\rVert^2.$$ – Convergence in function values: one can simply use the result in distance along with the previous basic inequalities (1) and (2) characterizing smoothness and strong convexity (both with \(y=x_\star\)):<br/>     $$f(x_k)-f(x_\star) \leqslant \hspace{-.15cm}\tfrac{L}{2}\hspace{-.1cm}\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2  \leqslant  \hspace{-.15cm}    \tfrac{L}{2}\hspace{-.1cm}\left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{\hspace{-.1cm}2k} \rVert{x_0-x_\star}\lVert^2 \leqslant  \hspace{-.15cm}     \tfrac{L}{\mu}\hspace{-.1cm} \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{\hspace{-.1cm}2k}(f(x_0)-f(x_\star)).$$  It is also possible to directly look for convergence in terms of function values, but it is then usually unclear in the literature what inequalities to use, and I am not aware of any such proof leading to the same rate without the leading \(\tfrac{L}{\mu}\) (except the proof presented below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, even in this toy example, a few very legitimate questions can be raised:<br/>– can we improve anything? Can gradient descent really behaves like that on this class of functions?<br/>– How could we have guessed the inequality to use, and the shape of the corresponding proof? Obviously, the obscure fact is to arrive to inequality (1).  Therefore, is there a principled way for choosing the right inequalities to use, for example for studying convergence in terms of other quantities, such as  function values?<br/>– Is this the unique way to arrive to the desired result? If yes, how likely are we to find such proofs for more complicated cases (algorithms and/or function class)?</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the specific step size choice \(\gamma=\tfrac2{L+\mu}\), a partial answer to the first question is obtained by the observation that the rate is actually achieved on the quadratic function<br/> $$f(x)=\tfrac12 \, x^\top \begin{bmatrix}<br/> L &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \mu<br/> \end{bmatrix}x.$$ The following lines precisely target the missing answers.</p>



<h2>Worst-case analysis through worst-case scenarios</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start by rephrasing our goal, and restrict ourselves to the study of a single iteration. We fix our target to finding the smallest possible value of \(\rho\) such that the inequality<br/> $$ \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2  \leqslant       \rho^2 \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 $$ is valid for all \(x_k\) and \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k)\) (hence \(\rho\) is a function of \(\gamma\)). In other words, our goal is to solve<br/>$$ \rho^2(\gamma):= \sup \left\{ \frac{\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\, \big|\, f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k),\, \nabla f(x_\star)=0\right\}.$$<br/>Alternatively, we could be interested in studying convergence in other forms: for function values, we could target to solve the slightly modified problem:<br/> $$ \sup  \left\{ \frac{f(x_{k+1})-f(x_\star)}{f(x_{k})-f(x_\star)}\, \big|\, f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k),\, \nabla f(x_\star)=0 \right\}.$$ It turns out that in both cases, the problem can be solved both numerically to high precision, and analytically, and that the answer is \(\rho^2(\gamma)=\max\{(1-\mu\gamma)^2,(1-L\gamma)^2\}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The only thing we did, so far, was to explicitly reformulate the problem of finding the best (smallest) convergence rate as the problem of finding the worst-case scenario, nothing more. In what follows, some parts might become slightly technical, but the overall idea is only to reformulate this problem of finding the worst-case scenarios, for solving it.</p>



<h3>Dealing with an infinite-dimensional variable: the function \(f\)</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The first observation is that the problem of computing \(\rho\) is stated as an infinite-dimensional optimization problem: we are looking for the worst possible problem instance (a function \(f\) and an initial point \(x_k\)) within a predefined class of problems. The first step we take to work around this is to reformulate it in the following equivalent  form (note that we maximize also over the dimension \(d\)—we discuss later how to remove it):<br/>$$\begin{array}{rl} \rho^2:= \underset{f,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}{\sup} &amp;\displaystyle \frac{\lVert{x_{k}-\gamma g_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\\<br/> \text{s.t. }    &amp; \exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}:\, g_k= \nabla f(x_k),\, 0=\nabla f(x_\star).<br/>\end{array}$$<br/>This problem intrinsically does not look better (it contains an  existence constraint), but it allows using mathematical tools which are referred to as  <em>interpolation,</em> or <em>extension</em>, theorems [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00241.pdf">7</a>, <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01530908/file/DHLL_appendix.pdf">8</a>]. The problem is depicted on Figure 2:</p>

<p class="justify-text">It turns out that convex interpolation (that is, neglecting smoothness and strong convexity) is actually rather simple:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>given a convex function and an index set \(I\), any set of samples \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) of the form \(\{(\text{coordinate}, \text{(sub)gradient}, \text{function value})\}\)) satisfies, for all \(i,j\in I\): $$f_i \geqslant      f_j+\langle g_j; x_i-x_j\rangle,$$ by definition of subgradient, as illustrated on Figure 3.</li></ul>

<ul class="justify-text"><li>Formally, the reasoning allows arriving to the following “convex interpolation” (or “convex extension”) result, where we denote the set of (closed, proper) convex functions by \(\mathcal{F}_{0,\infty}\) (to be understood as \(L\)-smooth \(\mu\)-strongly convex functions with \(\mu=0\) and \(L=\infty\)): $$\begin{array}{c}\exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{0,\infty}: \,  g_k\in\partial f(x_k) \text{ and } f_k=f(x_k) \ \ \forall k\in  I\\ \Leftrightarrow\\ f_i \geqslant       f_j+\langle{g_j};{x_i-x_j}\rangle\quad \forall i,j\in I,\end{array}$$ where \(\partial f(x)\) denotes the subdifferential of \(f\) at \(x\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In the next section, we use a similar interpolation result for taking smoothness and strong convexity into account. The result is a bit more technical, but follows from similar constructions as those for convex interpolation—the main difference being that the interpolation is done on the Fenchel conjugate instead, in order to incorporate smoothness, see [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, Section 2].</p>



<h3>Reformulation through convex interpolation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Back to the problem of computing worst-case scenarios, we can now reformulate the existence constraint <em>exactly</em> using the following result (see [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>,  Theorem 4]): let \(I\) be a finite index set and let \( S=\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) be a set of triplets, then<br/>  $$\begin{array}{c}\exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}: \,  g_i=\nabla f(x_i) \text{ and } f_i=f(x_i) \text{ for all } i\in  I\\ \Leftrightarrow\\  f_i \geqslant      f_j+\langle{g_j};{x_i-x_j}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_i-g_j}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_i-x_j-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_i-g_j)}\rVert^2  \,\,\, \forall i,j\in I.\end{array}$$ Therefore, the previous problem can be reformulated as (recalling that \(g_\star=0\))<br/>$$  \begin{array}{rl} \underset{{f_k,\,f_\star,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}} {\sup}&amp;\displaystyle\frac{\rVert{x_{k}-\gamma  g_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}{\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}\\<br/>      \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\<br/>      &amp; f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2.<br/>\end{array}$$ </p>



<h3>Quadratic reformulation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The next step is to remove the ratio appearing in the objective function, which we do via an homogeneity argument, as follows.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Starting from a feasible point, scale \(x_k,\,x_\star,g_k\) by some \(\alpha&gt;0\) and \(f_k,\,f_\star\) by \(\alpha^2\) and observe it does not change the value of the objective, while still being a feasible point. Therefore, the problem can be reformulated as a nonconvex QCQP (quadratically constrained quadratic program): $$  \begin{array}{rl} \underset{{f_k,\,f_\star,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}} {\sup}&amp;\displaystyle{\rVert{x_{k}-\gamma  g_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}\\<br/>       \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\<br/>       &amp; f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\ &amp;{\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2} \leqslant      1,<br/> \end{array}$$  which is quadratic in \(x_k\), \(x_\star\) and  \(g_k\), and linear in \(f_\star\) and \(f_k\). Actually, in the current form, nonconvexity comes from the term “\(\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle\)” in the second constraint (and from the objective, due to maximization). It turns out that this problem can be reformulated <em>losslessly</em> using semidefinite programming (this is due to the maximization over \(d\), as commented at the end of the next section). </p>



<h3>Semidefinite reformulation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">At the end of this section, we will be able to compute, numerically, the values of the rate \(\rho^2(\gamma)\) for given values of the parameters \(\mu,\,L\), and \(\gamma\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The last step in the reformulation goes as follows: the previous problem can be reformulated as a semidefinite program, as it is linear in terms of the entries of the following Gram matrix<br/>$$G = \begin{pmatrix}<br/>     \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle \\ \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_k}\rVert^2<br/>     \end{pmatrix}\succcurlyeq 0,$$ and in terms of the function values \(f_k\) and \(f_\star\). From those variables, one reformulate the previous problem as $$\begin{array}{rl} \underset{f_k,\,f_\star,\, G\succeq 0}{\sup} \, &amp;{\mathrm{Tr} (A_\text{num} G)}\\<br/>      \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_k-f_\star+\mathrm{Tr} (A_1 G)\leqslant 0\\<br/>      &amp;  f_\star-f_k+\mathrm{Tr} (A_2 G)\leqslant 0 \\<br/>      &amp;\mathrm{Tr} (A_\text{denom} G) \leqslant      1,\end{array}$$ which is a gentle semidefinite program where we picked matrices \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) for encoding the previous terms. That is, we choose those matrices such that<br/> $$\begin{array}{rl}<br/>\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{denom}} G)&amp;=\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,\\  \mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{num}} G)&amp;=\lVert{x_k-\gamma g_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,\\ \mathrm{Tr}(A_1G)&amp;=\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2,\\ \mathrm{Tr}(A_2G)&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2L}\lVert g_k\rVert^2+\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert x_k-x_\star-\tfrac1L g_k\rVert^2.\end{array}$$ One possibility is to choose \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) as symmetric matrices, as follows: $$\begin{array}{cc}<br/> A_{\text{denom}}=\begin{pmatrix}     1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0     \end{pmatrix}, &amp; A_{\text{num}}=\begin{pmatrix}     1 &amp; -\gamma\\ -\gamma &amp; \gamma^2     \end{pmatrix}, \\ A_1=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)} &amp; -\tfrac12-\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} \\ -\tfrac12-\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} &amp; \tfrac{1}{2L}+\tfrac{\mu}{2L(L-\mu)}\end{pmatrix}, &amp;  A_2=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)} &amp; -\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} \\ -\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} &amp; \tfrac{1}{2L}+\tfrac{\mu}{2L(L-\mu)} \end{pmatrix}.\end{array}$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">All those steps can be carried out in the exact same way for the problem of computing the convergence rate for function values, reaching a similar problem with \(6\) inequality constraints instead—because interpolation conditions have to be imposed on all pairs of points in a set of \(3\) points: \(x_k\), \(x_{k+1}\) and \(x_\star\), instead of only \(2\) for the distance problem. The objective function is then \(f_{k+1}-f_\star\), the de-homogenization constraint (arising from the denominator of the objective function) is \(f_{k}-f_\star \leqslant     1\), and the Gram matrix is \(3\times 3\):<br/>$$G=\begin{pmatrix}<br/>     \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle&amp; \langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle\\ \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_k}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{g_{k+1}}\rangle \\<br/>     \langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \langle{g_{k+1}};{g_k}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_{k+1}}\rVert^2<br/>     \end{pmatrix}\succcurlyeq 0, $$ and the function values variables are \(f_k\), \(f_{k+1}\) and \(f_\star\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We provide the numerical optimal values of those semidefinite programs on Figure 5 for both convergence in distances and in function values. </p>

The results match exactly the expected \(\max\{(1-\gamma L)^2,(1-\gamma\mu)^2\}\) in both cases. Note that the corresponding SDPs can be solved both for “good and bad” choices of step sizes: if the step size is chosen wisely then \(\rho(\gamma)&lt;1\), and otherwise \(\rho(\gamma)\geqslant 1\). The SDP confirms the common knowledge that \(\gamma\in (0,2/L)\Rightarrow \rho(\gamma)&lt; 1\).

<p class="justify-text">As a conclusion for this section, let us note that we showed how to compute the “best” rates that are dimension independent. In general, requiring the iterates and gradient (e.g., \(x_k\) and \(g_k\) for the problem in terms of distance, and \(x_k\), \(g_k\) and \(g_{k+1}\) for function values, and potentially more vectors when dealing with more complex settings) to lie in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is equivalent to adding a rank constraint in the SDP. </p>



<h2>Duality between worst-case scenarios and combinations of inequalities</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Any feasible point to the previous SDP corresponds to a <em>lower bound</em>: a sampled version of a potentially difficult function for gradient descent. If we want to find <em>upper bounds</em> on the rate, a natural way to proceed is to go to the dual side of the previous SDPs, where any feasible point will naturally correspond to an upper bound on the convergence rate (by <em>weak duality</em>). As the primal problems were SDPs, their Lagrangian duals are SDPs as well. Let us associate one multiplier per constraint: $$ \begin{array}{rl}<br/>f_k-f_\star+\mathrm{Tr} (A_1 G)\leqslant 0&amp;:\lambda_1\\<br/>f_\star-f_k+\mathrm{Tr} (A_2 G)\leqslant 0&amp;:\lambda_2\\<br/>\mathrm{Tr}(A_\text{denom} G) \leqslant 1&amp;: \tau.<br/>\end{array}$$The dual is then<br/>$$\begin{array}{rl}<br/> \underset{\tau,\,\lambda_1,\,\lambda_2}{\min} &amp; \, \tau \\<br/> \text{s.t. } &amp; \lambda_1=\lambda_2,\\<br/> &amp; S:=A_\text{num}-\tau A_\text{denom}-\lambda_1A_1-\lambda_2A_2 \preccurlyeq 0,\\<br/> &amp;\tau,\lambda_1,\lambda_2 \geqslant  0.<br/> \end{array}$$ Hence, by weak duality, any feasible point to this last SDP corresponds to an upper bound on the rate: \(\tau \geqslant \rho^2\). A mere rephrasing of weak duality can be obtained through the following reasoning: assume we received some feasible \(\tau,\lambda_1,\lambda_2\) (and hence \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2\) and a corresponding \(S\preccurlyeq 0\)), we then get, for any primal feasible \(G\succcurlyeq0\):<br/>$$\begin{array}{rl}\mathrm{Tr}(SG)&amp;=\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{num}}G)-\tau\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{denom}}G)-\lambda_1\mathrm{Tr}(A_1G)-\lambda_2\mathrm{Tr}(A_2G)\\&amp;=\lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2\\ \,&amp;\,\,\,-\lambda_1[     f_k-f_\star+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2]\\ &amp;\,\,\,-\lambda_2 [f_\star-f_k+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2]\\ &amp;\geqslant \lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2, \end{array}$$ where the first equality follows from the definition of \(S\), the second equality corresponds to the definitions of \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\), and the last inequality follows from the sign of the interpolation inequalities (constraints in the primal) for any primal feasible point. Hence, we indeed have that any feasible \(\tau\) corresponds to a valid upper bound on the convergence rate, as $$S\preccurlyeq 0 \,\,\Rightarrow \,\, \mathrm{Tr}(SG)\leqslant 0\,\,\Rightarrow  \lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2\leqslant 0.$$ In order to obtain analytical proofs, we therefore need to find analytical dual feasible points, and numerics can of course help in this process! Let’s look at what the optimal dual solutions look like for our two running examples.</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li> in Figure 6, we provide the numerical values for \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) for the distance problem.</li></ul>

<ul class="justify-text"><li>For function values, the SDP is slightly more complicated, as more inequalities are involved (6 interpolation inequalities). We provide raw numerical values for the six multipliers in Figure 7.</li></ul>

<p>For those who want a bit more details, here are a few additional pointers:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Strong duality holds—a way to prove it is to show that there exists a Slater point in the primal, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, Theorem 6]—, and hence primal and dual optimal values match.</li><li>There might be different ways to optimaly combine the interpolation inequalities for proving the desired results. In other words: dual optimal solutions are often not unique—which is, in fact, quite a good news: I am sure nobody want to find the analytical version of the multipliers provided in Figure 7.</li><li>It is often possible to simplify the proofs by using fewer, or weaker, inequalities. This might lead to ”cleaner” results, typically (but not always) at the cost of ”weaker” rates. This was done for designing the proof for function values, later in this text.</li></ul>



<h2>Combinations of inequalities: same proofs without SDPs</h2>



<p class="justify-text">So far, we showed that computing convergence rates can be done in a very principled way. To this end, one can solve semidefinite programs—which may have arbitrarily complicated analytical solutions. Here, I want to emphasize that the process of <em>verifying</em> a solution can be quite different to that of<em> finding</em> a solution. Put in other words, although the dual certificates (a.k.a., the proofs) might have been found by solving SDPs, they can be formulated in ways that do not require the reader to know anything about the PEP methodology, nor on any SDP material, for verifying them. This fact might actually not be very surprising to the reader, as many proofs arising in the first-order optimization literature actually “only consists” in linear combinations of (quadratic) inequalities. On the one hand, those proofs can be seen as feasible points to “dual SDPs”, although generally not explicitely proved as such. On the other hand, proofs arising from the SDPs might therefore be expected to be writable without any explicit reference to semidefinite programing and performance estimation problems.<br/></p>



<p class="justify-text">In what follows, we provide the proofs for gradient descent, using the previous numerical inspiration, but without explicitly relying on any semidefinite program. The reader is not expected to verify any of those computations, as our goal is rather to emphasize that the principles underlying both proofs are exactly the same: reformulating linear combinations of inequalities.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For both proofs below, we limit ourselves to the step size regime \(0\leq   \gamma \leq \tfrac{2}{L+\mu}\), and we prove  that, in  this regime, \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\)—actually we only proof the upper bounds, but one can easily verify that they are <em>tight</em> on simple quadratic functions.  The complete proofs (for the proximal gradient method),  can be found in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04398.pdf">11</a>]. </p>



<h3>Example 1: distance to optimality</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Recall the notations: \(g_k:=\nabla f(x_k)\), \(f_k:= f(x_k)\), \(g_\star:=\nabla f(x_\star)\), and \(f_\star:= f(x_\star)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For distance to optimality, sum the following inequalities with their corresponding weights: $$\begin{array}{r}     f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2  :\lambda_1,  \\     f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\langle{g_\star};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2:\lambda_2.     \end{array}$$ We use the following values for the multipliers: \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2=2\gamma\rho(\gamma) \geqslant      0\) (see Figure 6). </p>



<p class="justify-text">After appropriate substitutions of \(g_\star\), \(x_{k+1}\), and \(\rho(\gamma)\), using respectively \(g_\star=0\), \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma g_k\) and \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\), and with little effort, one can check that the previous weighted sum of inequalities can be written in the form: $$ \begin{array}{rl}    \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2  \leqslant      &amp; \left(1-\gamma \mu \right)^2\lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2 -\frac{\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu))}{L-\mu} \lVert{\mu {(x_k  -x_\star)} – g_k}\rVert^2. \end{array}$$ This statement can be checked simply by expanding both expressions (i.e., the weighted sum and its reformulation) and verifying that all terms indeed match.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, using $$\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu)) \geqslant      0,  \text{ and } L-\mu \geqslant      0,$$ which are nonnegative by assumptions on the values of \(L\in(0,\infty)\), \(\mu\in (0,L)\) and \(\gamma\in(0,2/(L+\mu))\), we arrive to the desired $$ \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(1-\gamma \mu \right)^2\lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that, by using \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2\), the weighted sum exactly corresponds to the (scaled by a positive constant) inequality introduced in the early stage of this note for studying distance to optimality. However, the resulting expression is tight for all values of the step size here, whereas it was only tight for \(\gamma=2/(L+\mu)\) earlier, due to a different choice of weights! </p>



<p class="justify-text">The curious reader might wonder how to find such a reformulation. Actually, back in terms of SDPs, and using the expressions for the multipliers, it simply corresponds to $$\mathrm{Tr}(SG)=-\frac{\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu))}{L-\mu} \lVert{\mu {(x_k  -x_\star)} – g_k}\rVert^2.$$ In the example below, the reformulation is a bit more tricky—as \(\mathrm{Tr}(SG)\)  has two nonnegative terms, which were simply obtained by doing an analytical Cholesky factorization of the term \(\mathrm{Tr}(SG)\)—, but the idea is exactly the same.</p>



<h3>Example 2: function values</h3>



<p class="justify-text">For function values, we combine the following inequalities after multiplication with their respective coefficients:    </p>



<p class="justify-text">$$\scriptsize \begin{array}{lr}     f_k \geqslant      f_{k+1}+\langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_{k+1}}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_{k+1}}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_{k+1}-\frac{1}{L}(g_k-g_{k+1})}\rVert^2    &amp;:\lambda_1,\\<br/>f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{1}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2  &amp;:\lambda_2, \\<br/>f_\star \geqslant      f_{k+1}+\langle{g_{k+1}};{x_\star-x_{k+1}}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_\star-g_{k+1}}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_\star-x_{k+1}-\frac{1}{L}(g_\star-g_{k+1})}\rVert^2  &amp;:\lambda_3.     \end{array}$$ We use the following multipliers \(\lambda_1=\rho(\gamma)\), \(\lambda_2=(1-\rho(\gamma))\rho(\gamma)\), and  \(\lambda_3=1-\rho(\gamma)\) (obtained by greedily trying to set different combinations of multipliers to \(0\) in the SDP—see Figure 7 for the values without such simplifications).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Again, after appropriate substitutions of \(g_\star\), \(x_{k+1}\), and \(\rho(\gamma)\), using respectively \(g_\star=0\), \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma g_k\) and \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\), we obtain that the weighted sum of inequalities can be reformulated exactly as $$  \begin{array}{rl}          f(x_{k+1})-f_\star \leqslant      &amp;\left(1-\gamma \mu\right)^2 \left(f(x_k)-f_\star\right)\\&amp;-\frac{1}{2 (L-\mu)}\lVert \nabla f(x_{k+1})-(1-\gamma  (L+\mu))\nabla f(x_k) +\gamma  \mu  L (x_\star-x_k)\rVert^2\\<br/>&amp;-\frac{\gamma  L(2- \gamma  (L+\mu))}{2 (L-\mu )}\lVert \nabla f(x_k)+\mu  (x_\star-x_k)\rVert^2.\end{array}$$ Again, this statement can be checked simply by expanding both expressions (i.e., the weighted sum and its reformulation), and verifying that all terms match. The desired conclusion $$ f(x_{k+1})-f_\star \leqslant \left(1-\gamma \mu\right)^2 \left(f(x_k)-f_\star\right), $$ follows from the signs of the leading coefficients: \(\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu)) \geqslant      0\), and \(L-\mu \geqslant      0\).</p>



<h3>To go further</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Before finishing, let us mention that we only dealt with linear convergence through a single iteration of gradient descent.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are quite a few ways to handle both more iterations and sublinear convergence rates. Using SDPs, probably the most natural approach is to directly incorporate several iterations in the problem by  studying, for example, ratios of the form  $$\sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_0}  \frac{f(x_{N})-f_\star}{\lVert x_0-x_\star\rVert^2}. $$ This type of approach was used in the work of Drori and Teboulle [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3209.pdf">2</a>] and in most consecutive PEP-related works: it has the advantage of providing  comfortable “non-improvable results” [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07516.pdf">12</a>]   (by providing matching lower bounds) for any given \(N\), but requires solving larger and larger SDPs. Alternatively, simpler proofs can often be obtained through the use of  Lyapunov (or potential) functions—i.e., study a single iteration to produce recursable inequalities; a nice introduction is provided in [<a href="http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v015a004/v015a004.pdf">13</a>]. This idea can be exploited in PEPs [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00947.pdf">14</a>] by enforcing the proofs to have a certain structure. Those principles are also at the heart of the related approach using integral quadratic constraints [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1009597">3</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/hu17a/hu17a.pdf">15</a>]. </p>



<h2>Take-home message and conclusions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The overall message of this note is that first-order methods can often be studied directly using the definition of their “worst-cases” (i.e., by trying to find worst-case scenarios), along with their dual counterparts (linear combinations of inequalities), by translating them into semidefinite programs.</p>



<p class="justify-text">What we saw might look like an overkill for studying gradient descent. However, as long as we deal with Euclidean spaces, the same approach actually works beyond this simple case. In particular, the same technique applies to first-order methods performing explicit, projected, proximal, conditional, and inexact (sub)gradient steps [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07516.pdf">12</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, let us mention a few previous works illustrating that the use of such computer-assisted proofs allowed obtaining results that are apparently too complicated for us to find bare-handed—even in apparently simple contexts.  Reasonable examples include the direct proof for convergence rates in  function values [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04398.pdf">11</a>] presented above, but also proofs arising in the context of optimized numerical schemes [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3209.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2636">16</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5468.pdf">17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06600.pdf">18</a>]—in particular [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06600.pdf">18</a>] presents a method for minimizing the gradient norm at the last iterate, in smooth convex minimization—,  in the context of monotone inclusions [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00146.pdf">19</a>],  and even for more general fixed-point problems (e.g., for Halpern iterations [<a href="http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2017/11/6336.pdf">20</a>]).</p>



<h3>Toolbox</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The PErformance EStimation TOolbox (PESTO) [<a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/julien.hendrickx/availablepublications/PESTO_CDC_2017.pdf">21</a>, see <a href="https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox/graphs/traffic">Github</a>] allows a quick access to the methodology without worrying about details of semidefinite reformulations. The toolbox contains many  examples (about 50) in different settings, and include progresses on the approach, and results, by other groups (which are much more thoroughly referenced in the <a href="https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox/blob/master/UserGuide.pdf">user guide</a>). In particular, we included standard classes of functions and operators, along with examples for analyzing recent optimized methods.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The second Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place next Friday, March 27th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC).  <strong>Sujay Sanghavi</strong> from University of Texas at Austin will speak about “<em>Towards Model Agnostic Robustness</em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: It is now common practice to try and solve machine learning problems by starting with a complex existing model or architecture, and fine-tuning/adapting it to the task at hand. However, outliers, errors or even just sloppiness in training data often lead to drastic drops in performance. </p>



<p>We investigate a simple generic approach to correct for this, motivated by a classic statistical idea: trimmed loss. This advocates jointly (a) selecting which training samples to ignore, and (b) fitting a model on the remaining samples. As such this is computationally infeasible even for linear regression. We propose and study the natural iterative variant that alternates between these two steps (a) and (b) – each of which individually can be easily accomplished in pretty much any statistical setting. We also study the batch-SGD variant of this idea. We demonstrate both theoretically (for generalized linear models) and empirically (for vision and NLP neural network models) that this effectively recovers accuracy in the presence of bad training data.</p>



<p>This work is joint with Yanyao Shen and Vatsal Shah and appears in NeurIPS 2019, ICML 2019 and AISTATS 2020.</p>

    <title>Private and Secure Distributed Matrix Multiplication</title>
    <summary>Machine learning on big data sets takes a significant amount of computational power, so it is often necessary to offload some of the work to external distributed systems, such as an Amazon EC2 cluster. It is useful to be able to utilize external resources for computation tasks while keeping the actual data private and secure. In particular, matrix multiplication is an essential step in many machine learning processes, but the owner of the matrices may have reasons to keep the actual values protected. In this post, we’ll discuss four works about secure distributed computation. First, we’ll talk about a method of using MDS (maximum distance separable) error correcting codes to add security and privacy to general data storage (“Cross Subspace Alignment and the Asymptotic Capacity of X-Secure T-Private Information Retrieval” by Jia, Sun, Jafar).

<p>The data in the grey box is only given to the master, so workers only have access to what they receive (via green arrows). Later on we will also suppose the workers have a shared library not available to the master. The workers do not communicate with each other as part of the computation, but we want to prevent them from figuring out anything about the data if they do talk to each other.</p>



<p> This model is related to <em>private computation</em> but not exactly the same. We assume the servers are “honest but curious”, meaning they won’t introduce malicious computations. We also only require the master to receive the final result, and don’t need to protect any data from the master. This is close to the BGW scheme ([Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Wigderson ’88]), but we do not allow workers to communicate with each other as part of the computation of the result.</p>



<p> We consider <em>unconditional</em> or <em>information-theoretic</em> security, meaning the data is protected even if the workers have unbounded computational power. Furthermore, we will consider having <em>perfect  secrecy</em>, in which the mutual information between the information revealed to the workers and the actual messages is zero.</p>



<h2>X-Secure T-Private Information Retrieval</h2>



<p> Before we get into matrix-matrix multiplication, consider the problem of storing information on the workers to be retrieved by the master, such that it is “protected.” What do we mean by that? [Jia, Sun, and Jafar ’19] define X-secure T-private information retrieval as follows: </p>

<p>Given these constraints, Jia et al. give bounds on the capacity of the system. Capacity is the maximum rate achievable, where rate is defined as bits requested by the worker (<img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="L"/>, the length of a single message) divided by the number of bits downloaded by the worker. The bounds are in terms of the capacity of T-Private Information Retrieval, (which is the same as the above definition, with only requirement 2).</p>

<p>Jia et al. give schemes that achieve these bounds while preserving the privacy and security constraints by introducing random noise vectors into how data is stored and queries are constructed. The general scheme for <img alt="N&gt;X+T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3EX%2BT&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N&gt;X+T"/> uses <em>cross subspace alignment</em>, which essentially chooses how to construct the stored information and the queries such that the added noise mostly “cancels out” when the master combines all the response from the servers. The scheme for <img alt="N\leq X+T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Cleq+X%2BT&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N\leq X+T"/> is straightforward to explain, and demonstrates the idea of using error correcting codes that treat the random values as the message and the actual data as the “noise.”</p>



<p>For this scheme, the message length <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="L"/> is set to <img alt="N-X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N-X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N-X"/> (the number of nodes <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>, minus the maximum number of colluding servers <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X"/>).

<h2>Matrix Multiplication with Polynomial Codes</h2>

The methods for secure and private distributed matrix multiplication we will discuss shortly are based on <em>polynomial codes</em>, used by [Yu, Maddah-Ali, Avestimehr ’17] for doing distributed matrix multiplications robust to stragglers. Suppose the master has matrices <img alt="{\bf{A}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{m\times n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BA%7D%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_q%5E%7Bm%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{A}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{m\times n}"/> and <img alt="{\bf{B}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BB%7D%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_q%5E%7Bn+%5Ctimes+p%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{B}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times p}"/> for some finite field <img alt="\mathbb{F}_q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{F}_q"/>, and <img alt="m,n,p \in \mathbb{Z}^+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%2Cn%2Cp+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5E%2B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="m,n,p \in \mathbb{Z}^+"/>. Assume <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="m"/> and <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> are divisible by <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>, so we can represent the matrices divided into <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> submatrices: </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="{\bf{A}}= \begin{bmatrix}A_1\\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ A_m\end{bmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BA%7D%7D%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7DA_1%5C%5C+A_2+%5C%5C+%5Cvdots+%5C%5C+A_m%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{A}}= \begin{bmatrix}A_1\\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ A_m\end{bmatrix}"/>               and        <img alt="{\bf{B}}= \begin{bmatrix}B_1&amp; B_2 &amp; \dots &amp;B_n\end{bmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BB%7D%7D%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7DB_1%26+B_2+%26+%5Cdots+%26B_n%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{B}}= \begin{bmatrix}B_1&amp; B_2 &amp; \dots &amp;B_n\end{bmatrix}"/> </p>



<p>So to recover <img alt="\bf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{AB}"/>, the master needs each entry of: </p>



<p><img alt="{\bf{AB}} = \begin{bmatrix}A_1B_1 &amp; A_1B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_1B_n\\A_2B_1 &amp; A_2B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_2 B_n\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots\\A_mB_1 &amp;A_mB_2 &amp; \dots&#xA0; &amp; A_mB_n \end{bmatrix}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BAB%7D%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7DA_1B_1+%26+A_1B_2+%26+%5Cdots+%26+A_1B_n%5C%5CA_2B_1+%26+A_2B_2+%26+%5Cdots+%26+A_2+B_n%5C%5C%5Cvdots+%26+%5Cvdots+%26%5Cvdots+%26%5Cvdots%5C%5CA_mB_1+%26A_mB_2+%26+%5Cdots%C2%A0+%26+A_mB_n+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{AB}} = \begin{bmatrix}A_1B_1 &amp; A_1B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_1B_n\\A_2B_1 &amp; A_2B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_2 B_n\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots\\A_mB_1 &amp;A_mB_2 &amp; \dots&#xA0; &amp; A_mB_n \end{bmatrix}."/></p>



<p>The key idea of polynomial codes is to encode <img alt="A_1,...,A_m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1%2C...%2CA_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A_1,...,A_m"/> and <img alt="B_1,...,B_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_1%2C...%2CB_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B_1,...,B_n"/> in polynomials <img alt="\tilde{A}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}_i"/> and <img alt="\tilde{B}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{B}_i"/> to be sent to the <img alt="i^{th}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%5E%7Bth%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i^{th}"/> worker,  where they are multiplied and the result is returned. The goal of Yu et al. was to create robustness to stragglers, and so they add redundancy in this process so that not all workers need to return a result for the master to be able to determine <img alt="\bf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{AB}"/>. In particular, only <img alt="mn" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=mn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="mn"/> returned values are needed, so <img alt="N-mn" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N-mn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N-mn"/> servers can be slow or fail completely without hurting the computation. This method can be thought of as setting up the encodings of <img alt="\bf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{A}"/> and <img alt="\bf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{B}"/> so that the resulting multiplications <img alt="\tilde{C}_1=\tilde{A}_1\tilde{B}_1,...,\tilde{C}_N=\tilde{A}_N\tilde{B}_N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BC%7D_1%3D%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_1%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_1%2C...%2C%5Ctilde%7BC%7D_N%3D%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_N%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{C}_1=\tilde{A}_1\tilde{B}_1,...,\tilde{C}_N=\tilde{A}_N\tilde{B}_N"/> are evaluations of a polynomial with coefficients  <img alt="A_1B_1,A_1B_2,...,A_2B_1....,A_mB_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1B_1%2CA_1B_2%2C...%2CA_2B_1....%2CA_mB_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A_1B_1,A_1B_2,...,A_2B_1....,A_mB_n"/> at <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> different points — equivalent to a Reed-Solomon code. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1603" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/blog_fig7.png?w=1024"/></figure>



<p>This idea is adapted by [Chang, Tandon ’18] to protect the data from colluding servers: noise is incorporated into the encodings such that the number of encoded matrices required to determine anything about the data is greater than the security threshold <img alt="X &lt; N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3C+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X &lt; N"/>. Since the master receives all <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> responses it is able to decode the result of <img alt="\textbf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{AB}"/>, but no set of <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X"/> nodes can decode <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/>, <img alt="\textbf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{B}"/>, or <img alt="\textbf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{AB}"/>. Similarly, [Kim, Yang, Li ’19] adapts this idea to impose privacy on a matrix-matrix multiplication: workers are assumed to have a shared library <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_i%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M"/>, and the user would like to multiply <img alt="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D%7D%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_{D}"/> for some <img alt="D \in[1:M]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+%5Cin%5B1%3AM%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="D \in[1:M]"/> without revealing the value of <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="D"/> to the workers. The workers encode the entire library such that when the  encoding is multiplied by an encoded input <img alt="\tilde{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}"/> from the master, the result is useful to the master in decoding <img alt="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D%7D%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_D"/>.</p>



<p>Chang and Tandon consider the following two privacy models, where up to <img alt="\ell" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\ell"/> servers may collude. The master also has <img alt="K^{(A)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%5E%7B%28A%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="K^{(A)}"/> (and in the second model, <img alt="K^{(B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%5E%7B%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="K^{(B)}"/>), which are matrices of random values with the same dimensions as <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> (and <img alt="\textbf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{B}"/>). These are used in creating the encodings <img alt="\tilde{A}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}_i"/> (and <img alt="\tilde{B}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{B}_i"/>).</p>



<p> <img alt="\textbf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{B}"/> is public, <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> is private:</p>

<p>Both private:</p>

<p>Kim, Yang, and Lee take a similar approach of applying the method of polynomial code to <em>private</em> matrix multiplication. As before, there are <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> workers, but now the master wants to multiply <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> with some <img alt="{\textbf{B}}_D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\textbf{B}}_D"/> in shared library <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_i%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M"/> (all the workers have the shared library). </p>



<p>Since the master isn’t itself encoding <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M"/> it has to tell the workers how to encode the library so that it can reconstruct the desired product. This is done by having the master tell the workers what values of <img alt="\vec{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\vec{y}"/> they should use to evaluate the polynomial that corresponds to encoding each library matrix. We denote the encoding of the library done by each worker <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> as the multivariate polynomial <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="h"/> which is evaluated at <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M"/> and the node-specific vector <img alt="y^{(i)}_{[1:M]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E%7B%28i%29%7D_%7B%5B1%3AM%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="y^{(i)}_{[1:M]}"/> to get the node’s encoding, <img alt="\tilde{B}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{B}_i"/>. The worker multiplies this with the encoding of <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> it receives, <img alt="\tilde{A}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}_i"/> and returns the resulting value <img alt="Z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="Z_i"/>. All together, we get the following communication model: </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As we’ve seen, coding techniques originally designed to add redundancy and protect against data loss can also be used to intentionally incorporate noise for data protection. In particular, this can be done when out-sourcing matrix multiplications, making it a useful technique in many data processing and machine learning applications.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">This month, I will follow up on <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">last month’s blog post</a>, and describe classical techniques from numerical analysis that aim at accelerating the convergence of a vector sequence to its limit, by only combining elements of the sequence, and without the detailed knowledge of the iterative process that has led to this sequence. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Last month, I focused on sequences that converge to their limit exponentially fast (which is referred to as <em>linear</em> convergence), and I described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) method</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanks_transformation">Shanks transformation</a>, Anderson acceleration and its <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04133">regularized version</a>. These methods are called “non-linear” acceleration techniques, because, although they combine linearly iterates as \(c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m x_{k+m}\), the scalar weights in the linear combination depend non-linearly on \(x_k,\dots,x_{k+m}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will focus on sequences that converge sublinearly, that is, with a difference to their limit that goes to zero as an inverse power of \(k\), typically in \(O(1/k)\). </p>



<h2>Richardson extrapolation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a sequence \((x_k)_{k \geq 0} \in \mathbb{R}^d\), with an asymptotic expansion of the form $$ x_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k}\Delta + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big), $$ where \(x_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the limit of \((x_k)_k\) and \(\Delta\) a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The idea behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation">Richardson extrapolation</a> [<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.1911.0009">1</a>] is to combine linearly two iterates taken at two different values of \(k\) so that the zero-th order term \(x_\ast\) is left unchanged, but the first order term in \(1/k\) cancels out. For \(k\) even, we can consider $$  2 x_k – x_{k/2} =  2 \Big( x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta  +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big)  \Big) \, – \Big( x_\ast +  \frac{2}{k} \Delta  + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big) \Big)  =  x_\ast +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big).$$</p>

<p class="justify-text">The key benefit of Richardson extrapolation is that we only need to know that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion is proportional to \(1/k\), <em>without the need to know the vector \(\Delta\)</em>. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2481" height="280" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/richardson_2d.gif" width="332"/>Richardson extrapolation in two dimensions. The sequence is of the form \(x_k = \frac{1}{k} \Delta_1 + \frac{(-1)^k}{k^2} \Delta_2\). The extrapolated sequence \(2 x_k – x_{k/2}\) is only plotted for \(k\) even.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, following [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], I will explore situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful within machine learning. I identified three situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful (there are probably more):</p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>Iterates of an optimization algorithms \((x_k)_{k \geq 0}\), and the extrapolation is \( 2x_k – x_{k/2}.\)</li><li>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent, where we will combine iterates obtained from two different values of the step-size.</li><li>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter.</li></ol>



<p class="justify-text">As we will show, extrapolation techniques come with no significant loss in performance, but in several situations strong gains. It is thus “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences">unreasonably effective</a>“.</p>



<h2>Application to optimization algorithms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider an iterate \(x_k\) of an iterative optimization algorithm which is minimizing a function \(f\), thus converging to a global minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(f\). Then so is \(x_{k/2}\), and thus also $$  x_k^{(1)} = 2x_k – x_{k/2}.$$ Therefore, performance is never significantly deteriorated (the risk is essentially to lose half of the iterations). The potential gains depend on the way \(x_k\) converges to \(x_\ast\). The existence of a convergence rate of the form \(f(x_k) -f(x_\ast) = O(1/k)\) or \(O(1/k^2)\) is not enough, as Richardson extrapolation requires a specific direction of asymptotic convergence. As illustrated below, some algorithms are oscillating around their solutions, while some converge with a specific direction. Only the latter ones can be accelerated with Richardson extrapolation, while the former ones are good candidates for <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">Anderson acceleration</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2395" height="162" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nonoscillating_oscillating-1024x350.png" width="476"/> Left: Oscillating convergence, where Richardson extrapolation does not lead to any gain. Right: non-oscillating  convergence, with a main direction \(\Delta\) (in red dotted), where Richardson extrapolation can be beneficial if the oscillations orthogonal to the direction \(\Delta\) are negligible compared to convergence along the direction \(\Delta\). </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Averaged gradient descent.</strong> We consider the usual gradient descent algorithm $$x_k = x_{k-1} – \gamma f'(x_{k-1}),$$ where \(\gamma &gt; 0 \) is a step-size, with Polyak-Ruppert averaging [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>]: $$ y_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i.$$ Averaging is key to robustness to potential noise in the gradients [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070704277">5</a>]. However it comes with the unintended consequence of losing the exponential forgetting of initial conditions for strongly-convex problems [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4316-non-asymptotic-analysis-of-stochastic-approximation-algorithms-for-machine-learning.pdf">6</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">A common way to restore exponential convergence (up to the noise level in the stochastic case) is to consider “tail-averaging”, that is, to replace \(y_k\) by the average of only the latest \(k/2\) iterates [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-595/16-595.pdf">7</a>]. As shown below for \(k\) even, this corresponds exactly to Richardson extrapolation on the sequence \((y_k)_k\): $$ \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=k/2}^{k-1} x_i = \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i – \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k/2-1} x_i = 2 y_k – y_{k/2}. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">With basic  assumptions on \(f\), it is shown in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>] that for locally strongly-convex problems: $$y_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta + O(\rho^k), $$ where  \(\displaystyle \Delta = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (x_i – x_\ast)\) and \(\rho \in (0,1)\) depends on the condition number of \(f”(x_\ast)\). This is illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2507" height="250" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/averaged_gradient.png" width="342"/>Averaged gradient descent on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> problem in dimension \(d=400\), and with \(n=4000\) observations. For the regular averaged recursion, the line in the log-log plot has slope \(-2\). See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We can make the following observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Before Richardson extrapolation, the asymptotic convergence rate after averaging is of order \(O(1/k^2)\), which is better than the usual \(O(1/k)\) upper-bound for the rate of gradient descent, but with a stronger assumption that in fact leads to exponential convergence before averaging.</li><li>While \(\Delta\) has a simple expression, it cannot be computed in practice (but Richardson extrapolation does not need to know it).</li><li>Richardson extrapolation leads to an exponentially convergent algorithm from an algorithm converging asymptotically in \(O(1/k^2)\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Accelerated gradient descent.</strong> Above, we considered averaged gradient descent, which is asymptotically converging as \(O(1/k^2)\), and on which Richardson extrapolation could be used with strong gains. Is it possible also for the accelerated gradient descent method [<a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=dan&amp;paperid=46009&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng">8</a>], which has a (non-asymptotic) convergence rate of \(O(1/k^2)\) for convex functions?</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that the behavior of the iterates of accelerated gradient descent is exactly of the form depicted in the left plot of the figure above: that is, the iterates \(x_k\) oscillate around the optimum [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-084/15-084.pdf">9</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Flammarion15.pdf">10</a>], and Richardson extrapolation is of no help, but is not degrading performance too much. See below for an illustration. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2509" height="243" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/accelerated_gradient.png" width="332"/>Accelerated gradient descent on a quadratic optimization problem in dimension \(d=1000\). See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].  </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Other algorithms.</strong> It is tempting to test it on other optimization algorithms. For example, as explained in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], Richardson extrapolation can be used to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe</a> algorithm, where sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. Others could be tried.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While above we have focused on Richardson extrapolation applied to the number of iterations of an iterative algorithm, it is most often used in integration methods (for computing integrals or solving ordinary differential equations), and then often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method">Romberg-Richardson extrapolation</a>. Within machine learning, in a similar spirit, this can be applied to the step-size of stochastic gradient descent [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6514-stochastic-gradient-richardson-romberg-markov-chain-monte-carlo.pdf">11</a>], which I now describe.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the minimization of a function \(F(x)\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), which can be written as an expectation as $$F(x) = \mathbb{E}_{z} f(x,z).$$ We assume that we have access to \(n\) independent and identically distributed observations (i.i.d.) \(z_1,\dots,z_n\). This is a typical scenario in machine learning, where \(f(x,z)\) represents the loss for the predictor parameterized by \(x\) on the observation \(z\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">The stochastic gradient method is particularly well adapted, and we consider here a single pass, as $$x_i= x_{i-1} – \gamma f'(x_{i-1},z_i),$$ where the gradient is taken with respect to the first variable, for \(i = 1,\dots,n\). It is known that with a constant step-size, when \(n\) tends to infinity, \(x_n\) will <em>not</em> converge to the minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(F\), as the algorithm always moves [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0324039">16</a>], as illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2488" height="279" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/logistic_2d-1.gif" width="403"/>Stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem: (blue) without averaging, (red) with averaging.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">One way to damp the oscillations is to consider averaging, that is, $$ y_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i$$ (we consider uniform averaging for simplicity). For least-squares regression, this leads to a converging algorithm [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">12</a>] with attractive properties for ill-conditioned problems (see also <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-sum-of-a-geometric-series-is-all-you-need/">January’s blog post</a>). However, for general loss functions, it is shown in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>] that \(y_n\) converges to some \(y^{(\gamma)} \neq x_\ast\). There is a bias due to a step-size \(\gamma\) that does not go to zero. In order to apply Richardson extrapolation, together with Aymeric Dieuleveut and Alain Durmus [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>], we showed that $$ y^{(\gamma)} = x_\ast + \gamma \Delta + O(\gamma^2),$$ for some \(\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^d\) with some complex expression. Thus, we have $$2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2),$$ thus gaining one order. If we consider the iterate \(y_n^{(\gamma)}\) and \(y_n^{(2 \gamma)}\) associated to the two step-sizes \(\gamma\) and \(2 \gamma\), the linear combination $$2 y_n^{(\gamma)} – y_n^{(2\gamma)} $$ has an improved behavior as it tends to \(2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2)\): it remains not convergent, but get to way smaller values. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2525" height="274" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SGD_logistic-1.png" width="359"/>Averaged stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem in dimension 20.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Higher-order extrapolation.</strong> If we can accelerate a sequence by extrapolation, why not extrapolate the extrapolated sequence? This is possible if we have an higher-order expansion of the form $$ y^{(\gamma)} = \theta_\ast + \gamma \Delta_1 + \gamma^2 \Delta_2 + O(\gamma^3),$$ for some (typically unknown) vectors \(\Delta_1\) and \(\Delta_2\). Then, the sharp reader can check that $$3 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 3 y_n^{(2\gamma)} +  y_n^{(3\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first two orders \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma^2\). This is illustrated above for SGD.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not extrapolate the extrapolation of the extrapolated sequence? One can check that $$4 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 6 y_n^{(2\gamma)} + 4  y_n^{(3\gamma)}  -y_n^{(4\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first three orders of an expansion of \(y^{(\gamma)}\). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">binomial coefficient</a> aficionados have already noticed the pattern there, and checked that $$ \sum_{i=1}^{m+1} (-1)^{i-1} { m+1 \choose i} y_n^{(i\gamma)}$$ will lead to cancellations of the first \(m\) orders.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not go on forever? First because \(m+1\) recursions have to be run in parallel, and second, because the constant in front of the term in \(\gamma^{m+1}\) typically explodes, a phenomenon common to many expansion methods.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now explore the application of Richardson extrapolation to regularization methods. In a nutshell, regularization allows to make an estimation problem more stable (less subject to variations for statistical problems) or the algorithm faster (for optimization problems). However, regularization adds a bias that needs to be removed. In this section, we apply Richardson extrapolation to the regularization parameter to reduce this bias. I will only present an application to smoothing for non-smooth optimization (see an application to  ridge regression in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-smooth optimization problems</strong>. We consider the minimization of a convex function of the form \(f = h + g\), where \(h\) is smooth and \(g\) is non-smooth. These optimization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning and signal processing, where the lack of smoothness can come from (a) non-smooth losses such as max-margin losses used in support vector machines and more generally structured output classification [<a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2005/proceedings/papers/113_StructuredPrediction_TaskarEtAl.pdf">13</a>], and (b) sparsity-inducing regularizers (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">14</a>] and references therein). While many algorithms can be used to deal with this non-smoothness, we consider a classical smoothing technique below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Nesterov smoothing</strong>. In this section, we consider the smoothing approach of Nesterov [<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A_Files/Nesterov-2005.pdf">15</a>] where the non-smooth term is “smoothed” into \(g_\lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is a regularization parameter, and accelerated gradient descent is used to minimize \(h+g_\lambda\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">A typical way of smoothing the function \(g\) is to add \(\lambda\) times a strongly convex regularizer (such as the squared Euclidean norm) to the Fenchel conjugate of \(g\); this leads to a function \(g_\lambda\) which has a smoothness constant (defined as the maximum of the largest eigenvalues of all Hessians) proportional to \(1/\lambda\), with a uniform error of \(O(\lambda)\) between \(g\) and \(g_\lambda\). Given that accelerated gradient descent leads to an iterate with excess function values proportional to \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) after \(k\) iterations, with the choice of \(\lambda \propto 1/k\), this leads to an excess in function values proportional to \(1/k\), which improves on the subgradient method which converges in \(O(1/\sqrt{k})\). Note that the amount of regularization depends on the number of iterations, so that this smoothing method is not “anytime”.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Richardson extrapolation.</strong> If we denote by \(x_\lambda\) the minimizer of \(h+g_\lambda\) and \( x_\ast\) the global minimizer of \( f=h+g\), if we can show that \( x_\lambda = x_\ast + \lambda \Delta + O(\lambda^2)\), then \( x^{(1)}_\lambda = 2 x_\lambda – x_{2\lambda} = O(\lambda^2)\) and we can expand \( f(x_\lambda^{(1)})  = f(x_\ast)  + O(\lambda^2)\), which is better than the \(O(\lambda)\) approximation without extrapolation. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, given a number of iterations \(k\), with \( \lambda \propto k^{-2/3}\), to balance the two terms \( 1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \( \lambda^2\),  we get an overall convergence rate for the non-smooth problem of \( k^{-4/3}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>\(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation</strong>. Like above for the step-size, we can also consider \(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation \(x_{\lambda}^{(m)}\), which leads to a bias proportional to \(\lambda^{m+1}\). Thus, if we consider \(\lambda \propto 1/k^{2/(m+2)}\), to balance the terms \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \(\lambda^{m+1}\), we get an error for the non-smooth problem of \(1/k^{2(m+1)/(m+2)}\), which can get arbitrarily close to \(1/k^2\) when \(m\) gets large. The downsides (like for the extrapolation on the step-size above) are that (a) the constants in front of the asymptotic equivalent may blow up (a classical problem in high-order expansions), and (b) \(m\)-step extrapolation requires running the algorithm \(m\) times (this can be down in parallel). In the experiment below, 3-step extrapolation already brings in most of the benefits.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to experimentally study the benefits of extrapolation, for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">Lasso</a> optimization problem, and for a series of regularization parameters equal to \(2^{i}\) for \(i\) between \(-18\) and \(1\) (sampled every \(1/5\)), we run accelerated gradient descent on \(h+g_\lambda\) and we plot the value of \(f(x)-f(x_\ast)\) for the various estimates, where for each number of iterations, we minimize over the regularization parameter. This is an oracle version of varying \(\lambda\) as a function of the number of iterations. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">These last two blog posts were dedicated to acceleration techniques coming from numerical analysis. They are cheap to implement, typically do not interfere with the underlying algorithm, and when used in the appropriate situation, can bring in significant speed-ups.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will most probably host an invited post by my colleague <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/">Adrien Taylor</a>, who will explain how machines can <s>replace</s> help researchers that prove bounds on optimization algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As data science has broadened its scope in recent years, a number of domains have applied computational methods for classification and prediction to evaluate individuals in high-stakes settings. These developments have led to an active line of recent discussion in the public sphere about the consequences of algorithmic prediction for notions of fairness and equity. In part, this discussion has involved a basic tension between competing notions of what it means for such classifications to be fair to different groups. We consider several of the key fairness conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and in particular how these properties operate when the goal is to rank-order a set of applicants by some criterion of interest, and then to select the top-ranking applicants. The talk will be based on joint work with Sendhil Mullainathan and Manish Raghavan.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">I don’t know of any user of iterative algorithms who has not complained one day about their convergence speed. Whether the data are too big, the processors not fast or numerous enough, waiting for an algorithm to converge unfortunately remains a core practical component of computer science and applied mathematics. This was already a concern long before computers were invented (and most of the techniques I will describe date back to the early 19th century): imagine you are doing all the operations (multiplications, additions, divisions) by hand, wouldn’t you want some cheap way to accelerate your algorithm (and here literally reduce your pain)?</p>



<p class="justify-text">Acceleration is a key concept in numerical analysis and can be carried through in two main ways. The first way is to modify some steps of the algorithm (such as Nesterov acceleration for gradient descent, or <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">Chebyshev</a> / <a href="https://francisbach.com/jacobi-polynomials/">Jacobi</a> acceleration for linear recursions). This requires a good knowledge of the inner structure of the underlying algorithm. A second way is to totally ignore the specifics of the algorithm, and see the acceleration problem as trying to find good “combinations” of the observed iterates that converge faster.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I thus consider a sequence of iterates \((x_k)_{k \geq 0}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) obtained from an iterative algorithm \(x_{k+1} = T(x_k)\), which will typically be an optimization algorithm. The main question I will address is: Can we do better than outputting the last iterate?</p>



<p class="justify-text">This has a long history in numerical analysis, where many techniques have been developed for uni-dimensional sequences. Acceleration techniques vary according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_convergence">type of convergence</a> of the original sequence (quadratic, linear, sublinear), the amount of knowledge about the asymptotic behavior, and the possibility of extensions to high-dimensional and noisy problems.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Acceleration techniques are often based on an explicit or implicit modelling of the sequence \(x_k\), either through a model of the function \(T: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) (the iteration of the algorithm) or through an asymptotic expansion of \(x_k\). In this post, I will focus on linearly convergent sequences, that is, sequences \(x_k\) converging to some \(x_\ast\) at an exponential rate. As we will see, this will done through modelling \(x_k\) as an autoregressive process.</p>



<p class="justify-text">I will first start from the simplest scheme, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</a> from 1926 [1], then look at higher order generalizations still in one dimension, and finally to the general vector case. We will then apply all that to gradient descent.</p>



<h2>Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This is the simplest of all techniques and the source of all others in this post. We try to model \(x_k\in \mathbb{R}\) as first-order auto-regressive sequence, that is, \(x_{k+1} = ax_{k}+b\), for \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\). The method works by (a) estimating \(a\) and \(b\) from a sequence of few consecutive (here three) iterates, and (b) extrapolating by computing the limit \(x_{\rm acc}\) of the estimated model. Given that we fit the model to consecutive iterates \((x_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2})\), the model \((a,b)\) will also depend on \(k\), as well as its limit \(x_{\rm acc}\). In order to avoid having too many \(k\)’s in my notations, I will drop the dependence in \(k\) of the model parameters.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this situation, the model recursion has a limit when \(a \neq 1\), and the limit is \(x_{\rm acc} =  \frac{b}{1-a}\). In order to fit the two parameters, we need two equations, which can be obtained by considering two consecutive evaluations of the recursions (which require three iterates). That is, we consider the linear system in \((a,b)\): $$ \Big\{ \begin{array}{ll} ax_{k}+b  &amp; = x_{k+1} \\    ax_{k+1}+b &amp; = x_{k+2} \end{array}$$ which can be solved in a variety of ways. All of them are equivalent, but naturally lead to different extensions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Solving by elimination.</strong> We can eliminate \(b\) by subtracting the two equations, leading to $$ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1} = a ( x_{k+1} – x_{k}),$$  and thus $$a = \frac{ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}}.$$ We then get $$b = x_{k+1} – a x_{k} = x_{k+1} –  \frac{ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}} x_{k} =  \frac{  x_{k+1}^2 – x_{k} x_{k+2}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}}, $$ and the extrapolating sequence $$x_{\rm acc} = \frac{b}{1-a} = \frac{x_{k} x_{k+2} – x_{k+1}^2 }{-2 x_{k+1} + x_{k+2} + x_{k}},$$ which we denote \(x^{(1)}_k\), to highlight its dependence on \(k\). Note that to compute \(x^{(1)}_k\), we need access to the three iterates \((x_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2})\), and thus, when comparing the original sequence to the extrapolated one, we will compare \(x_k\) and \(x^{(1)}_{k-2}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Asymptotic auto-regressive model</strong>. A key feature of the acceleration techniques that I describe in this post is that although they implicitly or explicitly model sequence with auto-regressive processes, the models do not need to be correct, that is, they also work if the autoregressive recursion is true only asymptotically, for example \(\displaystyle \frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast}\) converging to a constant \(a \in [-1,1)\). Then we also get some acceleration, which can be quantified (see the end of the post for details), and for which we present a classical example below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Approximating \(\pi\).</strong> We consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80">Leibniz formula</a>, which is one of many ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80">approximating \(\pi\)</a>: $$ \pi = \lim_{k \to +\infty} x_k  \mbox{ with } x_k = 4 \sum_{i=0}^{k} \frac{(-1)^i}{2i+1}.$$ This formula can be proved by expanding the derivative \(x \mapsto \frac{1}{1+x^2}\) of \(x \mapsto \arctan x\) as a power series and then integrating it. We can check that $$\frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast} =  \ – 1 + \frac{1}{k} + o( \frac{1}{k}), $$ and as detailed at the end of the post, we should expect the error to go from \(1/k\) to \(1/k^3\).  Below, we show the first 10 iterates of the two sequences, with the correct significant digits in bold. $$ \begin{array}{|l|l|l|} \hline k &amp; x_k &amp;  x_k^{(1)} \\ \hline  1  &amp;   4.0000   &amp;  \times \\      2  &amp;  2.6667     &amp;    \times \\  3  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.4667   &amp; \mathbf{3.1}667 \\   4 &amp;   2.8952  &amp;  \mathbf{3.1}333 \\     5  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.3397  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}52 \\  6 &amp;   2.9760 &amp;   \mathbf{3.1}397 \\   7  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.2837  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}27 \\   8  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.0171  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}09 \\  9  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.2524  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}21 \\   10  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.0418 &amp;  \mathbf{3.141}3 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ We see that the extrapolated sequence converges much faster. This is confirmed in the convergence plot below:</p>

Notice the improvement from \(O(1/k)\) to \(O(1/k^3)\).</figure></div>



<h2>Higher-order one-dimensional extensions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process relies on fitting a first-order auto-regressive model, or on assuming that \(x_{k+1} – x_\ast – a (x_k – x_\ast) \to 0\) asymptotically. This can be extended to \(m\)-th order constant recursions. This corresponds to modelling \(x_k\) as the sum of \(m\) exponentials.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus try to fit the model $$x_{k+m} = a_0 x_k + a_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + a_{m-1} x_{k+m-1} + b = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i x_{k+i} + b, $$ which has \(m+1\) parameters. We thus need \(m + 1\) equations, that is we consider the recursion for \(k, k+1,\dots, k+m\), which requires the knowledge of the \(2m+1\) iterates \(x_k, x_{k+1},\dots,x_{k+2m}\). This leads to the \(m+1\) equations: $$x_{k+m+j} = a_0 x_{k+j} + a_1 x_{k+j+1} + \cdots + a_{m-1} x_{k+j+m-1} + b = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i x_{k+j+i} + b,$$ for \(j \in \{0,\dots,m\}\). This is a system with \(m+1\) unknowns and \(m+1\) equations, from which we could get all \(a_j\)’s and \(b\), and then the model limit as the extrapolated sequence \(x^{(m)}_k = \frac{b}{1 – a_0 – a_1 – \cdots – a_{m-1}}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This linear system can be solved in a variety of ways. At the end of the blog post, I show how it can be solved using determinants of Hankel-like matrices, often referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanks_transformation">Shanks transformation</a>, which then leads to an iterative algorithm dating back from Wynn [2], which is called the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_algorithme">\(\varepsilon\)-algorithm</a>. In order to smooth our way to the vector case extension, I will present it in a slightly non-standard way. See [3] for a detailed survey on acceleration and extrapolation.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Instead of learning the model parameters to estimate \(x_{k+m}\) from the past iterates, we focus directly on the prediction of the limit \(x_{\rm acc}\) by looking for real numbers \(c_0,\dots,c_m\) such that for all \(k\), $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_{k+i} – x_{\rm acc} ) = 0,$$ with the arbitrary normalization \(\sum_{i=0}^m c_i = 1\). The \(c_i\)’s can be obtained from the \(a_i\)’s and \(b\) as \((c_0,c_1,\dots,c_{m-1},c_m)\propto (a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{m-1},-1)\). We then have $$x_{\rm acc} = \sum_{i=0}^m c_{i} x_{k+i}.$$ Again, the parameters \(c_i\)’s depend on \(k\), but we omit this dependence.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to estimate the \(m+1\) parameters \(c_0,\dots,c_m\), we subtract two versions of the equality for \(k\) and \(k+1\), leading to $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_{k+1+i} – x_{k+i} ) = 0.$$ Defining the matrix \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times (m+1)}\) by $$U_{ji} = x_{k+1+i+j} – x_{k+i+j},$$ for \(i \in \{0,\dots,m\}\) and \(j \in \{0,\dots,m-1\}\), we have $$ U c = 0. $$ Together with the constraint \(1_{m+1}^\top c = 1\), this leads to the correct number of equations to estimate \(c\), from \(2m+1\) iterates \(x_k,\dots,x_{k+2m}\). The extrapolated iterate \(x^{(m)}_k\) is then $$x^{(m)}_k = x_{\rm acc} =   \sum_{i=0}^m c_{i} x_{k+i}.$$ Note that the extrapolation is exact when the sequence is exactly following a \(m\)-th order recursion. See an example of application on the Leibniz formula below.</p>

<h2>Extension to vectors</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider accelerating vector sequences \(x_k \in \mathbb{R}^d\). There are multiple approaches to extend acceleration from real numbers to vectors, as presented in [4, 5]. The simplest way is to apply high-order extrapolation to all coordinates separately (which is often called the vector \(\varepsilon\)-algorithm [10]); this depends however a lot on the chosen basis, requires too many linear systems to solve, and performs worse (see examples below for gradient descent). We now present a vector extension which exists under many names: the Eddy-Mesina method [6,7], reduced rank extrapolation [4, 11, 12], or Anderson acceleration [8]. </p>



<p class="justify-text">We want to model the sequence \(x_k \in \mathbb{R}^d\) as $$x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + b,$$ where \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) and \(b \in \mathbb{R}^d\). By a simple variable / equation counting arguments, there are \(d^2+d\) parameters, and we thus need \(d+1\) equations in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and thus \(d+2\) consecutive iterates, to estimate \(A\) and \(b\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to use only \(m+2\) iterates, with \(m \) much less than \(d\), we will focus directly on the extrapolation equation $$x_{\rm acc} = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m}, $$ with the constraint that \(c_0+c_1+\cdots+c_m =1\). Therefore, we will not try to explicitly fit the model parameters \(A\) and \(b\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">A sufficient condition for good extrapolation weights is that the extrapolated version is close for two consecutive \(k\)’s, that is $$c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m} \approx c_0 x_{k+1} + c_1 x_{k+2}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m+1},$$ which can be rewritten as $$c_0 (x_{k}-x_{k+1}) + c_1 ( x_{k+1} -x_{k+2}) + \cdots + c_m (x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1}) \approx 0.$$ A natural criterion is thus to minimize the \(\ell_2\)-norm $$ \big\| c_0 \Delta x_{k} + c_1  \Delta x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m \Delta x_{k+m} \big\|_2 \mbox{ such that } c_0+c_1+\cdots+c_m = 1,$$ where \(\Delta x_{i} = x_{i} -x_{i+1}\). Denoting \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times (m+1)}\) the matrix with columns \(\Delta x_{k}, \dots,  \Delta x_{k+m}\), we need to minimize \(\| U c \|_2\) such that \(c^\top 1_{m+1} = 1\), whose solution is $$ c \propto ( U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}, \mbox{ that is, } c = \frac{1}{1_{m+1}^\top (U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}}  ( U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}.$$ Note that while the weights \(c_0,\dots,c_m\) sum to one, they may be negative, that is, the extrapolated sequence is not always a convex combination (hence the name extrapolation). Moreover, note that unless \(m\) is large enough, the optimal \(U c\) is in general not equal to zero (it is when modelling real sequences, see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For \(m=1\), the solution is particularly simple, as we need to minimize $$ \|\Delta x_{k+1}  – c_0 ( \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k ) \|^2,$$ leading to $$c_0 = \frac{\Delta x_{k+1}^\top ( \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k )}{ \|  \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k \|^2} \mbox{ and } c_1 = \frac{\Delta x_{k}^\top ( \Delta x_{k} – \Delta x_{k+1} )}{ \|  \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k \|^2}.$$ The acute reader can check that when \(d=1\), we recover Aitken’s formula. See an example in two dimensions below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2276" height="319" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/anderson_2d.gif" width="380"/>Anderson acceleration in two dimensions. The sequence is following an auto-regressive process with a symmetric \(A\) with eigenvalues in \((-1,1)\). Anderson acceleration cancels the oscillation due to the eigenvalue with largest magnitude.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recovering one-dimensional sequence acceleration.</strong> Given a real sequence \(y_k \in \mathbb{R}\), we can define the vector \(x_k\) in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) as $$x_k = \left( \begin{array}{c} y_k \\  y_{k+1} \\ \vdots \\ y_{k+m-1} \end{array} \right).$$ One can then check that the matrix \(U\) defined for this vector sequence is exactly the same as the matrix \(U\) defined earlier for the real valued sequence. The optimal \(\| Uc \|\) is then equal to zero (which is not the case in general).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>When is it exact?</strong> The derivation I followed is only intuitive, and as for the other acceleration mechanisms, a natural question is: when is it exact? We will consider linear recursions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Analysis for linear recursions.</strong> Assuming that \(x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + b\) is exact for all \(k \geq 0\), then \(x_k – x_\ast = A^{k} ( x_0 – x_\ast)\), and thus, following [13], $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i (x_{k+i}-x_{k+i+1}) = \sum_{i=0}^m c_i A^{i} A^{k}(I – A )(x_0 -x_\ast) = P_m(A)(I – A) A^{k}(x_0 -x_\ast) ,$$ for \(P_m(\sigma)  =  \sum_{i=0}^m c_i \sigma^{i}\) a \(m\)-th order polynomial such that \(P_m(1) = 1\). We can write \(Uc\)  as $$ Uc = P_m(A) ( x_k – x_{k+1}) = ( I – A)  P_m(A)  (x_k – x_\ast) .$$ The error between the true limit and the extrapolation is equal to: $$  x_\ast – \sum_{i=0}^m c_i x_{k+i} = \sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_\ast – x_{k+i}  ) = P_m(A) (   x_\ast -x_{k}) = (I-A)^{-1} Uc.$$ Thus, we have $$ \Big\| x_\ast – \sum_{i=0}^m c_i x_{k+i} \Big\|_2 \leq \| U c \|_2 \times  \|(I – A)^{-1}\|_{\rm op} \leq \|(I – A)^{-1}\|_{\rm op}  \|I – A\|_{\rm op} \|P_m(A) ( x_k – x_\ast)\|.  $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The method will be exact when one can find a degree \(m\) polynomial so that \(P_m(A) (x_{k} – x_\ast) = 0 \), and a sufficient condition is that \(P_m(A)=0\), which is only possible if \(A\) had only \(m\) distinct eigenvalues. This is exactly minimal polynomial extrapolation [9]. Another situation is when \(m = d\) (like for the special case of real sequences above). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Otherwise, the method will be inexact, but the method can find a good polynomial \(P_m\), and the error is less than the infimum of \( \|P_m(A) ( x_k – x_\ast)\|\) over all polynomial of degree \(m\) such that \(P_m(1)=1\). Assuming that the matrix \(A\) is symmetric and with all eigenvalues between \(-\rho\) and \(\rho\) (which will be the case for the gradient method below), then the error is less than the infimum of \(\sup_{\sigma \in [-\rho,\rho]} |P_m(\sigma)|\),  which is attained for the Chebyshev polynomial (see a <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">previous post</a>). The improvement in terms of convergence is similar to Chebyshev acceleration, but (a) without the need to know \(\rho\) in advance (the method is totally adaptive), and (b) with a provable robustness when the iterates deviate from following an autoregressive process (see [13] for details).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Going beyond linear recursions. </strong>As presented, Anderson acceleration does not lead to stable acceleration (see the experiment below for gradient descent). The main reason is that when iterates deviate from an autoregressive process, or when the recursion is naturally noisy, the estimation of the parameters \(c\) is unstable, in particular because the matrix \(U^\top U\) which has to be inverted is severely ill-conditioned [14]. In a joint work with Damien Scieur and Alexandre d’Aspremont, we considered regularizing  the estimation of \(c\) by penalizing its \(\ell_2\)-norm. We thus minimize  \( \| U c \|_2^2 + \lambda \| c\|_2^2\) such that \(c^\top 1_{m+1} = 1\), whose solution is $$ c \propto ( U^\top U + \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}, \mbox{ that is, } c = \frac{1}{1_{m+1}^\top (U^\top U + \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}}  ( U^\top U +  \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}.$$ This simple modification leads to theoretical guarantees for non-linear recursions, and I will refer to it as regularized non-linear acceleration (RNA, see [13] for details; the “non-linearity” comes from the non-linear dependence of \(c\) on the iterates).</p>



<h2>Application to gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can apply RNA to the recursion, $$x_{k+1}  = x_k – \gamma \nabla f(x_k),$$ where \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) is a differentiable function, and \(\gamma\) a step-size. In the plot below, we consider accelerating gradient descent with \(m\)-th order RNA, with \(m=8\). We compare this acceleration with applying RNA to each variable separately (“RNA-univ.”), and to the unregularized version (“Anderson”). We can see the benefits of our simple extrapolation steps, and in particular the instability of unregularized acceleration.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2331" height="326" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/anderson_grad_nonest.png" width="419"/>Gradient descent on a regularized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> problem, with 1000 observations in dimension 100. We compare regular gradient descent, to plain Anderson acceleration (with no regularization), RNA [13] applied to each variable separately, and RNA. All accelerations are with order \(m =8\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In order to obtain stronger benefits from non-linear acceleration, several extensions are considered in [13]; in particular line search to find the good regularization parameter \(\lambda\) is quite useful. Another interesting extension is the <em>online</em> version of the algorithm [16, section 2.5], where the extrapolated sequence is used directly within the acceleration procedure, and not as a separate sequence with no interaction with the original gradient method: this corresponds to using RNA to accelerate iterates coming from RNA!</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, while the simplest theoretical guarantees come for deterministic convex optimization problems and gradient descent, RNA can be extended to stochastic algorithms [15] and to non-convex optimization problems such as the ones encountered in deep learning [16].</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I described acceleration techniques that combine iterates of an existing algorithm, without the need to understand finely the inner structure of the original algorithm. They come at little extra-cost and can provide strong benefits.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This month’s post was dedicated to algorithms which converge linearly, that is, the iterates are asymptotically equivalent to sums of exponentials. Next month, I will consider situations where the convergence is sublinear, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation">Richardson extrapolation</a> excels.</p>

<h2>Asymptotic analysis for Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In one dimension, we do not need the auto-regressive model to be exact, and an asymptotic analysis is possible. The asymptotic condition corresponds to \(\displaystyle \frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast}\) converging to a constant \(a \in [-1,1)\). More precisely if $$\frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast} = a + \varepsilon_{k+1},$$ with \(\varepsilon_k\) tending to zero, then we can estimate \(a\) through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitkens \(\Delta^2\) method</a> [1] as, $$ a_{k+1} = \frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{x_{k}-x_{k-1}} = \frac{(x_{k+1}-x_\ast) – (x_k-x_\ast) }{(x_{k} – x_\ast) -( x_{k-1}-x_\ast) } = \frac{ a + \varepsilon_{k+1} – 1}{1 – 1/(a+\varepsilon_{k})} = a + \varepsilon_{k+1} + o( \varepsilon_{k+1}).$$ A closer Taylor expansion leads to $$ a + \varepsilon_{k} + \frac{1}{a-1}( \varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}) + O(\varepsilon_{k}^2).$$ We can then provide a better estimate of \(x_\ast\) as $$ \frac{x_{k+1} – a_{k+1}x_k}{1- a_{k+1}} = x_\ast + \frac{x_{k+1} -x_\ast – a_{k+1}( x_k-x_\ast)}{1- a_{k+1}} = x_\ast + \frac{(a+\varepsilon_{k+1}-a_{k+1}) ( x_k – x_\ast)}{1-a_{k+1}},$$ whose difference with \(x_\ast\) is equivalent to $$ \frac{(a+\varepsilon_k-a_{k+1}) ( x_k – x_\ast)}{1-a }  \sim \frac{\varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}}{(1-a)^2} ( x_k – x_\ast).$$ We have thus provided an acceleration of order \(\displaystyle \frac{\varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}}{(1-a)^2} \).</p>



<h2>High-order Shanks transformation</h2>



<p>In order to relate our formulas to classical expressions, we first rewrite the recursion for \(m=1\) and then \(m=2\), and then to general \(m\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>First-order recursion (Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\)).</strong> We write the autorecursive recursion as $$ (x_{k+1} – x_\ast) = a ( x_{k} – x_\ast) \Leftrightarrow c_0(x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_\ast) = 0 ,$$ with the constraint \(c_0 + c_1 = 1\), that is, \(c_0 = \frac{-a}{1-a}\) and \(c_1 = \frac{1}{1-a}\). We can then write \(x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}\), and we have the linear system in \((c_0,c_1,x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ x_k &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using Cramer’s formula $$x_{\rm acc} = x_\ast = \frac{\left| \begin{array}{cc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}  \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} \end{array}\right|}{\left| \begin{array}{cc}  x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}  \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right|},$$  which leads to the same formula for \(x^{(1)}_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Second-order recursion.</strong> Here, we only consider the case \(m=2\) for simplicity. We consider the model, $$c_0 (x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1} – x_\ast)+ c_{2} (x_{k+2} – x_\ast) = 0, $$ with the normalization \(c_0 + c_1 + c_2 = 1\). We can then extract \(x_\ast\) as $$ x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} +  c_2 x_{k+2}.$$ In order to provide the extra \(2\) equations that are necessary to estimate the three parameters, we take first order differences and get $$c_0 (x_k -x_{k+1}) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}) +  c_2 ( x_{k+2} – x_{k+3} ) =0,$$ for \(k\) and \(k+1\). This leads to the linear system in \((c_0,c_1, c_2, x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3} &amp; 0 \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+2} &amp;  – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ c_2 \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c}  0  \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule">Cramer’s rule</a> (and classical manipulations of determinants) as $$x_k^{(2)} = \frac{\left| \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3}   \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4}   \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+2}    \end{array} \right|}{\left| \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3}     \\ x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4}   \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp;  \end{array} \right|}.$$  </p>



<p class="justify-text">The formula extends to order \(m\) (see below) and is often called the Shanks transformation; it is cumbersome and not easy to use. However, the coefficients can be computed recursively (which is to be expected for a Hankel matrix, but rather tricky to derive), through Wynn’s \(\varepsilon\)-algorithm.  See [3] for a survey on acceleration and extrapolation.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Higher-order recursion.</strong> We consider the model, for \(m \geq 1\), $$c_0 (x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1} – x_\ast) + \cdots + c_{m} (x_{k+m} – x_\ast) = 0, $$ with the normalization \(c_0 + c_1 + \cdots + c_m = 1\). We can then extract \(x_\ast\) as $$ x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m x_{k+m}.$$ In order to provide the extra \(m\) equations, we take first order differences and get $$c_0 (x_k -x_{k+1}) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}) + \cdots + c_m ( x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} ) =0,$$ for \(k, k+1,\dots, k+m-1\).

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In a <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">previous post</a> I reported on the beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">recent result</a> by Natarajan and Wright showing the astounding power of multi-prover interactive proofs with quantum provers sharing entanglement: in letters, <img alt="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEEXP%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}"/>. In this post I want to report on follow-up work with Ji, Natarajan, Wright, and Yuen, that we just posted to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">arXiv</a>. This time however I will tell the story from a personal point of view, with all the caveats that this implies: the “hard science” will be limited (but there could be a hint as to how “science”, to use a big word, “progresses”, to use an ill-defined one), the story is far too long, and it might be mostly of interest to me only. It’s a one-sided story, but that has to be. (In particular below I may at times attribute credit in the form “X had this idea”. This is my recollection only, and it is likely to be inaccurate. Certainly I am ignoring a lot of important threads.) I wrote this because I enjoyed recollecting some of the best moments in the story just as much as some the hardest; it is fun to look back and find meanings in ideas that initially appeared disconnected. Think of it as an example of how different lines of work can come together in unexpected ways; a case for open-ended research. It’s also an antidote against despair that I am preparing for myself: whenever I feel I’ve been stuck on a project for far too long, I’ll come back to this post and ask myself if it’s been 14 years yet — if not, then press on.</p>
<p>It likely comes as a surprise to me only that I am no longer fresh out of the cradle. My academic life started in earnest some 14 years ago, when in the Spring of 2006 I completed my Masters thesis in Computer Science under the supervision of Julia Kempe, at Orsay in France. I had met Julia the previous term: her class on quantum computing was, by far, the best-taught and most exciting course in the Masters program I was attending, and she had gotten me instantly hooked. Julia agreed to supervise my thesis, and suggested that I look into some interesting recent result by Stephanie Wehner that linked the study of entanglement and nonlocality in quantum mechanics to complexity-theoretic questions about interactive proof systems (specifically, this was Stephanie’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508201">paper</a> showing that <img alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BQIP%7D%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}"/>).</p>
<p>At the time the topic was very new. It had been initiated the previous year with a beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404076">paper</a> by Cleve et al. (that I have recommended to many a student since!). It was a perfect fit for me: the mathematical aspects of complexity theory and quantum computing connected to my undergraduate background, while the relative concreteness of quantum mechanics (it is a physical theory after all) spoke to my desire for real-world connection (not “impact” or even “application” — just “connection”). Once I got myself up to speed in the area (which consisted of three papers: the two I already mentioned, together with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0102013">paper</a> by Kobayashi and Matsumoto where they studied interactive proofs with quantum messages), Julia suggested looking into the the “entangled-prover” class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> introduced in the aforementioned paper by Cleve et al. Nothing was known about this class! Nothing besides the trivial inclusion of single-prover interactive proofs, IP, and the containment in…ALL, the trivial class that contains all languages.<br/>
Yet the characterization MIP=NEXP of its classical counterpart by Babai et al. in the 1990s had led to one of the most productive lines of work in complexity of the past few decades, through the PCP theorem and its use from hardness of approximation to efficient cryptographic schemes. Surely, studying <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> had to be a productive direction? In spite of its well-established connection to classical complexity theory, via the formalism of interactive proofs, this was a real gamble. The study of entanglement from the complexity-theoretic perspective was entirely new, and bound to be fraught with difficulty; very few results were available and the existing lines of works, from the foundations of nonlocality to more recent endeavors in device-independent cryptography, provided little other starting point than strong evidence that even the simplest examples came with many unanswered questions. But my mentor was fearless, and far from a novice in terms of defraying new areas, having done pioneering work in areas ranging from quantum random walks to Hamiltonian complexity through adiabatic computation. Surely this would lead to something?</p>
<p>It certainly did. More sleepless nights than papers, clearly, but then the opposite would only indicate dullness. Julia’s question led to far more unexpected consequences than I, or I believe she, could have imagined at the time. I am writing this post to celebrate, in a personal way, the latest step in 15 years of research by dozens of researchers: today my co-authors and I uploaded to the quant-ph arXiv what we consider a complete characterization of the power of entangled-prover interactive proof systems by proving the equality <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}"/>, the class of all recursively enumerable languages (a complete problem for RE is the halting problem). Without goign too much into the result itself (if you’re interested, we have a long introduction waiting for you), and since this is a personal blog, I will continue on with some personal thoughts about the path that got us there.</p>
<p>When Julia &amp; I started working on the question, our main source of inspiration were the results by Cleve et al. showing that the nonlocal correlations of entanglement had interesting consequences when seen through the lens of interactive proof systems in complexity theory. Since the EPR paper a lot of work in understanding entanglement had already been accomplished in the Physics community, most notably by Mermin, Peres, Bell, and more recently the works in device-indepent quantum cryptography by Acin, Pironio, Scarani and many others stimulated by Ekert’s proposal for quantum key distribution and Mayers and Yao’s idea for “device-independent cryptography”. By then we certainly knew that “spooky action-at-a-distance” did not entail any faster-than-light communication, and indeed was not really “action-at-a-distance” in the first place but merely “correlation-at-a-distance”. What Cleve et al. recognized is that these “spooky correlations-at-a-distance” were sufficiently special so as to not only give numerically different values in “Bell inequalities”, the tool invented by Bell to evidence nonlocality in quantum mechanics, but also have some potentially profound consequences in complexity theory. In particular, examples such as the “Magic Square game” demonstrated that enough correlation could be gained from entanglement so as to defeat basic proof systems whose soundness relied only on the absence of communication between the provers, an assumption that until then had been wrongly equated with the assumption that any computation performed by the provers could be modeled entirely locally. I think that the fallacy of this implicit assumption came as a surprise to complexity theorists, who may still not have entirely internalized it. Yet the perfect quantum strategy for the Magic Square game provides a very concrete “counter-example” to the soundness of the “clause-vs-variable” game for 3SAT. Indeed this game, a reformulation by Aravind and Cleve-Mermin of a Bell Inequality discovered by Mermin and Peres in 1990, can be easily re-framed as a 3SAT system of equations that is <em>not</em> satisfiable and yet is such that the associated two-player clause-vs-variable game has a <em>perfect</em> quantum strategy. It is this observation, made in the paper by Cleve et al., that gave the first strong hint that the use of entanglement in interactive proof systems could make many classical results in the area go awry.</p>
<p>By importing the study of non-locality into complexity theory Cleve et al. immediately brought it into the realm of asymptotic analysis. Complexity theorists don’t study fixed objects, they study families of objects that tend to have a uniform underlying structure and whose interesting properties manifest themselves “in the limit”. As a result of this new perspective focus shifted from the study of single games or correlations to infinite families thereof. Some of the early successes of this translation include the “unbounded violations” that arose from translating asymptotic separations in communication complexity to the language of Bell inequalities and correlations (e.g. this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5043">paper</a>). These early successes attracted the attention of some physicists working in foundations as well as some mathematical physicists, leading to a productive exploration that combined tools from quantum information, functional analysis and complexity theory.</p>
<p>The initial observations made by Cleve et al. had pointed to <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> as a possibly interesting complexity class to study. Rather amazingly, nothing was known about it! They had shown that under strong restrictions on the verifier’s predicate (it should be an XOR of two answer bits), a collapse took place: by the work of Hastad, XOR-MIP equals NEXP, but <img alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}"/> is included in EXP. This seemed very fortuitous (the inclusion is proved via a connection with semidefinite programming that seems tied to the structure of XOR-MIP protocols): could entanglement induce a collapse of the entire, unrestricted class? We thought (at this point mostly Julia thought, because I had no clue) that this ought not to be the case, and so we set ourselves to show that the equality <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}"/>, that would directly parallel Babai et al.’s characterization MIP=NEXP, holds. We tried to show this by introducing techniques to “immunize” games against entanglement: modify an interactive proof system so that its structure makes it “resistant” to the kind of “nonlocal powers” that can be used to defeat the clause-vs-variable game (witness the Magic Square). This was partially successful, and led to one of the papers I am most proud of — I am proud of it because I think it introduced elementary techniques (such as the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality — inside joke — more seriously, basic things such as “prover-switching”, “commutation tests”, etc.) that are now routine manipulations in the area. The paper was a hard sell! It’s good to remember the first rejections we received. They were not unjustified: the main point of criticism was that we were only able to establish a hardness result for exponentially small completeness-soundness gap. A result for such a small gap in the classical setting follows directly from a very elementary analysis based on the Cook-Levin theorem. So then why did we have to write so many pages (and so many applications of Cauchy-Schwarz!) to arrive at basically the same result (with a <img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>)?</p>
<p>Eventually we got lucky and the paper was accepted to a conference. But the real problem, of establishing any non-trivial lower bound on the class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> with constant (or, in the absence of any parallel repetition theorem, inverse-polynomial) completeness-soundness gap, remained. By that time I had transitioned from a Masters student in France to a graduate student in Berkeley, and the problem (pre-)occupied me during some of the most difficult years of my Ph.D. I fully remember spending my first year entirely thinking about this (oh and sure, that systems class I had to pass to satisfy the Berkeley requirements), and then my second year — yet, getting nowhere. (I checked the arXiv to make sure I’m not making this up: two full years, no posts.) I am forever grateful to my fellow student Anindya De for having taken me out of the cycle of torture by knocking on my door with one of the most interesting questions I have studied, that led me into quantum cryptography and quickly resulted in an enjoyable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4680">paper</a>. It was good to feel productive again! (Though the paper had fun reactions as well: after putting it on the arXiv we quickly heard from experts in the area that we had solved an irrelevant problem, and that we better learn about information theory — which we did, eventually leading to another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5514">paper</a>, etc.) The project had distracted me and I set interactive proofs aside; clearly, I was stuck.</p>
<p>About a year later I visited IQC in Waterloo. I don’t remember in what context the visit took place. What I do remember is a meeting in the office of Tsuyoshi Ito, at the time a postdoctoral scholar at IQC. Tsuyoshi asked me to explain our result with Julia. He then asked a very pointed question: the bedrock for the classical analysis of interactive proof systems is the “linearity test” of Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld (BLR). Is there any sense in which we could devise a quantum version of that test?</p>
<p>What a question! This was great. At first it seemed fruitless: in what sense could one argue that quantum provers apply a “linear function”? Sure, quantum mechanics is linear, but that is besides the point. The linearity is a property of the prover’s answers as a function of their question. So what to make of the quantum state, the inherent randomness, etc.?</p>
<p>It took us a few months to figure it out. Once we got there however, the answer was relatively simple — the prover should be making a question-independent measurement that returns a linear function that it applies to its question in order to obtain the answer returned to the verifier — and it opened the path to our subsequent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">paper</a> showing that the inclusion of NEXP in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> indeed holds. Tsuyoshi’s question about linearity testing had allowed us to make the connection with PCP techniques; from there to MIP=NEXP there was only one step to make, which is to analyze multi-linearity testing. That step was suggested by my Ph.D. advisor, Umesh Vazirani, who was well aware of the many pathways towards the classical PCP theorem (indeed a lot of the activity that led to the proof of the theorem took place in Berkeley, with many of Umesh’s current or former students making substantial contributions). It took a lot of technical work, yet conceptually a single question from my co-author had sufficed to take me out of a 3-year slumber.</p>
<p>This was in 2012, and I thought we were done. For some reason the converse inclusion, of <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> in NEXP, seemed to resist our efforts, but surely it couldn’t resist much longer. Navascues et al. had introduced a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that seemed to give the right answer (technically they could only show convergence to a relaxation, the commuting value, but that seemed like a technicality; in particular, the values coincide when restricted to finite-dimensional strategies, which is all we computer scientists cared about). There were no convergence bounds on the hierarchy, yet at the same time commutative SDP hierarchies were being used to obtain very strong results in combinatorial optimization, and it seemed like it would only be a matter of time before someone came up with an analysis of the quantum case. (I had been trying to solve a related “dimension reduction problem” with Oded Regev for years, and we were making no progress; yet it seemed <em>someone</em> ought to!)</p>
<p>In Spring 2014 during an open questions session at a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/qhc2014-1">workshop</a> at the Simons Institute in Berkeley Dorit Aharonov suggested that I ask the question of the possible inclusion of QMA-EXP, the exponential-sized-proofs analogue of QMA, in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. A stronger result than the inclusion of NEXP (under assumptions), wouldn’t it be a more natural “fully quantum” analogue of MIP=NEXP? Dorit’s suggestion was motivated by research on the “quantum PCP theorem”, that aims to establish similar hardness results in the realm of the local Hamiltonian problem; see e.g. <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/quantum-pcp-conjectures/">this post</a> for the connection. I had no idea how to approach the question — I also didn’t really believe the answer could be positive — but what can you do, if Dorit asks you something… So I reluctantly went to the board and asked the question. Joe Fitzsimons was in the audience, and he immediately picked it up! Joe had the fantastic ideas of using quantum error-correction, or more specifically secret-sharing, to distribute a quantum proof among the provers. His enthusiasm overcame my skepticism, and we eventually <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0260">showed</a> the desired inclusion. Maybe <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> <em>was</em> bigger than <img alt="{\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{NEXP}}"/> after all.</p>
<p>Our result, however, had a similar deficiency as the one with Julia, in that the completeness-soundness gap was exponentially small. Obtaining a result with a constant gap took 3 years of couple more years of work and the fantastic energy and insights of a Ph.D. student at MIT, Anand Natarajan. Anand is the first person I know of to have had the courage to dive in to the most technical aspects of the analysis of the aforementioned results, while also bringing in the insights of a “true quantum information theorist” that were supported by Anand’s background in Physics and upbringing in the group of Aram Harrow at MIT. (In contrast I think of myself more as a “raw” mathematician; I don’t really understand quantum states other than as psd matrices…not that I understand math either of course; I suppose I’m some kind of a half-baked mish-mash.) Anand had many ideas but one of the most beautiful ones led to what he poetically called the “Pauli braiding test”, a “truly quantum” analogue of the BLR linearity test that amounts to doing <em>two</em> linearity tests in conjugate bases and piecing the results together into a robust test for <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-qubit entanglement (I wrote about our work on this <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/pauli-braiding/">here</a>).</p>
<p>At approximately the same time Zhengfeng Ji had another wonderful idea, that was in some sense orthogonal to our work. (My interpretation of) Zhengfeng’s idea is that one can see an interactive proof system as a computation (verifier-prover-verifier) and use Kitaev’s circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction to transform the entire computation into a “quantum CSP” (in the same sense that the local Hamiltonian problem is a quantum analogue of classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSP)) that could then itself be verified by a quantum multi-prover interactive proof system…with exponential gains in efficiency! Zhengfeng’s result implied an exponential improvement in complexity compared to the result by Julia and myself, showing inclusion of NEEXP, instead of NEXP, in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. However, Zhengfeng’s technique suffered from the same exponentially small completeness-soundness gap as we had, so that the best lower bound on <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> per se remained NEXP.</p>
<p>Both works led to follow-ups. With Natarajan we promoted the Pauli braiding test into a “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">quantum low-degree test</a>” that allowed us to show the inclusion of QMA-EXP into <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>, with constant gap, thereby finally answering the question posed by Aharonov 4 years after it was asked. (I should also say that by then all results on <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> started relying on a sequence of parallel repetition results shown by Bavarian, Yuen, and others; I am skipping this part.) In parallel, with Ji, Fitzsimons, and Yuen we showed that Ji’s compression technique could be “iterated” an arbitrary number of times. In fact, by going back to “first principles” and representing verifiers uniformly as Turing machines we realized that the compression technique could be used iteratively to (up to small caveats) give a new proof of the fact (first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08618">shown</a> by Slofstra using an embedding theorem for finitely presented group) that the zero-gap version of <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> contains the halting problem. In particular, the entangled value is uncomputable! This was not the first time that uncomputability crops in to a natural problem in quantum computing (e.g. the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04573">spectral gap paper</a>), yet it still surprises when it shows up. Uncomputable! How can anything be uncomputable!</p>
<p>As we were wrapping up our paper Henry Yuen realized that our “iterated compression of interactive proof systems” was likely optimal, in the following sense. Even a mild improvement of the technique, in the form of a slower closing of the completeness-soundness gap through compression, would yield a much stronger result: undecidability of the constant-gap class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. It was already known by work of Navascues et al., Fritz, and others, that such a result would have, if not surprising, certainly consequences that seemed like they would be taking us out of our depth. In particular, undecidability of any language in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> would imply a negative resolution to a series of equivalent conjectures in functional analysis, from Tsirelson’s problem to Connes’ Embedding Conjecture through Kirchberg’s QWEP conjecture. While we liked our result, I don’t think that we believed it could resolve any conjecture(s) in functional analysis.</p>
<p>So we moved on. At least I moved on, I did some cryptography for a change. But Anand Natarajan and his co-author John Wright did not stop there. They had the last major insight in this story, which underlies their recent STOC best paper described in the previous <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">post</a>. Briefly, they were able to combine the two lines of work, by Natarajan &amp; myself on low-degree testing and by Ji et al. on compression, to obtain a compression that is specially tailored to the existing <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> protocol for NEXP and compresses that protocol without reducing its completeness-soundness gap. This then let them show Ji’s result that <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> contains NEEXP, but this time with constant gap! The result received well-deserved attention. In particular, it is the first in this line of works to not suffer from any caveats (such as a closing gap, or randomized reductions, or some kind of “unfair” tweak on the model that one could attribute the gain in power to), and it implies an unconditional separation between MIP and <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>.</p>
<p>As they were putting the last touches on their result, suddenly something happened, which is that a path towards a much bigger result opened up. What Natarajan &amp; Wright had achieved is a one-step gapless compression. In our iterated compression paper we had observed that iterated gapless compression would lead to <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}"/>, implying negative answers to the aforementioned conjectures. So then?</p>
<p>I suppose it took some more work, but in some way all the ideas had been laid out in the previous 15 years of work in the complexity of quantum interactive proof systems; we just had to put it together. And so a decade after the characterization <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4737">QIP = PSPACE</a> of single-prover quantum interactive proof systems, we have arrived at a characterization of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems, <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}"/>. With one author in common between the two papers: congratulations Zhengfeng!</p>
<p>Even though we just posted a paper, in a sense there is much more left to do. I am hopeful that our complexity-theoretic result will attract enough interest from the mathematicians’ community, and especially operator algebraists, for whom CEP is a central problem, that some of them will be willing to devote time to understanding the result. I also recognize that much effort is needed on our own side to make it accessible in the first place! I don’t doubt that eventually complexity theory will not be needed to obtain the purely mathematical consequences; yet I am hopeful that some of the ideas may eventually find their way into the construction of interesting mathematical objects (such as, who knows, a non-hyperlinear group).</p>
<p>That was a good Masters project…thanks Julia!</p></div>

<h2>From numbers to operators</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The simplest version of this basic result for real numbers is the following: $$ \forall r \neq 1, \ \forall n \geq 0, \   \sum_{k=0}^n r^k = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r},$$ and is typically proved by multiplying the two sides by \(1-r\) and forming a telescoping sum. When \(|r|&lt;1\), we can let \(n\) tend to infinity and get $$ \forall |r| &lt;  1, \  \sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = \frac{1}{1-r}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proofs without words.</strong> There is a number of classical proofs of the last identities, many of them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_without_words">without words</a>, presented in the beautiful series of books by Roger Nelsen [1, 2, 3]. I particularly like the two below.</p>

Adapted from [1, p. 118].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>High school: from philosophy to trigonometry.</strong> Before looking at extensions beyond real numbers, I can’t resist mentioning some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes">Zeno’s paradoxes</a>, like Achilles and the tortoise, which are intimately linked with the sum of a geometric series (and which were a highlight of my high school philosophy “career”).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Speaking of high school, it is interesting to note that there, the core identity of this blog post, is often used as \(a^{n+1}-b^{n+1} = (a-b)(a^n+a^{n-1}b+\cdots+ab^{n-1}+b^{n})\) in order to factorize polynomials (and not in the other way around like done later in this post).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another nice elementary use of geometric series comes up with complex numbers, in order to compute sum of cosines, such as: $$\! \sum_{k=0}^n \! \cos k\theta = {\rm Re} \Big(\!\sum_{k=0}^n e^{ i k \theta}\!\Big) = {\rm Re} \Big(\!\frac{e^{i(n+1)\theta}-1}{e^{i\theta}-1}\!\Big) =  {\rm Re} \Big(\! \frac{ \sin \frac{n+1}{2} \theta e^{i(n+1)\theta/2}}{ \sin \frac{\theta}{2} e^{i\theta/2} }\!\Big) = \frac{  \sin \frac{n+1}{2} \theta}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} \cos \frac{n\theta}{2}. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Square matrices and operators.</strong> Within applied mathematics, the matrix and operator versions are the most useful. For \(A\) a square matrix or any linear operator, we have $$ \forall A \mbox{ such that } I-A \mbox{ is invertible}, \  \sum_{k=0}^n A^k = (I-A)^{-1}(I-A^{n+1}),$$ with the classical proof: \(\displaystyle (I – A)\sum_{k=0}^n A^k = \sum_{k=0}^n A^k – \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} A^k = I – A^{n+1}.\)</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\| A\| &lt;1\) for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm">matrix norm</a> induced from a vector norm, we can let \(n\) go to infinity, to obtain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_series">Neumann series</a> \(\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} A^k = (I-A)^{-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are now ready to talk about machine learning and optimization!</p>



<h2>Stochastic gradient for quadratic functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Matrix geometric series come up naturally when analyzing iterative algorithms based on linear recursions. In this blog post, I will focus on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) techniques to solve the following problem: $$ \min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d} F(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E} \big[ y – \theta^\top \Phi(x) \big]^2,$$ where the expectation is taken with respect to some joint distribution on \((x,y)\). We denote by \(\theta_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^d\) the minimizer of the objective function above (which is assumed to exist). We assume the feature vector \(\Phi(x)\) is high-dimensional, so that the moment matrix \(H = \mathbb{E} \big[ \Phi(x)\Phi(x)^\top \big]\) cannot be assumed to be invertible.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stochastic gradient descent recursion. </strong>Starting from some initial guess \(\theta_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d\), typically \(\theta_0 =0\), the SGD recursion is: $$  \theta_n = \theta_{n-1} – \gamma ( \theta_{n-1}^\top \Phi(x_n) \, – y_n) \Phi(x_n),$$ where \((x_n,y_n)\) is an independent sample from the distribution mentioned above, and \(\gamma &gt; 0\) is the step-size. This algorithm dates back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_approximation">Robbins and Monro</a> in the 50’s and is particularly adapted to machine learning as it updates the parameter \(\theta\) after each observation \((x_n,y_n)\) (as opposed to waiting for a full pass over the data).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Denoting \(\varepsilon_n = y_n – \theta_\ast^\top \Phi(x_n)\) the residual between the observation \(y_n\) and the optimal linear prediction \(\theta_\ast^\top \Phi(x_n)\), we can rewrite the SGD recursion as $$\theta_n = \theta_{n-1} – \gamma ( \theta_{n-1}^\top \Phi(x_n) \, – \theta_{\ast}^\top \Phi(x_n) -\, \varepsilon_n) \Phi(x_n),$$ leading to $$\theta_n \, – \theta_\ast = \big[ I – \gamma \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top \big] ( \theta_{n-1}- \theta_\ast) + \gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This is a stochastic linear recursion on the deviation to optimum \(\theta_n \, – \theta_\ast\). The expectation of the SGD recursion is: $$\mathbb{E} [ \theta_n] \, – \theta_\ast = \big[ I – \gamma H \big] ( \mathbb{E}[ \theta_{n-1}] – \theta_\ast), $$ where \(H = \mathbb{E} \big[ \Phi(x) \Phi(x)^\top \big]\), and where we have used that  \(\gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n)\) has zero expectation (as a consequence of optimality conditions for \(\theta_\ast\)). This is exactly the gradient descent recursion on the expected loss (which cannot be run in practice because we only have access to a finite amount of data).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simplification. </strong>The main difficulty in analyzing the stochastic recursion is the presence of two sources of randomness when compared to the gradient descent recursion: (A) some additive noise \(\gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n)\) independent of the current iterate \(\theta_{n-1}\) and with zero expectation, and (B) some multiplicative noise \(\gamma \big[  H – \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top \big] (\theta_{n-1} – \theta_\ast)\), which comes from the use of \(  I – \gamma \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top  \) instead of \(I – \gamma H\), and depends on the current iterate \(\theta_{n-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, for simplicity, I will ignore the multiplicative noise and only focus on the additive noise, and thus consider the recursion $$\theta_n\, – \theta_\ast = ( I – \gamma H )  ( \theta_{n-1}- \theta_\ast) + \gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n).$$ Detailed studies with multiplicative noise can be found in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/defossez15.pdf">5</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-335/16-335.pdf">6</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-595/16-595.pdf">7</a>], and lead to similar results. Moreover, I will assume (again for simplicity) that \(\varepsilon_n\) and \(\Phi(x_n)\) are independent, and that \(\mathbb{E} [ \varepsilon_n^2 ] = \sigma^2\) (which corresponds to uniform noise of variance \(\sigma^2\) on top of the optimal linear predictions); again, results directly extends without this assumption.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bias / variance decomposition. </strong>Having a constant multiplicative term \(I – \gamma H\) in the recursion leads to an explicit formula: $$\theta_n – \theta_\ast = ( I – \gamma H ) ^n ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \sum_{k=1}^n \gamma  ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k} \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k),$$ which is now easy to analyze. It is the sum of a deterministic term depending on initial conditions,  and a zero mean term which is the sum of independent zero-mean terms due to the noise in the gradients. Thus, we can compute the expectation of the excess risk \(F(\theta_n)\, – F(\theta_\ast) = \frac{1}{2} ( \theta_n – \theta_\ast)^\top H ( \theta_n – \theta_\ast)\), as follows: $$\! \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_n) \,- F(\theta_\ast)\big] = {\rm Bias} + { \rm Variance}, $$ where the bias term characterizes the forgetting of initial conditions: $$ {\rm Bias} = \frac{1}{2}  ( \theta_0 – \theta_\ast)^\top ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n} H ( \theta_0 – \theta_\ast),  $$ and the variance term characterizes the effect of the noise: $${\rm Variance} =  \frac{\gamma^2 }{2}\! \sum_{k=1}^n \! \mathbb{E} \big[ \varepsilon_k^2 \Phi(x_k)^\top ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n-2k}H  \Phi(x_k) \big] = \frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}\! \sum_{k=1}^n \! {\rm tr} \big[  ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n-2k}H^2   \big] .$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The bias term is exactly the convergence rate of gradient descent on the expected risk, and can be controlled by upper-bounding the eigenvalues of the matrix  \(( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n} H\). As shown at the end of the post, when \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), where \(L\) is the largest eigenvalue of \(H\), then this matrix has all eigenvalues less than \(1/(4n\gamma)\), leading to a bound on the bias term of $$ \frac{1}{8 \gamma n} \|\theta_0 – \theta_\ast\|^2.$$ We recover the traditional \(O(1/n)\) convergence rate of gradient descent. For the variance term we use the sum of a geometric series, to obtain the bound $$\frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}   {\rm tr} \big[ H^2( I – (I – \gamma H)^2 )^{-1}  \big] = \frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}  {\rm tr} \big[ H^2( 2\gamma H – \gamma^2 H^2 )^{-1}  \big] \leq \frac{\gamma  \sigma^2}{2}  {\rm tr}(H) .$$ While the bias term that characterizes the forgetting of initial conditions goes to zero as \(n\) goes to infinity, this is not the case for the variance term. This is the traditional lack of convergence of SGD with a constant step-size. In the left plot of the figure below, we compare deterministic gradient descent to stochastic gradient with a constant step-size. For convergence rates in higher dimension, see further below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2039" height="236" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/paths_video-1.gif" width="564"/>Gradient descent algorithms run from the same starting point. Left plot: plain gradient descent (GD), plain (non-averaged) gradient descent (SGD). Right plot: averaged SGD with uniform weights (ASGD-1) and with weights proportional to the iteration index (ASGD-k).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Convergence can be obtained by using a decreasing step-size, typically of the order \(1 / \sqrt{n},\) leading to an overall convergence rate proportional to \(1 / \sqrt{n}.\) This can be improved through averaging, which I now present.</p>



<h2>Impact of averaging</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the averaged iterate \(\bar{\theta}_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n \theta_k\), an off-line (no interaction with the stochastic recursion) averaging often referred to as Polyak–Ruppert averaging, after [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">8</a>, 9]. The averaged iterate can also be expressed as a linear function of initial conditions and noise variables as $$\bar{\theta}_n -\theta_\ast = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n  ( I – \gamma H ) ^k ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \frac{\gamma}{n+1}   \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{j=k}^n   ( I – \gamma H ) ^{j-k} \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k).$$ Geometric series come in again! We can get a closed form for \(\bar{\theta}_n -\theta_\ast\) as: $$\frac{1}{n+1} (\gamma H)^{-1} \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big] ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \frac{\gamma}{n+1} (\gamma H)^{-1} \sum_{k=1}^n \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k+1} \big] \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The bound on \(\mathbb{E} \big[ F(\bar{\theta}_n) \,- F(\theta_\ast)\big] \), will here also be composed of a bias term and a variance term. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bias.</strong> The bias term is equal to $$\frac{1}{2(n+1)^2}( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) ^\top   (\gamma H)^{-2} H \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big]^2 ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast).$$ Using the fact that the eigenvalues of the matrix \( (\gamma H)^{-2} H \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big]^2\) are all less than \((n+1)/\gamma\) (see proof at the end of the post), we obtain the upper bound $$ \frac{1}{2 (n+1)\gamma} \| \theta_0 – \theta_\ast\|^2,$$ which is essentially the same than with averaging (but, see an important difference in the discussion below, regarding the behavior for large \(n\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Variance.</strong> The variance term is equal to $$ \frac{\gamma^2}{2 (n+1)^2}  \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma^2 {\rm tr} \Big( \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k+1} \big]^2 (\gamma H)^{-2} H^2 \Big).$$ Using the positivity of the matrix \(( I – \gamma H )\), we finally obtain the following bound for variance term: $$  \frac{ \sigma^2 n {\rm tr}(I)}{2(n+1)^2}\leq \frac{\sigma^2 d}{2n}.$$ We now have a convergent algorithm, and we recover traditional quantities from the statistical analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least-squares regression</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Experiments.</strong> Now, both bias and variance are converging at rate \(1/n\). See an illustration in two dimensions in the right plot of the figure above, as well as a convergence rates below. In these two figures, what differs is the decay of eigenvalues of \(H\) (fast in the first figure, slower in the second).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2029" height="235" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rates_d3-1-1024x453.png" width="533"/>Bias (left) and variance (right) terms for plain SGD, averaged SGD with uniform averaging (ASGD-1) and non-uniform averaging (ASGD-k).

<p>We can make the following observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Depending on the amount of noise in the gradients, the sum of the variance and the bias terms will either be dominated by one of the two; typically the bias term in early iterations, and then the variance term (see more  details in [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/defossez15.pdf">5</a>]).</li><li>The variance term of non-averaged SGD is converging to a constant (while the bias term is exactly the one of regular gradient descent).</li><li>With averaging, the variance terms decay as a line in a log-log plot. The reader with good eyes can check that the slope is indeed -1, thus illustrating the convergence rate in \(1/n\) (here the bound is tight). For the variance terms (right plots), there is no significant difference between the two eigenvalue decays.</li><li>The bias terms have different behaviors for the two decays. For the fast decays (top plot), the bounds in \(1/n\) are reasonably tight (lines of slope -1). For slower decay, we see some strong-convexity behavior entering the scene, as the slowest eigenvalue is 1/100 and the number of iterations is far larger than 100, and thus the optimization problem looks strongly convex, and then the bias term of plain SGD (which corresponds to deterministic gradient descent) converges exponentially fast, while the two averaging techniques decay as powers of \(n\) (again, the acute reader can spot slopes of -2 and -4, and the smart reader can explain why; more on this in a future post dedicated to SGD).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Pros and cons of averaging.</strong> Overall, we can see that averaging may slow down the forgetting of initial conditions, while it makes the method robust to noise in the gradients. The trade-off depends on the amount of noise, but in most high-dimensional learning problems and for the accuracies practitioners are interested in (no need to have an excess risk of \(10^{-5}\) then the best risk is of order \(10^{-1}\)), the bias term is the one which is seen the most. Thus, a less-aggressive form of averaging that puts more weights on later iterates seems advantageous (pink curve above). More on this in a future blog post.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond least-squares.</strong> In this blog post, to illustrate the use of sums of geometric series, I have focused on an idealized version (no multiplicative noise) of least-squares regression. For other losses, e.g., logistic loss, the analysis is more involved, and averaging does not lead to a converging algorithm, but transforms a term in \(\gamma\) into a term in \(\gamma^2\), which is still a significant improvement when the step-size \(\gamma\) is small (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">10</a>] for more details).</p>



<h3>Extensions</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The sum of a geometric series can be extended in a variety of ways. For example, we can take the derivative with respect to \(r\), to get $$ \forall r \neq 1, \  \sum_{k=1}^n k r^{k-1} = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{(1-r)^2} – \frac{ (n+1) r^n}{1-r} = \frac{1 + n r^{n+1} – (n+1) r^n }{(1-r)^2}.$$ This is useful for example to compute the performance of the weighted average \(\frac{2}{n(n+1)} \sum_{k=1}^n k \theta_k\). This can be extended further with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_series">binomial series</a> $$ (1-r)^{-1-\beta} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty { k + \beta \choose k} r^k. $$</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I have essentially used the sum of a geometric series as an excuse to talk about stochastic gradient descent, but there are other places where such series pop out, such as in the analysis of Markov chains and the associated ergodic theorems [11], which are ubiquitous in the analysis of simulation algorithms.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This year, I am still planning to post every first Monday of the month. Expect additional posts on acceleration, stochastic gradient, and orthogonal polynomials, but also new topics should be covered, always with connections with machine learning. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Happy new year!</p>

<h2>Detailed computations</h2>



<p><strong>Bounds on eigenvalues – I.</strong> In order to show the first desired inequality on eigenvalues, we simply need to show that \((1-t)^{2n} t \leq 1/(4n)\) for any \(t \in [0,1]\), which is the consequence of $$(1-t)^{2n} t \leq (e^{-t})^{2n} t \leq \frac{1}{2n} \sup_{u \geq 0} e^{-u} u = \frac{1}{2e n} \leq \frac{1}{4n}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bounds on eigenvalues – II.</strong> In order to show the second desired inequality on eigenvalues, we simply need to show that \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq \sqrt{n+1} \sqrt{t}\), for any \(t \in [0,1]\). This is a simple consequence of the straightforward inequality \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq 1\) and the inequality \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq (n+1) t \), which itself can be obtained by integrating the inequality \((1-u)^n \leq 1\) between \(0\) and \(t\).</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Following up my last post on Chebyshev polynomials, another piece of polynomial magic this month. This time, Jacobi polynomials will be the main players.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since definitions and various formulas are not as intuitive as for Chebyshev polynomials, I will start by the machine learning / numerical analysis motivation, which is an elegant refinement of Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<h2>Spectral measures and polynomial acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Like in the previous post, we consider the iteration in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) $$x_{k+1} = Ax_{k} – b,$$ with \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) a symmetric matrix with spectrum \({\rm Spec}(A) \subset (-1,1)\), with unique fixed point \(x_\ast\) such that \(x_\ast = A x_\ast – b\), that is, \(x_\ast = ( A – I)^{-1} b\).  These recursions naturally come up in gradient descent for quadratic functions or gossip algorithms (as described later).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to speed-up convergence, a classical idea explored in the <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">last post</a> is to take linear combinations of all past iterates. That is, we consider \(y_k = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k x_i\) for some weights \(\nu_i^k\) such that \(\sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k=1\) (so that if all iterates are already at \(x_\ast\), then the weighted average stays there). We have $$ y_k – x_\ast =  \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k ( x_i – x_\ast) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k A^i (x_0-x_\ast) = P_k(A) (x_0-x_\ast),$$ where \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k X^i\) is a polynomial such that \(P_k(1)=1\).  </p>



<p class="justify-text">For Chebyshev acceleration, we used the following bound: $$  \frac{1}{n} \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2^2 =   \frac{1}{n} ( x_0 – x_\ast)^\top P_k(A)^2 (x_0 -x_\ast)   \leq \max_{\lambda \in {\rm Spec}(A)} |P_k(\lambda)|^2 \cdot \frac{1}{n}\|x_0 – x_\ast\|_2^2.$$ Using the fact that  \({\rm Spec}(A) \subset [-1\!+\!\delta,1\!-\!\delta]\) for some \(\delta&gt;0\), minimizing \(\max_{\lambda \in {\rm Spec}(A)} |P_k(\lambda)|^2\) subject to \(P_k(1)=1\) led to a rescaled Chebyshev polynomials. This allowed to go from a convergence rate proportional to \((1\!-\!\delta)^k\) to a convergence rate proportional to \((1 – \sqrt{2\delta})^k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\delta\) is small, this is a significant gain. But when \(\delta\) is really small, none of the two techniques converge quickly enough, in particular in early iterations where the exponential convergence regime has not been reached. However, only a few eigenvalues are close to \(-1\) or \(1\)  (see examples in gossip matrices below), and using more information about eigenvalues beyond the smallest and largest ones can be advantageous.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1600" height="159" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comparing_spectra-1-1024x266.png" width="613"/>Histogram of eigenvalues of gossip matrices for gossiping within the 1D, 2D and 3D grid, with the same number of nodes \(n = 4096\): the eigengap \(1-\rho\) is small, and the eigenvalues are well-spread. See more details in the gossip section below.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We will use the spectral decomposition \(A = \sum_{i=1}^n\! \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), where \(\lambda_i\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\) with orthonormal eigenvectors \(u_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\). We thus have $$  \frac{1}{n} \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{n} ( x_0 – x_\ast)^\top P_k\Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top \Big)^2 ( x_0 – x_\ast) =  \frac{1}{n}\! \sum_{i=1}^n P_k(\lambda_i)^2 \big[ (x_0 – x_\ast)^\top u_i \big]^2.$$ Assuming \(\big[ (x_0 – x_\ast)^\top u_i \big]^2 \leq \tau^2\) for all \(i=1,\dots,n\) (that is, the initial deviation from the optimum has uniform magnitude on all eigenvectors), we need to minimize $$ e(P_k) = \frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! P_k(\lambda_i)^2  = \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)$$ with respect to \(P_k\), where \(d\sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n\! \delta_{\lambda_i}\) is the spectral probability measure of \(A\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Now, the new goal is to minimize \(\displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)\) with respect to a polynomial \(P_k\) with degree \(k\) and such that \(P_k(1)=1\). This is where orthogonal polynomials naturally come in. Their use in creating acceleration mechanisms dates back from numerical analysis in the 1980’s and 1990’s (with a very nice and detailed account in [1]).</p>



<h2>Orthogonal polynomials and kernel polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a sequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal polynomials</a> \(Q_k\) for the probability measure \(d\sigma\) in support within \([-1,1]\), each of degree \(k\), which we do not assume normalized. They are essentially unique (up to rescaling); see, e.g., the very good books by Gábor Szegő [2] and Theodore Seio Chihara [3].</p>



<p class="justify-text">We denote by \(\alpha_i = \int_{-1}^1 \! Q_i^2(\lambda)d\sigma(\lambda)\), for \(i \geq 0\), the squared norm of \(Q_i\), so that the sequence of polynomials \(({\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i)\) is <em>orthonormal</em>. We can then solve the optimization problem above for \(P_k\), by writing it \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k u_i {\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(X)\), and the problem in \(u \in\mathbb{R}^{k+1}\) becomes: $$\min_{u \in \mathbb{R}^{k+1}} \sum_{i=0}^k u_i^2 \mbox{ such that }  \sum_{i=0}^k u_i {\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(1) = 1.$$ This optimization problem can be solved in closed form, and the solution is such that \(\displaystyle u_i = \frac{{\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(1)}{\sum_{j=0}^k \!{\alpha_j^{-1}} Q_j(1)^2}\) for all \(i\), with the optimal polynomial $$P_k(X) =  \frac{\sum_{i=0}^k \! {\alpha_i^{-1}} Q_i(1) Q_i(X) }{\sum_{i=0}^k \!{\alpha_i^{-1}} Q_i(1)^2}.$$ The optimal value is thus equal to $$\big({\sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_i^{-1} Q_i(1)^2 } \big)^{-1}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The polynomials \(\sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_i^{-1} Q_i(X)Q_i(Y)\) are called the <em>kernel polynomials</em> [3, Chapter I, Section 7] associated to \(d\sigma\), and have many properties (beyond the optimality property which we just proved) that we will use below. </p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, the problem seems essentially solved: one can construct iteratively the polynomials \(Q_k\) using classical second-order recursions for orthogonal polynomials, and thus compute \(P_k(X)\) which is proportional to \(\sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{\alpha_i} Q_i(1) Q_i(X)\). This leads however to a somewhat complicated algorithm, and some additional polynomial magic can be invoked.</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that kernel polynomials, of which \(P_k\) is a special case, are themselves proportional to orthogonal polynomials for the modified measure \((1-\lambda) d \sigma(\lambda)\) (see proof at the end of the post). This is useful to generate the optimal polynomial with a second-order recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To summarize, if we know the spectral measure \(d\sigma\), then we can derive a sequence of polynomials \(P_k\) that leads to an optimal value for \(\displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)\). However, knowing precisely the spectral density is typically as hard as finding the fixed point of the recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since convergence properties are dictated by the behavior of the spectral measure around \(-1\) and \(1\), i.e., by the number of eigenvalues around \(-1\) and \(1\), we can model the spectral measure by simple distributions with varied behavior at the two ends of the spectrum. A known family is the rescaled Beta distribution, with density proportional to \((1-x)^\alpha (1+x)^\beta\). This will lead to Jacobi polynomials and “simple” formulas below.</p>



<h2>Jacobi polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">For \(\alpha, \beta &gt; -1\), the \(k\)-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_polynomials">Jacobi polynomial</a> \(J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}\) is equal to $$J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) = \frac{(-1)^k}{2^k k!} (1-x)^{-\alpha} (1+x)^{-\beta} \frac{d^k}{dx^k} \Big\{ (1-x)^{\alpha + k} (1+x)^{\beta + k} \Big\}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Denoting \(\displaystyle d\sigma(x) =   \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} ( 1 -x )^\alpha (1+x)^\beta dx\) the rescaled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta distribution</a> (with \(\Gamma(\cdot)\) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>), the Jacobi polynomials are orthogonal for the probability measure \(d\sigma\). That is, $$ \int_{-1}^1  \! J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) J_\ell^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) d\sigma(x) = 0, $$ if \(k \neq \ell\), and equal to \(\displaystyle \alpha_k = \frac{1}{2k+\alpha + \beta + 1} \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2) \Gamma(k+\alpha+1) \Gamma(k+\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)  \Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(k+\alpha+\beta+1)}\) if \(k=\ell\). We have the following equivalent \( \displaystyle \alpha_k \sim \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1) }\frac{1}{2k}\) when \(k\) tends to infinity. All the formulas in these sections can be obtained from standard references on orthogonal polynomials [2, 3] (with a summary on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_polynomials">Wikipedia</a>) and are presented without proofs.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The value at 1 is an important quantity for acceleration, and is equal to: $$ J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(1) = {k+\alpha \choose k} = \frac{\Gamma(k+\alpha+1)}{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(\alpha+1)} \sim \frac{ (k/e)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)},$$ while the value at -1 is equal to $$ J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(-1) =(-1)^k {k+\beta \choose k} = \frac{\Gamma(k+\beta+1)}{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(\beta+1)} \sim \frac{ (k/e)^\beta}{\Gamma(\beta+1)}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to compute the polynomials, the following recursion is key: $$  J_{k+1}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = (a_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} X + \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)})J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} – c_k J_{k-1}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X),$$ with coefficients with explicit (and slightly complicated) formulas (in the case you wonder why I use \(\tilde{b}\) instead of \(b\), this is to avoid overloading the notation with the iteration \(x_{k+1}= Ax_{k}-b\)): $$a_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} =   \frac{(2k+\alpha+\beta+1)  (2k+2+\alpha+\beta)  }{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta)  },\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $$ $$ \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}  =   \frac{(2k+\alpha+\beta+1) ( \alpha^2 – \beta^2 )}{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta) (2k + \alpha+\beta )},$$ $$c_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}  =\frac{ 2 (k+\alpha)(k+\beta)(2k +2+\alpha+\beta) }{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta) (2k + \alpha+\beta )}.  $$ It can be started with \(J_0^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = 1\) and \(J_1^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = \frac{\alpha – \beta}{2} +\frac{ \alpha + \beta +2}{2} X\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The class of Jacobi polynomials includes many of other important polynomials, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomials</a> (\(\alpha = \beta = -1/2\)), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials">Legendre polynomials</a> (\(\alpha = \beta = 0\)) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegenbauer_polynomials">Gegenbauer polynomials </a>(\(\alpha = \beta = d-1/2\)). Here are plots below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1604" height="202" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jacobi-1.gif" width="387"/>Jacobi polynomials, as used for the acceleration of gossip algorithms in one-dimension, with \((\alpha,\beta) = (1/2,-1/2)\).</figure></div>



<h2>Jacobi acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now apply the polynomial acceleration technique above to the Beta distribution, that is for \(\displaystyle d\sigma(x) =   \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} ( 1 -x )^\alpha (1+x)^\beta dx\), we have:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Regular recursion error</strong> (no acceleration):  the error \(e(X^k) = \displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \lambda^{2k} d\sigma(\lambda)\) is asymptotically equivalent to \(\displaystyle \frac{C_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{\alpha+1}}+\frac{C_{\beta,\alpha}}{k^{\beta+1}}\), for some constants \(C_{\alpha,\beta}\) (see details at the end of the post). Before acceleration, there is thus an equivalent impact of the spectrum around \(-1\) and \(1\).</li><li><strong>Jacobi acceleration error</strong>: as shown at the end of the post, the error \(e(P_k)\) is equivalent to \(\displaystyle  \frac{E_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{2\alpha+2}} \) for some constant \(E_{\alpha,\beta}\). </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">What’s happening around \(-1\) and \(1\) is important, and particular the behavior around 1, and we thus see that \(\beta\) is less important for the accelerated version (in fact, using \(\beta=0\) to construct the Jacobi polynomial, as done in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>], leads to a similar acceleration). In particular, when considering distributions where \(\beta = \alpha\), then we see that Jacobi acceleration transforms a rate proportional to \(1/k^{\alpha+1}\) to a rate proportional to \(1/k^{2\alpha+2}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The final recursion is then equal to (see detailed computations at the end of the post): $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(2k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta\!+\!2)   }{2(k\!+\!2\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta)(k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!2)  }  \big[ (2k\!+\!3\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta) (Ay_k-b) +  \frac{ (\alpha\!+\!1)^2\! -\! \beta^2  }{  2k \!+\! 1\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta }    y_k    \Big] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  $$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  –  \frac{    (k+\beta)(2k +3+\alpha+\beta) }{ (k+2+\alpha+\beta) (2k + 1+\alpha+\beta )} \frac{ k }{ k+\alpha+2} y_{k-1}, $$ with initialization \(y_0=x_0\) and \(y_1 = \frac{\alpha+\beta+3}{2\alpha+4}(Ax_0 – b) + \frac{\alpha+1-\beta}{2\alpha+4}x_0\). For \(\alpha = \frac{d}{2}-1\) and \(\beta =0\), this exactly recovers the recursion from [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>].</p>



<h2>Application to gossip</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Like in the previous post we consider the gossip problem. For large grid graphs, the gap is small, equivalent to \(\frac{1}{2d} \frac{1}{n^{2/d}}\) for the \(d\)-dimensional grid. The gap is tending to zero with \(n\), and using acceleration techniques for non-zero gaps, such as Chebyshev acceleration, is not efficient for the earlier iterations.</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that for grid graphs, the spectral measure tends to a limit with behavior \((1-x^2)^{d/2-1}\) around \(-1\) and \(1\). This is formerly true for the grid graph, and the behavior around 1 (which is the one that matters for acceleration) is the same for a large class of graphs with an underlying geometric structure [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>]. This thus corresponds to the Beta distribution of parameters \(\alpha = \beta = \frac{d}{2}-1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Below, I consider gossiping on a chain graph with \(n=200\) nodes, and compare regular gossip with Chebyshev acceleration and Jacobi acceleration. In early iterations, Jacobi acceleration is much better. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1714" height="204" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gossip_jacobi_1D.gif" width="673"/>Gossiping a one-dimensional white noise signal of length \(n = 200\), converging to its mean, which is zero. (left) regular gossip, (center) Chebyshev acceleration, (right) Jacobi acceleration</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">When looking at the convergence rate (plot below), for late iterations, the linear convergence of Chebyshev acceleration does take over; for a method that achieves the best of both world (good in early and late iterations), see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Section 7].</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1808" height="196" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gossip_jacobi_1D_double-1024x457.png" width="441"/>Squared gossiping errors (norm between the signal and its average) in natural (left) and logarithmic (right) scale. Chebyshev acceleration is slow at the beginning, and faster at the end (once the error is already quite small).</figure></div>



<p>Similar plots may be made in two dimensions, gossiping a white noise signal, where the stationary behavior is observed much sooner for Jacobi acceleration. Here, Chebyshev acceleration performs worse than the regular iteration because the eigengap is very small (equal to \(6 \times 10^{-4}\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1859" height="180" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gossip_jacobi_2D-1.gif" width="663"/>Gossiping a two-dimensional white noise signal of size \(n = 64 \times 64 = 4096\), converging to its mean, which is zero.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I tried to move from the worst-case analysis of spectral acceleration which typically focuses on largest and smallest eigenvalues of the involved contracting operators, closer to an average-case analysis that takes into account the whole spectrum. This led to acceleration by Jacobi polynomials rather than Chebyshev polynomials. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond gossip.</strong> While I have focused primarily on applications to gossip where the spectral measure can be well approximated, this can be extended to other situations. For example, Fabian Pedregosa and Damien Scieur [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04756.pdf">5</a>] recently considered an application of polynomial acceleration to gradient descent for least-squares regression with independent covariates, where the spectral measure of the covariance matrix tends to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchenko%E2%80%93Pastur_distribution">Marchenko-Pastur</a> distribution (which is close to the rescaled Beta distributions above).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Jacobi polynomials beyond acceleration.</strong> In this post, I focused only on the acceleration properties of Jacobi polynomials. There are many more interesting applications of these polynomials in machine learning and associated fields. For example, their role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics">spherical harmonics</a> to provide an orthonormal basis of the square-integrable functions on the unit sphere in any dimension, is quite useful for the theoretical study of neural networks (see, e.g., [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">6</a>] and references therein). I would typically say that this is a topic for another post, but this would be even more technical…</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will probably take a break in the polynomial magic series, and go back to less technical posts.</p>

<h2>Detailed computations</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kernel polynomial as orthogonal polynomial</strong>. We consider a series \((R_k)\) of orthogonal polynomials for the measure \((1-\lambda) d\sigma(\lambda)\). Assuming that \(R_k \neq 0\) (see proof in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Appendix D]), then we show that the polynomial \(\frac{R_k(X)}{R_k(1)}\) is the optimal polynomial of degree \(k\) minimizing \(\int_{-1}^1 P^2(\lambda) d\sigma(\lambda)\) such that \(P(1)=1\). Indeed, taking any polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) and such that \(P(1)=1\), the polynomial \(P(X) \, – \frac{R_k(X)}{R_k(1)}\) vanishes at \(1\) and can thus be written as \(A(X)(X-1)\) with \(A(X)\) of degree equal or less than \(k-1\). Then we have: $$\! \int_{-1}^1 \! \! P(\lambda)^2 d\lambda = \! \int_{-1}^1\!\!   \frac{R_k(\lambda)^2}{R_k(1)^2}d\sigma(\lambda) + 2 \! \int_{-1}^1 \!\!  \frac{R_k(\lambda)}{R_k(1)} A(\lambda)(\lambda-1)d\sigma(\lambda)+ \! \int_{-1}^1  \!\! \! A(\lambda)^2(\lambda-1)^2 d\sigma(\lambda).$$ The second term in the right hand side is equal to zero by orthogonality of \((R_k)\), and the third term is non-negative. Therefore, we must have  \(\displaystyle \! \int_{-1}^1 \! \! P(\lambda)^2 d\lambda \geq  \! \int_{-1}^1\!\!   \frac{R_k(\lambda)^2}{R_k(1)^2}d\sigma(\lambda)\), which shows optimality.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Jacobi recursion</strong>. Given the original recursion \(x_{k+1} = A x_k – b\), we consider \(y_k = \frac{Q_k(A) ( x_0  – x_\ast)}{Q_k(1)} + x_\ast\), where \(Q_k = J_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)}\). We get: $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} A + b_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)})Q_{k}(A)( x_0  – x_\ast) – c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} Q_{k-1}(A) ( x_0  – x_\ast)}{Q_{k+1}(1)} + x_\ast.$$ This leads to $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} A + b_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)})Q_{k}(1) (y_k – x_\ast) – c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} Q_{k-1}(1) ( y_{k-1}  – x_\ast)}{Q_{k+1}(1)} + x_\ast.$$ Removing all terms in \(x_\ast\) (which have to cancel), we get: $$ y_{k+1} =  a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}(Ay_k-b) + \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}y_k –  c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k-1}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}y_{k-1}. $$ Using the explicit formula for \(Q_{k}(1)\), we get after some calculations: $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(2k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta\!+\!2)   }{2(k\!+\!2\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta)(k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!2)  }  \big[ (2k\!+\!3\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta) (Ay_k-b) +  \frac{ (\alpha\!+\!1)^2\! -\! \beta^2  }{  2k \!+\! 1\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta }    y_k    \Big] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  $$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  –  \frac{    (k+\beta)(2k +3+\alpha+\beta) }{ (k+2+\alpha+\beta) (2k + 1+\alpha+\beta )} \frac{ k }{ k+\alpha+2} y_{k-1}, $$ with initialization \(y_0 = x_0\) and \(y_1 = \frac{\alpha+\beta+3}{2\alpha+4}(Ax_0 – b) + \frac{\alpha+1-\beta}{2\alpha+4}x_0\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Equivalents of performance</strong>. We first provide an equivalent of $$ \int_{-1}^1 \lambda^{2k} d\sigma(\lambda) = \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)}\int_{-1}^1 \! x^{2k} (1-x)^\alpha(1+x)^\beta dx.$$ By splitting the sum in two, this is equivalent to $$ \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)}\Big\{ 2^\beta\!\! \int_{0}^1 \! x^{2k} (1-x)^\alpha dx  + 2^\alpha \!\! \int_{0}^1 \! x^{2k}(1-x)^\beta dx \Big\},$$ leading to, using the normalizing factor of the Beta distribution, $$\frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} \Big\{ 2^\beta\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Gamma(2k+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+2k+2)} +2^\alpha\frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)\Gamma(2k+1)}{\Gamma(\beta+2k+2)}   \Big\}, $$ and finally to  $$ \displaystyle \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} \Big\{ 2^\beta\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1) }{ (2k/e)^{\alpha+1} }  +2^\alpha\frac{\Gamma(\beta+1) }{ (2k/e)^{\beta+1} }    \Big\} ,$$ which is indeed of the form \(\displaystyle \frac{C_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{\alpha+1}}+\frac{C_{\beta,\alpha}}{k^{\beta+1}}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to estimate \(e(P_k)\), since \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{\alpha_i} Q_i(1) Q_i(X)\), we first need an equivalent of the term \(\displaystyle \frac{Q_i(1)^2}{\alpha_i^2} \sim \frac{(i/e)^{2\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)^2} \Big( \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1) }\frac{1}{2i}\Big)^{-1} \sim E_{\alpha,\beta}’ i^{2\alpha+1}\), for some \(E_{\alpha,\beta}’\), leading to an error of the form \(e(P_k) \displaystyle \sim \frac{1}{ E_{\alpha,\beta}’  \sum_{i=0}^k i^{2\alpha+1}} \sim\frac{2\alpha+2}{ E_{\alpha,\beta}’} \frac{1}{k^{2\alpha+2}} \), which is of the desired form.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Spectral density of a grid</strong>. As seen at the far end of the <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">previous blog post</a>, the eigenvalues of \(A\) for the grid in one-dimension, with \(m=n\), is (up to negligible corrections) \(–  \cos \frac{k\pi}{m}\) for \(k =1,\dots,m\). This leads to a limiting spectral measure as \(– \cos \theta\) for \(\theta\) uniformly distributed on \([0,\pi]\). This leads to a spectral density \(\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}}\) supported on \([-1,1]\). In the plot below, we see that the histogram of eigenvalues for a finite \(m\) matches empirically this density.</p>

<p class="justify-text">For a \(d\)-dimensional grid, with \(n = m^d\), the spectral density is the one of \(\frac{1}{d} (X_1+\cdots X_d)\) for \(X_i\) independent and distributed as \(\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}} d\lambda\) on \([-1,1]\), for each \(i=1,\dots,d\). This leads to a convolution power of the density above, rescaled to have support in \([-1,1]\). This can be shown to lead to behavior as \((1-\lambda^2)^{d/2-1}\) around \(1\) and \(-1\) (see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Prop. 5.2]).</p></div>

Within machine learning and optimization, typically (a) they provide natural basis functions which are easy to manipulate, or (b) they can be used to model various acceleration mechanisms.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will describe one class of such polynomials, the Chebyshev polynomials (Tchebychev in French, Чебышёв in Russian), whose extremal properties (beyond being orthogonal) are useful in the analysis of accelerated algorithms. </p>



<h2>Definition and first properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The \(k\)-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomial</a> \(T_k\) is classically defined as the unique polynomial such that $$\forall  \theta \in [0,2\pi], \  \cos (k\theta) = T_k(\cos \theta).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence</strong>. Summing the two equations \(\cos [(k\pm 1)\theta] = \cos (k\theta) \cos \theta \mp \sin (k\theta) \sin \theta\), the following recurrence relationship can be deduced: $$\forall k &gt;0, \ T_{k+1}(X) = 2X T_k(X) \, – T_{k-1}(X).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Together with the first two polynomials \(T_0 (X) = 1\) and \(T_1(X) = X\), this leads to \(T_2(X) = 2X^2 – 1\), \(T_3(X) = 4X^3 – 3X\), and so on.</p>



<p class="justify-text">From the recurrence relationships, one can easily deduce that \(T_k\) has the parity of \(k\) and that \(T_k\) has degree \(k\), with leading coefficient \(2^{k-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Oscillatory behavior</strong>. For \(k\theta = j \pi\), for \(j\) integer, we have \(\cos (k \theta)=(-1)^j\), while when \(j\) goes from \(k\) to \(0\), \(\cos \theta = \cos\! \big( \frac{ j \pi}{k}\big)\) goes from -1 to 1. Thus, on \([-1,1]\), \(T_k(x)\) oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\), with equality for \(\cos\! \big(  \frac{j \pi}{k} \big)\) for \(j = 0,\dots,k\). This oscillatory behavior is illustrated below and crucial for the extremal properties below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1592" height="223" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chebyshev-3.gif" width="306"/>First 33 Chebyshev polynomials, plotted between -1 and 1. Note the stronger oscillatory behavior between -1 and 1 as \(k\) grows.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthogonality</strong>. Using the orthogonality of the Fourier basis on \([0,2\pi]\), we have for \(k \neq \ell\),  \(\int_0^{\pi} \cos (k\theta) \cos (\ell\theta) d\theta=0\), and with the change of variable \(x = \cos \theta\), we obtain $$\int_{-1}^1 \frac{T_k(x) T_\ell(x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx = 0.$$ Thus the Chebyshev polynomials inherit from many properties from such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal polynomials</a> (such as the two-term recursion above, but for the Chebyshev polynomials, these can obtained more directly). For further properties, see [1].</p>



<h2>Extremal properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Chebyshev polynomials exhibit many “extremal properties”, of the form: among all polynomials of degree \(k\) with some form of normalization (e.g., fixed \(k\)-th order coefficient or value at given point), the one with smallest specific norm is proportional to \(T_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical one is as follows: the polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) with \(k\)-th order coefficient equal to one, and with minimum \(\ell_\infty\)-norm \(\max_{ x \in [-1,1]} \! | P(x)|\) on \([-1,1]\), is \(P = \frac{1}{2^{k-1}}T_k\). The proof is particularly elegant and simple (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">here</a>). Since this is not the property that we need for optimization, we will consider another one.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong> (<em>largest value outside of \([-1,1]\)</em>). For any polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) such that \(|P(x)| \leq 1\) for \(x \in [-1,1]\), and any \(z &gt; 1\), \(|P(z)| \leq T_k(z)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><em>Proof</em>. By contradiction, we assume that there exists \(z &gt; 1\) such that \(P(z)&gt;T_k(z)\) (the other possibility \(P(z) &lt; -T_k(z)\) is done by replacing \(P\) by \(-P\)). Without loss of generality, we can assume that \(\max_{x \in [-1,1]} |P(x) | &lt; 1\) (by potentially rescaling \(P\)). Then, the polynomial \(Q = P – T_k\) of degree \(k\) has alternatively strictly positive and negative values between \(-1\) and \(z&gt;1\). Indeed, \(Q(z) &gt; 0\), and \((-1)^j Q\big(\cos\! \big(\frac{j \pi}{k}\big)\big) &lt; 0 \) for all \(j = 0,\dots,k\). Therefore there are \(k+2\) alternating signs, and thus \(k+1\) zeros, which implies that \(Q=0\) since \(Q\) has degree \(k\). This is a contradiction with the existence of \(z\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that for any \(\theta\), \(T_k( \cosh \theta) = \cosh (k\theta)\) (which can be shown by induction), and \(T_k\) is thus increasing on \([1,+\infty)\) with values quickly increasing as \(k\) grows. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1589" height="221" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chebyshev_beyong_one-1.gif" width="303"/>First 33 Chebyshev polynomials, plotted between 1 and 4 in logarithmic scale. Note the exploding behavior as \(k\) grows.</figure></div>



<h2>Chebyshev acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a recursion in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) of the form \(x_k = A x_{k-1} – b\), with \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) a symmetric matrix and eigenvalues in \([-\rho,\rho]\) with \(\rho \in [0,1)\). Such recursions are ubiquitous in data science, as (1) gradient descent on a strongly-convex quadratic function, or (b) gossip for distributed averaging [<a href="http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/gossip.pdf">2</a>] (see an example in a section below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The recursion converges to the unique (because \(\rho \in [0,1)\)) fixed point \(x_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(x_\ast =  A x_\ast – b\). We have, by unrolling the recursion: $$ x_k – x_\ast = A ( x_{k-1} – x_\ast) = A^k (x_0 – x_\ast).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to the usual exponential convergence rate \(\| x_k – x_\ast\|_2 \leq \rho^k \| x_0 – x_\ast\|_2\). In the following, writing \(\rho = 1 – ( 1-\rho)\) makes explicit the importance of \(1-\rho\), which is the gap between \(1\) and the largest eigenvalue of \(A\). Increasing this gap is equivalent to accelerating the convergence rate.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to speed-up convergence, a classical idea is to take linear combinations of all past iterates. That is, we consider \(y_k = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k x_i\) for some weights \(\nu_i^k\) such that \(\sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k=1\) (so that if all iterates are already at \(x_\ast\), then the weighted average stays there). We have $$ y_k – x_\ast =  \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k ( x_i – x_\ast) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k A^i (x_0-x_\ast) = P_k(A) (x_0-x_\ast),$$ where \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k X^i\) is a polynomial such that \(P_k(1)=1\).  Therefore, we have: $$  \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2 \leq \max_{\lambda \in [-\rho, \rho]} |P_k(\lambda)| \cdot \|x_0 – x_\ast\|_2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to select the best polynomial, we are looking for \(P_k\) such that \(P_k(1)=1\) and \(\max_{\lambda \in [-\rho,\rho]}\! |P_k(\lambda)|\) is as small as possible. Up to mapping \([-\rho,\rho]\) to \([-1,1]\), we know from the extremal property above that the optimal polynomial is exactly a rescaled Chebyshev polynomial, that is, $$P_k(X) = \frac{T_k(X/\rho)}{T_k(1/\rho)}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The maximal value on \([-\rho,\rho]\) is then \((T_k(1/\rho))^{-1}\). In order to compare to \(\rho^k\) (no acceleration), we can provide an equivalent of \([T_k(1/\rho)]^{-1/k}\) as \(\frac{\rho}{ 1+ \sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\) (see end of the post). There is no real acceleration when \(\rho\) is bounded away from 1, but as \(\rho\) tends to \(1\), this can be shown (see also the end of the post) to be equivalent to \(1 – \sqrt{2(1\!-\!\rho)}\), with the usual “square root” acceleration: \(1\!-\!\rho\) is essentially replaced by \(\sqrt{1\!-\!\rho}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus get an acceleration, but as is, computing \(y_k\) seems to require to store all values of \(x_1,\dots,x_k\), which is not practical. Since there is a second-order recursion for Chebyshev polynomials, one can derive one as well, directly for the sequence \((y_k)\).  A somewhat lengthy calculation (see end of the post) leads to the recursion $$ y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}, $$<br/>with a sequence \(\omega_{k+1}\) also defined by recursion as \(\omega_{k+1} = ( 1 – \frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega_k)^{-1}\), initialized with \(\omega_1 = 2\), \(y_0 = x_0\), \(y_1 = Ax_0 – b\). Therefore, on top of the usual computation of \(A y_k -b\), Chebyshev acceleration comes at no extra computational cost.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simpler stationary recursion</strong>. In the recursion above, the parameter \(\omega_k\) varies with \(k\). A similar (then non totally optimal) acceleration can be obtained by replacing all \(\omega_k\)’s by their limit \(\omega\) when \(k\) tends to infinity, which is characterized by the equation \(\omega = ( 1-\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega)^{-1}\) with smallest solutions \(\frac{ 1/\rho    – \sqrt{1/\rho^2 -1}}{\rho/2}\)  (see end of the post for detailed computations). The now stationary recursion then becomes $$ y_{k+1} = \omega ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega) y_{k-1}, $$ and is exponentially convergent with rate proportional to \(\rho \omega/2 =  \frac{1}{1/\rho + \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1}} = \frac{\rho}{1+ \sqrt{ 1 – \rho^2}}\). Thus, the recursion is simpler and the final speed asymptotically the same as full Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<h2>Relationship with other acceleration mechanisms</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-adaptive schemes</strong>. As seen above for an affine operator \(F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n\) (i.e., \(F(x) = Ax-b\)), Chebyshev acceleration takes a recursion of the form $$x_{k+1} = F(x_{k}),$$ and linearly combines iterates; it ends up creating second-order recursions of the form $$ y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} F(y_k) + (1-\omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}, $$ with the same fixed points. Other formats (with fixed point preservation) can be considered such as $$ y_{k+1} = F(y_k) + \delta_{k+1}(y_k –  y_{k-1}),$$ or $$ y_{k+1} = F(y_k) + \delta_{k+1}(F(y_k) –  F(y_{k-1})), $$ for some constants \(\delta_{k+1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(F\) is affine, the format does not matter much (and all end up being essentially equivalent), but for gradient descent algorithms where \(F(x) = x – \gamma f'(x)\) for some non-quadratic function \(f\) and \(\gamma\) a step-size, there is a difference, the last one corresponding to Nesterov acceleration (see a nice post on it <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2014/03/06/nesterovs-accelerated-gradient-descent-for-smooth-and-strongly-convex-optimization/">here</a>), and the one before to classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">momentum</a>, also known as the heavy-ball method (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7457">3</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptive schemes</strong>. The methods above need to know the bound on the spectrum \(\rho\). They have to commit to such a value (which is typically only known through upper bounds) and cannot “get lucky”, that is, even if the best value \(\rho\) is known, they cannot benefit from additional better properties of the spectrum of \(A\) (e.g., clustered eigenvalues). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method">conjugate gradient</a> method, which accesses the matrix \(A\) with the slightly stronger oracle of computing \(Ax\) any \(x\) (and not only \(Ax – b\)), or Anderson acceleration (which does not need a stronger oracle), are adaptive for similar problems [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/10078356X">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04133">5</a>].

<h2>Application to accelerated gossip</h2>



<p class="justify-text">A interesting linear recursion pops out in distributed optimization, where we assume that computers or processors are placed in \(n\) nodes in a network, and the goal is to minimize an average of function \(f_1,\dots,f_n\), each of them only accessible by the corresponding node. The nodes are allowed to communicate messages along each edge of a network. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1367" height="221" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2dgrid.png" width="255"/>Two-dimensional grid with \(d = 8 \times 8 = 64\) nodes.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The simplest of such problem is the network averaging problem where \(f_i(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} (\theta – \xi_i)^2\), for a uni-dimensional parameter \(\theta\) and \(\xi \in \mathbb{R}^n\). The solution of this consensus is \(\theta_\ast = \frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! \xi_i\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The gossip algorithm [<a href="http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/gossip.pdf">2</a>] consists in iteratively replacing the value \(\theta_i\) at a given node by a weighted average \(\sum_{j \sim i} W_{ij} \theta_j\) of the values at neighboring nodes (and node \(i\)). If all \(n\) nodes communicate simultaneously, then the vector \(\theta \) is replaced by \(W \theta\), hence a linear recursion $$ \theta_{k+1} = W \theta_{k},$$ initialized at \(\theta_0 = \xi\). Assuming that \(W\) is symmetric, with non-negative off-diagonal elements, and such that \(W 1_n = 1_n\) (where \(1_n \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the vector of all ones), then all eigenvalues of \(W\) except the largest one are included in the interval \([-\rho, \rho]\), with \(\rho \in (0,1)\) for a connected graph. A simple such matrix \(W\) can be obtained from the adjacency matrix \(A\) of the graph, such that \(A_{ij} = 1\) if nodes \(i\) and \(j\) are connected, and zero otherwise, as \(W = I – \alpha L \), with \(L = {\rm Diag}(A 1_n) – A\) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">Laplacian matrix</a> and \(\alpha\) selected so that the eigenvalues are all between \(-\rho\) and \(\rho\), except one, which is equal to 1 (see values of \(\rho\) and \(\alpha\) at the end of the post). We will see below that this extra eigenvalue which is equal to one is in fact not a problem for analyzing the convergence of this network averaging procedure.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When applying the gossip matrix \(W\) iteratively to \(\theta_0 = \xi\), the projection on the eigensubspace corresponding to the unit eigenvalue is not changed, while all other projections on the other eigensubspaces converge to zero at rate at most \(\rho^k\). Thus \(\theta_k\) converges to the constant vector \(\frac{1}{n} 1_n 1_n^\top \xi\) at rate \(\rho^k\), and thus to a constant vector, with the average \(\frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! \xi_i\) in all components.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that we have a linear recursion, we can use Chebyshev acceleration defined above and obtain substantial improvements, as illustrated below. For the use of this acceleration within distributed optimization algorithms, see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01478317/document">6</a>] and references therein.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Among classical classes of orthogonal polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials are special, because beyond being orthogonal, they satisfy extremal properties that are particularly useful in numerical analysis.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In future posts, I plan to go over Jacobi polynomials (which include Legendre, Gegenbauer and Chebyshev polynomials), Hermite polynomials, and finally Bernoulli polynomials (which are not orthogonal but still very special). For all of these, there are natural applications in machine learning.</p>

<h2>Detailed Computations</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Limit of </strong>\([T_k(1/\rho)]^{-1/k}\). For \(z \geq 1\), then a well-known property of Chebyshev polynomials is that \(T_k(z) = \cosh [ k \, {\rm acosh} (z)]\) (which can be shown by induction using basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function">hyperbolic trigonometry</a> identities). Moreover, we have \({\rm acosh} (z) = \log( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} )\) and thus $$T_k(z) = \frac{1}{2} \big[ \big( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} \big)^k + \big(z – \sqrt{z^2-1}\big)^k  \big].$$ For \(z = 1/\rho\), and taking limits, we get that \([T_k(z)]^{1/k}\) tends to \( z + \sqrt{z^2-1}\), which leads to the limit \(\frac{\rho}{ 1+ \sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\) for \([T_k(z)]^{-1/k}\). Then a classical Taylor expansion in \(1-\rho\) leads to \(1 – \sqrt{2(1-\rho)}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence for Chebyshev acceleration</strong>. We have, using the recursion for Chebyshev polynomials $$y_{k+1} – x_\ast = \frac{ 2 }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} (A/\rho) T_k(A/\rho) ( x_0 – x_\ast) \ – \frac{ 1  }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} T_{k-1}(A/\rho) ( x_0 – x_\ast).$$ Using the equality \(x_\ast = A x_\ast -b\), the terms in \(x_\ast\) cancel (they have to anyway, because \(P_k(1)=1\)). We then get $$y_{k+1}  = \frac{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}  ( A y_k – b) \, – \frac{ T_{k-1}(1/\rho)  }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} y_{k-1}.$$</p>



<p>Using \(T_{k-1}(1/\rho) = (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho) – T_{k+1}(1/\rho)\), and denoting \(\omega_{k+1} =  \frac{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}\), we get $$y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} ( A y_{k} – b) + ( 1- \omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}.$$ Reusing one last time the Chebyshev recursion, we get $$\omega_{k+1}^{-1} = \frac{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}= 1 – \frac{T_{k-1}(1/\rho)}{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)} =1  – \frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega_{k},$$ which is the desired recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence of stationary recursion</strong>. The roots of \(\omega = ( 1-\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega)^{-1}\) are the ones of \(\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega^2 – \omega + 1 = 0\), with smallest solutions \(\omega = \frac{ 1/\rho   – \sqrt{1/\rho^2 -1}}{\rho/2}\). In order to study the second-order recursion $$ y_{k+1} = \omega ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega) y_{k-1}, $$ with constant coefficient, we need to compute the roots of \(r^2 = \omega \lambda r + (1-\omega)\), for \(|\lambda| \leq \rho\). The discriminant of this equation is \(\lambda^2 \omega^2 + 4 (1-\omega) \leq \rho^2 \omega^2 + 4(1-\omega) = 0\), and thus the roots are complex conjugate with squared modulus \((\omega\ – 1) = \frac{1}{4} \rho^2 \omega^2\) independent of \(\lambda\). Thus, as \(k\) tends to infinity, \(\| y_k  – x_\ast\|_2^{1/k}\) tends to \(\frac{1}{2} \rho \omega =   ( 1/\rho – \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1} ) = \frac{1}{1/\rho + \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1}}\), which is exactly the rate for Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a square grid</strong>. Given a chain of length \(m\) such as depicted below, the \(m \times m\) Laplacian matrix can be shown (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05210">7</a>]) to have eigenvalues \(2 + 2 \cos \frac{k\pi}{m}\) for \(k =1,\dots,m\).</p>

<p class="justify-text">For a two-dimensional grid of size \(m \times m\), then the \(m^2 \times m^2\) Laplacian matrix can be shown (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05210">7</a>]) to have eigenvalues \(4 + 2\cos \frac{k_1\pi}{m} + 2\cos \frac{k_2\pi}{m}\) for \(k_1,k_2 =1,\dots,m\). Therefore, the second smallest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_\min = 2 – 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\) and the largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_\max = 4 + 4  \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\). We then select \(\alpha\) such that \(1-\alpha \lambda_\min = \rho\) and \(1-\alpha \lambda_\max = -\rho\), leading to \(\alpha = \frac{2}{\lambda_\min + \lambda_\max} = \frac{2}{6 + 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\) and finally \(\rho = \frac{\lambda_\max – \lambda_\min}{\lambda_\max + \lambda_\min} = \frac{2 +6  \cos \frac{\pi}{m} }{6 + 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\sim \frac{8 – 3 \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}{8 –  \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}\sim 1 – \frac{\pi^2}{4 m^2}\). Thus, as a function of \(n = m^2\), the eigengap is proportional to \(1/n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">More generally, for the grid of size \(m\) in dimension \(d\), then we get \(\lambda_\min = 2 – 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\) and \(\lambda_\max = 2d + 2d  \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\), and \(\rho = \frac{\lambda_\max – \lambda_\min}{\lambda_\max + \lambda_\min} = \frac{2d-2 +(2d+2)  \cos \frac{\pi}{m} }{2d+2 + (2d-2) \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\sim \frac{4d – (d+1) \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}{4d –  (d-1)\frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}\sim 1 – \frac{\pi^2}{2d m^2}.\) Thus, as a function of \(n = m^d\), the eigengap is proportional to \(1/n^{2/d}\). Moreover, when \(m\) is large, the normalizing factor \(\alpha\) tends to \(1/(2d)\).</p></div>

<p>The mainstream thought in classical control operates under the simplifying principle that nature evolves according to well-specified dynamics perturbed by i.i.d. Gaussian noise, a field called <b>Optimal Control</b>. While this principle has proven very successful in some real world systems, it does not lend itself to the construction of truly <b>robust</b> controllers. In the real world one can expect all sorts of deviations from this setting, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherent correlations between perturbations across time due to the environment.</li>
<li>Modeling misspecification, which can introduce unforeseeable, non-stochastic deviations from the assumed dynamics.</li>
<li>Completely adversarial perturbations introduced by a malicious entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, in the world of classical supervised learning, the presence of the above factors has led to the adoption of <a href="https://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">online learning</a> in lieu of statistical learning, which allows for robust noise models and game-theoretic / strategic learning. A natural question arises: <i>what is the analogue of online learning and worst-case regret in robust control? </i></p>
<h2>Linear Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control</h2>
<p>Dynamical systems constitute the formalism to describe time-dependent, dynamic real-world phenomenon, ranging from fluid flow through a pipe, the movement of a pendulum, to the change of weather. The archetypal example here is a linear dynamical system, which permits a particularly intuitive interpretation as a (configurable) vector field (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system">wikipedia</a>):</p>
<p><img alt="" height="158" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null.png?w=624&amp;h=158" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>A linear dynamical system (LDS) posits the state of a system evolves via the following dynamical relation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+Ax_t+%2B+Bu_t+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t"/></p>

<p>Here <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t"/> represents the state of the system, <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> represents a control input and <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> is a perturbation introduced to the dynamics, for the time step t. The vector fields above illustrate the behavior of the system for a few different choices of A, when the control input <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> is set to zero. The control inputs, when correctly chosen, can modify the dynamics to induce a particular desired behavior. For example, controlling the thermostat in a data center to achieve a particular temperature, applying a force to a pendulum to keep it upright, or driving a drone to a destination.</p>
<p>The goal of the controller is to produce a sequence of control actions <img alt="u_1 \ldots u_T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_1+%5Cldots+u_T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_1 \ldots u_T"/> aimed at minimizing the cumulative loss <img alt="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_t+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)"/>. In classical control the loss functions are convex quadratics and known ahead of time. However, in the quest for more robust controllers, henceforth we will consider a broader class of general (possibly non-quadratic) convex cost functions, which may be adversarially chosen, and only be revealed online per-time-step to the controller.</p>
<h2>Previous notions: LQR and H-infinity control</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most fundamental setting in control theory is a LDS is with quadratic costs <img alt="c_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t"/> and i.i.d Gaussian perturbations <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>. The solution known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear&#x2013;quadratic_regulator">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a>, derived by solving the Riccati equation, is well understood and corresponds to a linear policy (i.e. the control input is a linear function of the state).</p>
<p>The assumption of i.i.d perturbations has been relaxed in classical control theory, with the introduction of a min-max notion, in a subfield known as <a href="https://stephentu.github.io/blog/h-infinity-control/2018/07/01/hinf-optimal-control-dynamic-games.html"><img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control</a>. Informally, the idea behind <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control is to design a controller which performs well against <i>all </i>sequences of bounded perturbations. There are two shortcomings of this approach; firstly computing such a controller can be a difficult optimization problem in itself. While a closed form for such a controller is known for linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, no such form is known when costs can be non-quadratic. Secondly and perhaps more importantly, the min-max notion is non-adaptive and hence often too pessimistic. It is possible that during the execution of the system, nature produces a <i>benign (predictable)</i> sequence of perturbations (say, for instance, the perturbations are, in truth, highly correlated). The <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> controller in this setting could be overly pessimistic and lead to a higher cost than what could be achieved via a potentially more adaptive controller. This motivates our approach of minimizing regret, which we describe next.</p>
<h2>A less pessimistic metric: Policy regret</h2>
<p>Our starting point for more robust control is regret minimization in games. Regret minimization is a well-accepted metric in online learning, and we consider applying it to online control.</p>
<p>Formally, we measure the efficacy of a controller through the following notion of <i>policy </i>regret.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BRegret%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bt%7D+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29+-+%5Cmin_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bstable+%7D+K%7D+c_t%28x_t%28K%29%2C+-Kx_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)"/></p>
<p>Here in, <img alt="x_t(K)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t%28K%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t(K)"/> represents the state encountered when executing the linear policy $K$. In particular, the second term represents the total cost paid by the best(in hindsight) stable linear policy had it executed in the system facing the same sequence of perturbations as the controller. In this regard the above notion of regret is <b>counterfactual</b> and hence more challenging than the more common stateless notion of regret.<br/>
(Remark: a <span style="font-weight: 400;">stable linear policy K is one which ensures that the spectral radius of  A-BK is strictly less than one. For a formal quantitative definition, please see the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, the choice of comparing to a linear policy is made keeping tractability in mind. Note that this nevertheless generalizes the standard Linear Quadratic Regulator and <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control on Linear Dynamical Systems, as the optimal choice of controllers in those settings is indeed a linear policy (if the cost functions are quadratic, our setting allows more general loss functions).</p>
<p>Algorithms which achieve low regret on the above objective are naturally adaptive as they perform as well as the best controller (upto a negligible additive regret) oblivious to whether the sequence is <i>friendly </i>or <i>adversarial. </i></p>
<h2>A new type of controller</h2>
<p>In successive recent works (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1] </a>and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05062">[2]</a>), we show that the above notion of policy regret is tractable and can be sublinear (even logarithmic under certain conditions). Using a new parameterization for controller that we detail next, we obtain the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Robustness to Adversarial Perturbations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1]</a>) – </b>For arbitrary, but bounded, perturbations $w_t$, which may even be chosen adversarially, we provide an efficient algorithm that achieves regret of <b><img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/></b>.</li>
<li><b>Fast Rates under Stochastic Perturbations (</b>[2]<b>) – </b>Further, for strongly convex costs, and i.i.d. perturbations, we give an efficient algorithm with a poly-logarithmic (in T) regret guarantee.</li>
</ul>
<p>The former result is the first such result to establish vanishing average regret in an online setting for control with adversarial perturbations. The latter result offers a significant improvement over the work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07104">Cohen et al. </a>who established a rate of <img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/> in a similar (stochastic) setting.</p>
<p>We assume that the dynamical system i.e. (A,B) is completely known to us and the state is fully observable. These assumptions have been eliminated in further work with our collaborators, and will be a subject of a future blog post. We now describe the core ideas which go into achieving both our results.</p>
<h2>The Gradient Perturbation Controller</h2>
<p>Consider how the choice of the linear controller determines the control input.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="120" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-1.png?w=624&amp;h=120" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>The above display demonstrates that the action, state, and hence the cost are <b>non-convex</b> functions of the linear controller K. The first piece of our result evades this lack of convexity by over-parametrization, ie. relaxing the notion of a linear policy as described next.</p>
<p>In place of learning a direct representation of a linear controller K, we learn a sequence of matrices <img alt="M_1, M_2 \ldots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%2C+M_2+%5Cldots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="M_1, M_2 \ldots "/> which represent the dependence of <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> on <img alt="w_{t - i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_%7Bt+-+i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_{t - i}"/> under the execution of some linear policy. Schematically, we parameterize our policy as follows</p>
<p><img alt="" height="62" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-2.png?w=624&amp;h=62" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Note that, the assumption that the dynamics is known permits the exact inference of <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>’s and thereby making the execution of such a controller possible. While the choice of the controller ensures that control inputs are linear in <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/>, the superposition principle for linear dynamical systems ensures that the state sequence too is linear in the same variables. Therefore, the cost of execution of such a controller parameterized via <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/> is convex and we can hope to learn them using standard techniques like Gradient Descent. Observe that, by construction, it is possible to emulate the behavior any linear controller K by a suitable choice of <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/>’s.</p>
<p>There are two barriers though. First, the number of parameters grows with time $T$ and so can regret and running time. Secondly, since there is a state, the decision a controller makes at a particular instance affects the future. We deal with these two problems formally in the paper and show how they may be circumvented. One of the important techniques we use is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Online Convex Optimization with Memory</a>.</p>
<p>With all the core components in place, we provide a brief specification of our algorithm. Let’s fix some memory length H, and a time step t. Define a proxy cost as</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)"/> =</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The algorithm now as suggested by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Anava, Hazan and Manor</a>, is to take a gradient step on the above proxy.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="29" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-3.png?w=624&amp;h=29" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>The above algorithm achieves <img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/> regret against <b>worst-case</b> noise. For the full proof and the precise derivation of the algorithm, check out the paper.</p>
<h2>Achieving Logarithmic Regret</h2>
<p>Algorithms for (state-less) online learning often enjoy logarithmic regret guarantees in the presence of strongly convex loss functions. Prima facie, one could hope that for dynamical systems with strongly convex costs, such a stronger regret guarantee would hold. The cautionary note here is that <b>strong convexity of the cost <img alt="c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(x_t, u_t)"/> in the control input does not imply strong convexity in the controller representation</b>.,</p>
<p>In fact, the strong convexity of our proxy cost function <img alt="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)"/> in its natural parameterization over M’s is further hindered by the fact that the space of M’s constitutes a highly over-parametrized representation (say, vs. K). Indeed in the case of adversarial perturbations, it is easy to construct a case where the strong convexity does not transfer over from the control to the controller.</p>
<p>In a future blog post we detail how this technical difficulty can be overcome using the natural gradient method, giving rise to a logarithmic regret algorithm for control.</p>
<h2>Experimental Validation</h2>
<p>Below we provide empirical evaluations of the GPC controller in various scenarios, demonstrating it is indeed more robust to correlated noise than previous notions. <b>(All the plots below are produced by a new research-first control and time series library in the works — Alpha version scheduled to be released soon! STAY TUNED!!!) </b></p>
<p>To start, let’s reproduce the classical setting of controlling an LDS with i.i.d. Gaussian noise. Here, the LQR program is <i>optimal</i>. Yet, the plot below attests that our new control methodology offers a slightly suboptimal, yet comparable, performance. This observation also underlines the message the the proposed controller tracks the optimal controller without any foreknowledge of the structure of the perturbations. Here, for example, GPC is not made aware of the i.i.d. nature of the perturbations.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-4.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Moving on to correlated perturbations across time, a simple such setting is when the perturbations are drawn from a Gaussian Random Walk (as opposed to independent Gaussians). Note that here it is possible to derive the <i>optimal </i>controller via the separation principle. Here is the performance plot:</p>
<h1><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-5.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></h1>
<p>Note that the default LQR controller performs much worse, where as GPC is able to track the performance of the optimal controller quite closely. Next up, <b>sinusoidal noise</b>:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-6.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Here the full power of regret minimization is exhibited as the consecutive samples of the sine function are very correlated, yet predictable. GPC vastly outperforms LQR as one would expect. But, is this fundamentally a hard setting? What would happen if we use the H-infinity controller, or, god forbid, no control at all? We see this in the next plot (on the log-linear scale):</p>
<p><img alt="" height="202" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-7.png?w=624&amp;h=202" title="" width="624"/></p>
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>We have surveyed a new family of controls that are fundamentally different than classical optimal control: they are adaptive and attain regret guarantees vs. adversarial noise. Their preliminary experimental tests seem quite promising.</p>
<p>In the coming posts we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain how GPC can obtain the first logarithmic regret in the tracking/Kalman setting,</li>
<li>Reveal our new research-first library for control / time-series prediction,</li>
<li>Tackle more general settings.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Stay tuned! Preferably using the GPC… <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></h1>
