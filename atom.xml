<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: This talk reviews diffusion methods to identify low-dimensional manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets, and illustrates that by pinpointing additional mathematical structure, improved results can be obtained. Much of the talk draws on a case study from a collaboration with biological morphologists, who compare different phenotypical structures to study relationships of living or extinct animals with their surroundings and each other. This is typically done from carefully defined anatomical correspondence points (landmarks) on e.g. bones; such landmarking draws on highly specialized knowledge. To make possible more extensive use of large (and growing) databases, algorithms are required for automatic morphological correspondence maps, without any preliminary marking of special features or landmarks by the user.</p>

    <title>Coverage Analysis for UAV-Assisted Cellular Networks in Rural Areas</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1616889600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Maurilio Matracia, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kishk:Mustafa_A=.html">Mustafa A. Kishk</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Alouini:Mohamed=Slim.html">Mohamed-Slim Alouini</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13794">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Despite coverage enhancement in rural areas is one of the main requirements
in next generations of wireless networks (i.e., 5G and 6G), the low expected
profit prevents telecommunication providers from investing in such sparsely
populated areas. Hence, it is required to design and deploy cost efficient
alternatives for extending the cellular infrastructure to these regions. A
concrete mathematical model that characterizes and clearly captures the
aforementioned problem might be a key-enabler for studying the efficiency of
any potential solution. Unfortunately, the commonly used mathematical tools
that model large scale wireless networks are not designed to capture the
unfairness, in terms of cellular coverage, suffered by exurban and rural areas.
In big cities, in fact, cellular deployment is essentially capacity driven and
thus cellular base station densities are maximum in the town centers and
decline when getting far from them. In this paper, a new stochastic
geometry-based model is implemented in order to show the coverage spatial
variation among urban, suburban, and exurban settlements. Indeed, by
implementing inhomogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs) it is possible to
study the performance metrics in a realistic scenario where terrestrial base
stations (TBSs) are clustered around the urban center while outer aerial base
stations (ABSs) are uniformly distributed outside an urban exclusion zone.
Based on this, our simulation results can quantify the improvement, in terms of
coverage probability, that even a surprisingly low density of ABSs can bring to
peripheral regions depending on the extension of the exclusion zone, enabling
us to draw insightful considerations.

    <title>Faster one block quantifier elimination for regular polynomial systems of equations</title>

real algebraic geometry, polynomial system solving and symbolic computation.
Given a semi-algebraic formula (whose atoms are polynomial constraints) with
quantifiers on some variables, it consists in computing a logically equivalent
formula involving only unquantified variables. When there is no alternate of
quantifier, one has a one block quantifier elimination problem.
</p>
<p>We design a new practically efficient algorithm for solving one block
quantifier elimination problems when the input semi-algebraic formula is a
system of polynomial equations satisfying some mild assumptions such as
transversality. When the input is generic, involves $s$ polynomials of degree
bounded by $D$ with $n$ quantified variables and $t$ unquantified ones, we
prove that this algorithm outputs semi-algebraic formulas of degree bounded by
$\mathcal{D}$ using $O\ {\widetilde{~}}\left (n\ 8^{t}\ \mathcal{D}^{3t+2}\
</p>
<p>\binom{t+\mathcal{D}}{t} \right )$ arithmetic operations in the ground field
where $\mathcal{D} = n\ D^s(D-1)^{n-s+1}\ \binom{n}{s}$.
</p>
<p>In practice, it allows us to solve quantifier elimination problems which are
out of reach of the state-of-the-art (up to $8$ variables).

    <title>TR21-048 |  Better Pseudodistributions and Derandomization for Space-Bounded Computation | 

	William Hoza</title>
    <summary>Three decades ago, Nisan constructed an explicit pseudorandom generator (PRG) that fools width-$n$ length-$n$ read-once branching programs (ROBPs) with error $\varepsilon$ and seed length $O(\log^2 n + \log n \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))$ (Combinatorica 1992). Nisan's generator remains the best explicit PRG known for this important model of computation. However, a recent line of work starting with Braverman, Cohen, and Garg (Braverman, Cohen, and Garg SICOMP 2020; Chattopadhyay and Liao CCC 2020; Cohen, Doron, Renard, Sberlo, and Ta-Shma ECCC 2021; Pyne and Vadhan ECCC 2021) has shown how to construct *weighted* pseudorandom generators (WPRGs, aka pseudorandom pseudodistribution generators) with better seed lengths than Nisan's generator when the error parameter $\varepsilon$ is small.
		
In this work, we present an explicit WPRG for width-$n$ length-$n$ ROBPs with seed length $O(\log^2 n + \log(1/\varepsilon))$. Our seed length eliminates $\log \log$ factors from prior constructions, and our generator completes this line of research in the sense that further improvements would require beating Nisan's generator in the standard constant-error regime. Our technique is a variation of a recently-discovered reduction that converts moderate-error PRGs into low-error WPRGs (Cohen et al. ECCC 2021; Pyne and Vadhan ECCC 2021). Our version of the reduction uses averaging samplers.
		
We also point out that as a consequence of the recent work on WPRGs, any randomized space-$S$ decision algorithm can be simulated deterministically in space $O(S^{3/2} / \sqrt{\log S})$. This is a slight improvement over Saks and Zhou's celebrated $O(S^{3/2})$ bound (JCSS 1999). For this application, our improved WPRG is not necessary.</summary>

To manage
these constraints and smooth out the expenditure across auctions, the bidders
(or the platform on behalf of them) often employ pacing: each bidder is
assigned a multiplier between 0 and 1, and her bid on each item is
multiplicatively scaled down by the multiplier. This naturally gives rise to a
game in which each bidder strategically selects a multiplier. The appropriate
notion of equilibrium in this game is the pacing equilibrium.
</p>
<p>In this work, we show that the problem of finding an approximate pacing
equilibrium is PPAD-complete for second-price auctions. This resolves an open
question of [CKSSM17]. As a consequence of our hardness result, we show that
the tatonnement-style budget-management dynamics introduced by [BCI+07] is
unlikely to converge efficiently for repeated second-price auctions. Our
hardness result also implies the existence of a refinement of supply-aware
market equilibria which is hard to compute with simple linear utilities.

    <title>ButterFly BFS -- An Efficient Communication Pattern for Multi Node Traversals</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1616803200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Green:Oded.html">Oded Green</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13577">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a building block used in a wide array of graph
analytics and is used in various network analysis domains: social, road,
transportation, communication, and much more. Over the last two decades,
network sizes have continued to grow. The popularity of BFS has brought with it
a need for significantly faster traversals. Thus, BFS algorithms have been
designed to exploit shared-memory and shared-nothing systems -- this includes
algorithms for accelerators such as the GPU. GPUs offer extremely fast
traversals at the cost of processing smaller graphs due to their limited memory
size. In contrast, CPU shared-memory systems can scale to graphs with several
billion edges but do not have enough compute resources needed for fast
traversals. This paper introduces ButterFly BFS, a multi-GPU traversal
algorithm that allows analyzing significantly larger networks at high rates.
ButterFly BFS scales to the similar-sized graphs processed by shared-memory
systems while improving performance by more than 10X compared to CPUs. We
evaluate our new algorithm on an NVIDIA DGX-2 server with 16 V100 GPUS and show
that our algorithm scales with an increase in the number of GPUS. We show that
we can achieve a roughly $70\%$ performance linear speedup, which is
non-trivial for BFS. For a scale 29 Kronecker graph and edge factor of 8, our
new algorithm traverses the graph at a rate of over 300 GTEP/s. That is a high
traversal rate for a single server.

    <title>Why Do Local Methods Solve Nonconvex Problems?</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Ma:Tengyu.html">Tengyu Ma</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13462">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Non-convex optimization is ubiquitous in modern machine learning. Researchers
devise non-convex objective functions and optimize them using off-the-shelf
optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and its variants, which leverage
the local geometry and update iteratively. Even though solving non-convex
functions is NP-hard in the worst case, the optimization quality in practice is
often not an issue -- optimizers are largely believed to find approximate
global minima. Researchers hypothesize a unified explanation for this
intriguing phenomenon: most of the local minima of the practically-used
objectives are approximately global minima. We rigorously formalize it for
concrete instances of machine learning problems.

    <title>Online Stochastic Matching, Poisson Arrivals, and the Natural Linear Program</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1616803200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Huang:Zhiyi.html">Zhiyi Huang</a>, Xinkai Shu <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13024">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the online stochastic matching problem. Consider a bipartite graph
with offline vertices on one side, and with i.i.d.online vertices on the other
side. The offline vertices and the distribution of online vertices are known to
the algorithm beforehand. The realization of the online vertices, however, is
revealed one at a time, upon which the algorithm immediately decides how to
match it. For maximizing the cardinality of the matching, we give a
$0.711$-competitive online algorithm, which improves the best previous ratio of
$0.706$. When the offline vertices are weighted, we introduce a
$0.7009$-competitive online algorithm for maximizing the total weight of the
matched offline vertices, which improves the best previous ratio of $0.662$.
</p>
<p>Conceptually, we find that the analysis of online algorithms simplifies if
the online vertices follow a Poisson process, and establish an approximate
equivalence between this Poisson arrival model and online stochstic matching.
Technically, we propose a natural linear program for the Poisson arrival model,
and demonstrate how to exploit its structure by introducing a converse of
Jensen's inequality. Moreover, we design an algorithmic amortization to replace
the analytic one in previous work, and as a result get the first
vertex-weighted online stochastic matching algorithm that improves the results
in the weaker random arrival model.

<font color="#000000"/></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/da.png?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-18426" height="155" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/da.png?resize=150%2C155&amp;ssl=1" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>
Dorit Aharonov is a researcher in quantum computation. She was a Ph.D. student of Michael Ben-Or and Avi Wigderson. Her 1999 <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~doria/thesis.ps">thesis</a>, entitled “Noisy Quantum Computation,” included her role with Ben-Or as one of several superposed groups who discovered the quantum fault tolerance threshold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_threshold_theorem">theorem</a>.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I wish to send our congratulations to Avi and Laci—László Lovász—on winning the 2021 <a href="https://www.abelprize.no">Abel Prize</a>.</p>
<p>
The prize citation is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For their foundational contributions to theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, and their leading role in shaping them into central fields of modern mathematics. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Genealogy </h2><p/>
<p>
You might wonder why we are talking about Aharonov? She was a student of Avi and he was a student of mine—see <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=82100">this</a> for more details. I am proud of Avi for his terrific results and also for his great students. I guess Aharonov is a grand-student of mine. </p>
<p>
Lovász and Ken’s advisor, Dominic Welsh of Oxford, partnered with Dominic’s student Magnus Bordewich and Michael Freedman of Microsoft on a 2005 <a href="http://community.dur.ac.uk/m.j.r.bordewich/papers/Bordewich2005-c.pdf">paper</a> titled, “Approximate counting and quantum computation.” The paper translates criteria for approximating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_polynomial">Jones polynomial</a> into simulations of quantum circuits. It references how topological quantum field theory (TQFT) implicitly embodies a quantum algorithm that meets the criteria, hence showing that the Jones approximation problem is complete for <img alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{BQP}}"/> in a suitable promise-problem sense. </p>
<p>
The genealogy of the Jones polynomial is that it was discovered by Vaughan Jones. Aharonov, with Jones and his student Zeph Landau, wrote a 2009 <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00453-008-9168-0.pdf">paper</a> that makes the quantum algorithm for approximating the Jones polynomial explicit. To quote the converse of a statement in their abstract, removing the dependence on TQFT makes the algorithm “accessible to computer scientists.”</p>
<p>
Aharonov’s work thus represents the mixing of elements of classical mathematics and computing theory (including quantum, i.e. non-classical, computing) that this year’s Abel Prize recognizes. <em>Mixing</em> is indeed the word, since results on the mixing rates of Markov chains by Lovász and many others undergird some of this work. This is true even more directly of a notable <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0012090.pdf">paper</a> by her with Andris Ambainis, Julia Kempe, and Umesh Vazirani on quantum walks. </p>
<p/><h2> More Quantum </h2><p/>
<p>
When we hosted the 2012 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/01/30/perpetual-motion-of-the-21st-century/">debate</a> between Gil Kalai and Aram Harrow on the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing, Gil led off with the following photo of the physicist Robert Alicki, Ben-Or, Aharonov, and himself, which was taken in Jerusalem in 2005.</p>
<p/><p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BAAK.png?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18428" height="415" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BAAK.png?resize=557%2C415&amp;ssl=1" width="557"/></a></p>
<p/><p>
Aharonov wrote an influential long <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9812037.pdf">survey</a> in 1998 titled “Quantum Computation,” which grew out of her thesis and is sometimes <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2864868_Noisy_Quantum_Computation">confused</a> with it. Ken and I owe a small debt to diagrams she used in the survey, for which she in turn alluded to Richard Feynman’s path integrals and their visualizations: </p>
<p/><p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AharonovSnip.png?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18429" height="231" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AharonovSnip.png?resize=487%2C231&amp;ssl=1" width="487"/></a></p>
<p/><p>
We expanded on this kind of diagram in our textbook on quantum computing with MIT Press, whose <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-quantum-algorithms-linear-algebra-second-edition">second edition</a> is scheduled to appear next month. </p>
<p/><h2> Abel Prize and Lower Bounds </h2><p/>
<p>
Whereas the Fields Medals are awarded only every four years, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Prize">Abel Prize</a> is annual. It commemorates the Norwegian mathematician Niels Abel. Although it has been awarded only since 2003, it was originally proposed in 1899 expressly as a counterpart to the Nobel Prizes—and fell through only because of the 1905 separation of Sweden and Norway. We most recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/03/21/the-shortest-path-to-the-abel-prize/">covered</a> the 2019 prize going to Karen Uhlenbeck.</p>
<p>
Abel of course is the mathematician who gave his name to abelian groups and much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Niels_Henrik_Abel">else</a>. About his short life of twenty-seven years, Charles Hermite said: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Abel has left mathematicians enough to keep them busy for five hundred years. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
What we note is that Abel’s most famous result is a lower bound type result. He showed the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation in radicals. Finding clever identities, clever inequities, clever algorithms is hard. But not as hard as showing that something cannot be done. </p>
<p>
Abel’s result is perhaps like proving today, in the 21st century, a lower bound on the complexity of some concrete problem. Some of Avi’s and also Laci’s best work has been directed toward this quest: Prove some non-trivial lower bound. Avi has worked on numerous approaches, including the <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/node/817">fusion method</a> in 1993. Although its lack of breakthroughs has caused jibes about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion">cold fusion</a>,” Avi noted the following in a recent <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tbd-9">talk</a> at the Simons Institute: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I will review (and hope to revive) a collection of old works, which suggest obtaining circuit lower bounds by “fusing” many correct computations (of a circuit too small) into an incorrect computation.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
In a couple of models, this viewpoint led to (slight) superlinear lower bounds, which nonetheless have not been improved upon for 25 years. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We hope that the Abel Prize award will promote efforts to achieve not-so-slightly super-linear lower bounds on circuit size, running time, algebraic size, quantum effort, anything like that…</p>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
We also tip our hat to others who have reported on the Abel Prize, including some of our fellow bloggers: Gil Kalai <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/17/cheerful-news-in-difficult-times-the-abel-prize-is-awarded-to-laszlo-lovasz-and-avi-wigderson/">here</a>, Scott Aaronson <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5388">here</a>, Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/03/i-read-news-today-oh-boy.html">here</a>, plus Kevin Hartnett for <i>Quanta</i> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/avi-wigderson-and-laszlo-lovasz-win-abel-prize-20210317/">here</a>.</p></font></font></div>

    <title>TR21-047 |  Random restrictions and PRGs for PTFs in Gaussian Space | 

	Zander Kelley, 

	Raghu Meka</title>
    <summary>A polynomial threshold function (PTF) $f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function of the form $f(x) = sign(p(x))$ where $p$ is a polynomial of degree at most $d$. PTFs are a classical and well-studied complexity class with applications across complexity theory, learning theory, approximation theory, quantum complexity and more. We address the question of designing pseudorandom generators (PRG) for polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) in the gaussian space: design a PRG that takes a seed of few bits of randomness and outputs a $n$-dimensional vector whose distribution is indistinguishable from a standard multivariate gaussian by a degree $d$ PTF. 
     
     Our main result is a PRG that takes a seed of $d^{O(1)}\log ( n / \varepsilon)\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^2$ random bits with output that cannot be distinguished from $n$-dimensional gaussian distribution with advantage better than $\varepsilon$ by degree $d$ PTFs. The best previous generator due to O'Donnell, Servedio, and Tan (STOC'20) had a quasi-polynomial dependence (i.e.,  seedlength of $d^{O(\log d)}$) in the degree $d$. Along the way we prove a few nearly-tight  structural properties of restrictions of PTFs that may be of independent interest.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>With a bit of a delay, we are starting to upload the videos of our seminar’s talks. The <a href="https://toc4fairness.org/inaugural-meeting-toc4fairness-seminar-annette-zimmermann/">Inaugural Meeting</a> of our seminar was devoted to a wonderful talk by Dr. <a href="https://www.annette-zimmermann.com/">Annette Zimmermann</a>.  I highly recommend watching <a href="https://toc4fairness.org/inaugural-meeting-toc4fairness-seminar-annette-zimmermann-2/">the video</a>, and following up with some additional reading (some pointers below).</p>



<p>I won’t try to summarize the talk because I doubt that I can do it justice, but one of the themes (which I fully support) is that it is not enough to consider “fair” implementations of specific tasks. Instead, we (also) want to explore the right task to implement and if it is appropriate to implement any algorithmic task in any specific context. </p>



<p>As a side note, I loved Annette’s statement on ethics,  “if we can choose, we’re on the hook.” For me, it beautifully complements the paradigm that “ought implies can.” In other words, ethical imperatives only exist when the expected action is possible but every choice has ethical implications.   </p>

    <title>When are Neural Networks more powerful than Neural Tangent Kernels?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The empirical success of deep learning has posed significant challenges to machine learning theory: Why can we efficiently train neural networks with gradient descent despite its highly non-convex optimization landscape? Why do over-parametrized networks generalize well? The recently proposed Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory offers a powerful framework for understanding these, but yet still comes with its limitations.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we explore how to analyze wide neural networks beyond the NTK theory, based on our recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01619">Beyond Linearization paper</a> and follow-up <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13436">paper on understanding hierarchical learning</a>. (This blog post is also cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/blog.einstein.ai/beyond-ntk/">Salesforce Research blog</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="neural-tangent-kernels">Neural Tangent Kernels</h3>
<p>The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is a recently proposed theoretical framework for establishing provable convergence and generalization guarantees for wide (over-parametrized) neural networks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572">(Jacot et al. 2018)</a>. Roughly speaking, the NTK theory shows that</p>

<ul>
  <li>A sufficiently wide neural network trains like a linearized model governed by the derivative of the network with respect to its parameters.</li>
  <li>At the infinite-width limit, this linearized model becomes a kernel predictor with the Neural Tangent Kernel (the NTK).</li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, a wide neural network trained with small learning rate converges to 0 training loss and generalize as well as the infinite-width kernel predictor. For a detailed introduction to the NTK, please refer to the earlier <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/10/03/NTK/">blog post</a> by Wei and Simon.</p>

<h3 id="does-ntk-fully-explain-the-success-of-neural-networks">Does NTK fully explain the success of neural networks?</h3>
<p>Although the NTK yields powerful theoretical results, it turns out that real-world deep learning <em>do not operate in the NTK regime</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Empirically, infinite-width NTK kernel predictors perform slightly worse (though competitive) than fully trained neural networks on benchmark tasks such as CIFAR-10 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955">(Arora et al. 2019b)</a>. For finite width networks in practice, this gap is even more profound, as we see in Figure 1: The linearized network is a rather poor approximation of the fully trained network at practical optimization setups such as large initial learning rate <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04010">(Bai et al. 2020)</a>.</li>
  <li>Theoretically, the NTK has poor <em>sample complexity for learning certain simple functions</em>. Though the NTK is a universal kernel that can interpolate any finite, non-degenerate training dataset <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02054">(Du et al. 2018</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03804">, 2019)</a>, the test error of this kernel predictor scales with the RKHS norm of the ground truth function. For certain non-smooth but simple functions such as a single ReLU, this norm can be exponentially large in the feature dimension <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00687">(Yehudai &amp; Shamir 2019)</a>. Consequently, NTK analyses yield poor sample complexity upper bounds for learning such functions, whereas empirically neural nets only require a mild sample size <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1141">(Livni et al. 2014)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<i><b>Figure 1.</b>
Linearized model does not closely approximate the training trajectory of neural networks with practical optimization setups, whereas higher order Taylor models offer a substantially better approximation.

<br/>
<br/>
</div>

<p>These gaps urge us to ask the following</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question</strong>: How can we theoretically study neural networks beyond the NTK regime? Can we prove that neural networks outperform the NTK on certain learning tasks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key technical question here is to mathematically understand neural networks operating <em>outside of the NTK regime</em>.</p>

<h2 id="higher-order-taylor-expansion">Higher-order Taylor expansion</h2>
<p>Our main tool for going beyond the NTK is the <em>Taylor expansion</em>. Consider a two-layer neural network with $m$ neurons, where we only train the “bottom” nonlinear layer $W$:</p>

\[f_{W_0 + W}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \sum_{r=1}^m a_r \sigma( (w_{0,r} + w_r)^\top x).\]

<p>(Here, $W_0+W$ is an $m\times d$ weight matrix, where $W_0$ denotes the random initialization and $W$ denotes the trainable “movement” matrix initialized at zero). For small enough $W$, we can perform a Taylor expansion of the network around $W_0$ and get</p>

\[f_{W_0+W}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \sum_{r=1}^m a_r \sigma(w_{0,r}^\top x) + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \sum_{r=1}^m a_r \frac{\sigma^{(k)} (w_{0,r}^\top x)}{k!} (w_r^\top x)^k\]

<p>Let us denote the $k$-th order term as $ f^{(k)}_{W_0, W}$, and rewrite this as</p>

\[f_{W_0+W}(x) = f^{(0)}_{W_0}(x) + \sum_{k=1}^\infty f^{(k)}_{W_0, W}(x).\]

<p>Each term $ f^{(k)}<em>{W_0, W}$ is a $k$-th order polynomial of the trainable parameter $W$. For the moment assume that $ f^{(0)}</em>{W_0}(x)=0$ (this can be achieved via techniques such as the symmetric initialization).</p>

<p>The key insight of the NTK theory can be described as the following <strong>linearized approximation</strong> property</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For small enough $W$, the neural network $f_{W_0,W}$ is closely approximated by the linear model $f^{(1)}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Towards moving beyond the linearized approximation, in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01619">Beyond Linearization paper</a>, we start by asking</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Why just $f^{(1)}$? Can we also utilize the higher-order term in the Taylor series such as $f^{(2)}$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first sight, this seems rather unlikely, as in Taylor expansions we always expect the linear term $f^{(1)}$ to dominate the whole expansion and have a larger magnitude than $f^{(2)}$ (and subsequent terms).</p>

<h3 id="killing-the-ntk-term-by-randomized-coupling">“Killing” the NTK term by randomized coupling</h3>
<p>We bring forward the idea of <em>randomization</em>, which helps us escape the “domination” of $f^{(1)}$ and couple neural networks with their quadratic Taylor expansion term $f^{(2)}$. This idea appeared first in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04918">Allen-Zhu et al. (2018)</a> for analyzing three-layer networks, and as we will show also applies to two-layer networks in a perhaps more intuitive fashion.</p>

<p>Let us now assign each weight movement $w_r$ with a <em>random sign</em> $s_r\in\{\pm 1\}$, and consider the randomized weights $\{s_rw_r\}$. The random signs satisfy the following basic properties:</p>

\[E[s_r]=0 \quad {\rm and} \quad s_r^2 \equiv 1.\]

<p>Therefore, let $SW\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ denote the randomized weight matrix, we can compare the first and second order terms in the Taylor expansion at $SW$:</p>

\[E_{S} \left[f^{(1)}_{W_0, SW}(x)\right] = E_{S} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\sum_{r\le m} a_r \sigma'(w_{0,r}^\top x) (s_rw_r^\top x) \right] = 0,\]

<p>whereas</p>

\[f^{(2)}_{W_0, SW}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\sum_{r\le m} a_r \frac{\sigma^{(2)}(w_{0,r}^\top x)}{2} (s_rw_r^\top x)^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\sum_{r\le m} a_r \frac{\sigma^{(2)}(w_{0,r}^\top x)}{2} (w_r^\top x)^2 = f^{(2)}_{W_0, W}(x).\]

<p>Observe that the sign randomization keeps the quadratic term $f^{(2)}$ unchanged, but “kills” the linear term $f^{(1)}$ in expectation!</p>

<p>If we train such a randomized network with freshly sampled signs $S$ at each iteration, the linear term $f^{(1)}$ will keep oscillating around zero and does not have any power in fitting the data, whereas the quadratic term is not affected at all and thus becomes the leading force for fitting the data. (The keen reader may notice that this randomization is similar to Dropout, with the key difference being that we randomize the weight <em>movement</em> matrix, whereas vanilla Dropout randomizes the weight matrix itself.)</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/beyond-ntk.png" style="width: 700px;"/>
<br/>
<i><b>Figure 2.</b>
The NTK regime operates in the "NTK ball" where the network is approximately equal to the linear term. The quadratic regime operates in a larger ball where the network is approximately equal to the sum of first two terms, but the linear term dominates and can blow up at large width. Our randomized coupling technique resolves this by introducing the random sign matrix that in expectation "kills" the linear term but always preserves the quadratic term.
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
</div>

<p>Our first result shows that networks with sign randomization can still be efficiently optimized, despite its now non-convex optimization landscape:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Any escaping-saddle algorithm (e.g. noisy SGD) on the regularized loss function $E_S[L(W_0+SW)]+R(W)$, with freshly sampled sign $S=S_t$ per iteration, can find the global minimum in polynomial time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proof builds on the quadratic approximation $E_S[f]\approx f^{(2)}$ and recent understandings on neural networks with quadratic activation, e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04926">Soltanolkotabi et al. (2017)</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01206">Du and Lee (2018)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="generalization-and-sample-complexity-case-study-on-learning-low-rank-polynomials">Generalization and sample complexity: Case study on learning low-rank polynomials</h3>
<p>We next study the generalization of these networks in the context of learning <em>low-rank degree-$p$ polynomials</em>:</p>

\[f_\star(x) = \sum_{s=1}^{r_\star} \alpha_s (\beta_s^\top x)^{p_s}, \quad |\alpha_s|\le 1,\|(\beta_s^\top x)^{p_s}\|_{L_2} \le 1, p_s\le p \quad \textrm{for all } s.\]

<p>We are specifically interested in the case where $r_\star$ is small (e.g. $O(1)$), so that $y$ only depends on the projection of $x$ on a few directions. This for example captures teacher networks with polynomial activation of bounded degree and analytic activation (approximately), as well as constant depth teacher networks with polynomial activations.</p>

<p>For the NTK, the sample complexity of learning polynomials have been studied extensively in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08584">(Arora et al. 2019a)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12191">(Ghorbani et al. 2019)</a>, and many concurrent work. Combined, they showed that the sample complexity for learning degree-$p$ polynomials is $\Theta(d^p)$, with matching lower and upper bounds:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (NTK)</strong> : Suppose $x$ is uniformly distributed on the sphere, then the NTK requires $O(d^p)$ samples in order to achieve a small test error for learning any degree-$p$ polynomial, and there is a matching lower bound of $\Omega(d^p)$ for any inner-product kernel method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.0161">Beyond Linearization paper</a>, we show that the quadratic Taylor model achieves an improved sample complexity of  $\tilde{O}(d^{p-1})$ with isotropic inputs:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (Quadratic Model)</strong>: For mildly isotropic input distributions, the two-layer quadratic Taylor model (or two-layer NN with sign randomization) only requires $\tilde{O}({\rm poly}(r_\star, p)d^{p-1})$ samples in order to achieve a small test error for learning a low-rank degree-$p$ polynomial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13436">follow-up paper on understanding hierarchical learning</a>, we further design a “hierarchical learner” using a specific three-layer network, and show the following</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (Three-layer hierarchical model)</strong>: Under mild input distribution assumptions, a three-layer network with a fixed representation layer of width $D=d^{p/2}$ and a trainable quadratic Taylor layer can achieve a small test error using only $\tilde{O}({\rm poly}(r_\star, p)d^{p/2})$ samples.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When $r_\star,p=O(1)$, the quadratic Taylor model can improve over the NTK by a multiplicative factor of $d$, and we can further get a substantially larger improvement of $d^{p/2}$ by using the three-layer hierarchical learner. Here we briefly discuss the proof intuitions, and refer the reader to our papers for more details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Generalization bounds</strong>: We show that, while the NTK and quadratic Taylor model expresses functions using similar random feature constructions, their generalization depends differently on the norm of the input. In the NTK, the generalization depends on the L2 norm of the features (as well as the weights), whereas generalization of the quadratic Taylor model depends on the operator norm of the input matrix features $\frac{1}{n}\sum x_ix_i^\top$ times the nuclear norm of $\sum w_rw_r^\top$. It turns out that this decomposition can match the one given by the NTK (it is never worse), and in addition be better by a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ if the input distribution is mildly isotropic so that $\|\frac{1}{n}\sum x_ix_i^\top\|_{\rm op} \le 1/\sqrt{d} \cdot \max \|x_i\|_2^2$, leading to the $O(d)$ improvement in the sample complexity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hierarchical learning</strong>: The key intuition behind the hierarchical learner is that we can utilize the $O(d)$ sample complexity gain to its fullest, by applying quadratic Taylor model to not the input $x$, but a feature representation $h(x)\in \mathbb{R}^D$ where $D\gg d$. This yields a gain as long as $h$ is rich enough to express $f_\star$ and also isotropic enough to let the operator norm $\|\frac{1}{n}\sum h(x_i)h(x_i)^\top\|_{\rm op}$ be nice. In particular, for learning degree-$p$ polynomials, the best we can do is to choose $D=d^{p/2}$, leading to a sample complexity saving of $\tilde{O}(D)=\tilde{O}(d^{p/2})$.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h3>
<p>In this post, we explored higher-order Taylor expansions (in particular the quadratic expansion) as an approach to deep learning theory beyond the NTK regime. The Taylorization approach has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-convex but benign optimization landscape;</li>
  <li>Provable generalization benefits over NTKs;</li>
  <li>Ability of modeling hierarchical learning;</li>
  <li>Convenient API for expeirmentation (cf. the <a href="https://github.com/google/neural-tangents">Neural Tangents</a> package and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04010">Taylorized training</a> paper).</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe these advantages make the Taylor expansion a powerful tool for deep learning theory, and our results are just a beginning. We also remark that there are other theoretical frameworks such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08156">Neural Tangent Hierarchy</a> or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06561">Mean-Field Theory</a> that go beyond the NTK with their own advantages in various angles, but without computational efficiency guarantees. See the <a href="https://jasondlee88.github.io/slides/beyond_ntk.pdf">slides</a> for more on going beyond NTK. Making progress on any of these directions (or coming up with new ones) would be an exciting direction for future work.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-046 |  Fourier Growth of Parity Decision Trees | 

	Uma Girish, 

	Avishay Tal, 

	Kewen Wu</title>
    <summary>We prove that for every parity decision tree of depth $d$ on $n$ variables, the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients at level $\ell$ is at most $d^{\ell/2} \cdot O(\ell \cdot \log(n))^\ell$. 
Our result is nearly tight for small values of $\ell$ and extends a previous Fourier bound for standard decision trees by Sherstov, Storozhenko, and Wu (STOC, 2021). 

As an application of our Fourier bounds, using the results of Bansal and Sinha (STOC, 2021), we show that the $k$-fold Forrelation problem has (randomized) parity decision tree complexity  $\tilde{\Omega}\left(n^{1-1/k}\right)$, while having quantum query complexity $\lceil k/2\rceil$. 

Our proof follows a random-walk approach, analyzing the contribution of a random path in the decision tree to the level-$\ell$ Fourier expression. 
To carry the argument, we apply a careful cleanup procedure to the parity decision tree, ensuring that the value of the random walk is bounded with high probability. We observe that step sizes for the level-$\ell$ walks can be computed by the intermediate values of level $\le \ell-1$ walks, which calls for an inductive argument.
Our approach differs from previous proofs of Tal (FOCS, 2020) and Sherstov, Storozhenko, and Wu (STOC, 2021) that relied on decompositions of the tree. In particular, for the special case of standard decision trees we view our proof as slightly simpler and more intuitive.

In addition, we prove a similar bound for noisy decision trees of cost at most $d$ -- a model that was recently introduced by Ben-David and Blais (FOCS, 2020).</summary>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We revisit and settle a fundamental problem in statistics: given access to independent samples from a 1D random variable (with finite but unknown mean and variance), what is the best way to estimate the mean in the high probability regime, in terms of error convergence with respect to sample size? The conventional wisdom is to use the empirical mean as our estimate. However, it is known that the empirical mean can in fact have exponentially sub-optimal convergence for certain heavy-tailed distributions. On the other hand, the median-of-means estimator (invented and reinvented in various literature) does have sub-Gaussian convergence for all finite-variance distributions, albeit only in the big-O sense with a sub-optimal multiplicative constant. The natural remaining question then, is whether it is possible to bridge the gap, and have an estimator that has optimal convergence with the right constant for all finite-variance distributions.</p>
<p>In this talk, we answer the question affirmatively by giving an estimator that converges with the optimal constant inside the big-O, up to a 1+o(1) multiplicative factor. The estimator is also easy to compute. The convergence analysis involves deriving tail bounds using linear and convex-concave programming dualities, which may be of independent interest.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Paul Valiant.</p></blockquote></div>

Sarah Hart holds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham_Professor_of_Geometry">chair</a> that dates back to 1597—Gresham Professor of Geometry at Birkbeck, University of London.  She is a British mathematician specialising in group theory. The British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences">modifier</a> is redundant since I spelled specialising with a “s” not a “z”: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Today’s British English spellings mostly follow Samuel Johnson’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language">A Dictionary of the English Language</a> (1755), while many American English spellings follow Webster’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s_Dictionary">An American Dictionary of the English Language</a> (1828). </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Today we will discuss history, making history, and more.<br/>
<span id="more-18389"/></p>
<p>
Hart is an excellent writer about math with a special interest in history and in non-standard applications of math to things like Moby-Dick. See the recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/science/math-gresham-sarah-hart.html">article</a> in the science section of the New York Times about Hart: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For the mathematician Sarah Hart, a close reading of “Moby-Dick” reveals not merely “one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world” and “the greatest book of the sea ever written,” but also a work awash in mathematical metaphors. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/?attachment_id=18329" rel="attachment wp-att-18329"><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-18329" height="194" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wt.png?resize=259%2C194&amp;ssl=1" width="259"/></a></p>
<p>
Hart’s paper on Moby-Dick is titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12102.pdf">Ahab’s Arithmetic</a>. I bet few articles on the arxiv website are on fictional works like Moby-Dick: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Herman Melville’s novel Moby-Dick contains a surprising number of mathematical allusions. In this article we explore some of these, as well as discussing the questions that naturally follow: why did Melville choose to use so much mathematical imagery? How did Melville come to acquire the level of mathematical knowledge shown in the novel? And is it commensurate with the general level of mathematical literacy at that time? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Hart also has given many talks on math from a unique point of <a href="https://www.gresham.ac.uk/professorships/geometry-professorship/">view</a>.</p>
<p/><h2> Group Theory History </h2><p/>
<p>
Hart is the current <a href="https://www.bshm.ac.uk/where-our-members-are">president</a> of the British Society for the History of Mathematics: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Mathematics has been part of human culture since the beginnings of civilization. Its study and practice has gone hand in hand with the evolution and development of commerce, architecture, legal theory, cosmology, astrology, and countless other activities. The history of mathematics today addresses a rich cultural heritage across continents, peoples, and ages, taking in the practical traditions of merchants’ accounts and surveying just as it does the elevated traditions of learned scholars at court or the modern day university professor. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Hart adds: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In this <a href="https://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/id/eprint/26953/">article</a> we explore mathematical allusions in Herman Melville’s novel Moby-Dick. We argue that both the quantity and sophistication of these allusions are evidence for Melville’s high level of mathematical knowledge and ability. We discuss some of the most compelling mathematical imagery, as well as giving background on the several mathematicians and mathematics books mentioned in the novel. We also include some biographical details supporting the assertion that Melville had an unusually good mathematical education. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Another view of history is given by Alma <a href="https://history.columbia.edu/person/alma-steingart/">Steingart</a> of the history department of Columbia. Steingart has written, for example, an <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/histmath/files/2015/11/steingart-group-theory.pdf">article</a> on the history of the classification of all simple groups: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Over a period of more than 30 years, more than 100 mathematicians worked on a project to classify mathematical objects known as finite simple groups. The Classification, when officially declared completed in 1981, ranged between 300 and 500 articles and ran somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 journal pages. Mathematicians have hailed the project as one of the greatest mathematical achievements of the 20th century, and it surpasses, both in scale and scope, any other mathematical proof of the 20th century. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Decades ago as soon as we started to think about the <a href="https://www.uni-ulm.de/fileadmin/website_uni_ulm/iui.inst.190/Mitarbeiter/wagner/GroupIso_040712.pdf">group isomorphism</a> problem we realized there is an application of the classification theorem: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We can use it to prove that isomorphism for finite simple groups is in polynomial time. The proof is simple—bad pun: Just use the fact that all simple groups are generated by at most <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2}"/> elements. So just try all possible pairs. See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/advances-on-group-isomorphism/">GLL</a> for some more comments. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Making Group Theory History </h2><p/>
<p>
Hart may be interested in the history of math, but proving new theorems is perhaps the best way to affect history. The <a href="https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v16i1r59/pdf">paper</a> titled Small maximal sum-free sets by Michael Giudici and Hart solves a previously open problem. The site <i>Theorem of day</i> highlights this paper <a href="https://www.theoremoftheday.org/GroupTheory/SumFree/TotDSumFree.pdf">here</a>. Also Tim <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.3877.pdf">Gowers</a> proved some related results.</p>
<p>
Hart’s main theorem is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Let <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> be a finite group and let <img alt="{&lt;S&gt;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3CS%3E%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{&lt;S&gt;}"/> be the subgroup generated by a subset <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> of the elements of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>. Then unless <img alt="{|S | \le 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CS+%7C+%5Cle+2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{|S | \le 2}"/>, <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> cannot be both maximally sum-free and minimal with respect to generating <img alt="{&lt;S&gt;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3CS%3E%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{&lt;S&gt;}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Consider a set <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> of elements in a finite group <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>. There are two properties that <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> can have, and these properties act in opposite directions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Force <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> to be smaller: The set <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> is sum-free. This means that for <img alt="{a, b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2C+b%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a, b}"/> in <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/>,
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  ab \not\in S. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++ab+%5Cnot%5Cin+S.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  ab \not\in S. "/></p>
</li><li>Force <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> to be larger: The set is minimal generator for <img alt="{&lt;S&gt;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3CS%3E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{&lt;S&gt;}"/>. This means that it is not possible to generate <img alt="{&lt;S&gt;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3CS%3E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{&lt;S&gt;}"/> with less elements than <img alt="{|S|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CS%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{|S|}"/>.  Intuitively these properties work against each other. Adding an element to <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> could violate sum-free; deleting an element from <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> could violate generation.

<h2>Mathematics and the real world</h2>
<h3>Zvi Artstein  <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/c30.pdf">The pendulum under vibrations revisited</a></h3>
<p>Zvi (Zvika) was one of the first people that I met in 1971 at the university as a high school student and he gave me a lot of good advice and help. Here he shed light on an old mystery!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Abstract: A simple intuitive physical explanation is offered, of the stability of the inverted pendulum under fast violent vibrations. The direct description allows to analyze, both intuitively and rigorously, the effect of vibrations in similar, and in more general, situations. The rigorous derivations in the paper follow a singular perturbations model of mixed slow and fast dynamics. The approach allows applications beyond the classical inverted pendulum model.</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I first heard about the stability of the inverted pendulum under fast violent vibrations from Sylvia Serfaty in connection with <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/the-intermediate-value-theorem-applied-to-football/">my study of “forehead-football.” See this post</a>. Let me mention with pride that Endre Szemeredi, who is a fan of football in general (and a capable player), is also a fan of my forehead-football idea.</p>
<h3>Imre Bárány, William Steiger, and Sivan Toledo <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06838">the cocked hat</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Abstract (arXive): We revisit the cocked hat — an old problem from navigation — and examine under what conditions its old solution is valid.</em></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great story, read it in <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-navigation/article/abs/cocked-hat-formal-statements-and-proofs-of-the-theorems/5264C1491A61116CAF7B890161CFD091">The Journal of Navigation</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06838">on the arXive.</a></p>
<h2>Rigidity</h2>
<h3>Katie Clinch, Bill Jackson, Shin-ichi Tanigawa: Maximal Matroid Problem on Graphs</h3>
<div>In mid January, we had a <strong>great lecture</strong> by <b/>Shin-ichi Tanigawa (University of Tokyo). I certainly plan to blog about it. Here is the abstract.</div>
<div> </div>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The problem of characterizing the 3-dimensional generic rigidity of graphs is one of the major open problems in graph rigidity theory. Walter <span class="il">Whiteley</span> conjectured that the 3-dimensional generic matroid coincides with a matroid studied in the context of bivariate splines.  In this talk I will show a solution to the characterization problem for the latter matroid. </em></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>I will explain the idea of our characterization from the view point of constructing maximal matroids on complete graphs. Specifically, for a graph H, a matroid on the edge set of a complete graph is called an H-matroid if every edge set of each subgraph isomorphic to H is a circuit. A main theme of my talk will be about identifying and constructing a maximal H-matroid with respect to the weak order. This talk is based on a joint work with Bill Jackson and Katie Clinch.</em></span>

    <title>TR21-045 |  Reconstruction Algorithms for Low-Rank Tensors and Depth-3 Multilinear Circuits | 

	Vishwas Bhargava, 

	Shubhangi Saraf, 

	Ilya Volkovich</title>
    <summary>We give new and efficient black-box reconstruction algorithms for some classes of depth-$3$ arithmetic circuits. As a consequence, we obtain the first efficient algorithm for computing the tensor rank and for finding the optimal tensor decomposition as a sum of rank-one tensors when then input is a {\it constant-rank} tensor. More specifically, we provide efficient learning algorithms that run in randomized polynomial time over general fields and in deterministic polynomial time over $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb C$ for the following classes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\it Set-multilinear depth-$3$ circuits of constant top fan-in ($\Sigma\Pi\Sigma_{{\sqcup_j X_j}}(k)$ circuits)}. As a consequence of our algorithm, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm for tensor rank computation and optimal tensor decomposition of constant-rank tensors. This result holds for $d$ dimensional tensors for any $d$, but is interesting even for $d=3$.
    \item {\it Sums of powers of constantly many linear forms ($\Sigma\!\wedge\!\Sigma(k)$ circuits)}.  As a consequence we obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm for tensor rank computation and optimal tensor decomposition of constant-rank symmetric tensors.
    \item {\it Multilinear depth-3 circuits of constant top fan-in (multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma(k)$ circuits)}. Our algorithm works over all fields of characteristic 0 or large enough characteristic. Prior to our work the only efficient algorithms known were over polynomially-sized finite fields \cite{KarninShpilka09}. 
\end{enumerate}
Prior to our work, the only polynomial-time or even subexponential-time algorithms known (deterministic or randomized) for subclasses of $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma(k)$ circuits that also work over large/infinite fields were for the setting when the top fan-in $k$ is at most $2$ \cite{Sin16, Sin20}.</summary>

    <title>TR21-044 |  SAT-based Circuit Local Improvement | 

	Alexander Kulikov, 

	Nikita Slezkin</title>
    <summary>Finding exact circuit size is a notorious optimization problem in practice. Whereas modern computers and algorithmic techniques allow to find a circuit of size seven in blink of an eye, it may take more than a week to search for a circuit of size thirteen. One of the reasons of this behavior is that the search space is enormous: the number of circuits of size $s$ is $s^{\Theta(s)}$, the number of Boolean functions on $n$ variables is $2^{2^n}$.

In this paper, we explore the following natural heuristic idea for decreasing the size of a given circuit: go through all its subcircuits of moderate size and check whether any of them can be improved by reducing to SAT. This may be viewed as a local search approach: we search for a smaller circuit in a ball around a given circuit. We report the results of experiments with various symmetric functions.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>For years, I’d sometimes hear discussions about the <em>ethics</em> of quantum computing research.  Quantum ethics!</p>



<p>When the debates weren’t purely semantic, over the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">propriety</a> of terms like “quantum supremacy” or “ancilla qubit,” they were always about chin-strokers like “but what if cracking RSA encryption gives governments more power to surveil their citizens?  or what if only a few big countries or companies get quantum computers, thereby widening the divide between haves and have-nots?”  Which, OK, conceivably these will someday be issues.  But, besides barely depending on any specific facts about quantum computing, these debates always struck me as oddly <em>safe</em>, because the moral dilemmas were so hypothetical and far removed from us in time.</p>



<p>I confess I may have even occasionally poked fun when asked to expound on quantum ethics.  I may have commented that quantum computers probably won’t kill anyone unless a dilution refrigerator tips over onto their head.  I may have asked forgiveness for feeding custom-designed oracles to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP">BQP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QMA">QMA</a>, without first consulting an ethics committee about the long-term effects on those complexity classes.</p>



<p>Now fate has punished me for my flippancy.  These days, I really <em>do</em> feel like quantum computing research has become an ethical minefield—but not for any of the reasons mentioned previously.  What’s new is that millions of dollars are now potentially available to quantum computing researchers, along with equity, stock options, and whatever else causes “ka-ching” sound effects and bulging eyes with dollar signs.  And in many cases, to have a shot at such riches, all an expert needs to do is profess optimism that quantum computing will have revolutionary, world-changing applications and have them <em>soon</em>.  Or at least, not object too strongly when others say that.</p>



<p>Some of today’s rhetoric will of course remind people of the D-Wave saga, which first brought this blog to prominence when it began in earnest in 2007.  Quantum computers, we hear now as then, will soon leave the Earth’s fastest supercomputers in the dust.  They’re going to harness superposition to try all the exponentially many possible solutions at once.  They’ll crack the Traveling Salesman Problem, and will transform machine learning and AI beyond recognition.  Meanwhile, simulations of quantum systems will be key to solving global warming and cancer.</p>



<p>Despite the parallels, though, this new gold rush <em>doesn’t</em> feel to me like the D-Wave one, which seems in retrospect like just a little dry run.  If I had to articulate what’s new in one sentence, it’s that this time “the call is coming from inside the house.”  Many of the companies making wildly overhyped claims are recognized leaders of the field.  They have brilliant quantum computing theorists and experimentalists on their staff with impeccable research records.  Some of those researchers are among my best friends.  And even when I wince at the claims of near-term applications, in many cases (especially with quantum simulation) the claims aren’t <em>obviously</em> false—we won’t know for certain until we try it and see!  It’s genuinely gotten harder to draw the line between defensible optimism and exaggerations verging on fraud.</p>



<p>Indeed, this time around virtually <em>everyone</em> in QC is “complicit” to a greater or lesser degree.  I, too, have accepted compensation to consult on quantum computing topics, to give talks at hedge funds, and in a few cases to serve as a scientific adviser to quantum computing startups.  I tell myself that, by 2021 standards, this stuff is all trivial chump change—a few thousands of dollars here or there, to expound on the same themes that I already discuss free of charge on this blog.  I actually get paid to <em>dispel</em> hype, rather than propagate it!  I tell myself that I’ve turned my back on the orders of magnitude more money available to those willing to hitch their scientific reputations to the aspirations of this or that specific QC company.  (Yes, this blog, and my desire to preserve its intellectual independence and credibility, might well be costing me millions!)</p>



<p>But, OK, some would argue that accepting <em>any</em> money from QC companies or QC investors just puts you at the top of a slope with unabashed snake-oil salesmen at the bottom.  With the commercialization of our field that started around 2015, there’s no bright line anymore marking the boundary between pure scientific curiosity and the pursuit of filthy lucre; it’s all just points along a continuum.  I’m not sure that these people are wrong.</p>



<p>As some of you might’ve seen already, IonQ, the trapped-ion QC startup that originated from the University of Maryland, is poised to have the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ionq-m-a-dmy-technology/quantum-computing-provider-ionq-to-go-public-via-2-billion-spac-deal-idUSKBN2B013Z">first-ever quantum computing IPO</a>—a so-called “SPAC IPO,” which while I’m a financial ignoramus, apparently involves merging with a shell company and thereby bypassing the SEC’s normal IPO rules.  Supposedly they’re seeking $650 million in new funding and a $2 billion market cap.  If you want to see what IonQ is saying about QC to prospective investors, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e33152a051d2e7588f7571c/t/60459578b8c075444a656357/1615173012167/IonQ+Investor+Presentation+030721+vFF.pdf">click here</a>.  Lacking any choice in the matter, I’ll probably say more about these developments in a future post.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://psiquantum.com/">PsiQuantum</a>, the Palo-Alto-based optical QC startup, has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5af3039-abbf-4b25-92e2-c40e5957c8cd">said</a> that it’s soon going to leave “stealth mode.”  And Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Honeywell, and other big players continue making large investments in QC—treating it, at least rhetorically, not at all like blue-sky basic research, but like a central part of their future business plans.</p>



<p>All of these companies have produced or funded excellent QC research.  And of course, they’re all heterogeneous, composed of individuals who might vehemently disagree with each other about the near- or long-term prospects of QC.  And yet all of them have, at various times, inspired reflections in me like the ones in this post.</p>



<p>I regret that this post has no clear conclusion.  I’m still hashing things out, solicing thoughts from my readers and friends.  Speaking of which: this coming Monday, March 22, at 8-10pm US Eastern time, I’ve decided to hold a discussion around these issues on <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a>—my “grand debut” on that app, and an opportunity to see whether I like it or not!  My friend Adam Brown will moderate the discussion; other likely participants will be John Horgan, George Musser, Michael Nielsen, and Matjaž Leonardis.  If you’re on Clubhouse, I hope to see you there!</p>

<p>
Daniela Kühn is the Mason Professor in Mathematics at the University of Birmingham. She works in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. She has many honors, including giving an invited lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2014.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we should look at a new result of hers.</p>
<p>
By the way, as I wrote this draft, I was excited to see that it was the second time we highlighted a researcher from Bi*ngham*. <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com">Previously</a> we highlighted Jessica Fridrich, from Binghamton University. OK, they are different places, in different countries, but the closeness in edit distance caught my eye.</p>
<p>
Kühn says <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/maths/kuhn-daniela.aspx">here</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Recently I have focused on sufficient conditions for Hamilton cycles in directed graphs, i.e. cycles which contain all the vertices of the directed graph. It is unlikely that there is a good characterization of all (directed) graphs containing a Hamilton cycle since the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete. So it is natural to ask for sufficient conditions for the existence of a Hamilton cycle. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here is her <a href="https://silo.tips/download/hamiltonian-degree-sequences-in-digraphs">paper</a> on degree sequences on directed graphs that force Hamilton cycles. It is joint with Deryk Osthus and Andrew Treglown. </p>
<p/><h2> The Conjecture </h2><p/>
<p>
Paul Erdős is known for his conjectures as well as his countless results. Here are two of his open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conjectures_by_Paul_Erdos">ones</a> that are directly about graphs: </p>
<ol>
<li>The Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture on coloring unions of cliques.
</li><li>The Erdős-Hajnal conjecture that in a family of graphs defined by an excluded induced subgraph, every graph has either a large clique or a large independent set.
</li></ol>
<p>Of course math is tricky: A conjecture like the—</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Erdős-Szekeres conjecture on the number of points needed to ensure that a point set contains a large convex polygon. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>—could still be about graphs. Consider the graph that is <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\dots}"/></p>
<p>
Well, the conjecture (1) is now claimed to be solved, and so the list of open conjectures is one less. Kühn with co-authors Dong Yeap Kang, Tom Kelly, Abhishek Methuku, and Deryk Osthus have claimed to resolve it. I have no reason to doubt these top researchers—it’s just until it is refereed. Their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04698.pdf">paper</a> is cleverly titled: A Proof Of The Erdős-Faber-Lovász Conjecture. </p>

This conjecture, now almost 50 years old, states that a graph that consists of complete graphs of size <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> that barely overlap can be colored with <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> colors. Here barely overlap is they have no edge in common. </p>
<p>
That is: If <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/> complete graphs, each having exactly <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/> vertices, have the property that every pair of complete graphs has at most one shared vertex, then the union of the graphs can be properly colored with <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/> colors. The following picture should help you understand the conjecture:</p>

<p>
The conjecture can be stated various ways:<br/>

<p>
The chromatic index of a hypergraph <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{H}"/> is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{H}"/> so that any two edges that share a vertex have different colors.</p>
<p/><h2> Previous Results </h2><p/>
<p>
While Kühn’s paper solves the conjecture, there were many partial results before. These prefer to view the conjecture as one about hypergraphs. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A linear hypergraph (also known as partial linear space) is a hypergraph with the property that every two hyperedges have at most one vertex in common. A hypergraph is said to be uniform if all of its hyperedges have the same number of vertices as each other.

In this language, the Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture states that, given any <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>-uniform linear hypergraph with <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> hyperedges, one may <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>-color the vertices such that each hyperedge has one vertex of each color.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
A simple hypergraph is a hypergraph in which at most one hyperedge connects any pair of vertices and there are no hyperedges of size at most one. In the graph coloring formulation of the Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture, it is safe to remove vertices that belong to a single clique, as their coloring presents no difficulty; once this is done, the hypergraph that has a vertex for each clique, and a hyperedge for each graph vertex, forms a simple hypergraph. And, the hypergraph dual of vertex coloring is edge coloring. Thus, the Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture is equivalent to the statement that any simple hypergraph with <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> vertices has chromatic index (edge coloring number) at most <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>. </em>

    <title>TR21-043 |  Promise Problems Meet Pseudodeterminism | 

	Peter Dixon,

	N. V. Vinodchandran</title>
    <summary>The  Acceptance Probability Estimation Problem (APEP) is to additively approximate the acceptance probability of a Boolean circuit. This problem admits a probabilistic approximation scheme. A central question is whether we can design a pseudodeterministic approximation algorithm for this problem: a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a canonical approximation with high probability. Recently, it was shown that such an algorithm would imply that every approximation algorithm can be made pseudodeterministic (Dixon, Pavan, Vinodchandran; (ITCS 2021).    

The main conceptual contribution of this work is to establish that the existence of a pseudodeterministic algorithm for APEP is fundamentally connected to the relationship between probabilistic promise classes and the corresponding standard complexity classes. In particular, we show the following equivalence:  every promise problem in PromiseBPP has a solution in BPP if and only if APEP has a pseudodeterministic algorithm. Based on this intuition, we show that pseudodeterministic algorithms for APEP  can shed light on a few central topics in complexity theory such as circuit lowerbounds, probabilistic hierarchy theorems, and multi-pseudodeterminism.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In Rome we have an expression, <em>mai una gioia</em> (literally, “never (a moment of) joy”) that applies well to the present times. Yesterday, there was, finally, something to be joyous about: the announcement that two of my heroes, Laszlo Lovasz and Avi Wigderson, will share the 2021 Abel Prize, one of the highest honors of mathematics.</p>
<p>The reader can find a very good article about them on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/avi-wigderson-and-laszlo-lovasz-win-abel-prize-20210317/">Quanta Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of talking about their greatest accomplishment, here I would like to recall two beautiful and somewhat related results, that admit a short treatment.</p>
<p><span id="more-4504"/></p>
<p>Avi’s first paper was on the 3-coloring problem. He described a polynomial time algorithm that, given a 3-colorable graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, finds a valid coloring of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with <img alt="{O(\sqrt n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors, where <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the number of vertices. The starting point is that if every vertex in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> had degree <img alt="{\leq \sqrt n -1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cleq+%5Csqrt+n+-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then there is an easy way to color the graph with <img alt="{\sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors (look at the vertices in any order, choose for each vertex a color not already used for the neighbors that have already been considered).</p>
<p>What if there is some vertex <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of degree <img alt="{\geq \sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgeq+%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? Well, and this is the idea of the paper, the <em>neighbors of <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> must induce a bipartite subgraph</em>, so we can color the neighbors of <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with 2 colors in a way that is consistent with all the edges between neighbors of <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then remove the neighbors of <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and continue with the rest of the graph, committing to never use those two colors again. Every time we do this, we consume two colors but we get rid of <img alt="{\geq \sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgeq+%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> vertices, so this costs us at most <img alt="{2\sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors. When we are done, all remaining vertices have degree <img alt="{\leq \sqrt n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cleq+%5Csqrt+n-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and we just need <img alt="{\sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> more colors as observed above.</p>
<p>In total, we used at most <img alt="{3\sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors.</p>
<p>This remained the state of the art for approximate graph coloring for a few years, until Avrim Blum improved the bound for 3-colorable graphs to <img alt="{O(n^{0.4})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B0.4%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and then to <img alt="{O(n^{3/8})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B3%2F8%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors, using more sophisticated combinatorial arguments. Later, Karger, Motwani and Sudan devised an approximation algorithm that uses <img alt="{\tilde O(n^{1/4})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+O%28n%5E%7B1%2F4%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors to color 3-colorable graphs, and is based on a semidefinite programming relaxation of the coloring problem, which is related to the Lovasz <em>theta function</em>. It is still open whether there is a polynomial time algorithm that uses <img alt="{n^{o(1)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors.</p>
<p>The Lovasz theta function <img alt="{\theta (G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta+%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a convex relaxation of the maximum independent set problem in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. It is, or it can be formulated as, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the maximum independent set problem, and so it can be computed (up to arbitrarily good accuracy) in polynomial time.</p>
<p>Lovasz defined the theta function to study the <em>Shannon capacity of a graph</em>. This is a question that arises when one wants to find error-correcting codes for a channel that may introduce errors. Suppose that the channel carries an element of an alphabet <img alt="{V}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of size <img alt="{n=|V|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D%7CV%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and that certain pairs of alphabet elements can be “confused” by the channel, meaning that for certain pairs <img alt="{\{ a,b \}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B+a%2Cb+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> the channel may output <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> given <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or viceversa. If we construct the graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> whose vertex set is <img alt="{V}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and whose edges are the pairs of “confusable” pairs, then an independent set in this graph gives a set of length-1 codewords that are not confusable, and <img alt="{\log_2 \alpha(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog_2+%5Calpha%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="{\alpha(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the size of a maximal independent set in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, is the number of bits that we can transmit in an errorless way by making one use of the channel. If we can access the channel <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> times, then an errorless code is an independent set in <img alt="{G^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the graph that has vertex set <img alt="{V^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and such that <img alt="{((a_1,\ldots,a_k),(b_1,\ldots,b_k))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%28a_1%2C%5Cldots%2Ca_k%29%2C%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_k%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an edge if and only if all the pairs <img alt="{(a_i,b_i)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a_i%2Cb_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are edges of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The number of bits of information per channel use that we can send is</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac 1k \log \alpha(G^k) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac+1k+%5Clog+%5Calpha%28G%5Ek%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> and so we are interested in</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} (\alpha (G^k))^{1/k} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clim_%7Bk%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D+%28%5Calpha+%28G%5Ek%29%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> Nicely, we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \theta (G^k) = (\theta(G))^k " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Ctheta+%28G%5Ek%29+%3D+%28%5Ctheta%28G%29%29%5Ek+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> so we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \theta(G) \geq \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} (\alpha (G^k))^{1/k} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Ctheta%28G%29+%5Cgeq+%5Clim_%7Bk%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D+%28%5Calpha+%28G%5Ek%29%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> and the theta function provides an upper bound to the Shannon capacity of a graph.</p>
<p>If we compute <img alt="{\theta (\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta+%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="{\bar G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the complement of the graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (that is, the graph whose edges are all the non-edges of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), then we see that <img alt="{\theta(\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a relaxation of the maximum clique problem in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Remarkably, <img alt="{\theta(\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is also a <em>lower bound</em> to the chromatic number of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and so it is <em>sandwiched</em> between the clique number and the chromatic number. Don Knuth has used this fact as a starting point for a wonderful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9312214">49-page treatise</a> on convex relaxations of the chromatic number and the clique number; here we will see a quick proof of this fact.</p>
<p>As you can see in Knuth’s survey, there are several equivalent ways to define the theta function. Below we define <img alt="{\theta(\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as a natural semidefinite programming relaxation of the maximum clique problem (we have a variable <img alt="{x_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> plus one variable <img alt="{x_v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_v%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for every vertex <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; all variables are vectors).</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle \begin{array}{lr} \max \sum_{v\in V} || x_v||^2\\ s.t.\\ ||x_0||^2 = 1\\ \langle x_0,x_v \rangle = ||x_v||^2 &amp; \forall v\in V\\ \langle x_u,x_v \rangle = 0 &amp; \forall u\neq v: (u,v) \not\in E\\ \end{array}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Blr%7D+%5Cmax+%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+V%7D+%7C%7C+x_v%7C%7C%5E2%5C%5C+s.t.%5C%5C+%7C%7Cx_0%7C%7C%5E2+%3D+1%5C%5C+%5Clangle+x_0%2Cx_v+%5Crangle+%3D+%7C%7Cx_v%7C%7C%5E2+%26+%5Cforall+v%5Cin+V%5C%5C+%5Clangle+x_u%2Cx_v+%5Crangle+%3D+0+%26+%5Cforall+u%5Cneq+v%3A+%28u%2Cv%29+%5Cnot%5Cin+E%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Barray%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>To see that it is a relaxation, given a clique <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, let <img alt="{x_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be any unit vector, and let <img alt="{x_v = x_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_v+%3D+x_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="{v\in K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%5Cin+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{x_v = {\bf 0}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_v+%3D+%7B%5Cbf+0%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="{v\not\in K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%5Cnot%5Cin+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We satisfy all constraints and the objective function is <img alt="{|K|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>If we write the semidefinite dual of the above relaxation, we can see that we get a minimization problem which is a relaxation of the chromatic number problem (and which is equivalent to the relaxation used by Karger, Motwani and Sudan to improve on Avi’s result on 3-coloring), so that the “sandwich theorem” follows from weak duality.</p>
<p>The reader should try to write down the semidefinite dual and reason about why it relaxes the chromatic number problem. Below, we collapse the construction of the dual, the way of embedding colorings into dual solutions, and the proof of weak duality for semidefinite programming, into a short but mystifying “sum of squares” proof.</p>
<p>Suppose that <img alt="{V = \{ v_1,\ldots,v_n \}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV+%3D+%5C%7B+v_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cv_n+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and let <img alt="{x_0,x_{v_1},\ldots,x_{v_n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%2Cx_%7Bv_1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7Bv_n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be a feasible solution to the max clique relaxation defined above. Suppose that the graph is <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-colorable and let <img alt="{(C_1,\ldots,C_k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28C_1%2C%5Cldots%2CC_k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be a partition of <img alt="{V}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> into color classes. We have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  0 \leq \sum_{i=1}^k \left \| -x_0 + \sum_{v\in C_i} x_v \right \|^2 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++0+%5Cleq+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Ek+%5Cleft+%5C%7C+-x_0+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+C_i%7D+x_v+%5Cright+%5C%7C%5E2+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  = \sum_{i=1}^k \left( || x_0||^2 - 2 \sum_{v\in C_i} \langle x_0 , x_v \rangle + \sum_{u,v \in C_i} \langle x_u, x_v\rangle \right) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Ek+%5Cleft%28+%7C%7C+x_0%7C%7C%5E2+-+2+%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+C_i%7D+%5Clangle+x_0+%2C+x_v+%5Crangle+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bu%2Cv+%5Cin+C_i%7D+%5Clangle+x_u%2C+x_v%5Crangle+%5Cright%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  = \sum_{i=1}^k \left( 1 - \sum_{v\in C_i} || x_v||^2 \right) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Ek+%5Cleft%28+1+-+%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+C_i%7D+%7C%7C+x_v%7C%7C%5E2+%5Cright%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  = k - \sum_{v\in V} ||x_v||^2 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%3D+k+-+%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+V%7D+%7C%7Cx_v%7C%7C%5E2+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> so that the objective function always satisfies</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{v\in V} ||x_v||^2 \leq k " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+V%7D+%7C%7Cx_v%7C%7C%5E2+%5Cleq+k+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> In particular, this is true for an optimal solution <img alt="{x_0,x_{v_1},\ldots,x_{v_k}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%2Cx_%7Bv_1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7Bv_k%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and for an optimal coloring, so we have that <img alt="{\theta(\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is upper bounded by the chromatic number of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as promised.</p>
<p>Above, we used various properties of feasible solutions, such as <img alt="{||x_0||^2 = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%7Cx_0%7C%7C%5E2+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{\langle x_0, x_v \rangle = ||x_v||^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+x_0%2C+x_v+%5Crangle+%3D+%7C%7Cx_v%7C%7C%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{u,v \in C_i } \langle x_u , x_v \rangle = \sum_{v\in C_i} || x_v||^2 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bu%2Cv+%5Cin+C_i+%7D+%5Clangle+x_u+%2C+x_v+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+C_i%7D+%7C%7C+x_v%7C%7C%5E2+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> which follows from the fact that each color class is an independent set, and so all inner products <img alt="{\langle x_u, x_v \rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+x_u%2C+x_v+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="{u,v \in C_i, u\neq v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%2Cv+%5Cin+C_i%2C+u%5Cneq+v%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> have to be equal to zero, because <img alt="{(u,v) \not\in E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28u%2Cv%29+%5Cnot%5Cin+E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Many of you will have seen the happy news today that Avi Wigderson and László Lovász <a href="https://www.abelprize.no/c76389/seksjon/vis.html?tid=76390&amp;strukt_tid=76389">share this year’s Abel Prize</a> (which now contends with the Fields Medal for the highest award in pure math).  This is only the second time that the Abel Prize has been given wholly or partly for work in theoretical computer science, after <a href="https://www.abelprize.no/c54147/seksjon/vis.html?tid=54148">Szemerédi</a> in 2012.  See also the articles in <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/avi-wigderson-and-laszlo-lovasz-win-abel-prize-20210317/">Quanta</a></em> or the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/science/abel-prize-mathematics.html">NYT</a>, which actually say most of what I would’ve said for a lay audience about Wigderson’s and Lovász’s most famous research results and their importance (except, no, Avi hasn’t <em>yet</em> proved P=BPP, just taken some major steps toward it…).</p>



<p>On a personal note, Avi was both my and my wife Dana’s postdoctoral advisor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  He’s been an <em>unbelievably</em> important mentor to both of us, as he’s been for dozens of others in the CS theory community.  Back in 2007, I also had the privilege of working closely with Avi for months on our <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/alg.pdf">Algebrization</a> paper.  Now would be a fine time to revisit <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2925">Avi’s Permanent Impact on Me</a> (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLxC3rGeWBI">watch the YouTube video</a>), which is the talk I gave at IAS in 2016 on the occasion of Avi’s 60th birthday.</p>



<p>Huge congratulations to both Avi and László!</p></div>

What he did musically with the Metropolitan opera and orchestra was nothing short of incredible. What he did to the young people he abused is inexcusable. I remember watching a Met taped videocast of Die Walküre with my daughter, enjoying the production but telling her "Do you realize we are watching an opera composed by an anti-Semite and conducted by a child molester?"  Can you separate art from artist?</p></div>

<p>The Abel Prize was awarded earlier today to László Lovász and Avi Wigderson</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>“for their foundational contributions to theoretical computer science and discrete </em><em>mathematics, and their leading role in shaping them into central fields of modern </em><em>mathematics.”</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to Laci and Avi, to their families, and to the communities of theoretical computer science and combinatorics. Let me quote one more sentence from the citation:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366;"><em>“They have both made fundamental contributions to understanding randomness in computation and in exploring the boundaries of efficient computation.” </em></span></p></blockquote>

<p>
Neil L. is a Leprechaun. He has been visiting me or Ken once every year since we started GLL. We had never seen a leprechaun before we began the blog—there must be some connection.</p>
<p>
Today we want to share the experience we had with him this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>
Here is my best reconstruction of what happened:</p>
<p>
It was Tuesday, already St. Patrick’s Day in Ireland, and Ken and I were on a Zoom connection working late. We had agreed to skip any post highlighting Neil. We intended to highlight another female mathematician or computer scientist. And Neil is definitely not a female.</p>
<p>
We never know in advance whether or when Neil is coming, but this time we took some steps. First, I am not where I was, and I made the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/03/17/leprechauns-will-find-you/">finding</a> task harder. Kathryn set up mirrors in my new study, since leprechauns fear being held by a stare. Ken is where he’s always been, but being still a few days from his first vaccination, knew Neil would respect the CDC guidelines.</p>
<p>
We thought all was well and were discussing Hilbert’s Tenth until Ken spotted the puff of green smoke in a mirror behind me. Before he could warn me I heard the familiar voice to my side:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Top of the evening to ye.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I might have let him take off his mask and get comfortable, but instead I retorted, “Neil, thanks for visiting, but Ken and I have other plans. This whole month is dedicated to honor female researchers. So nice to see you as always, but …”</p>
<p>
Neil smiled—we could tell that through his mask—and said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Well, we could talk about a certain female Leprechaun—one who just solved a big problem in complexity. A problem that rhymes with “slower hounds in crime.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Neil’s Dilemma </h2><p/>
<p>
I was doubly confused: once by the cryptic rhyme, but then because I realized Neil—masked or not—was simply, provably <b>lying</b>. I hesitated to confront Neil because I recalled a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/274015958551660685/">book</a> titled <em>Leprechauns Never Lie</em>, but Ken flashed the proof by sharing his screen over Zoom:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Neil, there <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/no-female-leprechauns_n_1355121">are no</a> female leprechauns. We all <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/03/16/leprechauns-go-universal/">discussed</a> this two St. Patrick’s Days ago. Quoting my link: <i>there is no record in Irish folklore of leprechauns having a female counterpart in their ranks or even a solid record of how they procreate or reproduce.</i>” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken and I realized there was more than just the truth or female researchers at stake: a leprechaun caught in transgression must surrender his treasure. <em>His</em> treasure. But that was bound to make Neil extra tricky.</p>
<p>
Neil was right on that wavelength, because his first words in reply were:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Before we proceed, there is a matter about my pot of gold that we must resolve. And it will tie to the larger matter at hand. I need expert help, and ye be the two best I know to ask.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pot.png?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18352" height="120" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pot.png?resize=120%2C120&amp;ssl=1" width="120"/></a></p>
<p>
What would Neil need to ask <em>us</em>? We had always tried to pin him down into telling us the answer to P=NP. Remember, a leprechaun cannot lie, so his answer would rule. So we said, “what do you need to ask?”</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I need to ask you about the meaning of P=NP.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Neil’s Question </h2><p/>
<p>
I bid Neil sit down and remove his mask to puff his pipe. I started to give the same answer I’ve given in countless classrooms: “P=NP means that a certain big class of problems could all be solved by an algorithm that runs in polynomial time. Polynomial time means…” But Ken cut in more pointedly:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Neil, why do <b>you</b> need to know about P=NP? And to know <b>what</b> about it?” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Neil puffed on his pipe and gave what we could tell was an honest answer:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “We Leprechauns have started thinking about going modern—belonging to the 21st century. I plan on getting rid of my pot of gold coins and going into Bitcoins. Those pots are heavy to lug for us wee folk. But to judge if it be safe in our world, we need to know the gist and risks in your world.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I switched gears and said the gist is that Bitcoin is based on a technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> that creates an unambiguous single history of recorded transactions, including how the coin was earned in the first place. The history does not need to be maintained by any trusted party—it is decentralized, and any party can access it to provide a proof of a record. Ah, but if P=NP…</p>
<p>
Ken cut in: “If P <em>effectively</em> equals NP. Not the <img alt="{n^{100}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B100%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n^{100}}"/> time for SAT or the huge constants from forbidden-minor sets kind of P=NP. If you can be really efficient at it then you can spoof a proof of an alternative history of records, one to your gain, or certainly put confidence in the other side’s version of events in doubt. Actually, something weaker than P=NP suffices.” We were next going to educate Neil on crypto, but he cut us off.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “We ken that </em>cheana féin<em>—well already. But what if your world have <b>no unambiguous single histories</b> to begin with? How déan that change the effective meaning of P=NP?” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Law and Lore </h2><p/>
<p>
The essence of Neil’s question escaped us at first. We replied that the notion of “history” involved was like a computation by a deterministic Turing machine <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M}"/>, and time is uniquely defined by its sequence of configurations <img alt="{I \vdash_M J \vdash_M K \vdash_M\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI+%5Cvdash_M+J+%5Cvdash_M+K+%5Cvdash_M%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{I \vdash_M J \vdash_M K \vdash_M\dots}"/> Ah, Neil replied, cannot there be a <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K}"/> that is reached by two separate paths, <img alt="{J \vdash_M K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ+%5Cvdash_M+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J \vdash_M K}"/> and <img alt="{J' \vdash_M K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27+%5Cvdash_M+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J' \vdash_M K}"/>? If you are at <img alt="{I}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{I}"/> and yet to go to <img alt="{J}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J}"/> you may have no inkling of <img alt="{J'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J'}"/> at present—your present.</p>
<p>
Ken cut in by saying that every computation can be performed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing">reversible</a> Turing machine <img alt="{M'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M'}"/>—so that there is only one possible past history—and that <img alt="{M'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M'}"/> is built from <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M}"/> by propagating part of the computation’s history somewhat as blockchain does. But that did not help our argument with Neil. When Ken brought up the reversibility of quantum computation, Neil was ready with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_histories">Consistent Histories</a> interpretation of quantum mechanics. The determinism of quantum evolution is at a “bird’s eye” level higher up, whereas in our “frog’s eye” experience the theory gives us probabilities over alternative histories <img alt="{J}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J}"/> and <img alt="{J'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J'}"/>, and <i>consistency</i> rather than <i>unique actuality</i> is the criterion for their viability.</p>
<p>
At this point I started to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_the_stone#Origin">kick a stone</a> at Neil about there being just one flesh-and-blood real world, with natural laws and a unique history, but his next words cut to the quick:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “On what basis then did ye dun me for speaking o’ female leprechauns? On the basis of <b>lore</b>, ye said. But is that as unchanging as the stone ye would kick at me?” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken got what Neil was saying and flashed a topical item on his Zoom screen:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lynettewukie.png?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18353" height="245" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lynettewukie.png?resize=550%2C245&amp;ssl=1" width="550"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
“This came <em>after</em> our discussion two years <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/03/16/leprechauns-go-universal/">ago</a>—in which you referenced Notre Dame—but maybe you are right that its significance is <em>before</em>.”</p>
<p>
I told Neil I still don’t agree about histories, but I withdrew our claim on his gold. Ken showed his face back on Zoom and was looking impatient so I gave him the floor.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “What Neil is on about is that many things we’d consider aspects of Leprechaun World are really theorized properties of our world. So we must ask, what if they are just one world?</em></p><em>
<p>
Take Bitcoin. Now it’s obvious why Neil and friends want to get involved with Bitcoin. There are so many more ways to play tricks with it than with pots of physical gold. We wrote <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/03/17/leprechauns-stay-home/">last year</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/03/17/leprechauns-are-tricky/">many</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2017/03/17/leprechauns-are-multiplying/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2016/03/17/happy-st-patricks-day-2/">before</a> about the gaming and crypto tricks they can play. </p>
</em><p><em>
But it’s nothing that we can’t do ourselves. So leprechauns make their pots of gold vanish? We’ve done that via Bitcoin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html">quite</a> to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/uk-man-makes-last-ditch-effort-to-recover-lost-bitcoin-hard-drive.html">perfection</a>—hundreds of millions of dollars poof!, no leprechauns involved.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Neil’s Slower Hounds </h2><p/>
<p>
Ken was about to say that this was the larger context of Neil’s question about P=NP but I recalled the second thing Neil said at the start and wanted something in return for letting go his gold. “Neil—I can grant female leprechauns but you said something else: that one proved a breakthrough in complexity. You said it rhymed with “slower hounds in crime”—ah, <em>lower bounds on time</em>. Neil puffed and said, </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Aye.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Can you tell us what she proved? We answered your question—and since you raised this to begin with, it’s only fair.” Ken chimed in by asking, “no one we know in our field is a leprechaun, right?”</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I cannae tell ye in the here of now, for a reason that ye conceded to me. Ye will appreciate something from <img alt="{J'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J'}"/> when ye reach <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K}"/> from <img alt="{J}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J}"/>. So I shall leave ye do what ye be doing.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Neil turned as if about to wisp away, but a cry from me stopped him: “No final trick this time?” He gave us both a look that was sad and loving at the same time, something we didn’t know leprechauns could do. But he said,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “No trick that ye not be increasingly doing by yourselves.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And with that he departed in a flash. The flash kicked onto my screen where Ken still was. In Ken’s place was an image I recognized as from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry">Bayeux</a> <a href="http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost11/Bayeux/bay_tama.html">Tapestry</a>—that great record of history a millennium ago—until I looked a little closer.</p>

    <title>TR21-042 |  Strong Parallel Repetition for Unique Games on Small Set Expanders | 

	Dana Moshkovitz</title>
    <summary>We show that NP-hardness of approximating Boolean unique games on small set expanders can be amplified to the full Unique Games Conjecture on small set expanders. 
The latter conjecture is known to imply hardness results for problems like Balanced-Separator, Minimum-Linear-Rearrangement and Small-Set-Expansion that are not known under the Unique Games Conjecture.
Our result follows from: (1) A transformation that fortifies any unique game on a small set expander. (2) An improved parallel repetition theorem for fortified games on small set expanders. 
Our approach avoids the known limitation on strong parallel repetition of unique games by enlarging the alphabet considerably before repetition. The limitation does not hold for unique games with a sufficiently large alphabet. 
Prior to this work, parallel repetition from fortification was only known for projection games, and seemed hopeless for unique games. 
Perhaps surprisingly, the idea for fortification of unique games comes from a reduction of Raghavendra and Steurer from Small-Set-Expansion to Unique Games.</summary>

    <title>TR21-041 |  An Efficient Coding Theorem via Probabilistic Representations and its Applications | 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira</title>
    <summary>A probabilistic representation of a string $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ is given by the code of a randomized algorithm that outputs $x$ with high probability [Oliveira, ICALP 2019]. We employ probabilistic representations to establish the first unconditional Coding Theorem in time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. More precisely, we show that if a distribution ensemble $\mathcal{D}_m$ can be uniformly sampled in time $T(m)$ and generates a string $x \in \{0,1\}^*$ with probability at least $\delta$, then $x$ admits a time-bounded probabilistic representation of complexity $O(\log(1/\delta) + \log (T) + \log(m))$. Under mild assumptions, a representation of this form can be  computed from $x$ and the code of the sampler in time polynomial in $n = |x|$. 
		
We derive consequences of this result relevant to the study of data compression, pseudodeterministic algorithms, time hierarchies for sampling distributions, and complexity lower bounds. In particular, we describe an instance-based search-to-decision reduction for Levin's Kt complexity [Levin, Information and Control 1984] and its probabilistic analogue rKt [Oliveira, ICALP 2019]. As a consequence, if a string $x$ admits a succinct time-bounded representation, then a near-optimal representation can be generated from $x$ with high probability in polynomial time. This partially addresses in a time-bounded setting a question from [Levin, Information and Control 1984] on the efficiency of computing an  optimal encoding of a string.</summary>

    <title>TR21-040 |  Majority vs. Approximate Linear Sum and Average-Case Complexity Below NC1 | 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Xin Lyu, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira</title>
    <summary>We develop a general framework that characterizes strong average-case lower bounds against circuit classes $\mathcal{C}$ contained in $\mathrm{NC}^1$, such as $\mathrm{AC}^0[\oplus]$ and $\mathrm{ACC}^0$. We apply this framework to show:

- Generic seed reduction: Pseudorandom generators (PRGs) against $\mathcal{C}$ of seed length $\leq n -1$ and error $\varepsilon(n) = n^{-\omega(1)}$ can be converted into PRGs of sub-polynomial seed length.

- Hardness under natural distributions: If $\mathrm{E}$ (deterministic exponential time) is average-case hard against $\mathcal{C}$ under some distribution, then $\mathrm{E}$ is average-case hard against $\mathcal{C}$ under the uniform distribution.

- Equivalence between worst-case and average-case hardness: Worst-case lower bounds against $\mathrm{MAJ} \circ \mathcal{C}$ for problems in $E$ are equivalent to strong average-case lower bounds against $\mathcal{C}$. This can be seen as a certain converse to the Discriminator Lemma [Hajnal et al., JCSS'93].

These results were not known to hold for circuit classes that do not compute majority. Additionally, we prove that classical and recent approaches to worst-case lower bounds against $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ via communication lower bounds for NOF multi-party  protocols [Hastad and Goldmann, CC'91; Razborov and Wigderson, IPL'93] and Torus polynomials degree lower bounds [Bhrushundi et al., ITCS'19] also imply strong average-case hardness against $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ under the uniform distribution.

Crucial to these results is the use of non-black-box hardness amplification techniques and the interplay between Majority ($\mathrm{MAJ}$) and Approximate Linear Sum ($\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$) gates. Roughly speaking, while a $\mathrm{MAJ}$ gate outputs $1$ when the sum of the $m$ input bits is at least $m/2$, a $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ gate computes a real-valued bounded weighted sum of the input bits and outputs $1$ (resp. $0$) if the sum is close to $1$ (resp. close to $0$), with the promise that one of the two cases always holds. As part of our framework, we explore ideas introduced in [Chen and Ren, STOC'20] to show that, for the purpose of proving lower bounds, a top layer $MAJ$ gate is equivalent to a (weaker) $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ gate. Motivated by this result, we extend the algorithmic method and establish stronger lower bounds against bounded-depth circuits with layers of $\mathrm{MAJ}$ and $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ gates. Among them, we prove that:
    
- Lower bound: $\mathrm{NQP}$ does not admit fixed quasi-polynomial size $\mathrm{MAJ} \circ \widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}} \circ \mathrm{ACC}^0 \circ \mathrm{THR}$ circuits.

This is the first explicit lower bound against circuits with distinct layers of $\mathrm{MAJ}$, $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$, and $\mathrm{THR}$ gates. Consequently, if the aforementioned equivalence between $\mathrm{MAJ}$ and $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ as a top gate can be extended to intermediate layers, long sought-after lower bounds against the class $\mathrm{THR} \circ \mathrm{THR}$ of depth-$2$ polynomial-size threshold circuits would follow.</summary>
