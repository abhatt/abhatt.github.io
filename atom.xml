<p>Some <a href="https://academicpositions.com/ad/bocconi-university/2021/assistant-professor-of-computer-science/172733">details are here</a>. Candidates must apply online by January 15 (end of day Central Europe time) for the application to be considered. To apply online, go to <a href="https://jobmarket.unibocconi.eu/">https://jobmarket.unibocconi.eu/</a> and look at the only opening that has a Jan 15 expiration (currently it is at the top of the list). The negotiable start date is September, 2022. By that time the new Computing Sciences department will be fully operational.</p>



<p>We are interested in all areas of computer science. <a href="https://www.alonrosen.net/">Alon Rosen</a>, <a href="http://www.dirkhovy.com/index.php">Dirk Hovy</a> and I are very happy to talk to prospective candidates about what the university is like and what are its plans for developing computer science.</p>



<p>The university pays internationally competitive salary and provides relocation assistance. The language of instructions of all computer science courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels is English.</p>



<p>Scholars of any nationality who have not lived in Italy for the past two years and who move to Italy to take a university tenure-track or tenured position pay almost no income tax for six years, or more if they buy a home in Italy and/or have children under the age of 18.</p>



<p>For Italians working in Italy: this position is governed by a private-law contract with Bocconi, which is not the same as a RDTA or RDTB position, although the terms are similar. </p>



<p>Subject to a successful mid-term review (which usually happens after three years), and a successful tenure review (which happens within five years from the mid-term review, or possibly earlier depending on the background of the candidate), assistant professors are promoted to associate professors with tenure. (For those familiar with the Italian system, the latter positions are fully recognized as professore associato by the ministry of university.)</p></div>

Axel Dahlberg, Jonas Helsen, and Stephanie Wehner are researchers from <a href="https://qutech.nl/">QuTech</a> associated to Delft Technological University. They have produced <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aba763">five</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002001902100137X">wonderful</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05305.pdf">elegant</a> <a href="https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-10-22-348/">recent</a> <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5120591">papers</a> that update the theory of quantum graph states.</p>
<p>
Today we introduce some of what their papers are about. </p>
<p>
We covered material <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/04/a-quantum-connection-for-matrix-rank/">related</a> to <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/10/net-zero-graphs/">graph</a> states a few times before the pandemic, <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/17/contraction-and-explosion/">going</a> in the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/08/26/a-matroid-quantum-connection/">direction</a> of <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/02/11/using-negative-nodes-to-count/">matroid</a> theory. The work by Dahlberg, Helsen, and Wehner stays with ordinary simple undirected graphs. </p>
<p>
Wehner was the advisor of Dahlberg and Helsen, and she was in turn a student of Harry Buhrman at CWI Amsterdam, where Helsen is now. Wehner’s <a href="https://qutech.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CV-Wehner-June-2021.pdf">CV</a> lists one of her jobs prior to graduate study as “Hacker” for ITSX BV in Amsterdam, a fact used in the lead sentence in a 2018 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01835-3">news feature</a> in <em>Nature</em> on work toward a quantum Internet. Both that and her Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Wehner">page</a> call her a theoretical physicist. We would claim her for theoretical computer science. </p>
<p>
Amid the entanglement of fields, a key point is that simple problems about simple graphs govern blueprints for vast networking technology that we can now only conceive. Is all this simple enough to introduce in a short post? We’ll see.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Graph States </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The quantum gates most commonly used to define and operate on <b>graph states</b> are the one-qubit Hadamard and Pauli gates </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{H} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix},\quad \mathsf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},\quad \mathsf{Y} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -i \\ i &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},\quad \mathsf{Z} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BH%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+1+%5C%5C+1+%26+-1+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%2C%5Cquad+%5Cmathsf%7BX%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+0+%26+1+%5C%5C+1+%26+0+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%2C%5Cquad+%5Cmathsf%7BY%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+0+%26+-i+%5C%5C+i+%26+0+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%2C%5Cquad+%5Cmathsf%7BZ%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+-1+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>together with the controlled-<img alt="{\mathsf{Z}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and controlled-NOT gates, which are shown together with their usual quantum circuit notation:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/01/05/quantum-graph-theory/czcnot/" rel="attachment wp-att-19462"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19462" height="64" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CZCNOT.png?resize=400%2C64&amp;ssl=1" width="400"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Just because we like to be different, we will represent edges of undirected graphs by the following two-qubit gate instead: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{E} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BE%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+1+%26+1+%26+-1%5C%5C+1+%26+1+%26+-1+%26+1%5C%5C+1+%26+-1+%26+1+%26+1%5C%5C+-1+%26+1+%26+1+%26+1+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
We don’t know a common name, but the gate is provided by Craig Gidney’s popular <a href="https://algassert.com/">Quirk</a> quantum circuit simulator with the following logical notation and enjoys the identities shown here: </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/01/05/quantum-graph-theory/eidentities/" rel="attachment wp-att-19464"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19464" height="72" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Eidentities.jpg?resize=500%2C72&amp;ssl=1" width="500"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
The third identity means that <img alt="{\mathsf{E}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the same as <img alt="{\mathsf{CZ}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BCZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> under the change of basis by the Hadamard transform. Graph states are usually defined by an initial <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-qubit Hadamard transform of all-zero input followed by placing a <img alt="{\mathsf{CZ}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BCZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> gate between qubits <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for each edge <img alt="{(i,j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the graph; the order does not matter because <img alt="{\mathsf{CZ}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BCZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> gates commute no matter how placed. Instead, we have dispensed with the initial transform and simply place an <img alt="{\mathsf{E}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for each edge. Here are our circuits for the star graph <img alt="{S_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on <img alt="{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> nodes, the <img alt="{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-cycle graph <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and the complete graph <img alt="{K_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, respectively: </p>

Putting an <img alt="{\mathsf{X}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BX%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> gate anywhere on line <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the same as flipping the input bit <img alt="{x_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and adds a self-loop to node <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the graph. A double edge between two nodes is the same as a non-edge; only the parity matters. The gates <img alt="{\mathsf{E}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{\mathsf{X}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BX%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and <img alt="{\mathsf{CNOT}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BCNOT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> all commute. Both <img alt="{\mathsf{E}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\mathsf{CZ}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BCZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be represented as <img alt="{e^{\pi i A}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7B%5Cpi+i+A%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for some Hermitian matrix of rank <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> whose diagonal form <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is all-zero except for a single <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> entry. The matrix <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> eloquently speaks “one unit of interaction.” </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Entanglement Examples </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
If we start with the graph <img alt="{K_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with just one edge on <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> nodes, then the quantum graph state is given by the first column of the matrix <img alt="{\mathsf{E}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> above: <img alt="{|K_2\rangle = \frac{1}{2}[1,1,1,-1]^T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK_2%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5B1%2C1%2C1%2C-1%5D%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If we follow with a single Hadamard gate on line <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then the state becomes </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[1,0,0,1]^T = \frac{|00\rangle + |11\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%5B1%2C0%2C0%2C1%5D%5ET+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%7C00%5Crangle+%2B+%7C11%5Crangle%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>This is the <em>Bell pair</em>. Named after John Bell, which is the simplest entangled state. If we say that the first qubit is held by “Alice” and the second by “Bob,” then Alice and Bob are entangled. For any <img alt="{n \geq 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the state <img alt="{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0^n\rangle + |1^n\rangle)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%28%7C0%5En%5Crangle+%2B+%7C1%5En%5Crangle%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger_state">GHZ state</a> after named for Daniel Greenberger, Michael Horne, and Anton Zeilinger, has the maximum possible entanglement among <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> qubits by several quantitative measures. </p>
<p>
Now let us add interactions with two more qubits held by “Charlie” and “Donna” in the form of the cycle graph <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>:</p>

<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/01/05/quantum-graph-theory/abcd/" rel="attachment wp-att-19467"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19467" height="130" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ABCD.png?resize=168%2C130&amp;ssl=1" width="168"/></a></p>
<p>
Questions that we can ask include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Are Alice and Bob entangled? Or Alice and Charlie? <p/>
</li><li>
Do they have less entanglement than a Bell pair? <p/>
</li><li>
Do the four parties together have as much entanglement as the <img alt="{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-qubit GHZ state?
</li></ol>
<p>
The answers to the first two questions are, “it depends.” Absent any knowledge of what Charlie and Donna do with their qubits, the status of Alice and Bob is conveyed by the <img alt="{4 \times 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <em>density matrix</em> resulting from the <em>partial trace-out</em> of Charlie and Donna. Here is a direct <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2p8dj2pd">shortlink</a> to view it on <em>Quirk</em> under its native “little-endian” qubit order (Donna uppermost), or <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4yd323pt">this</a> to view with Alice uppermost. This gives the <img alt="{4 \times 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> identity matrix, which represents the <em>completely mixed state</em> of two qubits, by which Alice and Bob have two independent classical coins with no entanglement. Regardless of what unitary operations Charlie and Donna do unto themselves, the trace-out remains the same.</p>
<p>
However, if Charlie and Donna <em>measure</em> their qubits, different effects can occur to Alice and Bob depending primarily on <em>how</em> they measure, and secondarily on the measurement results they get. If they both immediately measure in the standard basis, then Alice and Bob “collapse” to one of the four two-qubit basis states, as can be viewed on <em>Quirk</em> using the <em>post-selection</em> widgets “<img alt="{|0 \rangle\langle 0|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C0+%5Crangle%5Clangle+0%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>” and “<img alt="{|1 \rangle\langle 1|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C1+%5Crangle%5Clangle+1%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.” </p>
<p>
Yet if Charlie and Donna each apply one Hadamard gate before their measurement, then Alice and Bob get <img alt="{|K_2\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK_2%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, or something they can make equal to <img alt="{|K_2\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK_2%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by applying one of the Pauli matrices on being told Charlie’s and Donna’s outcomes. A further Hadamard by Alice or Bob then creates the Bell pair, as viewable <a href="https://tinyurl.com/bddz37zj">here</a> (or <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2p8dm9bm">here</a> for a big-endian view).</p>
<p>
To ask about Alice and Charlie, it is most convenient to re-order <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> so that Donna and Bob are consecutive: </p>
<p>

<p>
Tracing out Donna and Bob now <a href="https://tinyurl.com/26b52vtd">leaves</a> <a href="https://tinyurl.com/5bksjwau">the</a> density matrix <font size="-2"><img alt="{\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+0+%26+0+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+0+%26+0+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+0+%26+0+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+0+%26+0+%26+1+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></font>. This means that Alice and Charlie have classical coins that are fully correlated, but not quantum entanglement. However, if <em>just one</em> of Bob or Donna applies one Hadamard gate before measuring, Alice and Charlie <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4v3h9brv">become</a> a Bell pair (perhaps after a local tweak like the <img alt="{\mathsf{Z}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-gate <a href="https://tinyurl.com/524praur">here</a>). </p>
<p>
We can pose the same questions for other graphs. On the third, given the star <img alt="{S_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with Alice at the center, let her apply one Hadamard gate to her qubit. The <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2cmmdp4r">result</a> is the GHZ state. </p>
<p>
Given <img alt="{K_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we can do the same by involving two more gates: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{S} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; i \end{bmatrix},\qquad \mathsf{V} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} 1+i &amp; 1-i \\ 1-i &amp; 1+i \end{bmatrix}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BS%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+i+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%2C%5Cqquad+%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1%2Bi+%26+1-i+%5C%5C+1-i+%26+1%2Bi+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
These obey the identities <img alt="{\mathsf{S}^2 = \mathsf{Z}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BS%7D%5E2+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{\mathsf{V} = \mathsf{HSH}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BHSH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and so </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{V}^2 = \mathsf{HSHHSH} = \mathsf{HSSH} = \mathsf{HZH} = \mathsf{X}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D%5E2+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BHSHHSH%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BHSSH%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BHZH%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BX%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
Thus <img alt="{\mathsf{V}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is also written <img alt="{\mathsf{X^{1/2}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BX%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as by <em>Quirk</em>. Applications of these along with Hadamard and the Pauli matrices on any one qubit generate the <em>local Clifford group</em>. Now let three of the qubits do <img alt="{\mathsf{V}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> while the fourth does <img alt="{\mathsf{S}^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BS%7D%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> followed by <img alt="{\mathsf{H}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yrjrr57r">result</a> is again the GHZ state. The same tricks work with <img alt="{S_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{K_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for any <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>
Can we get the GHZ state from the cycle <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? The answer is <em>no</em>. This leads into the basic quantum connection to graphs.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Neighborhood Flip </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The upshot is that because the graph states of <img alt="{K_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and the star <img alt="{S_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can each produce the GHZ state, they can produce each other. The graph operation that does this is to choose one node <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and for every pair <img alt="{j,k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%2Ck%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of neighbors of <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
if <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are not connected, connect them by an edge; <p/>
</li><li>
if <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are connected, delete the edge between them.

Here are pictures for <img alt="{n = 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the second showing how Donna could connect Alice and Charlie in the cycle graph. This <em>neighborhood flip</em> operation <img alt="{F_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is self-inverse. It cannot disconnect a node, and so defines an equivalence relation <img alt="{\sim_{F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_%7BF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on connected graphs.</p>

<p/><p><br/>
If Alice is chosen in the graph at right after Donna’s flip, then Charlie is disconnected from Bob and Donna but Bob and Donna are connected. The edges to Alice do not change, so we get a triangle of Alice-Bob-Donna plus the edge Alice-Charlie. </p>
<p>
The quantum circuit rule for <img alt="{F_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is simple:</p>

</li><li>
for each neighbor <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, add a <img alt="{\mathsf{V}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BV%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> gate on line <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.
</li></ul>

What gives this power is that <em>every</em> local quantum transformation of graph states arises this way. This was proved in a 2004 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308151">paper</a> by Maarten Van den Nest, Jeroen Dehaene, and Bart De Moor, among <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0307130.pdf">several</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0004051">related</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301052">papers</a> leading to a long 2006 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0602096.pdf">synthesis</a>. </p>

The star and complete graphs go only to each other, though the center of the star can be moved to any vertex. This answers the last section’s question about <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>:</p>

The new papers, in particular <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05305.pdf">this</a> by Dahlberg and Wehner, complete the above-mentioned earlier work to prove the following extension of Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#flip">1</a>.

The deletions can without loss of generality be done last. </p>

</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
In our example of entangling Alice and Charlie in <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, Donna’s applying <img alt="{\mathsf{H}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and then measuring left Alice and Charlie connected only to Bob. Bob’s <em>not</em> applying <img alt="{\mathsf{H}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> before measuring was the same as applying it twice, first to flip Alice and Charlie into being connected, and then to drop himself out. Donna and Bob still needed to communicate their measurement results in order for Alice and Charlie to choose exactly the operations that produce the state <img alt="{|K_2\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK_2%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </p>
<p>
This opens the possibility of creating new entanglements by adding a node, flipping some neighborhoods, then deleting it. For example, neither <img alt="{C_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> nor <img alt="{K_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can work itself into two entangled pairs by local means, because <img alt="{\sim_{F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_%7BF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> cannot disconnect a graph. Suppose we invite Eve not to eavesdrop but to slot between Bob and Charlie in the path graph shown at left below.</p>

<p/><p><br/>
Bob and Charlie do neighborhood flips that connect Eve to Alice and Donna as well. This yields the bowtie graph in the middle. Then Eve can measure and step away, leaving Alice-Bob and Charlie-Donna as separate couples.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The New Hardness Results </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In 1991, before the quantum connection was visible, André Bouchet <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01275668">showed</a> that whether two <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-vertex graphs are equivalent under <img alt="{\sim_F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is polynomial-time decidable. The corresponding quantum problem about graph states is part-and-parcel with simulation questions for the larger class of <em>stabilizer states</em>, which we have also covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/04/a-quantum-connection-for-matrix-rank/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/10/net-zero-graphs/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
But once deletion is allowed, Dahlberg, Helsen, and Wehner show that the feasible picture changes—at least when the target graph is on a fixed set of vertices.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 4</b> <em> Given <img alt="{G = (V,E)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%3D+%28V%2CE%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{G' = (V',E')}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27+%3D+%28V%27%2CE%27%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with <img alt="{V' \subset V}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%27+%5Csubset+V%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (but not necessarily <img alt="{E' \subset E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27+%5Csubset+E%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), the problem of whether <img alt="{G' \leq_F G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27+%5Cleq_F+G%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete. It remains complete when <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a star or consists of multiple disjoint edges. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The disjoint edges are on prescribed pairs of vertices. They also show hardness when both graphs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_graph">circle graphs</a>, a subclass on which many other <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete problems become polynomial-time decidable. In consequence:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 5</b> <em> It is <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-hard to decide whether an <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-qubit graph state can be converted into a GHZ state on a given subset of the qubits, or into Bell pairs on designated pairs of qubits, by local unitary operations, measurements, and classical communication. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The fifth paper contains a further surprise. Even though the decision problem of <img alt="{\sim_F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> belongs to <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (indeed, to a subclass defined by parity and linear algebra), the associated counting problem is hard.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 6</b> <em> Given a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, counting the number of labeled graphs equivalent to <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> under <img alt="{\sim_F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_F%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Again the completeness holds under restriction to circle graphs, which furnish machinery for the proof that connects to other linear- and group-algebraic constructs important to quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>
What does the hardness mean? One takeaway is that shortcuts with multi-variable polynomials that suffice to simulate quantum graph-state and stabilizer circuits may not extend nicely to describe entanglement and how it is affected by measurement. Another is that various other problems about quantifying and channeling quantum entanglement are likely to be hard as well. To pick up one theme we took from Lance Fortnow in our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/31/make-a-trillion-dollars/">post</a>, the decision hardness channels questions about approximate optimization and heuristic most-case solving. Can entanglement be moved around a network and delivered to clients on demand, at what practical cost and loss of quantum coherence? I’ve tried to hint at such wider quantitative problems in the third section.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What other areas of graph theory may be enriched by the quantum connection? The role of vertex deletion makes us think of the graph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_conjecture">reconstruction</a> conjecture in particular. Can results on minors in this 2019 <a href="http://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/771369/files/771369.pdf">dissertation</a> extend to show that the <img alt="{\sim_F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim_F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> relation is <em>reconstructible</em>? There are other uses of graphs in quantum mechanics, even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schild's_Ladder">novel</a> about them.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
For a footnote, the double-<img alt="{\oplus}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Coplus%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> construction can be added to the <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/CQuIC/Qcircuit/">Qcircuit.tex</a> macro package by including the two lines</p>

    <title>Dynamic Suffix Array with Polylogarithmic Queries and Updates</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1641340800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kempa:Dominik.html">Dominik Kempa</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kociumaka:Tomasz.html">Tomasz Kociumaka</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01285">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The suffix array $SA[1..n]$ of a text $T$ of length $n$ is a permutation of
$\{1,\ldots,n\}$ describing the lexicographical ordering of suffixes of $T$,
and it is considered to be among of the most important data structures in
string algorithms, with dozens of applications in data compression,
bioinformatics, and information retrieval. One of the biggest drawbacks of the
suffix array is that it is very difficult to maintain under text updates: even
a single character substitution can completely change the contents of the
suffix array. Thus, the suffix array of a dynamic text is modelled using suffix
array queries, which return the value $SA[i]$ given any $i\in[1..n]$.
</p>
<p>Prior to this work, the fastest dynamic suffix array implementations were by
Amir and Boneh. At ISAAC 2020, they showed how to answer suffix array queries
in $\tilde{O}(k)$ time, where $k\in[1..n]$ is a trade-off parameter, with
$\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{k})$-time text updates. In a very recent preprint [2021],
they also provided a solution with $O(\log^5 n)$-time queries and
$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$-time updates.
</p>
<p>We propose the first data structure that supports both suffix array queries
and text updates in $O({\rm polylog}\,n)$ time (achieving $O(\log^4 n)$ and
$O(\log^{3+o(1)} n)$ time, respectively). Our data structure is deterministic
and the running times for all operations are worst-case. In addition to the
standard single-character edits (character insertions, deletions, and
substitutions), we support (also in $O(\log^{3+o(1)} n)$ time) the "cut-paste"
operation that moves any (arbitrarily long) substring of $T$ to any place in
$T$. We complement our structure by a hardness result: unless the Online
Matrix-Vector Multiplication (OMv) Conjecture fails, no data structure with
$O({\rm polylog}\,n)$-time suffix array queries can support the "copy-paste"
operation in $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ time for any $\epsilon&gt;0$.

    <title>Binary Fuse Filters: Fast and Smaller Than Xor Filters</title>

little memory. Engineers use them to avoid expensive disk and network accesses.
The recently introduced xor filters can be faster and smaller than Bloom and
cuckoo filters. The xor filters are within 23% of the theoretical lower bound
in storage as opposed to 44% for Bloom filters. Inspired by Dietzfelbinger and
Walzer, we build probabilistic filters -- called binary fuse filters -- that
are within 13% of the storage lower bound -- without sacrificing query speed.
As an additional benefit, the construction of the new binary fuse filters can
be more than twice as fast as the construction of xor filters. By slightly
sacrificing query speed, we further reduce storage to within 8% of the lower
bound. We compare the performance against a wide range of competitive
alternatives such as Bloom filters, blocked Bloom filters, vector quotient
filters, cuckoo filters, and the recent ribbon filters. Our experiments suggest
that binary fuse filters are superior to xor filters.

which consists of an infinite set called universe and an infinite set of
two-valued functions (attributes) defined on the universe. We consider the
notion of a problem over information system which is described by a finite
number of attributes and a mapping corresponding a decision to each tuple of
attribute values. As algorithms for problem solving, we use deterministic and
nondeterministic decision trees. As time and space complexity, we study the
depth and the number of nodes in the decision trees. In the worst case, with
the growth of the number of attributes in the problem description, (i) the
minimum depth of deterministic decision trees grows either almost as logarithm
or linearly, (ii) the minimum depth of nondeterministic decision trees either
is bounded from above by a constant or grows linearly, (iii) the minimum number
of nodes in deterministic decision trees has either polynomial or exponential
growth, and (iv) the minimum number of nodes in nondeterministic decision trees
has either polynomial or exponential growth. Based on these results, we divide
the set of all infinite binary information systems into five complexity
classes, and study for each class issues related to time-space trade-off for
decision trees.

game played on a hypergraph, or equivalently, on a monotone CNF. The players
take turns assigning values to variables of their choosing, and Breaker's goal
is to satisfy the CNF, while Maker's goal is to falsify it. The
Erd\H{o}s-Selfridge Theorem says that the least number of clauses in any
monotone CNF with $k$ literals per clause where Maker has a winning strategy is
$\Theta(2^k)$.
</p>
<p>We study the analogous question when the CNF is not necessarily monotone. We
prove bounds of $\Theta(\sqrt{2}\,^k)$ when Maker plays last, and
$\Omega(1.5^k)$ and $O(r^k)$ when Breaker plays last, where
$r=(1+\sqrt{5})/2\approx 1.618$ is the golden ratio.

range query operations for highly concurrent lock-based linked data structures.
Bundled references allow range queries to traverse a path through the data
structure that is consistent with the target atomic snapshot. We demonstrate
our technique with three data structures: a linked list, skip list, and a
binary search tree. Our evaluation reveals that in mixed workloads, our design
can improve upon the state-of-the-art techniques by 1.2x-1.8x for a skip list
and 1.3x-3.7x for a binary search tree. We also integrate our bundled data
structure into the DBx1000 in-memory database, yielding up to 40% gain over the
same competitors.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Happy 2022 everyone! We now cover the last papers of 2021. Our readers have pointed out a number of papers from previous months that we missed (sorry). To adequately cover (and publicize) these papers, we’ve decided to just incorporate those papers on this post rather than update previous posts. </p>



<p>We have a breakthrough on Locally Testable Codes, sublinear algorithms for testing pattern freeness, new thoughts on convexity testing, and a perspective on sampling community structure. And here’s the final list for 2021.</p>



<p><strong>Locally Testable Codes with constant rate, distance, and locality</strong> by Irit Dinur, Shai Evra, Ron Livne, Alexander Lubotzky, and Shahar Mozes (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/151/">ECCC</a>, posted Nov 2021). A Locally Testable Code (LTC) is one where the set of codewords has a property tester. The study of LTCs started with the PCP theorem, but blossomed into a deep research agenda. The holy grail is a \(c^3\)-LTC: one with constant rate, constant distance, and constant query property tester. Just to recall, the rate \(r \in (0,1)\) is the ratio of the message length to the encoding length. The distance \(\delta \in (0,1)\) is the (normalized) Hamming distance between codewords (we typically expect this to be constant for an error correcting code). And, most familiar to us, \(q\) is the number of queries required to property test codewords. The aim is to get all these parameters to be constants independent of the message length. The classic linearity test of BLR basically proves that the Hadamard code is 3-query testable. But the Hadamard code has poor (exponentially small) rate. Low-degree tests prove that Reed-Muller codes are constant-query testable, but they have inverse polynomial rate. Further work constructed LTCs with inverse polylogarithmic rate, meaning that the encoding has length \(n\cdot poly(\log n)\) for message length \(n\). There was even some belief that any LTC must have a rate going to zero. This paper invalidates that belief, and gives a truly \(c^3\)-construction. The construction is based on a 2-dimensional simplicial complex based on Cayley graphs. This is basically a graph with hyperedges corresponding to “squares” of vertices. Concurrent and independent work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09271.pdf">Breuckmann-Ebedhardt</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03654">Panteleev-Kalachev</a> also have similar constructions, though their perspective is of quantum codes.</p>



<p><strong>On the Locally Testable Code of Dinur et al. (2021)</strong> by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/175/">ECCC</a>). As the title says, this short paper gives a high level discussion of the previous result. It abstracts out some of the graph theoretic aspects, to explain connections to more combinatorial constructions. The construction and analysis is based on expander codes. These codes (e.g. low-density parity check, LDPC codes) have constant rate and distance, but we do not know how to test them. A string far from a codeword might only fail on (say) one parity check constraint. Interpreting the Dinur et al as an expander code, we essentially get a collection of correlated parity constraints. Hence, a string that is far from a codeword violates many constraints, leading to a tester. (Of course, this is an extremely watered down version of the analysis idea.) The construction takes two Cayley graphs on a non-Abelian group (which form the vertices). Specific 4-cycles in this graph (together with a constant sized tensor code) are used to make the final codewords.</p>



<p><strong>Strongly Sublinear Algorithms for Testing Pattern Freeness</strong> by Ilan Newman and Nithin Varma (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04856">arXiv</a>, posted Jun 2021). Pattern freeness is a major generalization of monotonicity testing. The input is (query access to) a function \(f: [n] \mapsto \mathbb{R}\). Let \(\pi: [k] \mapsto [k]\) be a permutation. The input is \(pi\)-free if no restriction of \(f\) to \(k\) elements induces the permutation \(pi\). <a href="http://cs.haifa.ac.il/~ilan/online-papers/permutations.pdf">Newman-Rabinovich-Rajendraprasad-Sohler</a> introduced this problem. When \(k=2\), this property is precisely monotonicity, for which (many) \(O(\varepsilon^{-1} \log n)\) property testers are known. Is such a bound achievable for \(k \geq 3\)? Interestingly, for non-adaptive algorithms, an optimal bound of \(\Theta(n^{1-1/(k-1)})\) (ignoring, \(\varepsilon, k\) dependencies) was achieved by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10660">Ben-Eliezer and Canonne</a>. This papers shows that there is an adaptive algorithm that makes \(n^{o(1)}\) queries, thereby proving a separation between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms. A key idea is to visualize the input as a set of points in the plane, and construct a coarse grid that partitions the points. There is a highly non-trivial case analysis on top of this that leads to a \(O(\sqrt{n})\)-query algorithm (this already beats the non-adaptive lower bound).</p>



<p><strong>Parameterized Convexity Testing</strong> by Abhiruk Lahiri, Ilan Newman, and Nithin Varma (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13012">arXiv</a>, posted Oct 2021). Given a function \(f:[n] \mapsto \mathbb{R}\), the property of interest is (discrete) convexity. The discrete derivatives should be monotonically non-decreasing. It is known that there is a \(O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log n)\) query non-adaptive tester for this property. This paper studies this problem from the perspective of parameterized property testing, where the range is restricted. The main result is that if the number of distinct discrete derivates is at most \(s\), there is a \(O(\varepsilon^{-1} \log s)\) query non-adaptive tester. Moreover, this bound is optimal even for adaptive algorithms. This picture parallels that of monotonicity. Interestingly, when there are only two distinct discrete derivatives, the tester can be made deterministic.</p>



<p><strong>Modularity and edge sampling</strong> by Colin McDiarmid and Fiona Skerman (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13190">arXiv</a>). Not your typical sublinear algorithms paper, but certainly of interest to us. The main problem is to understand when a random samples of edges in a graph can reveal information about the “community structure”. The modularity of a graph is a measure of this structure. Essentially, a partition has low modularity if the number of edges crossing the partition is close to that of a random graph with the same degree distribution. A partition of high modularity has significant fewer edges, and is thus a valid “clustering” of the graph. The modularity of the graph is obtained by maximizing over partitions. (The normalization of modularity is chosen so that the partition generally has a constant number of sets.) This paper proves a concentration inequality for the modularity of a constant sample of uniform random edges. The modularity of a sample of \(\Theta(\varepsilon^{-5})\) edges is an additive \(\varepsilon\)-approximation of the overall modularity, whp.</p></div>

    <summary>We give a new characterization of the Sherali-Adams proof system, showing that there is a degree-$d$ Sherali-Adams refutation of an unsatisfiable CNF formula $C$ if and only if there is an $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and a degree-$d$ conical junta $J$ such that $viol_C(x) - \varepsilon = J$, where $viol_C(x)$ counts the number of falsified clauses of $C$ on an input $x$. Using this result we show that the linear separation complexity, a complexity measure recently studied by Hrubeš (and independently by de Oliveira Oliveira and Pudlák under the name of weak monotone linear programming gates), monotone feasibly interpolates Sherali-Adams proofs; this sharpens a recent feasible interpolation result due to Hakoniemi.

We then investigate separation results for $viol_C(x) - \varepsilon$. In particular, we give a family of unsatisfiable CNF formulas $C$ which have polynomial-size and small-width resolution proofs, but for which any representation of $viol_C(x) - 1$ by a conical junta requires degree $\Omega(n)$; this resolves an open question of Filmus, Mahajan, Sood, and Vinyals. Since Sherali-Adams can simulate resolution, this separates the non-negative degree of $viol_C(x) - 1$ and $viol_C(x) - \varepsilon$ for arbitrarily small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Finally, by applying lifting theorems, we translate this lower bound into new separation results between extension complexity and monotone circuit complexity.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Deal friends,</p>



<p><br/>We are happy to announce the third edition of the conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography (ITC). Information-theoretic cryptography studies security in the presence of computationally unbounded adversaries and covers a wide array of topics at the intersection of cryptography, coding theory, information theory and theory of computation. Notable examples include randomness extraction and privacy amplification, secret sharing,  secure multiparty computation and proof systems, private-information retrieval and locally decodable codes, authentication codes and non-malleable codes, differential privacy, quantum information processing, and information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security.</p>



<p><br/>See <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The conference will have two tracks: a conference track and a spotlight track. The conference track will operate like a traditional conference with the usual review process and published proceedings. The spotlight track consists of invited talks (not included in the proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in the area. We are soliciting nominations for spotlight talks from the community. (See the Call for Papers.)</p>



<p>ITC2022 will take place on July 5-7, 2022 in Boston, MA. We are planning for a hybrid online/in-person event.  The submission deadline is <strong>Jan 10, 2022</strong> and the call for papers (including a nomination procedure for the spotlight track) is available here: <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2022/2022cfp.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io/2022/2022cfp.html</a>.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Scott’s foreword</strong></p>



<p>One week ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a>—the legendary naturalist and conservationist, and man who was universally acknowledged to know more about ants than anyone else in human history—passed away at age 92.  A mere three days later, <em>Scientific American</em>—or more precisely, the zombie clickbait rag that now flaunts that name—published a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-complicated-legacy-of-e-o-wilson/">shameful hit-piece</a>, smearing Wilson for his “racist ideas” without, incredibly, so much as a single quote from Wilson, or any other attempt to substantiate its libel (see also <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/12/30/scientific-american-does-an-asinine-hit-job-on-e-o-wilson-calling-him-a-racist/">this response by Jerry Coyne</a>).  <em>SciAm</em>‘s <em>Pravda</em>-like attack included the following extraordinary sentence, which I thought worthy of <a href="https://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html">Alan Sokal’s <em>Social Text</em> hoax</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The so-called normal distribution of statistics assumes that there are default humans who serve as the standard that the rest of us can be accurately measured against.</p></blockquote>



<p>There are intellectually honest people who don’t know what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> is.  There are no intellectually honest people who, not knowing what it is, figure that it must be something racist.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Laura Helmuth, the editor-in-chief now running <em>SciAm</em> into the ground, <a href="https://twitter.com/laurahelmuth/status/1476531766118682625">described</a> her magazine’s calumny against Wilson as “insightful” (the replies, including from Richard Dawkins, are fun to read).  I suppose it was as “insightful” as <em>SciAm</em>‘s <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eric-lander-is-not-the-ideal-choice-for-presidential-science-adviser/">disgraceful attack</a> last year on Eric Lander, President Biden’s ultra-competent science advisor and a leader in the war on COVID, for … being a white male, which appears to have been E. O. Wilson’s crime as well.  (Think I must be misrepresenting the “critique” of Lander?  Read it!)</p>



<p>Anyway, in response to <em>Scientific American</em>‘s libel of Wilson, I wrote on my Facebook that I’ll no longer agree to write for or be interviewed by them (you can read my old stuff free of charge <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/The_Limits_of_Quantum_Computers.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">here</a>), unless and until there’s a complete change of editorial direction.  I encourage all other scientists to commit likewise, thereby making it common knowledge that the entity that now calls itself “Scientific American” bears the same relation to the legendary home of Martin Gardner as does a corpse to a living being.  Fortunately, there are high-quality online venues (e.g., <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta</a></em>) that partly fill the role that <em>Scientific American</em> abdicated.</p>



<p>After reading my Facebook post, my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/curiouswavefn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ashutosh Jogalekar</a> was inspired to post an essay of his own.  Ashutosh used to write regularly for <em>Scientific American</em>, until he was fired seven years ago over a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/richard-feynman-sexism-and-changing-perceptions-of-a-scientific-icon/">column</a> in which he advocated acknowledging Richard Feynman’s flaws, including his arrogance and casual sexism, but also understanding those flaws within the context of Feynman’s whole life, including the tragic death of his first wife Arlene.  (Yes, that was really it!  Read the piece!)  Below, I’m sharing Ashutosh’s moving essay about E. O. Wilson with Ashutosh’s very generous permission. —<em>Scott Aaronson</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Guest Post by Ashutosh Jogalekar</strong></p>



<p>As some know, I was “fired” from Scientific American in 2014 for three “controversial” posts (among 200 that I had written for the magazine).  When I parted from the magazine I chalked up my departure to an unfortunate misunderstanding more than anything else.  I still respected some of the writers at the publication, and while I wore my separation as a badge of honor and in retrospect realized its liberating utility in enabling me to greatly expand my topical range, I occasionally still felt bad and wished things had gone differently.</p>



<p>No more.  Now the magazine has done me a great favor by allowing me to wipe the slate of my conscience clean. What happened seven years ago was not just a misunderstanding but clearly one of many first warning signs of a calamitous slide into a decidedly unscientific, irrational and ideology-ridden universe of woke extremism.  Its logical culmination two days ago was an absolutely shameless, confused, fact-free and purely ideological hit job on someone who wasn’t just a great childhood hero of mine but a leading light of science, literary achievement, humanism and biodiversity.  While Ed (E. O.) Wilson’s memory was barely getting cemented only days after his death, the magazine published an op-ed calling him a racist, a hit job endorsed and cited by the editor-in-chief as “insightful”.  One of the first things I did after reading the piece was buy a few Wilson books that weren’t part of my collection.</p>



<p>Ed Wilson was one of the gentlest, most eloquent, most brilliant and most determined advocates for both human and natural preservation you could find.  Under Southern charm lay hidden unyielding doggedness and immense stamina combined with a missionary zeal to communicate the wonders of science to both his fellow biologists and the general public.  His autobiography, “Naturalist”, is perhaps the finest, most literary statement of the scientific life I have read; it was one of a half dozen books that completely transported me when I read it in college.  In book after book of wide-ranging intellectual treats threading through a stunning diversity of disciplines, he sent out clarion calls for saving the planet, for enabling dialogue between the natural and the social sciences, for understanding each other better. In the face of unprecedented challenges to our fragile environment and continued barriers to interdisciplinary communication, this is work that likely will make him go down in history as one of the most important human beings who ever lived, easily of the same caliber and achievement as John Muir or Thoreau.  Even in terms of achievement strictly defined by accolades – the National Medal of Science, the Crafoord Prize which recognizes fields excluded by the Nobel Prize, and not just one but two Pulitzer Prizes – few scientists from any field in the 20th century can hold a candle to Ed Wilson.  My friend Richard Rhodes who knew Wilson for decades as a close and much-admired friend said that there wasn’t a racist bone in his body; Dick should know since he just came out with a first-rate biography of Wilson weeks before his passing.</p>



<p>The writer who wrote that train wreck is a professor of nursing at UCSF named Monica McLemore.  That itself is a frightening fact and should tell everyone how much ignorance has spread itself in our highest institutions.  She not only maligned and completely misrepresented Wilson but did not say a word about his decades-long, heroic effort to preserve the planet and our relationship with it; it was clear that she had little acquaintance with Wilson’s words since she did not cite any.  It’s also worth noting the gaping moral blindness in her article which completely misses the most moral thing Wilson did – spend decades advocating for saving our planet and averting a catastrophe of extinction, climate change and divisiveness – and instead focuses completely on his non-existent immorality.  This is a pattern that is consistently found among those urging “social justice” or “equity” or whatever else: somehow they seem to spend all their time talking about fictional, imagined immorality while missing the real, flesh-and-bones morality that is often the basis of someone’s entire life’s work.</p>



<p>In the end, the simple fact is that McLemore didn’t care about any of this.  She didn’t care because she had a political agenda and the facts did not matter to her, even facts as basic as the definition of the normal distribution in statistics.  For her, Wilson was some obscure white male scientist who was venerated, and that was reason enough for a supposed “takedown”.  And the editor of <em>Scientific American</em> supported and lauded this ignorant, ideology-driven tirade.</p>



<p>Ironically, Wilson would have found this ideological hit job all too familiar. After he wrote his famous book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sociobiology-Synthesis-Edward-Wilson-ebook/dp/B00L9XW7Q2">Sociobiology</a></em> in the 1970s, a volume in which, in a single chapter about human beings, he had the temerity to suggest that maybe, just maybe, human beings operate with the same mix of genes that other creatures do, the book was met by a disgraceful, below-the-belt, ideological response from Wilson’s far left colleagues Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould who hysterically compared his arguments to thinking that was well on its way down the slippery slope to that dark world where lay the Nazi gas chambers. The gas chamber analogy is about the only thing that’s missing from the recent hit job, but the depressing thing is that we are fighting the same battles in 2021 that Wilson fought forty years before, although turbocharged this time by armies of faithful zombies on social media. The sad thing is that Wilson is no longer around to defend himself, although I am not sure he would have bothered with a piece as shoddy as this one.</p>



<p>The complete intellectual destruction of a once-great science magazine is now clear as day.  No more should <em>Scientific American</em> be regarded as a vehicle for sober scientific views and liberal causes but as a political magazine with clearly stated ideological biases and an aversion to facts, an instrument of a blinkered woke political worldview that brooks no dissent. Scott Aaronson has taken a principled stand and said that after this proverbial last straw on the camel’s back, he will no longer write for the magazine or do interviews for them.  I applaud Scott’s decision, and with his expertise it’s a decision that actually matters.  As far as I am concerned, I now mix smoldering fury at the article with immense relief: the last seven years have clearly shown that leaving <em>Scientific American</em> in 2014 was akin to leaving the Soviet Union in the 1930s just before Stalin appointed Lysenko head biologist.  I could not have asked for a happier expulsion and now feel completely vindicated and free of any modicum of regret I might have felt.</p>



<p>To my few friends and colleagues who still write for the magazine and whose opinions I continue to respect, I really wish to ask: Why?  Is writing for a magazine which has sacrificed facts and the liberal voice of real science at the altar of political ideology and make believe still worth it?  What would it take for you to say no more?  As Oscar Wilde would say, one mistake like this is a mistake, two seems more like carelessness; in the roster of the last few years, this is “mistake” 100+, signaling that it’s now officially approved policy.  Do you think that being an insider will allow you to salvage the reputation of the magazine?  If you think that way, you are no different from the one or two moderate Republicans who think they can still salvage the once-great party of Lincoln and Eisenhower.  Both the GOP and <em>Scientific American</em> are beyond redemption from where I stand.  Get out, start your own magazine or join another, one which actually respects liberal, diverse voices and scientific facts; let us applaud you for it.  You deserve better, the world deserves better.  And Ed Wilson’s memory sure as hell deserves better.</p>

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (from Scott):</span></strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29778348">See here</a> for the Hacker News thread about this post.  I was amused by the conjunction of two themes: (1) people who were uncomfortable with my and Ashutosh’s expression of strong emotions, and (2) people who actually clicked through to the <em>SciAm</em> hit-piece, and then reported back to the others that the strong emotions were completely, 100% justified in this case.</p></div>

    <title>Did Betty White  die in 2021?/Why do people have their `end-of-the-year' lists before the end of the year?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> I am looking at Parade Magazine's issue whose cover story is</p><p>                                          <i>We say goodbye to the stars we lost in 2021.</i></p><p>The date on the magazine is Dec 19-26. Betty White is not in it. Neither is Bishop Tutu. Why not? Maybe they did not die in 2021. No, that's not it.  They died after the magazine appeared. They also won't be in the issue a year from now which has cover story </p><p>                                          <i>We say goodbye to the stars we lost in 2022.</i></p><p>Why do magazines and TV shows have their <i>end-of-the-year </i>stuff before the end of the year? Because they want to beat the competition? Because they all do it, so its a race-to-the-bottom? Tradition? </p><p>This blog does the same--- we already posted our end-of-the-year post. Every year I worry that someone will prove P=NP or P NE NP between Dec 24 and Jan 1.  We don't have the Betty-White-Problem since the end-of-the-year post is based on when we blogged about it, not when it happened. So if  theorist X died on Dec 27 then we would do the blog obit in Jan, and would mention it in the end-of-the-year post for the next year. (This happened with Martin Kruskal who died on Dec 26, 2006.) </p><p>Why do we have our end-of-the-year post before the end of the year? Tradition! That might not be a good reason.  </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

Unlike other known QBF proof systems, it builds winning strategies for the universal player within the proofs. Every line of this proof system consists of existential clauses along with countermodels. MRes stores the countermodels as merge maps. Merge maps are deterministic branching programs in which isomorphism checking is efficient as a result MRes is a polynomial time verifiable proof system.

In this paper, we introduce a family of proof systems MRes-$\mathcal{R}$ in which, the information of countermodels are stored in any pre-fixed complete representation $\mathcal{R}$, instead of merge maps. Hence corresponding to each possible complete representation $\mathcal{R}$, we have a sound and refutationally complete QBF-proof system in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. To handle arbitrary representations for the strategies, we introduce consistency checking rules in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$ instead of isomorphism checking in MRes. As a result these proof systems are not polynomial time verifiable. Consequently, the paper shows that using merge maps is too restrictive and can be replaced with arbitrary representations leading to several interesting proof systems.

The paper also studies proof theoretic properties of the family of new proof systems MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. We show that eFrege+$\forall$red simulates all valid refutations from proof systems in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. Since proof systems in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$ may use arbitrary representations, in order to simulate them, we first represent the steps used by the proof systems as a new simple complete structure. As a consequence, the corresponding proof system belonging to MRes-$\mathcal{R}$ is able to simulate all proof systems in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. Finally, we simulate this proof system via eFrege+$\forall$red using the ideas from [Chew et al. ECCC.'2021].

On the lower bound side, we lift the lower bound result of regular MRes ([Beyersdorff et al. FSTTCS.'2020]) for all regular proof systems in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. To be precise, we show that the completion principle formulas from [Jonata et al. Theor. Comput. Sci.'2015] which are shown to be hard for regular MRes in [Beyersdorff et al. FSTTCS.'2020], are also hard for any regular proof system in MRes-$\mathcal{R}$. Thereby, the paper lifts the lower bound of regular MRes to an entire class of proof systems, which use some complete representation, including those undiscovered, instead of merge maps.</summary>

    <title>TR22-001 |  On (Simple) Decision Tree Rank | 

	Yogesh Dahiya, 

	Meena Mahajan</title>
    <summary>In the decision tree computation model for Boolean functions, the depth corresponds to query complexity, and size corresponds to storage space. The depth measure is the most well-studied one, and is known to be polynomially related to several non-computational complexity measures of functions such as certificate complexity. The size measure is also studied, but to a lesser extent. Another decision tree measure that has received very little attention is the minimal rank of the decision tree, first introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler in 1989. This measure is not polynomially related to depth, and hence it can reveal additional information about the complexity of a function. It is characterised by the value of a Prover-Delayer game first proposed by Pudl{\'a}k and Impagliazzo in the context of tree-like resolution proofs. In this paper we study this measure further. We obtain upper and lower bounds on rank in terms of (variants of) certificate complexity. We also obtain upper and lower bounds on the rank for composed functions in terms of the depth of the outer function and the rank of the inner function. We compute the rank exactly for several natural functions and use them to show that all the bounds we have obtained are tight. We also observe that the size-rank relationship for decision trees, obtained by Ehrenfeucht and  Haussler, is tight upto constant factors.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Happy New Year, everyone!</p>



<p>It was exactly two years ago that it first became publicly knowable—though most of us <em>wouldn’t</em> know for at least two more months—just how freakishly horrible is the branch of the wavefunction we’re on.  I.e., that our branch wouldn’t <em>just</em> include Donald Trump as the US president, but <em>simultaneously</em> a global pandemic far worse than any in living memory, and a world-historically bungled response to that pandemic.</p>



<p>So it’s appropriate that I just finished reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Viral-Search-COVID-19-Matt-Ridley/dp/006313912X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8">Viral: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19</a>, by Broad Institute genetics postdoc Alina Chan and science writer Matt Ridley.  Briefly, I think that this is one of the most important books so far of the twenty-first century.</p>



<p>Of course, speculation and argument about the origin of COVID goes back all the way to that fateful January of 2020, and most of this book’s information was already available in fragmentary form elsewhere.  And by their own judgment, Chan and Ridley don’t end their search with a smoking-gun: no Patient Zero, no Bat Zero, no security-cam footage of the beaker dropped on the Wuhan Institute of Virology floor.  Nevertheless, as far as I’ve seen, this is the first analysis of COVID’s origin to treat the question with the full depth, gravity, and perspective that it deserves.</p>



<p><em>Viral</em> is essentially a 300-page plea to follow every lead as if we actually wanted to get to the bottom of things, and in particular, yes, to take the possibility of a lab leak a hell of a lot more seriously than was publicly permitted in 2020.  (Fortuitously, much of this shift already happened as the authors were writing the book, but in June 2021 I was still <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5542#comment-1893250">sneered at</a> for discussing the lab leak hypothesis on this blog.)  <em>Viral</em> is simultaneously a model of lucid, non-dumbed-down popular science writing and of cogent argumentation.  The authors never once come across like tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorists, railing against the sheeple with their conventional wisdom: they’re simply investigators carefully laying out what they’re confident should <em>become</em> conventional wisdom, with the many uncertainties and error bars explicitly noted.  If you read the book and your mind works anything like mine, be forewarned that you might come out agreeing with a lot of it.</p>



<p>I would say that <em>Viral</em> proves the following propositions beyond reasonable doubt:</p>



<ul><li>Virologists, including at Shi Zhengli’s group at WIV and at Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance, were engaged in <em>unbelievably</em> risky work, including collecting virus-laden fecal samples from thousands of bats in remote caves, transporting them to the dense population center of Wuhan, and modifying them to be more dangerous, e.g., through serial passage through human cells and the insertion of furin cleavage sites.  Years before the COVID-19 outbreak, there were experts remarking on how risky this research was and trying to stop it.  Had they known just <em>how</em> lax the biosecurity was in Wuhan—dangerous pathogens experimented on in BSL-2 labs, etc. etc.—they would have been louder.<br/></li><li>Even if it <em>didn’t</em> cause the pandemic, the massive effort to collect and enhance bat coronaviruses now appears to have been of dubious value.  It did not lead to an actionable early warning about how bad COVID-19 was going to be, nor did it lead to useful treatments, vaccines, or mitigation measures, all of which came from other sources.<br/></li><li>There are multiple routes by which SARS-CoV2, or its progenitor, could’ve made its way, otherwise undetected, from the remote bat caves of Yunnan province or some other southern location to the city of Wuhan a thousand miles away, as it has to do in any plausible origin theory.  Having said that, the regular Yunnan→Wuhan traffic in scientific samples of precisely these kinds of viruses, sustained over a decade, <em>does</em> stand out a bit!  On the infamous coincidence of the pandemic starting practically next door to the world’s center for studying SARS-like coronaviruses, rather than near where the horseshoe bats live in the wild, Chan and Ridley memorably quote Humphrey Bogart’s line from <em>Casablanca</em>: “Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.”<br/></li><li>The seafood market was probably “just” an early superspreader site, rather than the site of the original spillover event.  No bats or pangolins at all, and relatively few mammals of any kind, appear to have been sold at that market, and no sign of SARS-CoV2 was ever found in any of the animals despite searching.<br/></li><li>Most remarkably, <strong>Shi and Daszak have increasingly stonewalled</strong>, refusing to answer 100% reasonable questions from fellow virologists.  They’ve acted more and more like defendants exercising their right to remain silent than like participants in a joint search for the truth.  That might be understandable if they’d already answered ad nauseam and wearied of repeating themselves, but with many crucial questions, they haven’t answered even once.  They’ve refused to make available a key database of all the viruses WIV had collected, which WIV inexplicably took offline in September 2019.  When, in January 2020, Shi disclosed to the world that WIV had collected a virus called RaTG13, which was 96% identical to SARS-CoV2, she didn’t mention that it was collected from a mine in Mojiang, which the WIV had sampled from over and over because six workers had gotten a SARS-like pneumonia there in 2012 and three had died from it.  She didn’t let on that her group had been studying RaTG13 for years—giving, instead, the false impression that they’d just noticed it recently, when searching WIV’s records for cousins of SARS-CoV2.  And she didn’t see fit to mention that WIV had collected <em>eight other</em> coronaviruses resembling SARS-CoV2 from the same mine (!).  Shi’s original papers on SARS-CoV2 also passed in silence over the virus’s furin cleavage site—even though SARS-CoV2 was the first sarbecoronavirus with that feature, and Shi herself had recently demonstrated adding furin cleavage sites to other viruses to make them more transmissible, and the cleavage site would’ve leapt out immediately to any coronavirus researcher as the most interesting feature of SARS-CoV2 and as key to its transmissibility.  Some of these points had to be uncovered by Internet sleuths, poring over doctoral theses and the like, after which Shi would glancingly acknowledge the points in talks without ever explaining her earlier silences.  Shi and Daszak refused to cooperate with Chan and Ridley’s book, and have stopped answering questions more generally.  When people politely ask Daszak about these matters on Twitter, he blocks them.<br/></li><li>The Chinese regime has been every bit as obstructionist as you might expect: destroying samples, blocking credible investigations, censoring researchers, and preventing journalists from accessing the Mojiang mine.  So Shi at least has the excuse that, even if she’d <em>wanted</em> to come clean with everything relevant she knows about WIV’s bat coronavirus work, she might not be able to do so without endangering herself or loved ones.  Daszak has no such excuse.</li></ul>



<p>It’s important to understand that, even in the worst case—that (1) there was a lab leak, and (2) Shi and Daszak are knowingly withholding information relevant to it—they’re far from monsters.  Even in <em>Viral</em>‘s relentlessly unsparing account, they come across as genuine believers in their mission to protect the world from the next pandemic.</p>



<p>And it’s like: imagine devoting your life to that mission, having most of the world refuse to take you seriously, and then the calamity happens exactly like you said … <em>except</em> that, not only did your efforts fail to prevent it, but there’s a live possibility that they <em>caused</em> it.  It’s conceivable that your life’s work managed to save <em>minus</em> 15 million lives and create <em>minus</em> $50 trillion in economic value.</p>



<p>Very few scientists in history have faced that sort of psychic burden, perhaps not even the ones who built the atomic bomb.  I <em>hope</em> I’d maintain my scientific integrity under such an astronomical weight, but I’m doubtful that I would.  Would you?</p>



<p><em>Viral</em> very wisely never tries to psychoanalyze Shi and Daszak.  I fear that one might need a lot of conceptual space between “knowing” and “not knowing,” “suspecting” and “not suspecting,” to do justice to the planet-sized enormity of what’s at stake here.  Suppose, for example, that an initial investigation in January 2020 reassured you that SARS-CoV2 <em>probably</em> hadn’t come from your lab: would you continue trying to get to the bottom of things, or would you thereafter decide the matter was closed?</p>



<p>For all that, I agree with Chan and Ridley that COVID-19 might well have had a zoonotic origin after all.  And one point <em>Viral</em> makes abundantly clear is that, if our goal is to prevent the next pandemic, then resolving the mystery of COVID-19 actually matters less than one might think.  This is because, whichever possibility—zoonotic spillover <em>or</em> lab leak—turns out to be the truth of this case, <strong>the other possibility would remain absolutely terrifying and would demand urgent action as well</strong>.  Read the book and see for yourself.</p>



<p>Searching my inbox, I found an email from April 16, 2020 where I told someone who’d asked me that the lab-leak hypothesis seemed perfectly plausible to me (albeit no <em>more</em> than plausible), that I couldn’t understand why it wasn’t being investigated more, but that I was hesitant to blog about these matters.  As I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5542">wrote</a> seven months ago, I now see my lack of courage on this as having been a personal failing.  Obviously, I’m just a quantum computing theorist, not a biologist, so I don’t <em>have</em> to have any thoughts whatsoever about the origin of COVID-19 … but I <em>did</em> have some, and I didn’t share them here only because of the likelihood that I’d be called an idiot on social media.  Having now read Chan and Ridley, though, I think I’d take being called an idiot for this book review more as a positive signal about my courage than as a negative signal about my reasoning skills!</p>



<p>At one level, <em>Viral</em> stands alongside, I dunno, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eichmann-Jerusalem-Banality-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039881">Eichmann in Jerusalem</a></em> among the saddest books I’ve ever read.  It’s 300 pages of one of the great human tragedies of our lifetime balancing on a hinge between happening and not happening, and we all know how it turns out.  On another level, though, <em>Viral</em> is optimistic.  Like with Richard Feynman’s famous <a href="https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt">“personal appendix”</a> about the Space Shuttle <em>Challenger</em> explosion, the very act of writing such a book reflects a view that you’re still allowed to ask questions; that one or two people armed with nothing but arguments can run rings around governments, newspapers, and international organizations; that we don’t yet live in a post-truth world.</p></div>

Lance Fortnow was a colleague of mine for a long time at Georgia Tech and is now the Dean of the College of Computing at Illinois Institute of Technology. He started one of the top blogs in theory of computing, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org">Computational Complexity</a>, which is partnered by Bill Gasarch of the University of Maryland at College Park.</p>
<p>
Today, New Year’s Eve, we discuss his angles on the status of P versus NP.<br/>
<span id="more-19441"/></p>
<p>
Lance has written a <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/1/257448-fifty-years-of-p-vs-np-and-the-possibility-of-the-impossible/fulltext">new survey</a> on the current status of the P versus NP problem. It is titled, “Fifty Years of P vs. NP and the Possibility of the Impossible.” By this he means two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The believed impossibility of <em>solving</em> NP-hard problems is a valuable source of “computational friction.” The analogy is that without physical friction, movement would be too easy—we would be unable to control it. <p/>
</li><li>
The seeming impossibility of <em>resolving</em> the P=NP question has redistributed focus to coping with NP-hardness and finding ways around it. Indeed, this impossibility may be technically bound to the ability of heuristic approaches to achieve practical success.
</li></ul>
<p>
Well, as theorists, Ken and I would like to know about the status of resolving the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> 2022 and Beyond </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I am old enough that I am unlikely to see the resolution of P=NP. But that does not stop me from thinking about the what could be coming down the pike. Lance describes the importance of this great problem—it is roughly fifty years from its first statement by Steven Cook, and then Leonid Levin and Dick Karp—and reviews what can be called progress on it. But as this illustration from his article speaks, we are still at a crossroads about what kind of computational world we live in.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/31/make-a-trillion-dollars/cacm/" rel="attachment wp-att-19445"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19445" height="240" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cacm.jpg?resize=240%2C240&amp;ssl=1" width="240"/></a></p>
<p>
We are just about to enter the new year—2022. This could be the year that resolves P=NP, or that could be another fifty years away. Another measure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems">Prize</a> of a million dollars for solving it is now entering its third decade. Yet there seems to be no hint whether we are close to its resolution or not. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/31/make-a-trillion-dollars/attachment/2022/" rel="attachment wp-att-19446"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19446" height="90" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2022.png?resize=160%2C90&amp;ssl=1" width="160"/></a></p>
<p/><h2> Why P=NP Is So Hard </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There is a fundamental issue with the P=NP problem. Yes it is hard. Yes we seem to have no clear path to resolving it. We do not even have a clear path to a partial result. But that does not really explain why the problem is so hard. Let’s try and look at why the problem is so impossible.</p>
<p>
The reason I believe that the problem is so difficult is due to the inherent nature of algorithms for NP problems. This nature makes the resolution especially difficult, and especially interesting. Consider the problem of finding some <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(X) = b " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28X%29+%3D+b+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Here <img alt="{f(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an easy to compute function. The difficulty is that finding <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> given <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is hard. Think <img alt="{f(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is some crypto type problem, or if you wish some search type problem. </p>
<p>
Why is this such a nasty problem? The obvious issue is how hard is it to map an <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to an <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(X) = b " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28X%29+%3D+b+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>But {it what exactly does this mean?} The first issue is <i>when must we be able to do this?</i> The second is <i>how must we be able to do this?</i> Let’s look at these in turn.</p>
<p>
<i>When?</i> The obvious answer is <em>always</em>. We would love to be able to find <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for each <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that has a solution. This corresponds to being able to solve all problems. Clearly the best case. But in practice we might be quite happy with: </p>
<ul>
<li>
For most <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> find an <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; <p/>

Or even, for many <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> find an <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.
</li></ul>
<p>The latter could be: at least <img alt="{50\%}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B50%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the time we can find the <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In practice this could be more than enough. Think breaking a secret cryptosystem. If we could break even a positive fraction of the messages this could easily be enough. </p>
<p>
<i>How?</i> The obvious answer is with an efficient algorithm. We would love to be able to run a standard polynomial algorithm that finds <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. But in practice there are at least two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The standard algorithm could be replaced by algorithms that break the standard definition of algorithms. They could for example be quantum algorithms or could be DNA algorithms. <p/>
</li><li>
The algorithms could be standard conventional algorithms. But they might run in time bounds that are exponential but are tricky. For example suppose that there is an solution that runs in time 	<p/>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  2^{n/C} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5E%7Bn%2FC%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>If <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is modest size then the solution is exponential in practice. But if <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is large, then the algorithm for real problems would be efficient.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
The latter is interesting. If <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is any constant <i>no matter the size</i> you would collect the million dollar prize for solving P=NP. But if <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is large enough, this would also make a trillion dollars. This is because you could use the method to solve realistic sized problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Enter A Trillion Dollars </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The following image hopefully helps set the stage for what a trillion dollars looks like, compared to a million.</p>
<p/><p/>
<table style="margin: auto;">

<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/31/make-a-trillion-dollars/tri/" rel="attachment wp-att-19448"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19448" height="244" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tri.png?resize=425%2C244&amp;ssl=1" width="425"/></a>

<p>
The reason for showing this that if P=NP has better when and how solutions some yield attacks that could make immense amounts of money. For example, an algorithm that breaks <img alt="{50\%}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B50%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the problems in a practical time would be worth an immense amount of money. </p>
<p>
So if you could show P=NP, even in some practical way that’s better than what we can do now, you could be richer than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auric_Goldfinger">Auric Goldfinger</a> or some other James Bond masterminds. We might all, however, end up with the poorer world that these villains would have created. </p>
<p>
What has grown over the past fifty years—and the past decade in particular—is ways to make a trillion dollars by <em>not</em> resolving P versus NP. Discussion of these occupies latter sections of Lance’s survey where a “payoff” would ordinarily come in a review article.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What do you think about P=NP? Could the solvers win much more than the one million dollar prize? What would you do if you made progress? Is the real win the way the question acts as a ridge framing a valley that guides the flow of progress?</p>

    <title>TR21-182 |  On the strength of Sherali-Adams and Nullstellensatz as propositional proof systems | 

	Ilario Bonacina, 

	Maria Luisa Bonet</title>
    <summary>The propositional proof system Sherali-Adams (SA) has polynomial-size proofs of the pigeonhole principle (PHP). Similarly, the Nullstellensatz (NS) proof system has polynomial size proofs of the bijective (i.e. both functional and onto) pigeonhole principle (ofPHP). We characterize the strength of these algebraic proof systems in terms of Boolean proof systems the following way. We show that SA (resp. NS over ${\bf Z}$) with unary coefficients lies strictly between tree-like resolution and tree-like depth-$1$ Frege + PHP (resp. ofPHP).  We introduce weighted versions of PHP and ofPHP, resp. wtPHP and of-wtPHP and we show that SA (resp. NS over ${\bf Z}$)  lies strictly between resolution and tree-like depth-$1$ Frege + wtPHP (resp. of-wtPHP). We also show analogue results for depth-$d$ versions of SA and NS.</summary>

    <title>TR21-181 |  The KW Games as a Teaser | 

	Oded Goldreich</title>
    <summary>This is a purely pedagogical text.
We advocate using KW-games as a teaser (or ``riddle'') for a complexity theoretic course. 
In particular, stating the KW-game for a familiar NP-complete problem such as 3-Colorability and asking to prove that it requires more than polylogarithmic communication poses a seemingly tractable question that requires no background. 
The fact that this is actually a formidable question puts much of complexity theory in the right perspective.  
Indeed, complexity theory contains numerous extremely appealing problems that require little background (beyond basic comfort with the notion of computation) and yet are formidable.</summary>

    <title>TR21-180 |  Proving as Fast as Computing: Succinct Arguments with Constant Prover Overhead | 

	Noga Ron-Zewi, 

	Ron Rothblum</title>
    <summary>Succinct arguments are proof systems that allow a powerful, but untrusted, prover to convince a weak verifier that an input $x$ belongs to a language $L \in NP$, with communication that is much shorter than the $NP$ witness. Such arguments, which grew out of the theory literature, are now drawing immense interest also in practice, where a key bottleneck that has arisen is the high computational cost of \emph{proving} correctness.

In this work we address this problem by constructing succinct arguments for general computations, expressed as Boolean circuits (of bounded fan-in), with a \emph{strictly linear} size prover. The soundness error of the protocol is an arbitrarily small constant. Prior to this work, succinct arguments were known with a \emph{quasi-}linear size prover for general Boolean circuits or with linear-size only for arithmetic circuits, defined over large finite fields.

In more detail, for every Boolean circuit $C=C(x,w)$, we construct an $O(\log |C|)$-round argument-system in which the prover can be implemented by a size $O(|C|)$ Boolean circuit (given as input both the instance $x$ and the witness $w$), with arbitrarily small constant soundness error and using $poly(\lambda,\log |C|)$ communication, where $\lambda$ denotes the security parameter. The verifier can be implemented by a size $O(|x|) + poly(\lambda, \log |C|)$ circuit following a size $O(|C|)$ private pre-processing step, or, alternatively, by using a purely public-coin protocol (with no pre-processing) with a size $O(|C|)$ verifier. The protocol can be made zero-knowledge using standard techniques (and with similar parameters). The soundness of our protocol is computational and relies on the existence of collision resistant hash functions that can be computed by linear-size circuits, such as those proposed by Applebaum et al. (ITCS, 2017).

 At the heart of our construction is a new information-theoretic  \emph{interactive oracle proof} (IOP), an interactive analog of a PCP, for circuit satisfiability, with constant prover overhead. The improved efficiency of our IOP is obtained by bypassing a barrier faced by prior IOP constructions, which needed to (either explicitly or implicitly) encode the entire computation using a multiplication code.</summary>

<h3>Our August 2019 Oberwolfach meeting.</h3>
<p>At the end of August 2019 we had in Oberwolfach a very fruitful meeting on Geometric, algebraic, and topological combinatorics. (In <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/01/richard-ehrenborgs-problem-on-spanning-trees-in-bipartite-graphs/">this post</a>, I mentioned an open problem from the problem session.) I came to Oberwolfach just after a visit, with my son-in-law, Eran, to CERN near Genève. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/04/computer-science-and-its-impact-on-our-future/">this post</a> for pictures from ATLAS, CERN, and this post regarding my <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/21/the-argument-against-quantum-computers-a-cern-colloquium-and-a-new-paper/">CERN colloquium</a>.)</p>
<p>The August 2019 Oberwolfach meeting was the seventh meeting in a series of meetings that started in 1995.  Here is, by the way, is <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematics-as-a-team-sport-20200331/"> very nice article i</a>n Quanta Magazine about an Oberwolfach Meeting. (And feel free to share Oberwolfach memories in the comment section.)</p>
<p>The sequence in the title of the post is not a DNA sequence or something similar but rather it refers to these meetings in Oberwolfach and this post is devoted to these series of meetings and other meetings in Oberwolfach.</p>
<h2>Oberwolfach: AGC, 1995; GTC, 1999; TGC, 2003; GTC, 2007; TGC, 2011; GAC, 2015; GATC, 2019.</h2>
<p>Here A stands for ‘Algebraic’, G stands for ‘Geometric’, T stands for ‘Topological’ and C stands for ‘Combinatorics’.</p>
<p>These series of conferences are devoted to algebraic, geometric, and topological combinatorics. Both algebraic and geometric combinatorics are very large areas (and topological combinatorics is pretty large) and usually participants of the conference are divided into several overlapping, much appreciated minorities. Actually, living in a country where every citizen is a member of a much appreciated minority seems like a nice political setting to me.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://oda.mfo.de/handle/mfo/397">the review</a> of the first conference in the series AGC95.</p>
<h3>AGC 1995</h3>
<p>I was slightly younger than 40 years old. The meeting, organized by Anders Björner, Günter Ziegler and me, took place before a sabbatical semester at IAS, Princeton in the fall 1995. Here are a few topics that were discussed:</p>
<p><strong>Cluster algebras to be.</strong> Sergey Fomin’s lecture was on Piecewise-linear maps, total positivity, and pseudoline arrangements, it represented a joint work with Arkady Bernstein and Andrei Zelevinsky. This paper was the starting point of vastly influential cluster algebras that Sergey, Arkady, and Andrei started developing around that time.</p>
<p><strong>Polytopes spheres and face numbers.</strong> Tom Braden talked about Intersection homology and polytopes – recent progress, this was about his paper with Bob MacPherson where (among other things) a conjecture that I made some years earlier was settled.</p>
<p><strong>Convexity in the Grassmannian.</strong> Eli Goodman talked about a joint work with Ricky Pollack on  some combinatorial questions for convex sets on affine Grassmanian. Finding the right notion of convexity for a subset of the Grassmannian is a fascinating and unexplored question.</p>
<p><strong>Optimization.</strong> Monique Laurent talked about  the geometry of the set of positive semidefinite matrices with diagonal entries. Rekha Thomas talked about using Gröbner bases to solve integer programs (and a comparison between linear and integer programming).</p>
<p><strong>The two 2-lecture series.  </strong>Nati Linial gave a series of two lectures on <strong>the geometry of graphs</strong>. He talked about his program to think about graphs as metric objects and apply insights regarding metric spaces to theoretical computer science. This was shortly after the Linial-London Rabinovich paper that had large impact in theoretical computer science and combinatorics had appeared.  Rade Zivaleivich  gave two lectures on methods of obstruction theory, related to topological and colorful Tverberg theorems and measure partitions and other questions. We came back to this topic in subsequent  conferences in the series.</p>
<p><strong>Real algebraic geometry.</strong> Ricky Pollack talked about Complexity and algorithms in real algebraic geometry.</p>
<p><strong>Triangulations of cyclic polytopes and the generalized Baues Conjecture</strong>.<br/>
Jorg Rambau talked about a counterexample to the “Generalized Baues Conjecture” and Vic Reiner talked about Triangulations of cyclic polytopes: the higher Stasheff-Tamari posets.</p>
<p><strong>Universality. </strong>Jürgen Richter Gebert explained why Realization spaces of 4-polytopes are universal!</p>
<p>See the review for some more talks on the topics listed above and on other topics such as <strong>Lattices of parabolic subgroups, </strong><strong>Discrepancy theory, </strong><strong>Combinatorics of knots </strong>and more<strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Flashback: my first meeting at Oberwolfach</span></strong></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.mfo.de/occasion/8229/www_view">Konvexe Körper 1982</a></h3>
<p>I was a 27 year old graduate student. It was just after the 1982 Lebanon war. I had a one year old daughter and following the meeting my wife and I toured Italy for a week. It was great!  My thesis supervisor Micha A. Perles and my academic brother Michael Kallay also participated. At that conference I met for the first time many mathematicians and some of them have remained my good friends ever since. The meetings on Konvexe Körper took place every two years and I participated in several subsequent meetings.</p>
<h3>Oberwolfach’s Combinatorics meetings from January 2000 to January 2020</h3>
<p>The other series of conferences in Oberwolfach that I attended regularly, is the combinatorics meeting that takes place in the first week of January every 2-3 years. The <a href="https://www.mfo.de/occasion/0001/www_view">first one</a> in the series was also the first Oberwolfach meeting after 2000.  The <a href="https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2002/www_view">last meeting</a> in this series was in January 2020 and just before the meeting my wife and I spent four great days in Rome. This was in fact our last trip outside Israel until September 2021 (not counting a 1-day <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/02/11/petra-jordan/">visit to Petra</a>).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">And the answer is: GATC (2023) </span></strong></h2>
<p>Half a year ago Isabella Novik, Paco Santos, Volkmar Welker and I submitted a proposal for a 2023 meeting which is going to be the 8th meeting in this series. Recently the meeting was approved! It will take place on December 10-16, 2023.</p>

    <title>Raytracing diamonds</title>
    <summary>This comes from a question posed to me and others in 2019 by Stefan Langerman, a computational geometer who also happens to be a diamond dealer. The classic brilliant cut shape of diamonds has a flat “table” face on the top (visible) side of the gem, and many other smaller facets on the sides (“crown”) and back (“pavilion”), with angles chosen so that most of the light that enters through the table is reflected back out through the table, making the diamond look bright. Can we simulate this reflection process efficiently, without having to trace all the reflections of all (or a sufficiently dense sample of all) possible light rays?</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This comes from a question posed to me and others in 2019 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Langerman">Stefan Langerman</a>, a computational geometer who also happens to be a diamond dealer. The classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_(diamond_cut)">brilliant cut</a> shape of diamonds has a flat “table” face on the top (visible) side of the gem, and many other smaller facets on the sides (“crown”) and back (“pavilion”), with angles chosen so that most of the light that enters through the table is reflected back out through the table, making the diamond look bright. Can we simulate this reflection process efficiently, without having to trace all the reflections of all (or a sufficiently dense sample of all) possible light rays?</p>

<p>This appears to be an interesting problem even for a very simple abstraction of the diamond’s shape: a two-dimensional isosceles triangle, with the base of the triangle as its table and the two equal sides as its pavilion. What you need to know about light reflections in gems is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_angle_(optics)">critical angle</a>, determined from the high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index">refractive index</a> of diamonds and other gems. Inside the gem, rays that hit a face at an angle shallower than the critical angle; rays that hit more steeply than the critical angle will escape. Any light ray hitting the table will always enter the gem, and will be refracted so that it enters along a ray steeper than the critical angle. It will then bounce around within the gem until it happens to hit a face steeply enough to escape. The question is to predict where this escape ray escapes, more quickly than the obvious algorithm of calculating explicitly the entire sequence of reflections that it performs. Or if we can’t, can we at least provide good bounds on the lengths of these reflection sequences?</p>

<p>Three of the simplest cases involve the isosceles triangles for which the triangle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_tessellation">tiles the plane by copies reflected across its edges</a>, the equilateral triangle, isosceles right triangle, and 30-30-120 isosceles triangle. The paths of a reflected light ray within such a triangle are combinatorially equivalent to the paths of a straight line through this triangulation: they pass through the same types of edges, at the same angles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Reflection through many faces in a 30-30-120 gem" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/30-30-120.svg" width="80%"/></p>

<p>For all three of these triangle shapes, a line that enters the gem through any edge can only pass through a constant number of tiles in the tiling, before passing through another edge with the same angle, at which it must necessarily leave the gem (if it has not done so already). For instance, the red line shown, if it enters at its bottom left endpoint on the table of a green triangle, will exit after at most three reflections, through the parallel table of a blue triangle. The constant in the number of reflections here is absolute, not depending on the critical angle.</p>

<p>The next simplest case is the isosceles triangle with apex angle \(2\pi/5\). This triangle does not tile the plane, but we can still form a partial tiling by “unrolling” the path of reflections through the triangle into a line through a sequence of reflected triangles. In order to avoid exiting through one of the sides (by passing through it more perpendicularly than the entrance angle) and in order to miss the closest two copies of the table that are parallel to the entrance, there is only one passage that can be followed in the unrolled triangulation, the one shown by the red ray in the figure. Because this passage is perpendicular to one of the reflected sides of the triangle, a ray that is more perpendicular to the table than to this side can only continue for \(O(1)\) steps through this passage before hitting an exit. Here, though, the critical angle comes into play: critical angles that are closer to a right angle will allow larger (but constant) numbers of reflections.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Reflection in a 2pi/5 isosceles triangle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/pentagonal-isosceles-reflections.svg" width="40%"/></p>

<p>Isosceles triangles with apex \(\pi/4\) are even messier. When a ray entering the table exits by a side, or exits by the table without first bouncing off the table, it always does so within $O(1)$ steps. The trickier cases are when a ray entering through the table misses the opposite table in the octagon formed by reflected copies of the triangle, and passes through a sequence of diagonal or horizontal reflections into other octagons before escaping. In the case that there are no horizontal reflections, only diagonal ones, we just need to divide the vertical distance that the ray needs to travel to hit the next row of vertical edges by the slope of the ray, and round. The case that there is at least one horizontal reflection (shown) is a little more compicated, but again appears to involve a finite calculation. So it seems that with a little more calculation it is still possible to determine algorithmically what happens in this case, in constant time rather than having to simulate the unbounded number of bounces triangle-by-triangle.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Reflection in a pi/4 isosceles triangle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/octagonal-reflex.svg"/></p>

<p>All of these triangles have angles that are rational multiples of \(2\pi\). For reflections within polygons of this type, the reflected line will only pass through a constant number of slopes. The rays of a single slope that hit a given line of the polygon can be describes as an interval, and the mapping on rays that takes each ray starting on one of the sides with one of these slopes to the start of its next reflection is a special kind of mapping studied in the theory of dynamical systems, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_exchange_transformation">interval exchange transformation</a>. So from a geometric question on ray-tracing, we are led to a more abstract question: given an interval exchange transformation, and a starting point in that transformation, how easy is it to determine the number of times one would need to repeat the transformation to return back to the same interval?</p>

<p>I have no real progress to report on any of these questions, in part because the continuous nature of these problems lead to difficult numerical issues. Instead, I have a new arXiv preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11607">“The Complexity of Iterated Reversible Computation” (arXiv:2112.11607
)</a> on related but more combinatorial problems. Suppose one has an invertible mapping \(f\) on a finite (but exponentially large) set of states, that is easy to compute, such as an interval exchange transformation on integers rather than real numbers. Suppose also that you want to repeat this mapping for a given initial state \(x\) and a large number \(n\) of steps. Is there anything you can do to compute the result \(f^{(n)}(x)\) of this iterated mapping, more efficiently than the obvious method of just computing \(x\), \(f(x)\), \(f(f(x))\), one step at a time? One property that appears highly relevant here is that these mappings are reversible: they are one-to-one, and more strongly the inverse mapping is also an interval exchange transformation. In contrast, it is easy to find mappings that are not reversible and for which computing iterated values is \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\)-complete: consider, for instance, the state transition map of a space-bounded Turing machine.</p>

<p>For some similar systems, we do know of effective methods in practice if not in theory. For Conway’s Game of Life, for instance, it appears to be \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\)-complete to compute what happens to an initial state after \(n\) steps (although I’m not sure this exact claim has been published in the literature), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashlife">hashlife</a> (as implemented in <a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/">Golly</a>) can run many complicated and large patterns in an amount of runtime substantially less than the number of generated steps. The Game of Life is not reversible, but some other interesting cellular automata with similar behavior such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critters_(cellular_automaton)">Critters</a> are. Can we say anything about the computational complexity of simulating Critters or other reversible rules? My new paper addresses these questions by formulating a complexity class that includes computing \(f^{(n)}(x)\) for reversible cellular automaton simulation, integer interval exchange transformations, and others. It sandwiches this class between \(\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{PH}}\) and \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\), and finds complete problems for it including the simulation of reversible cellular automata and of piecewise linear tranformations. The complete cellular automata include the two-dimensional billiard ball model, already known for its ability to simulate reversible circuits, and a new one-dimensional automata that can simulate some two-dimensional automata including the billiard ball model. Because Critters can in turn simulate the billiard ball model, it is also complete in the same sense. But I wasn’t able to prove completeness for integer interval exchange transformations, let alone say anything useful about the non-integer transformations needed to understand diamond reflections.</p>

    <title>Complexity Year in Review 2021</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The pandemic hampered many activities but research flourished with a number of great results in complexity. Result of the year goes to</p><p><a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/151/">Locally Testable Codes with constant rate, distance, and locality</a> by Irit Dinur, Shai Evra, Ron Livne, Alexander Lubotzky and Shahar Mozes<br/>and independently in<br/><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03654">Asymptotically Good Quantum and Locally Testable Classical LDPC Codes</a> by Pavel Panteleev and Gleb Kalachev</p><p>They achieved the seemingly impossible, a code that can be checked with constant queries, constant rate, constant distance and constant error. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjc6GCRFnpg">Irit's presentation</a>, a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-defeat-randomness-to-create-ideal-code-20211124/">Quanta article</a> and an <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/175/">overview</a> by Oded Goldreich. Ryan O'Donnell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7LuOiOBYyQ">presents</a> the Panteleev-Kalachev paper, which also resolved a major open question in quantum coding theory.</p><p>Other great results include <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/081/">Superpolynomial Lower Bounds Against Low-Depth Algebraic Circuits</a> by Nutan Limaye, Srikanth Srinivasan and Sébastien Tavenas, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/07/intersecting-classes.html">The Complexity of Gradient Descent</a> by John Fearnley, Paul W. Goldberg, Alexandros Hollender and Rahul Savani, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/03/slicing-hypercube.html">Slicing the Hypercube is not easy</a> by Gal Yehuda and Amir Yehudayoff, and <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/164/">The Acrobatics of BQP</a> by Scott Aaronson, DeVon Ingram, and William Kretschmer. The latter paper answers a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2005/12/pulling-out-quantumness.html">16-year old open question of mine</a> that suggests you cannot pull out quantumness like you can pull out randomness from a computation.</p><p>In computing overall, the story continues to be the growth in machine learning and the power of data. We're entering a phase where data-driven programming often replaces logic-based approaches to solving complex problems. This is also the year that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/everyone-pitching-the-metaverse-has-a-different-idea-of-what-it-is/">metaverse</a> started to gain attention. Too early to know where that will take use, but the virtual space may become as disruptive as the Internet over the next decade, and its potential effect in research and education should not be ignored. In the next pandemic, we may wonder how we survived earlier pandemics without it.</p><p>The NSF might be going through some major changes and significant increases, or not, especially with the Build Back Better bill on hold. The <a href="https://cra.org/govaffairs/blog/">Computing Research Policy Blog</a> can help you through the morass. </p><p>We remember <a href="https://cms.math.ca/news-item/the-canadian-mathematical-society-mourns-the-loss-of-matthew-brennan/">Matthew Brennan</a>, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/06/benny-chor-1956-2021.html">Benny Chor</a>, <a href="https://www.informs.org/content/view/full/268792">Alan Hoffman</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/science/arianna-wright-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuonUktbfqohkSlUbCibOVtkqqBaLwvHVwbU6gHa7MzKURjZeiugYCoTG-1vIYeArQeoP6AmhZY0LNq4zFrs1x_VDPkdpRk7w85fVxp4Lf2Btp9m4Gz5rh8mIDL1lqnq6MDLmdrkuz7Dk40rMeCK9DvykpH4qIApup5Znd0j7miBbg_eYTZMmn4V2zvwjBZhlRTwfZCDsvPDgCxh2OtjufQiLo0BtGLkfAWeP6Ibav7EQcwxSCUbFT2d_5As86dBfPdAWOcXvPrNpT77c47lyKR5DIrGzoGI&amp;smid=url-share">Arianna Rosenbluth</a>, <a href="https://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2021/2021-2-23-3.html">Walter Savitch</a>, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/01/alan-selman-1941-2021.html">Alan Selman</a>, <a href="https://math.cornell.edu/professor-robert-strichartz-dies-78">Bob Strichartz</a> and <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5730">Stephen Wiesner</a>. </p><p>We thank our guest posters <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/08/the-long-road.html">Varsha Dani</a>, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/11/reflections-on-trusting-trustlessness.html">Evangelos Georgiadis</a>, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/09/guest-post-on-solving-or-trying-to-poly.html">Bogdan Grechuk</a>, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/08/do-four-colors-suffice.html">David Marcus</a> and <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/12/yes-virginia-there-is-santa-clause-for.html">Hunter Monroe</a>.</p><p>In May I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/05/emerging-from-pandemic.html">posted</a> on emerging from the pandemic.

<p>Richard Stanley, a most famous and influential mathematician in my area of combinatorics, the master of finding deep connections between combinatorics and other areas of pure mathematics, and my postdoctoral advisor, has just won the Steele prize for lifetime achievement, among the most prestigious mathematical prizes. </p>



<p>The citation reads: “Stanley has revolutionized enumerative combinatorics, revealing deep connections with other branches of mathematics, such as commutative algebra, topology, algebraic geometry, probability, convex geometry, and representation theory. In doing so, he solved important longstanding combinatorial problems, often reinvigorating these other fields with new combinatorial methods. Through his outstanding research; excellent expository works; and many PhD students, collaborators and colleagues, he continues to influence the field of combinatorics worldwide.” </p>



<p>Congratulations to Richard and to the community of combinatorics. </p>



<p>Richard’s work is mentioned in many posts over my blog but let me point you specifically to: </p>

<p>In the following January, Harvard GSAS kindly supports me to offer a <a href="https://cnchou.github.io/mini-course" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">mini-course on <em>“What is Computation? From Turing Machines to Blackholes and Neurons”</em></a>. In this blog post, I’m going to share the motivation for teaching this mini-course and give an overview on what you will learn if you are interested in participating!</p>



<p>Computation is not an exotic word for people living in the 21st century. In high school, kids have to learn and do all sorts of computations in arithmetics (and some even start to write computer programs!). For scientists, computational methods become more and more common and sometimes even completely change the paradigm of a field. There are computers of different forms hiding in our daily life ranging from your smartphones to the toy of your pets. Also, from time to time we see excitement on the news about the development of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Computation has become central in human civilization, however, do we really understand what computation is?</p>



<p>Let me first convince you why asking and attempting to answer this question is important.</p>



<p>Traditionally, at least on Wikipedia, computation is defined as <em>“any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and which follows a well-defined model (e.g. an algorithm)”</em>. Indeed, for computer scientists and mathematicians, computation is about solving <em>computational problems</em> via an abstract mathematical model known as <em>Turing machine</em>. In particular, the <em>Church-Turing Thesis</em>, which can be viewed as Newton’s laws in computer science, asserts that all effective computational methods in the world can be captured by Turing machines. That is to say, in the mathematical world, computation is something axiomatized and can be studied and understood parallel to the empirical world.</p>



<p>On the other hand, for the majority of people, computation is something more concrete and has a physical realization such as a digital computer. The rise of computer science in the past few decades is certainly owing to the great technological success of building up modern computers. The fascinating advances of technology seem to close the gap between theory and reality (similar to Newton’s laws!). Nevertheless, in the frontier of scientific research, the recent surging developments of quantum computing and artificial neural networks started to challenge our understanding in computation – the ways they compute are so different from the traditional Turing machines and we don’t really know why and how they work so well!</p>



<p>In my opinion, we need to revisit the notion of computation in order to attack these mysteries. Specifically, the approach should be interdisciplinary.</p>



<p>As computer scientists are used to think of computations as composing different <em>resources</em> and <em>subroutines</em>, the computations in physics and biology tend to be rather <em>holistic</em> and <em>open-ended</em>. When talking about computations, people from different fields often think a bit differently. Such distinctions across fields should not be barriers or problems, instead, it could potentially serve as seeds to enrich our understanding in the essence of computation.</p>



<p>This mini-course is an invitation to rethink about what computation is through different angles. We will focus on but not limit to three perspectives including mathematics, physics, and biology. Through theories, examples, and experiments, we are going to see the similarities and differences between these disciplines. Six guest speakers coming from a diverse background (from computer science and physics to neuroscience and modern art) will join us and provide lots of examples and stories from their home field. The aim of this mini-course is to remind people of the diverse nature of computation and envision the possibilities of future interdisciplinary research.</p>



<p>There will be three modules and each contains three 50-minute interactive lectures and 1-3 guest talk(s). The first module focuses on the mathematical foundation of computations in which the students will learn the concept of Turing machines, computability, reductions, and most importantly, the underlying philosophy. The second module is about the computations in the physical world where we will launch from classical mechanics, to statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and gravity. The third module looks into the computations in biology, ranging from genomes, evolution, to neuroscience. The mini-course will end with a panel discussion with all the guest speakers and students.</p>

    <title>Recursive bijective numbering</title>
    <summary>Ordinary radix systems for representing numbers, like binary or decimal, use fixed finite sets of digits. The same is true for bijective numeration, used for columns of spreadsheets. In bijective numbering, every string of digits represents a unique number, shorter strings represent smaller numbers, and strings of equal length have the usual order. In spreadsheets, the digits are letters A–Z, one-letter strings represent numbers \(1\) through \(26\), two-letter strings represent \(27\) through \(26+26^2=702\), etc. Instead, mixed radix systems like the factorial number system have position-varying digit sets. In factorial numbering, the \(i\)th digit can range from \(0\) to \(i-1\), with place value \((i-1)!\). The value of a digit string is the sum of digits times place values. One could combine these ideas and get a bijective factorial number system, in which strings of at most \(i\) digits can represent numbers up to the sum of the first \(i\) factorials. But in all of these mixed radix systems, the digits are not drawn from a finite set. Maybe we need another numbering system just to describe each digit of a mixed-radix number? This leads to the idea of a recursive numbering system, where the digits of a mixed-radix system are themselves numbers in the same system.</summary>

But in all of these mixed radix systems, the digits are not drawn from a finite set. Maybe we need another numbering system just to describe each digit of a mixed-radix number? This leads to the idea of a <em>recursive</em> numbering system, where the digits of a mixed-radix system are themselves numbers in the same system.</p>

<p>An example might clarify this idea. Let’s start with a recursive numbering system based on binary. Like other mixed-radix systems, we’ll number the digit positions starting with \(i=0\) at the right. Each position has a place value, the product of the numbers of choices for earlier digits, and the value of a sequence of digits is the sum of digits times place value. We’ll start with two choices of digit in position \(0\), like binary, and in later positions we’ll use the values we’ve already constructed as allowable digits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In position \(i=0\), the two available digits given in the base case are \(0\) and \(1\), allowing us to represent only the numbers \(0\) and \(1\) as one-digit strings.</li>
  <li>In position \(i=1\), there are still only two digits available, the two numbers \(0\) and \(1\) that have shorter representations. In this position, they have place value \(2\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(3\) to be represented as a two-digit string.</li>
  <li>In position \(i=2\), we now have four digits available, the numbers from \(0\) to \(3\). These have place value \(4\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(15\) to be represented with three digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>At each successive level of this structure, the number of available digits and place values will be equal. Each new digit squares the range of representable numbers. In any position \(i&gt;0\), we will have \(2^{2^{i-1}}\) digits available, with place value \(2^{2^{i-1}}\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(2^{2^{i}}-1\) to be represented. In some sense, though, we haven’t done anything very interesting yet. Like binary, we just get powers of two. The recursive-binary representation of a number can be obtained in a trivial way from its binary representation, by partitioning the bits into groups of 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, … bits.</p>

<p>Instead, a bijective numbering system leads to more interesting results when handled recursively. For recursive bijective numbering, we can start with a much simpler base case, the empty string, which can be interpreted in any bijective numbering system as representing the number \(0\). With this base case, we can define a bijective numbering system in which the available digits in position \(i\) (starting from \(i=0\) in the rightmost digit) are the numbers that can be represented by strings of length at most \(i\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>In position \(i=0\), there is only one available digit, the number \(0\) (already represented by the empty string), producing only one single-digit value, representing the number \(1\).</li>
  <li>In position \(i=1\), there are two available digits, the numbers \(0\) and \(1\) that we have already represented, so there are two two-digit sequences possible, representing two more numbers \(2\) and \(3\).</li>
  <li>In position \(i=2\), there are four available digits, providing eight three-digit sequences that can represent the numbers \(4\) through \(11\).</li>
</ul>

<p>If we let \(n_i\) denote the number of values that can be obtained by strings of exactly \(i\) digits, then we obtain a recurrence \(n_0=1\) (the zero-length strings represent only one value, zero) and \(n_i=n_{i-1}\sum_{j&lt;i}n_j\) (there are \(n_{i-1}\) choices for the string up to its last digit, and \(\sum_{j&lt;i}n_j\) choices for the last digit). This recurrence has the sequence of values <a href="http://oeis.org/A001697">1, 1, 2, 8, 96, 10368, 108615168, …</a> and its partial sums <a href="http://oeis.org/A001696">1, 2, 4, 12, 108, 10476, 108625644, …</a> give the total number of values that can be represented by strings of up to \(i\) digits.</p>

<p>The same idea can be represented graphically. Given a number represented by this recursive bijective numbering system, draw an ordered tree, where an \(i\)-digit number is represented by a tree whose root has \(i\) children, one for each digit, and where each digit is represented in the same way by a subtree. Conversely, if we have an ordered tree, we can think of it as representing a recursive bijective number, whose digits are computed recursively from the children of the root. In our recursive bijective numbers, we required that each digit be representable as a string of length at most its position; translating this requirement into tree terminology, each node that is the \(i\)th child of its parent (again starting with \(i=0\) on the right) must have degree at most \(i\).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Equivalence between recursive bijective numbering and tree enumeration" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/recursive-bijective.svg" width="60%"/></p>

<p>It follows that the sequences of numbers of representable values for \(i\)-digit strings and for \(\le i\)-digit strings, above, also give the numbers of ordered trees that obey this degree constraint, with root degree \(i\) or \(\le i\), respectively.</p>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">I’m about to leave for a family vacation—our first such since before the pandemic, one planned and paid for literally the day before the news of Omicron broke.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m about to leave for a family vacation—our first such since before the pandemic, one planned and paid for literally the day before the news of Omicron broke.  On the negative side, staring at the case-count graphs that are just now going vertical, I estimate a ~25% chance that at least one of us will get Omicron on this trip.  On the positive side, I estimate a ~60% chance that in the next 6 months, at least one of us would’ve gotten Omicron or some other variant even <em>without</em> this trip—so maybe it’s just as well if we get it now, when we’re vaxxed to the maxx and ready and school and university are out.</p>



<p>If, however, I <em>do</em> end this trip dead in an ICU, I wouldn’t want to do so without having clearly set out my values for posterity.  So with that in mind: in the comments of my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">previous post</a>, someone asked me why I identify as a liberal or a progressive, if I passionately support educational practices like tracking, ability grouping, acceleration, and (especially) <em>encouraging kids to learn advanced math whenever they’re ready for it</em>.  (Indeed, that might be my single stablest political view, having been held, for recognizably similar reasons, since I was about 5.)</p>



<p>Incidentally, that previous post was guest-written by my colleagues Edith Cohen and Boaz Barak, and linked to an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a> that now has almost 1500 signatories.  Our goal was, and is, to fight the imminent dumbing-down of precollege math education in the United States, spearheaded by the so-called “California Mathematics Framework.”  In our joint efforts, we’ve been careful with every word—making sure to maintain the assent of our entire list of signatories, to attract broad support, to stay narrowly focused on the issue at hand, and to bend over backwards to concede much as we could.  Perhaps because of those cautions, we—amazingly—got some actual traction, reaching people in government (such as Rep. Ro Khanna, D – Silicon Valley) and technology leaders, and forcing the “no one’s allowed to take Algebra in 8th grade” faction to respond to us.</p>



<p>This was disorienting to me.  On this blog, I’m used just to howling into the wind, having some agree, some disagree, some take to Twitter to denounce me, but in any case, having no effect of any kind on the real world.  </p>



<p>So let me return to howling into the wind.  And return to the question of what I “am” in ideology-space, which doesn’t have an obvious answer.</p>



<p>It’s like, what do you call someone who’s absolutely terrified about global warming, and who thinks the best response would’ve been (and actually, still is) a historic surge in nuclear energy, possibly with geoengineering to tide us over?</p>



<p>… who wants to end world hunger … and do it using GMO crops?</p>



<p>… who wants to smash systems of entrenched privilege in college admissions … and believes that the SAT and other standardized tests are the best tools ever invented for that purpose?</p>



<p>… who feels a personal distaste for free markets, for the triviality of what they so often elevate and the depth of what they let languish, but tolerates them because they’ve done more than anything else to lift up the world’s poor?</p>



<p>… who’s happiest when telling the truth for the cause of social justice … but who, if told to <em>lie</em> for the cause of social justice, will probably choose silence or even, if pushed hard enough, truth?</p>



<p>… who wants to legalize marijuana and psychedelics, and <em>also</em> legalize all the promising treatments currently languishing in FDA approval hell?</p>



<p>… who feels little attraction to the truth-claims of the world’s ancient religions, <em>except</em> insofar as they sometimes serve as prophylactics against newer and now even more virulent religions?</p>



<p>… who thinks the covid response of the CDC, FDA, and other authorities was a historic disgrace—not because it infringed on the personal liberties of antivaxxers or anything like that, but on the contrary, because it was weak, timid, bureaucratic, and slow, where it should’ve been like that of a general at war?</p>



<p>… who thinks the Nazi Holocaust was <em>even worse</em> than the mainstream holds it to be, because in addition to the staggering, one-lifetime-isn’t-enough-to-internalize-it human tragedy, the Holocaust <em>also</em> sent up into smoke whatever cultural process had just produced Einstein, von Neumann, Bohr, Szilard, Born, Meitner, Wigner, Haber, Pauli, Cantor, Hausdorff, Ulam, Tarski, Erdös, and Noether, and with it, one of the wellsprings of our technological civilization?</p>



<p>… who supports free speech, to the point of proudly tolerating views that <em>really, actually</em> disgust them at their workplace, university, or online forum?</p>



<p>… who believes in patriotism, the police, the rule of law, to the extent that they don’t understand why all the enablers of the January 6 insurrection, up to and including Trump, aren’t currently facing trial for treason against the United States?</p>



<p>… who’s (of course) disgusted to the core by Trump and everything he represents, but who’s <em>also</em> disgusted by the elite virtue-signalling hypocrisy that made the rise of a Trump-like backlash figure predictable?</p>



<p>… who not only supports abortion rights, but also looks forward to a near future when parents, if they choose, are free to use embryo selection to make their children happier, smarter, healthier, and free of life-crippling diseases (unless the “bioethicists” destroy that future, as a previous generation of Deep Thinkers destroyed our nuclear future)?</p>



<p>… who, when reading about the 1960s Sexual Revolution, instinctively sides with free-loving hippies and against the scolds … even if today’s scolds are themselves former hippies, or intellectual descendants thereof, who now clothe their denunciations of other people’s gross, creepy sexual desires in the garb of feminism and social justice?</p>



<p>What, finally, do you call someone whose image of an ideal world might include a young Black woman wearing a hijab, an old Orthodox man with black hat and sidecurls, a broad-shouldered white guy from the backwoods of Alabama, and a trans woman with purple hair, face tattoos and a nose ring … all of them standing in front of a blackboard and arguing about what would happen if Alice and Bob jumped into opposite ends of a wormhole?</p>



<p>Do you call such a person “liberal,” “progressive,” “center-left,” “centrist,” “Pinkerite,” “technocratic,” “neoliberal,” “libertarian-ish,” “classical liberal”?  Why not simply call them “correct”? <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p></div>
