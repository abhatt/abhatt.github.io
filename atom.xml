    <title>TR20-037 |  Failure of Feasible Disjunction Property for $k$-DNF Resolution and NP-hardness of Automating It | 

	Michal Garlik</title>
    <summary>We show that for every integer $k \geq 2$, the Res($k$) propositional proof system does not have the weak feasible disjunction property. Next, we generalize a recent result of Atserias and Müller [FOCS, 2019] to Res($k$). We show that if NP is not included in P (resp. QP, SUBEXP) then for every integer $k \geq 1$, Res($k$) is not automatable in polynomial (resp. quasi-polynomial, subexponential) time.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Greetings from the future! The progression of covid-19 in Italy is running about eight days ahead of France and Spain and about 16 days ahead of the United States. Here in Lombardy, which is about ten days ahead of NYC, we have been “sheltering at home” for 13 days already.</p>
<p>How is social distancing working out for me? I thought that I was well prepared for it, but it is still not easy. I have started to talk to the furniture, and apparently this is perfectly normal, at least as long as the furniture does not talk back. </p>
<p>As I have been telling my dining table, it has been very dismaying to read news from the US, where there seemed to be a very dangerous complacency. I am relieved to see that this is changing, especially at the state level, which makes me much more hopeful.</p>
<p>I have also found media coverage to be disappointing. Apparently, many highly educated people, including people whose job involves understanding policy issues, have no idea how numbers work (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ordODDzVso8">source</a>). This is a problem because a lot of issues concerning this epidemic have to do with numbers, which can be misleading if they are not reported in context.</p>
<p>For example, before the time when Trump decided that he had retroactively been concerned about a pandemic since January, conservative media emphasized the estimate of a 2% mortality rate, in a way that made it sound, well, 98% of people survive, and 98% is approximately 100%, so what is the big deal. For context, the Space Shuttle only exploded 1.5% of the times, and this was deemed <i>too dangerous for astronauts</i>. This is the kind of intuitive reference that I would like to see more of.</p>
<p>Even now, there is a valid debate on whether measures that will cost the economy trillions of dollars are justified. After all, it would be absurd to spend trillions of dollars to save, say, 10,000 lives, it would be questionable to do so to save 100,000 lives, and it would be undoubtedly right to do so to save millions of lives and a collapse of the health care system (especially considering that a collapse of the health care system might create its own financial panic that would also cost trillions of dollars).</p>
<p>So which one is it? Would doing nothing cost 10,000 American lives? A million? How long will people have to “shelter at home”? And what is next? I can recommend two well-researched articles: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-outcomes.html">this</a> on plausible scenarios and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-social-distancing-effect.html">this</a> on what’s next.</p>
<p>Kristof’s article cites an <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/">essay</a> by Stanford professor John Ioannidis who notes that it is within the realm of possibilities, given the available data, that the true mortality rate could be as low as 0.05%, that is, wait for it, lower than the mortality rate of the flu. Accordingly, in a plausible scenario, “If we had not known about a new virus out there, and had not checked individuals with PCR tests, the number of total deaths due to “influenza-like illness” would not seem unusual this year.”</p>
<p>Ioannidis’ essay was written without reference to data from Italy, which was probably not available in peer-reviewed form at the time of writing.</p>
<p>I would not want professor Ioannidis to tell me how to design graph algorithms, and I don’t mean to argue for the plausibility of the above scenario, but let me complement it with some data from Italy.</p>
<p>Lombardy is Italy’s richest and most developed region, and the second richest (in absolute and PPP GDP) administrative region in Europe after the Ile de France (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_regions_by_GDP">source</a>). It has a rather good health care system. In 2018, on average, 273 people died per day in Lombardy of all causes (<a href="https://ugeo.urbistat.com/AdminStat/it/it/demografia/popolazione/lombardia/3/2">source</a>). Yesterday, 381 people died in Lombardy with coronavirus (<a href="https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/tree/master/schede-riepilogative/regioni">source</a>). This is spread out over a region with more than 10 million residents.</p>
<p>Some areas are harder-hit hotspots. Three days ago, a Bergamo newspaper <a href="https://www.bergamonews.it/2020/03/17/coronavirus-a-bergamo-in-una-settimana-330-morti-14-volte-in-piu-rispetto-a-un-anno-fa/360586/">reported</a> that 330 people had died in the previous week of all causes in the city. In the same week of March in 2019, 23 people had died. That’s a 14x increase of mortality of all causes.</p>
<p>Bergamo’s hospital had 16 beds in its intensive care unit, in line with international standards (it is typical to have of the order of an ICU bed per 5000-10,000 people, and Bergamo has a population of 120,000). Right now there are 80 people in intensive care in Bergamo, a 5x increase in capacity that was possible by bringing in a lot of ventilators and moving other sick people to other hospitals. Nonetheless, there have been reports of shortages of ICU beds, and of people needing to intubated that could not be. There are also reports of people dying of pneumonia at home, without being tested.</p>
<p>Because of this surge in deaths, Bergamo’s funeral homes have not been able to keep up. It’s not that they have not been able to keep up with arranging funerals, because funerals are banned. They just do not have the capacity to perform the burials.</p>
<p>So coffins have been accumulating. A couple of days ago, a motorcade of army vehicles came to Bergamo to pick up 70 coffins and take them to other cities.</p>
<p/>
<p>It should be noted that this is happening after 20 days of “social distancing” measures and after 13 days of “sheltering at home” in Lombardy.</p>
<p>My point being, if we had not known that a news virus was going around, the number of excess deaths in Bergamo would have not been hidden by the random noise in the number of deaths due to influenza-like illness.</p></div>

</ul>
<h2 id="a-sneak-preview">A Sneak Preview</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline"><strong>A</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>A</strong><sub>2</sub></span> be square matrices and <span class="math inline"><strong>t</strong></span> a row vector such that</p>
<p><span class="math display"><strong>t</strong><strong>A</strong><sub>1</sub> = <em>x</em><sub>1</sub><strong>t</strong>, <strong>t</strong><strong>A</strong><sub>2</sub> = <em>x</em><sub>2</sub><strong>t</strong></span><br/>
Using high-school algebra lingo, we would refer to <span class="math inline"><strong>t</strong></span> as the eigenvector of <span class="math inline"><strong>A</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>A</strong><sub>2</sub></span>. It is easy to see that</p>
<p><span class="math display"><strong>t</strong> ⋅ (<strong>A</strong><sub>1</sub> + <strong>A</strong><sub>2</sub>) = (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>)<strong>t</strong>, <em>t</em> ⋅ <strong>A</strong><sub>1</sub><strong>A</strong><sub>2</sub> = <em>x</em><sub>1</sub><em>x</em><sub>2</sub><strong>t</strong></span><br/>
This extends readily to any polynomial <span class="math inline"><em>p</em>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)</span>, namely: if <span class="math inline"><strong>t</strong><strong>A</strong><sub><em>i</em></sub> = <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><strong>t</strong></span>, then</p>
<p><span class="math display"><strong>t</strong> ⋅ <em>f</em>(<strong>A</strong><sub>1</sub>, …, <strong>A</strong><sub><em>n</em></sub>) = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)<strong>t</strong></span><br/>
As in turns out, much of advanced lattice-based crypto boils down to a generalization of this statement! The generalization is along two orthogonal dimensions:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>arbitrary matrices <span class="math inline"><strong>A</strong><sub>1</sub>, …, <strong>A</strong><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> that may not share the same eigenvector <span class="math inline"><strong>t</strong></span>, and</li>
<li>a relaxation to “approximate” equality, namely <span class="math inline"><strong>t</strong><strong>A</strong><sub><em>i</em></sub> ≈ <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><strong>t</strong></span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The generalization underlies fully homomorphic encryption, homomorphic signatures, attribute-based encryption schemes and many more!</p>

    <title>Faster Divergence Maximization for Faster Maximum Flow</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1584662400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Liu:Yang_P=.html">Yang P. Liu</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sidford:Aaron.html">Aaron Sidford</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08929">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we provide an algorithm which given any $m$-edge $n$-vertex
directed graph with integer capacities at most $U$ computes a maximum $s$-$t$
flow for any vertices $s$ and $t$ in $m^{4/3+o(1)}U^{1/3}$ time. This improves
upon the previous best running times of $m^{11/8+o(1)}U^{1/4}$ (Liu Sidford
2019), $\tilde{O}(m \sqrt{n} \log U)$ (Lee Sidford 2014), and $O(mn)$ (Orlin
2013) when the graph is not too dense or has large capacities.
</p>
<p>To achieve the results this paper we build upon previous algorithmic
approaches to maximum flow based on interior point methods (IPMs). In
particular, we overcome a key bottleneck of previous IPMs applying to maxflow
(M\k{a}dry 2013, M\k{a}dry 2016, Cohen M\k{a}dry Sankowski Vladu 2017, Liu
Sidford 2019, Axiotis M\k{a}dry Vladu 2020), which make progress by maximizing
the energy of local $\ell_2$ norm minimizing electric flows. We generalize this
approach and instead maximize the divergence of flows which minimize the
Bregman divergence distance with respect to the weighted logarithmic barrier.
This allows our algorithm to depend on the $\ell_\infty$ norm as opposed to the
$\ell_4$ norm when bounding the amount of weight perturbation needed. Further,
we show that smoothed $\ell_2$-$\ell_p$ flows (Kyng, Peng, Sachdeva, Wang
2019), which we previously used to efficiently maximize energy (Liu Sidford
2019), can also be used to efficiently maximize divergence, thereby yielding
our desired runtimes. We believe both this generalized view of energy
maximization and generalized flow solvers we develop may be of further
interest.

    <title>Minimum Scan Cover with Angular Transition Costs</title>

motivated by questions in the context of satellite communication and
astrophysics. In the problem Minimum Scan Cover with Angular Costs (MSC), we
are given a graph $G$ that is embedded in Euclidean space. The edges of $G$
need to be scanned, i.e., probed from both of their vertices. In order to scan
their edge, two vertices need to face each other; changing the heading of a
vertex takes some time proportional to the corresponding turn angle. Our goal
is to minimize the time until all scans are completed, i.e., to compute a
schedule of minimum makespan.
</p>
<p>We show that MSC is closely related to both graph coloring and the minimum
(directed and undirected) cut cover problem; in particular, we show that the
minimum scan time for instances in 1D and 2D lies in $\Theta(\log \chi (G))$,
while for 3D the minimum scan time is not upper bounded by $\chi (G)$. We use
this relationship to prove that the existence of a constant-factor
approximation implies $P=NP$, even for one-dimensional instances. In 2D, we
show that it is NP-hard to approximate a minimum scan cover within less than a
factor of $\frac{3}{2}$, even for bipartite graphs; conversely, we present a
$\frac{9}{2}$-approximation algorithm for this scenario. Generally, we give an
$O(c)$-approximation for $k$-colored graphs with $k\leq \chi(G)^c$. For general
metric cost functions, we provide approximation algorithms whose performance
guarantee depend on the arboricity of the graph.

    <title>The Strahler number of a parity game</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1584662400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Daviaud:Laure.html">Laure Daviaud</a>, Marcin Jurdziński, K. S. Thejaswini <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08627">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The Strahler number of a rooted tree is the largest height of a perfect
binary tree that is its minor. The Strahler number of a parity game is proposed
to be defined as the smallest Strahler number of the tree of any of its
attractor decompositions. It is proved that parity games can be solved in
quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the number of vertices~$n$
and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $d$ is the number of priorities and $k$ is
the Strahler number. This complexity is quasi-polynomial because the Strahler
number is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. The proof is based on
a new construction of small Strahler-universal trees.
</p>
<p>It is shown that the Strahler number of a parity game is a robust parameter:
it coincides with its alternative version based on trees of progress measures
and with the register number defined by Lehtinen~(2018). It follows that parity
games can be solved in quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the
number of vertices and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $k$ is the register
number. This significantly improves the running times and space achieved for
parity games of bounded register number by Lehtinen (2018) and by Parys (2020).
</p>
<p>The running time of the algorithm based on small Strahler-universal trees
yields a novel trade-off $k \cdot \lg(d/k) = O(\log n)$ between the two natural
parameters that measure the structural complexity of a parity game, which
allows solving parity games in polynomial time. This includes as special cases
the asymptotic settings of those parameters covered by the results of Calude,
Jain Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan (2017), of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (2017),
and of Lehtinen (2018), and it significantly extends the range of such
settings, for example to $d = 2^{O\left(\sqrt{\lg n}\right)}$ and $k =
O\!\left(\sqrt{\lg n}\right)$.

vision and interactive computer graphics, with many real-world applications.
This paper investigates the novel problem of generating 3D shape point cloud
geometry from a symbolic part tree representation. In order to learn such a
conditional shape generation procedure in an end-to-end fashion, we propose a
conditional GAN "part tree"-to-"point cloud" model (PT2PC) that disentangles
the structural and geometric factors. The proposed model incorporates the part
tree condition into the architecture design by passing messages top-down and
bottom-up along the part tree hierarchy. Experimental results and user study
demonstrate the strengths of our method in generating perceptually plausible
and diverse 3D point clouds, given the part tree condition. We also propose a
novel structural measure for evaluating if the generated shape point clouds
satisfy the part tree conditions.

    <title>Fan-Crossing Free Graphs</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Brandenburg:Franz_J=.html">Franz J. Brandenburg</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08468">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A graph is fan-crossing free if it admits a drawing in the plane so that each
edge can be crossed by independent edges. Then the crossing edges have distinct
vertices. In complement, a graph is fan-crossing if each edge can be crossed by
edges of a fan. Then the crossing edges are incident to a common vertex. Graphs
are k-planar if each edge is crossed by at most k edges, and k-gap-planar if
each crossing is assigned to an edge involved in the crossing, so that at most
k crossings are assigned to each edge. We use the s-subdivision, path-addition,
and node-to-circle expansion operations to show that there are fan-crossing
free graphs that are not fan-crossing, k-planar, and k-gap-planar for k &gt;= 1,
respectively. A path-addition adds a long path between any two vertices to a
graph. An s-subdivision replaces an edge by a path of length s, and a
node-to-circle expansion substitutes a vertex by a 3-regular circle, so that
each vertex of the circle inherits an edge incident to the original vertex. We
introduce universality for an operation and a graph class, so the every graph
has an image in the graph class. In particular, we show the fan22 crossing free
graphs are universal for 2-subdivision and for node-to-circle 3 expansion.
Finally, we show that some graphs have a unique fan-crossing free embedding,
that there are maximal fan-crossing free graphs with less edges than the
density, and that the recognition problem for fan-crossing free graphs is
NP-complete.

    <title>Convex Hulls of Random Order Types</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1584662400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Goaoc:Xavier.html">Xavier Goaoc</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Welzl:Emo.html">Emo Welzl</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08456">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We establish the following two main results on order types of points in
general position in the plane (realizable simple planar order types, realizable
uniform acyclic oriented matroids of rank~$3$):
</p>
<p>- The number of extreme points in an $n$-point order type, chosen uniformly
at random from all such order types, is on average $4+o(1)$. For labeled order
types, this number has average $4-\frac{8}{n^2-n+2}$ and variance at most $3$.
</p>
<p>- The (labeled) order types read off a set of $n$ points sampled
independently from the uniform measure on a convex planar domain, smooth or
polygonal, or from a Gaussian distribution are concentrated, i.e. such sampling
typically encounters only a vanishingly small fraction of all order types of
the given size.
</p>
<p>Result~(a) generalizes to arbitrary dimension $d$ for labeled order types
with the average number of extreme points $2d+o(1)$ and constant variance. We
also discuss to what extent our methods generalize to the abstract setting of
uniform acyclic oriented matroids. Moreover, our methods allow to show the
following relative of the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem: for any fixed $k$, as $n
\to \infty$, a proportion $1 - O(1/n)$ of the $n$-point simple order types
contain a triangle enclosing a convex $k$-chain over an edge.
</p>
<p>For the unlabeled case in (a), we prove that for any antipodal, finite subset
of the $2$-dimensional sphere, the group of orientation preserving bijections
is cyclic, dihedral or one of $A_4$, $S_4$ or $A_5$ (and each case is
possible). These are the finite subgroups of $SO(3)$ and our proof follows the
lines of their characterization by Felix Klein.

<p>In light of the very unusual developments in the world due to the spread of Covid-19 and the disruption it is causing to many people in our field, especially those with young children at home, the FOCS PC has decided to push back the final deadline for papers by six days. We would have liked to do more, but we still are trying to stick to our timeline for notification since that date is coordinated with other deadlines in the theory community. In addition, some members of the committee are also affected by this crisis and there is concern that we may not be able to do our job as a committee in a shorter time frame. Pre-registration (including titles and abstracts) is still required by the original deadline. Here are the new dates:</p>



<p><strong>Pre-registration (including titles and abstracts):</strong> Thursday <strong>April 9</strong>, 11:59 PM (EDT)</p>



<p><strong>Final Paper Submission:</strong> Wednesday <strong>April 15</strong>, 11:59 PM (EDT)</p>



<p>Conference url: <a href="https://focs2020.cs.duke.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://focs2020.cs.duke.edu/</a></p>



<p>We hope you all stay healthy!</p>

    <title>What to do while stuck at home Part I</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First of all both the <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/">Turing award</a> and <a href="https://www.abelprize.no/seksjon/vis.html?tid=76020">Abel Prize</a> announced yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
As we start moving from the panic phase of the coronavirus to the boring phase, what kinds of things should you do or not do while stuck at home for the next two weeks to eighteen months.<br/>
<br/>
First of all still do your job. Teach your online classes. Try to do some research. Meet with your colleagues/students/advisor virtually (best with Zoom or something similar). Submit to conferences. What else? Use the situation for your advantage.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Attend virtual conferences: </b>Really attend. Pretend that you flew there and devote the entire day to going to virtual talks or chatting with other attendees in virtual hallways. I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/03/the-importance-of-networking.html">said it wouldn't happen this way</a> last week so prove me wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Create a Virtual Workshop: </b>Because you can. Invite people to give online talks. Open it up for all to listen. Find ways to discuss together.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Connect: </b>Make a virtual get-together with an old colleague or someone you've always wanted to meet. Researchers around the world will be holed up and happy to get some interactions.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Learn Something New: </b>Read a textbook. Take an online course in CS or something completely different. There are plenty.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Help Others Learn: </b>Start that book you've always wanted to write. Or just write a short survey article giving your view of a slice of the theory world. Create some videos or a podcast to explain stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Pick up a hobby: </b>Something outside computer science just to keep your sanity.<br/>
<b><br/></b>
<b>Watch some fun computer-related movies: </b>Her, Sneakers, The Computer wore Tennis Shoes, 2001, The Imitation Game, Hidden Figures, Colossus: The Forbin Project, Ex Machina. Add your own favorites in the comments.<br/>
<br/>
And on the other hand don't<br/>
<br/>
<b>Become an epidemiologist: </b>As a computer scientist you are an expert in networks, graph theory and exponential growth so you can create models that show we are grossly under preparing and/or overreacting to the virus and want to tell the world how you are right and the so-called "experts" are wrong. Please don't.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Prove P ≠ NP</b>: Trying to settle P v NP and failing is instructive. Trying to settle P v NP and thinking you succeeded is delusional.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Freak Out: </b>We will get past this virus and the world will recover.<br/>
<br/>
Bill will follow up with his own ideas in part II next week.</div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: It is now common practice to try and solve machine learning problems by starting with a complex existing model or architecture, and fine-tuning/adapting it to the task at hand. However, outliers, errors or even just sloppiness in training data often lead to drastic drops in performance. </p>



<p>We investigate a simple generic approach to correct for this, motivated by a classic statistical idea: trimmed loss. This advocates jointly (a) selecting which training samples to ignore, and (b) fitting a model on the remaining samples. As such this is computationally infeasible even for linear regression. We propose and study the natural iterative variant that alternates between these two steps (a) and (b) – each of which individually can be easily accomplished in pretty much any statistical setting. We also study the batch-SGD variant of this idea. We demonstrate both theoretically (for generalized linear models) and empirically (for vision and NLP neural network models) that this effectively recovers accuracy in the presence of bad training data.</p>



<p>This work is joint with Yanyao Shen and Vatsal Shah and appears in NeurIPS 2019, ICML 2019 and AISTATS 2020.</p>

    <title>Private and Secure Distributed Matrix Multiplication</title>
    <summary>Machine learning on big data sets takes a significant amount of computational power, so it is often necessary to offload some of the work to external distributed systems, such as an Amazon EC2 cluster. It is useful to be able to utilize external resources for computation tasks while keeping the actual data private and secure. In particular, matrix multiplication is an essential step in many machine learning processes, but the owner of the matrices may have reasons to keep the actual values protected. In this post, we’ll discuss four works about secure distributed computation. First, we’ll talk about a method of using MDS (maximum distance separable) error correcting codes to add security and privacy to general data storage (“Cross Subspace Alignment and the Asymptotic Capacity of X-Secure T-Private Information Retrieval” by Jia, Sun, Jafar).

<p>In this post, we’ll discuss four works about secure distributed computation. First, we’ll talk about a method of using MDS (maximum distance separable) error correcting codes to add security and privacy to general data storage (“<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07457.pdf">Cross Subspace Alignment and the Asymptotic Capacity of X-Secure T-Private Information Retrieval”</a> by Jia, Sun, Jafar). </p>

<p>Throughout this post we will use variations on the following communication model:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1572" height="192" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/blog_fig1.png?w=1024" width="404"/></figure>



<p>The data in the grey box is only given to the master, so workers only have access to what they receive (via green arrows). Later on we will also suppose the workers have a shared library not available to the master. The workers do not communicate with each other as part of the computation, but we want to prevent them from figuring out anything about the data if they do talk to each other.</p>



<p> This model is related to <em>private computation</em> but not exactly the same. We assume the servers are “honest but curious”, meaning they won’t introduce malicious computations. We also only require the master to receive the final result, and don’t need to protect any data from the master. This is close to the BGW scheme ([Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Wigderson ’88]), but we do not allow workers to communicate with each other as part of the computation of the result.</p>



<p> We consider <em>unconditional</em> or <em>information-theoretic</em> security, meaning the data is protected even if the workers have unbounded computational power. Furthermore, we will consider having <em>perfect  secrecy</em>, in which the mutual information between the information revealed to the workers and the actual messages is zero.</p>



<h2>X-Secure T-Private Information Retrieval</h2>



<p> Before we get into matrix-matrix multiplication, consider the problem of storing information on the workers to be retrieved by the master, such that it is “protected.” What do we mean by that? [Jia, Sun, and Jafar ’19] define X-secure T-private information retrieval as follows: </p>

<p>Given these constraints, Jia et al. give bounds on the capacity of the system. Capacity is the maximum rate achievable, where rate is defined as bits requested by the worker (<img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="L"/>, the length of a single message) divided by the number of bits downloaded by the worker. The bounds are in terms of the capacity of T-Private Information Retrieval, (which is the same as the above definition, with only requirement 2).</p>

<p>Jia et al. give schemes that achieve these bounds while preserving the privacy and security constraints by introducing random noise vectors into how data is stored and queries are constructed. The general scheme for <img alt="N&gt;X+T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3EX%2BT&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N&gt;X+T"/> uses <em>cross subspace alignment</em>, which essentially chooses how to construct the stored information and the queries such that the added noise mostly “cancels out” when the master combines all the response from the servers. The scheme for <img alt="N\leq X+T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Cleq+X%2BT&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N\leq X+T"/> is straightforward to explain, and demonstrates the idea of using error correcting codes that treat the random values as the message and the actual data as the “noise.”</p>



<p>For this scheme, the message length <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="L"/> is set to <img alt="N-X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N-X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N-X"/> (the number of nodes <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>, minus the maximum number of colluding servers <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X"/>).

<h2>Matrix Multiplication with Polynomial Codes</h2>



<p>We now move on to the task of matrix-matrix multiplication. The methods for secure and private distributed matrix multiplication we will discuss shortly are based on <em>polynomial codes</em>, used by [Yu, Maddah-Ali, Avestimehr ’17] for doing distributed matrix multiplications robust to stragglers. Suppose the master has matrices <img alt="{\bf{A}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{m\times n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BA%7D%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_q%5E%7Bm%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{A}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{m\times n}"/> and <img alt="{\bf{B}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BB%7D%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_q%5E%7Bn+%5Ctimes+p%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{B}} \in \mathbb{F}_q^{n \times p}"/> for some finite field <img alt="\mathbb{F}_q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{F}_q"/>, and <img alt="m,n,p \in \mathbb{Z}^+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%2Cn%2Cp+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5E%2B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="m,n,p \in \mathbb{Z}^+"/>. Assume <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="m"/> and <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> are divisible by <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>, so we can represent the matrices divided into <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> submatrices: </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="{\bf{A}}= \begin{bmatrix}A_1\\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ A_m\end{bmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BA%7D%7D%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7DA_1%5C%5C+A_2+%5C%5C+%5Cvdots+%5C%5C+A_m%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{A}}= \begin{bmatrix}A_1\\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ A_m\end{bmatrix}"/>               and        <img alt="{\bf{B}}= \begin{bmatrix}B_1&amp; B_2 &amp; \dots &amp;B_n\end{bmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BB%7D%7D%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7DB_1%26+B_2+%26+%5Cdots+%26B_n%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{B}}= \begin{bmatrix}B_1&amp; B_2 &amp; \dots &amp;B_n\end{bmatrix}"/> </p>



<p>So to recover <img alt="\bf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{AB}"/>, the master needs each entry of: </p>



<p><img alt="{\bf{AB}} = \begin{bmatrix}A_1B_1 &amp; A_1B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_1B_n\\A_2B_1 &amp; A_2B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_2 B_n\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots\\A_mB_1 &amp;A_mB_2 &amp; \dots&#xA0; &amp; A_mB_n \end{bmatrix}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BAB%7D%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7DA_1B_1+%26+A_1B_2+%26+%5Cdots+%26+A_1B_n%5C%5CA_2B_1+%26+A_2B_2+%26+%5Cdots+%26+A_2+B_n%5C%5C%5Cvdots+%26+%5Cvdots+%26%5Cvdots+%26%5Cvdots%5C%5CA_mB_1+%26A_mB_2+%26+%5Cdots%C2%A0+%26+A_mB_n+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{AB}} = \begin{bmatrix}A_1B_1 &amp; A_1B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_1B_n\\A_2B_1 &amp; A_2B_2 &amp; \dots &amp; A_2 B_n\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots\\A_mB_1 &amp;A_mB_2 &amp; \dots&#xA0; &amp; A_mB_n \end{bmatrix}."/></p>



<p>The key idea of polynomial codes is to encode <img alt="A_1,...,A_m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1%2C...%2CA_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A_1,...,A_m"/> and <img alt="B_1,...,B_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_1%2C...%2CB_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B_1,...,B_n"/> in polynomials <img alt="\tilde{A}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}_i"/> and <img alt="\tilde{B}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{B}_i"/> to be sent to the <img alt="i^{th}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%5E%7Bth%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i^{th}"/> worker,  where they are multiplied and the result is returned. The goal of Yu et al. was to create robustness to stragglers, and so they add redundancy in this process so that not all workers need to return a result for the master to be able to determine <img alt="\bf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{AB}"/>. In particular, only <img alt="mn" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=mn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="mn"/> returned values are needed, so <img alt="N-mn" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N-mn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N-mn"/> servers can be slow or fail completely without hurting the computation. This method can be thought of as setting up the encodings of <img alt="\bf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{A}"/> and <img alt="\bf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bf{B}"/> so that the resulting multiplications <img alt="\tilde{C}_1=\tilde{A}_1\tilde{B}_1,...,\tilde{C}_N=\tilde{A}_N\tilde{B}_N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BC%7D_1%3D%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_1%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_1%2C...%2C%5Ctilde%7BC%7D_N%3D%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_N%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{C}_1=\tilde{A}_1\tilde{B}_1,...,\tilde{C}_N=\tilde{A}_N\tilde{B}_N"/> are evaluations of a polynomial with coefficients  <img alt="A_1B_1,A_1B_2,...,A_2B_1....,A_mB_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1B_1%2CA_1B_2%2C...%2CA_2B_1....%2CA_mB_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A_1B_1,A_1B_2,...,A_2B_1....,A_mB_n"/> at <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> different points — equivalent to a Reed-Solomon code. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1603" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/blog_fig7.png?w=1024"/></figure>



<p>This idea is adapted by [Chang, Tandon ’18] to protect the data from colluding servers: noise is incorporated into the encodings such that the number of encoded matrices required to determine anything about the data is greater than the security threshold <img alt="X &lt; N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3C+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X &lt; N"/>. Since the master receives all <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> responses it is able to decode the result of <img alt="\textbf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{AB}"/>, but no set of <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="X"/> nodes can decode <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/>, <img alt="\textbf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{B}"/>, or <img alt="\textbf{AB}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{AB}"/>. Similarly, [Kim, Yang, Li ’19] adapts this idea to impose privacy on a matrix-matrix multiplication: workers are assumed to have a shared library <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_i%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M"/>, and the user would like to multiply <img alt="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D%7D%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_{D}"/> for some <img alt="D \in[1:M]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+%5Cin%5B1%3AM%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="D \in[1:M]"/> without revealing the value of <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="D"/> to the workers. The workers encode the entire library such that when the  encoding is multiplied by an encoded input <img alt="\tilde{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}"/> from the master, the result is useful to the master in decoding <img alt="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D%7D%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\textbf{A}}{\textbf{B}}_D"/>.</p>



<p>Chang and Tandon consider the following two privacy models, where up to <img alt="\ell" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\ell"/> servers may collude. The master also has <img alt="K^{(A)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%5E%7B%28A%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="K^{(A)}"/> (and in the second model, <img alt="K^{(B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%5E%7B%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="K^{(B)}"/>), which are matrices of random values with the same dimensions as <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> (and <img alt="\textbf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{B}"/>). These are used in creating the encodings <img alt="\tilde{A}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}_i"/> (and <img alt="\tilde{B}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{B}_i"/>).</p>



<p> <img alt="\textbf{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{B}"/> is public, <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> is private:</p>

<p>Both private:</p>

<p>Kim, Yang, and Lee take a similar approach of applying the method of polynomial code to <em>private</em> matrix multiplication. As before, there are <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> workers, but now the master wants to multiply <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> with some <img alt="{\textbf{B}}_D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\textbf{B}}_D"/> in shared library <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D_i%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}_i\}_{i=1}^M"/> (all the workers have the shared library). </p>



<p>Since the master isn’t itself encoding <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M"/> it has to tell the workers how to encode the library so that it can reconstruct the desired product. This is done by having the master tell the workers what values of <img alt="\vec{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\vec{y}"/> they should use to evaluate the polynomial that corresponds to encoding each library matrix. We denote the encoding of the library done by each worker <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> as the multivariate polynomial <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="h"/> which is evaluated at <img alt="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%7B%5Ctextbf%7BB%7D%7D%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EM&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{{\textbf{B}}\}_{i=1}^M"/> and the node-specific vector <img alt="y^{(i)}_{[1:M]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E%7B%28i%29%7D_%7B%5B1%3AM%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="y^{(i)}_{[1:M]}"/> to get the node’s encoding, <img alt="\tilde{B}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BB%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{B}_i"/>. The worker multiplies this with the encoding of <img alt="\textbf{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\textbf{A}"/> it receives, <img alt="\tilde{A}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BA%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{A}_i"/> and returns the resulting value <img alt="Z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="Z_i"/>. All together, we get the following communication model: </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As we’ve seen, coding techniques originally designed to add redundancy and protect against data loss can also be used to intentionally incorporate noise for data protection. In particular, this can be done when out-sourcing matrix multiplications, making it a useful technique in many data processing and machine learning applications.</p>

Specifically, assuming exponential lower bounds against randomized single-valued nondeterministic (SVN) circuits, we convert any randomized algorithm over inputs of length n running in time <img alt="t\geq n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5Cgeq+n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="t\geq n"/> to a deterministic one running in time <img alt="t^{2+\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5E%7B2%2B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="t^{2+\alpha}"/> for an arbitrarily small constant <img alt="\alpha &gt; 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%3E+0&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\alpha &gt; 0"/>. Such a slowdown is nearly optimal, as, under complexity-theoretic assumptions, there are problems with an inherent quadratic derandomization slowdown. We also convert any randomized algorithm that errs rarely into a deterministic algorithm having a similar running time (with pre-processing). The latter derandomization result holds under weaker assumptions, of exponential lower bounds against deterministic SVN circuits. Our results follow from a new, nearly optimal, explicit pseudorandom generator. The construction uses, among other ideas, a new connection between pseudoentropy generators and locally list recoverable codes.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>So far, I confess, this pandemic is not shaping up for me like for Isaac Newton.  It’s not just that I haven’t invented calculus or mechanics: I feel little motivation to think about research at all.  Or to catch up on classic literature or films … or even to shower, shave, or brush my teeth.  I’m quarantined in the house with my wife, our two kids, and my parents, so certainly there’s been plenty of family time, although my 7-year-daughter would inexplicably rather play fashion games on her iPad than get personalized math lessons from the author of <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>.</p>



<p>Mostly, it seems, I’ve been spending the time sleeping.  Or curled up in bed, phone to face, transfixed by the disaster movie that’s the world’s new reality.  Have you ever had one of those nightmares where you know the catastrophe is approaching—whether that means a missed flight, a botched presentation at your old high school, or (perhaps) more people dying than in any event since WWII—but you don’t know exactly when, and you can do nothing to avert it?  Yeah, that feeling is what I now close my eyes to <em>escape</em>.  And then I wake up, and I’m back in bizarro-nightmare-land, where the US is in no rush whatsoever to test people or to build ventilators or hospitals to cope with the coming deluge, and where ideas that could save millions have no chance against rotting institutions.</p>



<p>If nothing else, I guess we now have a decisive answer to the question of why humanity can’t get its act together on climate change.  Namely, if we can’t wrap our heads around a catastrophe that explodes exponentially over <strong>a few weeks</strong>—if those who denied or minimized it face no consequences even when they’re dramatically refuted before everyone’s eyes—then what chance could we possibly have against a catastrophe that takes a century?  (Note that I reject the view that the virus was sent by some guardian angel as the only possible <em>solution</em> to climate change, one crisis cancelling another one.  For one thing, I expect emissions to roar back as soon as this new Black Death is over; for another, the virus punishes public transportation but not cars.)</p>



<p>Anyway, I realized I needed something, not necessarily to take my mind off the crisis, but to break me out of an unproductive spiral.  Also, what better time than the present for things that I wouldn’t normally have time for?  So, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?cat=34">continuing a tradition</a> from 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018, we’re going to do an Ask Me Anything session.  Questions directly or tangentially related to the crisis (continuing the discussion from the previous thread) are okay, questions <em>totally unrelated</em> to the crisis are even okayer, goofball questions are great, and questions that I can involve my two kids in answering are greatest of all.  Here are this year’s ground rules:</p>



<ul><li>24 hours or until I get bored</li><li>One question per person total</li><li><strong>Absolutely no</strong> multi-part questions</li><li>Self-contained questions only—nothing that requires me to read a paper, watch a video, etc.</li><li>Scan the previous AMAs to see if your question is already there</li><li>Any sufficiently patronizing, hostile, or annoying questions might be left in the moderation queue, 100% at my discretion</li></ul>



<p>So ask away!  And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M">always look on the bright side of life</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Update (March 19): No more questions, please.</strong>  Thanks, everyone!  It will take me a few days just to work through all the great questions that are already in the queue. </p></div>

<p>Barak Weiss <a href="https://youtu.be/s_WRRVSM8ts">lectured about his breakthrough results</a> with Or Ordentlich, and Oded Regev, at a Simons Institute workshop: <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/lattices-2020-1">Lattices: Geometry, Algorithms and Hardness.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/rogers.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19530" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/rogers.jpg?w=640"/></a></p>
<p>It is a famous problem what is the densest (or, most efficient) packing of unit balls in Euclidean n-dimensional spaces and, of course, you can ask the same questions for other convex bodies. A sort of a dual problem, also famous, is the question of the most efficient covering the n-dimensional Euclidean space by balls or by translates of other convex bodies.</p>
<p>A very basic insight is that covering is much more efficient than packing. Can you explain the reason for that? The only thing that came up to my mind was that convex sets are roundish from the outside but not from the inside which makes it easier to cover with them.</p>
<p>But how efficiently can we cover the n-dimensional Euclidean space with translates of a convex body $K$?</p>
<p>C.A. Rogers with coauthors had some very fundamental results regarding covering (and packing) in the 50s and 60s. Or Ordentlich, Oded Regev and Barak Weiss have made a terrific improvement for one of the main questions in this area. They showed that for every convex set <em>K,</em> you can find a lattice <em>L </em> of determinant 1, and <em>r&gt;0</em>  such that <img alt="rK+L = \mathbb R^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=rK%2BL+%3D+%5Cmathbb+R%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="rK+L = \mathbb R^n"/> and</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="{\rm vol} (rK) \le cn^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crm+vol%7D+%28rK%29+%5Cle+cn%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="{\rm vol} (rK) \le cn^2"/>.</p>
<p>The best earlier upper bound was <img alt="n^{\log \log n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B%5Clog+%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{\log \log n}"/>.</p>
<p>One surprising aspect of the proof is the use of finite field Kakeya-type questions. Since the<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2336"> breakthrough</a> by <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/03/24/dvirs-proof-of-the-finite-field-kakeya-conjecture/">Zeev Dvir</a>, many people had hopes for applications from the finite fields results to the Euclidean setting (in particular, to the Euclidean Kakeya problem itself) and it is rare to see such applications. The proof here relies on results by  Dvir, Kopparty, Saraf, Sudan, and Lev. The Ordentlich-Regev-Weiss paper is not yet on the arXiv but the lecture gives a good picture about the results and the proofs.</p>

<p>For those of you confined at home, it may be hard to remain connected with the TCS community or stay up-to-date with the current research, as in-person seminars and conferences are cancelled. In case this may help, we have decided to <strong>increase for now the frequency of our online seminars</strong>, to try and mitigate this aspect. This won’t restore normalcy, but every little thing counts.</p>
<p>Here is our current, now <strong>weekly</strong> schedule: we may add more talks to it in the days to come, so keep an eye on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">our calendar</a> and don’t hesitate to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest talks and results</a> you are curious about.</p>
<ul>
<li>03/25: <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana Moshkovitz</a> (UT Austin) on <em>“Nearly Optimal Pseudorandomness From Hardness”</em></li>
<li>04/01: <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~venkatg/">Venkat Guruswami</a> (CMU) on <em>“Arıkan meets Shannon: Polar codes with near-optimal convergence to channel capacity”</em></li>
<li>04/08: Rahul Ilango (MIT) on <em>“NP-Hardness of Circuit Minimization for Multi-Output Functions”</em></li>
<li>04/15: <span class="JtukPc"><span id="rAECCd"><a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rvan/">Ramon van Handel</a> (Princeton) </span></span>on <em>“Rademacher type and Enflo type coincide”</em></li>

<li>04/29: <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~mahabadi/">Sepideh Mahabadi</a> (TTIC) on<em> “Non-Adaptive Adaptive Sampling on Turnstile Streams”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We emphasize that <strong>you can</strong> (and <em>should</em>) <strong>join as individuals</strong>, from home: if you are interested in a talk, ask for a spot for yourself, no need to go to your institution. We have the live audience capacity for this to work, so don’t hesitate!</p>
<p>We will post individual announcements several days before each talk, including the abstracts and how to ask for a spot, as usual; and the talks will of course be available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TCSplusSeminars/">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/past-talks">our website</a> afterwards if you couldn’t make it to the live, interactive one. Crucially, <strong>we would like your feedback</strong>: not only talk suggestions as pointed out before, but also any idea or suggestion you may have of things we could do or implement, or of content you would like to see. You can send us feedback by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/credits">emailing any of our organizers</a>, or leaving a comment below.</p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>
<p>The TCS+ team</p>

<p>
Neil L. is a Leprechaun. He has visited me once every year since I started GLL. I had never seen a leprechaun before I began the blog—there must be some connection.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I want to share the experiences we had with him on this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>
I thought because of the pandemic that he might not come. I thought that since New York City is on virtual lock-down he might not come. So I decided not to wait up for his visit, which always occurs in the wee hours of the morning. I looked it up: Wee hours is between 1am and 4am. We—that is Kathryn and I not wee—went to bed before midnight.</p>
<p>
Something woke me up at 3am. Not any noise but a bright green light. It was coming from my laptop, which was on the dresser but closed and switched off. I took it out of the bedroom and opened the lid and there he was.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Top o’ the morning to ye. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p/><h2> Neil Says Hi </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The first thing I noticed was: no pipe. There was no puff of smoke in my living room. Neil smokes a special brand of tobacco—green of course—that I would recognize in an instant. Otherwise he looked as usual: green coat and hat, brown vest and shoes, red beard. I could see all of him.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<em>“Glad as always to see you Neil. But why no pipe?”</em></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Neil started his usual pipe-puffing gesture but stopped his hand from touching his face.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">‘Tis virus not microbe. Smoke nae gan do good. All of us doing without. Least of our troubles. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Wow—that was hard for me to fathom. I thought of the travel bans. <em>“Are you all having to stay home?”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Aye. We obey the bans. Crown or Republic, nae matter. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I had to wrap my mind around this—leprechauns too? <em>“The virus applies to you?”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Sadly, we can carry it. Were it not, we could help folks point-to-point. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I realized: leprechauns can go anywhere instantly. The planar aspects of simulations like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">this</a> do not apply to them. Neil read my mind—at least he could do <em>that</em> remotely:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Aye. I noted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109232">all</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109234">your</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109244">comment</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109268">thread</a> about expander graphs and spreading the disease.

</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Of course <em>our</em> main trouble and concern is the danger of the virus—our being able to care for those who catch it and measures to ensure many do not catch it. I realize leprechauns, being immortal, have fewer worries there—and I did not ask Neil if they can get sick. So I thought of all the canceled St. Patrick’s Day parades, bars closing, no public merriment, sporting events gone too. But Neil’s next word went straight to the heart.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Boredom. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Boredom and Randomness </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I thought about fun things Neil had recounted in the past: tricks with <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/03/17/happy-st-patricks-day-2014/">math</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/happy-st-patricks-day-2/">codes</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/16/leprechauns-go-universal/">logic</a>, tricks on <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/leprechauns-will-find-you/">people</a>, even tricks during <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/leprechauns-are-multiplying/">March</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/03/17/leprechauns-know-what-it-feels/">Madness</a>. The NCAA tournament got completely canceled, unpostponable. Neil read my mind again and picked up on the topic of sporting events.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Consider me neighbor Bertie. He had his accommodations booked on the wee island in the pond of the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass. For last weekend during the Players Championship. That’s why they built the island, ye know.  </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
But of course, the Players was canceled. Even the Masters has been postponed. Neil continued,</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">He and his fellows’ best craic was playing with the balls goon o’er the water. Not in a nasty way. Ye know by the <b>Rule of Indistinguishability</b> we canna do them bad. Not allowed to make them play worse than other tough holes so ye could tell it is more than the usual hobgoblins in your head and butterflies in your chest. What we do must have the same expectation and other moments as random variation. But random is measure-1 so it is easy to comply. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
Of course. We have written about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/a-world-without-randomness/">feigned</a> randomness, and we haven’t yet had time to write a post this year on scientists <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/03/essays-elsewhere.html">taking</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism">superdeterminism</a> <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-path-we-didnt-take.html">seriously</a>—<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/02/guest-post-undecidability.html">even</a> <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/02/guest-post-undecidability_10.html">computationally</a>. How could we <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.0286.pdf">tell</a> that stuff apart from leprechauns? But thinking of Bertie gave me a more obvious question:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<em>“Neil, can’t Bertie and his pals do that remotely? Like lots of other things we’re doing now.”</em></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Neil’s answer exposed my lack of basic leprechaun knowledge.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">In every story of leprechaun tricks, who is present? The leprechaun. He cannot be remote—and he must run the risk of being catched. He can dance, run to the end of the rainbow, and disappear, but fun happens only when he is around. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Hearing this, I would have puffed my own pipe, if I smoked and had one. Neil continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Besides, remotely we cannot control well enough to abide the Rule of Indistinguishability. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
All this about randomness and conspiracy physics, with the world already weighing heavily, was too much. I winked out on the couch, without closing my laptop or seeing if Neil said goodbye with his usual flourish. </p>
<p>
I woke up in late morning and called Ken. As I told this part, Ken was instantly alarmed and horrified.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<em>“We must get Neil back. Is he still on your laptop?”</em> </p>
<p/><p><br/>
He was not. Ken plugged in and opened his own laptop—Neil has in the past visited him too—but nothing. He could not find any leprechauns registered on Skype or Zoom or Hangouts. Then Ken had a thought: “See if your laptop has the IP records.”</p>
<p>
It did. I could not tell what they signified, but my old IT contact at Tech said he could pinpoint the origin in minutes. Meanwhile, Ken calmed down enough to explain. I’ll let him write the rest of the story.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The One Uncanceled Competition </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What is apparently the lone major sporting competition in the world not to be canceled began today. It is chess—the Candidates Tournament to determine who will face Magnus Carlsen in the next world championship match. It is taking place in Yekaterinburg, Russia—in Siberia, still far from the worst virus activity. It has only the 8 players plus officials onsite—no spectators, press limited—and they are all subject to daily screenings. The players shake hands only <a href="https://worldchess.com/news/players-replicas-to-pose-for-photos-while-real-players-avoid-being-in-public">virtually</a>.</p>
<p>
Controversy about its starting continued today with one former World Champion, Vladimir Kramnik, stepping down from a broadcast commentary team “considering the nowadays disastrous humanitarian situation in the world.” But I’m with those saying that its value as a diversion—something to follow live in community—outweighs the concerns. I said this after some reflection on risks from our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/">post</a> and before being contacted about monitoring the tournament. One Chinese <a href="http://tiyutai.qingk.cn/comprehensivelive-info/sfbsrbdcpawqsxrbxrrvvudpcsvxpwfw/6fabf42212b308041e861a2005d12572/6b1607c0df6745e7b59e54f8a87a6309?from=singlemessage&amp;isappinstalled=0&amp;fbclid=IwAR06QhidyVdArI_RPSjTBWo2iUDVSbrJRkRvkPppohNtWT2J3AMRQxRD8Vk">broadcast</a> had over <a href="https://twitter.com/FIDE_chess/status/1239946569404817408">1 million</a> viewers today. Other broadcasts can be found on the official <a href="https://en.candidates-2020.com/main">site</a> and <a href="https://www.chess.com/tv">several</a> <a href="https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/fide-candidates-2020/1/1/1">other</a> <a href="https://new.uschess.org/news/2020-candidates-couch-potatoes/">places</a>. Today’s first round was vigorous, with all four games going beyond the turn-40 time control and two decisive.</p>
<p>
But if it is a lone attraction for us, omigosh, for the leprechauns… Dick’s story proved they can at least <em>read</em> minds remotely. What if they all banded together to mess with the players’ moves? Neil had told of the Indistinguishability constraint, but I realized <em>my own work</em> could enable getting around it. My model enables randomly simulating a human distribution of moves at any rating level. I’ve had the idea to try a “Turing Test” akin to one Garry Kasparov turned aside, as part of the Turing Centennial in 2012, by distinguishing five games played by human 2200-level players from five by computers set to play at 2200 strength. If the leprechauns passed the Turing test at a 2800 rating level they could derange the tournament. This all verges on real concerns in my statistical anti-cheating work, with humans not leprechauns.</p>
<p>
I quickly looked up the lore for <a href="https://mysticinvestigations.com/leprechaun-summoning-spell/">summoning</a> a leprechaun. This is far more audacious than knocking on a professor’s door outside office hours—not that that will happen anytime soon. I did not have real shamrocks but strewed countryside photos from my family’s trip to Ireland last summer around my laptop. I needed Kathryn as well as Dick online by videoconference to make the quorum of three. The IT person came back with the coordinates so that uniquely Neil would be summoned. I adapted the ancient incantation to our new age of interaction by laptop: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Oh Leprechaun, Leprechaun, I humbly call unto thee,<br/>
Ride the Irish rainbows of joy across the virtual sea,<br/>
Let the cables be lit with the beacon of your Shillelagh,<br/>
In dire peril of bad luck I make this plea,<br/>
For an unknown evil lies near, I ween:<br/>
Oh Leprechaun, Leprechaun, please appear on my screen! </b>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
It worked. Neil crackled into view. After a short greeting I blurted out my concerns.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Nae worry. Nae worry. The International Chess Federation—FIDE—took the most important step to assure the fair play.</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Wait—I know the fair-play measures FIDE developed. I’ve been part of them. That didn’t assuage what I’d just said.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">FIDE put not just one but two Scotsmen on the tournament staff. One of them is in charge of fair play. Nae Leprechaun gan cross a Scotsman! </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
And with that Neil was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our hearts go out to all those affected more immediately than we so far. Amid all the worries, we wish you a happy and safe St. Patrick’s Day.</p>

    <title>Richard Guy passed away at the age of 103</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Richard Guy passed away on March 9, 2020 at the age of 103. Before he died he was the worlds oldest living mathematician (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_centenarians_(scientists_and_mathematicians)">here</a> for a list of centenarians who are famous scientists or mathematicians). He was also the oldest <i>active </i>mathematician-- he had a paper on arxiv (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03379">here</a>) in October of 2019.  (ADDED later since a commenter pointed it out to me--- a paper by Berlekamp and Guy posted in 2020: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03705">here</a>)<br/>
<br/>
I met him twice- once at a Gathering for Gardner, and once at an AMS meeting. I told him that Berlekamp-Conway-Guy had a great influence on me. He asked if it was a positive or negative influence. He also seemed to like my talk on The Muffin Problem, though he might have been being polite.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did a blog about Richard Guy on his 103rd birthday, so I recommend readers to go <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/09/richard-guy-is-102-years-old-today.html">there</a><br/>
for more about him.  One point I want to re-iterate:<br/>
<br/>
Richard Guy thought of himself of an amateur mathematician. If he means someone who does it for love of the subject then this is clearly true.  If it is a measure of how good he is (the term `amateur' is sometimes used as an insult) then it is clearly false. If it means someone who does not have formal training than it is partially true.<br/>

    <title>TR20-036 |  Strong (D)QBF Dependency Schemes via Tautology-free Resolution Paths | 

	Olaf Beyersdorff, 

	Joshua Blinkhorn, 

	Tomáš Peitl</title>
    <summary>We suggest a general framework to study dependency schemes for dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBF). As our main contribution, we exhibit a new tautology-free DQBF dependency scheme that generalises the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme. We establish soundness of the tautology-free scheme, implying that it can be used in any DQBF proof system. We further explore the power of DQBF resolution systems parameterised by dependency schemes and show that our new scheme results in exponentially shorter proofs in comparison to the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in the basic DQBF expansion proof system.

On QBFs, we demonstrate that our new scheme is exponentially stronger than the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in Q Resolution, thus resulting in the strongest QBF dependency scheme known to date.</summary>

    <title>TR20-035 |  No-Signaling MIPs and Faster-Than-Light Communication, Revisited | 

	Justin Holmgren</title>
    <summary>We revisit one original motivation for the study of no-signaling multi-prover
  interactive proofs (NS-MIPs): specifically, that two spatially separated
  provers are guaranteed to be no-signaling by the physical principle that
  information cannot travel from one point to another faster than light.

  We observe that with more than two provers, the physical connection between
  no-signaling and faster-than-light communication is more nuanced, depending on
  the relative positioning of the provers.  In particular, we observe that
  provers are guaranteed to be no-signaling if and only if their positions are
  convexly independent.  Other prover positionings provide weaker guaranteees.

  We consider a new issue that thus arises only in the many-prover setting:
  how precisely must provers be positioned in order to guarantee the
    soundness of a (NS-)MIP?  We prove that substantially more precision is
  required to guarantee full no-signaling than to guarantee soundness of a
  specific NS-MIP for PSPACE implicit in the work of Kalai and Raz (CRYPTO 2009).</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Things do not look that good, and these are difficult times. But here on the blog we have plenty of things to cheer you up and assure you. And today we point to two book proofs — two book proofs to the same theorem– and, as a matter of fact, two book proofs to the same theorem by the same person, <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/">Rom Pinchasi</a>.  One of the proofs, the one chosen for presentation, is by Rom Pinchasi and  <a href="http://polyanskii.com/">Alexandr Polyanskii</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/drg_1567-douglas-guthrie-photos.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13104" height="424" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/drg_1567-douglas-guthrie-photos.jpg?w=640&amp;h=424" width="640"/></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rom Pinchasi has an immense proving power, both for difficult proofs at all costs, for book proofs, and for a large variety of proofs in between. (See, for example, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/a-discrepency-problem-for-planar-configurations/"> this post</a>.)</span></p>
<p>Before moving on, let me mention that there is a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/03/10/options-for-giving-math-talks-and-lectures-online/">timely blog post</a> by Terry Tao on Online teaching, and here is <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/349283/software-and-ideas-for-workshops-and-conferences-with-long-distance-participants">a related MO question about online conferences</a> that I asked last December.</p>
<h2>Proofs from the book</h2>
<p>Famously, the mathematician Paul Erdős, often referred to “The Book” in which God keeps the most elegant proof of each mathematical theorem. During a lecture in 1985, Erdős said, “You don’t have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book.” (And you do not have even to believe in the book to enjoy proofs from the book.)</p>
<h2>The Theorem: a 1978 conjecture by Erdős and Purdy</h2>
<p><strong>Theorem: </strong> Let <em>P</em> be a set of <em>n</em> points in general position in the plane. Suppose that <em>R</em> is a set of red points disjoint from <em>P</em> such that every line determined by <em>P</em> passes through a point in <em>R</em>. Then <em>|R|≥ n</em> for <em>n &gt; 6</em>.</p>
<p>This theorem settles a problem by Erdős and Purdy from 1978. Erdős and Purdy also asked about the case where the set of points is not required to be in general position. For that problem the best known lower bound, also proved by Rom Pinchasi, is <em>n/3</em>.</p>
<p>Book Proof I: <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EP_genpos.pdf">An algebraic solution of a problem of Erdős and Purdy</a>, by Rom Pinchasi</p>
<p>Book Proof II: <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EP_book.pdf">A one-page solution of a problem of Erdős and Purdy, by Rom Pinchasi and Alexandr Polyanskii</a></p>
<h2>Murty’s magic configurations conjecture.</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/magic.pdf">first proof of the Erdős-Purdy 1978 Conjecture</a> was achieved in 2008 by Eyal Ackerman, Kevin Buchin, Christian Knauer, Rom Pinchasi, and Günter Rote. They derived it from their solution to the 1971 conjecture on magic configurations by Murty. A planar set of points P is called magic if it possible to assign positive weights to the points so that the sum of weights in every line determined by the points is one. Murty conjectured that the only magic configurations are those in general position, and those which have a line missing at most one of the points, and a certain configuration of seven points.</p>
<h2>The Pinchasi-Polyanskii Book-Proof:</h2>
<p>Here, we very closely follow the Pinchasi-Polyanskii’s paper.</p>
<p>We say that a line is determined by a set of points in the plane if it contains at least two of the points. Since the points in P are in general position, each pair of points determines a different line.</p>
<p>Under the contrary assumption we must have <em>|R| = n−1</em>. Then it must be that every point in <em>R</em> is incident to precisely <em>n/2</em> lines determined by <em>P</em> and every line determined by <em>P</em> is incident to precisely one point in <em>R</em>. We would like to reach a contradiction.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Preliminary step: apply a projective transformation to the plane such that the convex hull of <em>P</em> becomes a triangle.</span></p>
<p><strong>Observation 1:</strong>  No point of R lies outside the convex hull of P.</p>
<p>Such a point <em>r</em> should be incident to two lines supporting the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Each of these supporting lines must contain precisely two points of <em>P</em>. Since the convex hull of <em>P</em> is a triangle this is impossible.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Regard the points in the plane as complex numbers. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">(This is really cool. I am not aware of many examples in discrete geometry that thinking about planar points as complex numbers helps.)</span></p>
<p>Notation: for every point<em> p</em> in the plane we denote by <img alt="p_x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p_x"/>  the <em>x</em>-coordinate of <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Crucial definition: For every point <em>p ∈ P</em> deﬁne</p>
<p><img alt="f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p-r) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p-p')." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28p%29+%3D+%5Cprod_%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D%28p-r%29+%2F+%5Cprod_%7Bp%27+%5Cin+P%5Cbackslash+%5C%7Bp%5C%7D%7D%28p-p%27%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p-r) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p-p')."/></p>
<p><strong>Observation 2:</strong> <em>f(p)</em> is a real number!</p>
<p>The proof will surely make you smile: For every <em>p’ ∈ P \{p}</em> there is a unique <em>r ∈ R</em> such that <em>p, p’</em>, and <em>r</em> are collinear. So <em>(p-r)/(p-p’)</em> is real. And the big ratio between products split to many small fractions that are all real.  <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Walla!</strong></span></p>
<p>Note that <em>f(p)</em> is thus also invariant under rotations of the plane.</p>
<p>Now, if the vertical line through p does not contain any other point in P ∪ R, then, for the unique <em>r ∈ R</em> such that <em>p, p’</em>, and<em> r</em> are collinear, we have that:</p>
<p><img alt="(1)~~~(p-r)/(p-p')~=~(p_x-r_x)/(p_x-p'_x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%29%7E%7E%7E%28p-r%29%2F%28p-p%27%29%7E%3D%7E%28p_x-r_x%29%2F%28p_x-p%27_x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(1)~~~(p-r)/(p-p')~=~(p_x-r_x)/(p_x-p'_x)"/>.</p>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<p><strong>Observation 3:</strong>  if the vertical line through <em>p</em> does not contain any other point in <em>P ∪ R</em>, then</p>
<p><img alt="(2)~~~ f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p_x-r_x) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p_x-p'_x)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282%29%7E%7E%7E+f%28p%29+%3D+%5Cprod_%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D%28p_x-r_x%29+%2F+%5Cprod_%7Bp%27+%5Cin+P%5Cbackslash+%5C%7Bp%5C%7D%7D%28p_x-p%27_x%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(2)~~~ f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p_x-r_x) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p_x-p'_x)."/></p>
<p><strong>Crucial observation 4:</strong>  Let <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> be any two points in <em>P</em> and let <em>r</em> be the unique point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>p</em> and<em> q</em>. Then</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>f(p)/f(q)=-(p-r)/(q-r).</em></h3>
<p>To see this rotate the plane so that the x-coordinates of <em>p,q</em>, and <em>r</em> are equal (or nearly equal) and apply Equations (2) and (1). (You will get the same, or nearly the same, contributions for <em>r’ ≠ r</em>  and you are left with the contribution for <em>r</em>. ) This also leads to:</p>
<p><strong>Observation 5:</strong> <em>f(p)/f(q)</em> <em>&gt;0</em>  if and only if the unique point <em>r ∈ R</em> that is collinear with <em>p</em> and<em> q</em> lies in the straight line segment delimited by <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>.</p>
<h3>A complete graph with green and red edges.</h3>
<p>Consider the complete graph <em>G</em> whose vertices are the points in <em>P</em>. For every two points <em>p, q ∈ P</em> we color the edge connecting  <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>red</strong></span> if the unique point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> lies outside the straight line segment connecting <em>p</em> and<em> q. </em>Otherwise we color the edge <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>green</strong></span>. In other words, the edge is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span></strong> if<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> f(p)/f(q) &lt; 0</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: #339966;">green</span></strong> if <strong><span style="color: #339966;">f(p)/f(q) &gt; 0</span></strong>.</p>
<p>The vertices of G can naturally be partitioned into two sets:<i> U = {p ∈ P | f(p) &gt; 0}</i> and<i> W = {p ∈ P | f(p) &lt; 0}</i>.</p>
<p>Without loss of generality assume that the three vertices of the convex hull of P belong to <em>U</em>. (Since no point of R is outside this convex hull all edges of the triangle forming the convex hull are green.)</p>
<p><strong>Observation 6:</strong> <em>|U| = n/2 + 1.</em></p>
<p>To see this let <em>a,b</em> ∈ <em>U</em> be two vertices of the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Let <em>c</em> ∈ <em>R</em> be the point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. The point <em>c</em> must be between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the boundary of the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Therefore, all the other n/2 −1 pairs of points of <em>P</em> that are collinear with c must form red edges. Consequently, precisely one point of every such pair belongs to U. Together with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, we obtain <em>|U| = n/2+1</em>.</p>
<p><strong>End of proof:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-19479"/></p>
<p>Consider now any triangulation of the convex hull of <em>P</em> using all the vertices of <em>U</em>. This triangulation contains precisely <em>3|U|−6</em> edges all of which correspond to green edges in the graph <em>G</em>. Each edge in the triangulation contains a unique point in <em>R</em>. Therefore,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>|R|≥ 3|1|−6 = 3n/2 −3.</em></p>
<p>This expression is greater than or equal to <em>n</em> for every <em>n ≥ 6</em>, as desired. <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>ahla!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">(Good old Euler’s theorem is used.)</span></p>
<h2>Related things.</h2>
<p>Yesterday, our PM explained on TV what geometric (exponential) growth is.  If I try to describe related results and problems to the theorem presented here, and move on to related results and problems to those and so on, the amount of beautiful results from discrete geometry will grow exponentially but this post will never be completed.</p>
<p>So let me mention just a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The result is related to the Motzkin-Rabin Colorful Sylvester-Gallai theorem. Given a set of red points and blue points in the plane, not all on a line, the Motzkin-Rabin theorem asserts that there is a line that contains two or more points in the set, such that all the points on the line have the same color.</li>
<li>Starting with the Sylvester-Gallai theorem itself, there is a rich Gallai-Sylvester theory, with recent deep connections to the theory of computing; My <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4661/the-sylvester-gallai-theorem-and-sections-of-varieties-with-simple-topology">third MathOverflow question</a> was about a Sylvester-Gallai type problem and here is a link to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4661/the-sylvester-gallai-theorem-and-sections-of-varieties-with-simple-topology#comment8133_4661">Greg Kuperberg remark</a>‘s regarding potential Gylvester-Kalai theorems.</li>
<li>Let me mention the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/on-sets-defining-few-ordinary-lines/">2012 solution by Ben Green and Terry Tao</a> of the ordinary line conjecture and the Orchard conjecture.</li>
<li>Let me mention the proof of Andreii Kupavskii and Alexandr Polyanskii to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3694.pdf">Shur’s conjecture</a>.</li>
<li>Here is a <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EPnCubic_s2.pdf">link to a very recent paper</a> by Chaya Keller and Rom Pinchasi. There they make the following <strong>bold conjecture</strong>: Let <em>P</em> be a set of n points in general position and and let <em>R</em> be a set of n points disjoint from P. If every line determined by P passes through a point in<em> R,</em> then <em>P </em>∪<em> R</em> is contained in a cubic curve.</li>
<li>There is, of course the famous book by Martin Aigner and Günter Ziegler: Proofs from the book.</li>
<li>At some point I tried to interest Günter with a companion book: The book of examples. We did not proceed with this project but this motivated my successful <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4994/fundamental-examples">MathOverflow questions about fundamental examples</a>.</li>
<li>Eventually, Günter and I decided to write instead: the book of examples of polytopes. We went as far as writing a list of chapters of the book! (Which is a very advanced stage of writing a book, I suppose.)</li>
<li>When I took a class for high-school students interested in mathematics, the Sylvester problem was a starred problem in the first problem set and the assertion of the Motzkin-Rabin colored theorem was a double starred problem. Among the 20-30 students none of us found a (correct) solution. (We referred to it in a trivia question in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/natis-influence/">this post</a>.) Years later, I gave the same class and gave the same starred problems, and one student managed to prove the Gallai-Sylvester theorem. Can you guess who he was?</li>
</ol>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>When I launched bit-player.org in 2006, displaying any sort of mathematical notation on the web was torture. I would typeset an equation in LaTeX, convert the output to a JPEG image, upload the image file to a directory on the server, and embed a reference to the file in an HTML <code>img</code> tag. The process was cumbersome and the product was ugly. In 2009 I wrote <a href="http://bit-player.org/bph-publications/AmSci-2009-03-Hayes-webmath.pdf">an <em>American Scientist</em> article</a> whining about this sorry state of affairs—but at just that moment an elegant solution was coming on the scene. Davide Cervone of Union College had created a program called jsMath, which could process TeX commands placed directly in an HTML document. For example, I could write:</p>
<pre style="text-align: center;"><code>e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots</code></pre>
<p>and it would appear on your screen as:</p>
<p>\[e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots\]</p>
<p class="undent">All the work of parsing the TeX code and typesetting the math was done by a JavaScript program downloaded into your browser along with the rest of the web page.</p>
<p>Cervone’s jsMath soon evolved into <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/mathjax">open-source project</a> initially supported by the AMS and SIAM. There are now about two dozen sponsors, and the project is under the aegis of <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>. From the MathJax web page: “The MathJax team consists of Davide Cervone and Volker Sorge. Regular contributors include Christian Lawson-Perfect, Omar Al-Ithawi, and Peter Krautzberger.”Cervone remains the principal author, though not the only contributor.</p>
<p>MathJax has made a big difference in my working life, transforming a problem into a pleasure. Putting math on the web is fun! Sometimes I do it just to show off. Furthermore, the software has served as an inspiration as well as a helpful tool. Until I saw MathJax in action, it simply never occurred to me that interesting computations could be done within the JavaScript environment of a web browser, which I had thought was there mainly to make things blink and jiggle. With the example of MathJax in front of me, I realized that I could not only display mathematical ideas but also explore and animate them within a web page.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Last fall I began hearing rumors about MathJax 3.0, “a complete rewrite of MathJax from the ground up using modern techniques.” It’s the kind of announcement that inspires both excitement and foreboding. What will the new version add? What will it take away? What will it fix? What will it break?</p>
<p>Before committing all of bit-player to the new version, I thought I would try a small-scale experiment. I have a standalone web page that makes particularly tricky use of MathJax. The page is a repository of the <a href="https://bit-player.github.io/dotster/">Dotster</a> programs extracted from a recent bit-player post, <a href="http://bit-player.org/2019/my-god-its-full-of-dots">My God, it’s full of dots</a>. In January I got the Dotster page running with MathJax 3.</p>
<p>Most math in web documents is static content: An equation needs to be formatted once, when the page is first displayed, and it never changes after that. The initial type­setting is handled automatically by MathJax, in both the old and the new versions. As soon as the page is downloaded from the server, MathJax makes a pass through the entire text, identifying elements flagged as TeX code and replacing them with typeset math. Once that job is done, MathJax can go to sleep.</p>
<p>The Dotster programs are a little different; they include equations that change dynamically in response to user input. Here’s an example:</p>


<p>The slider on the left sets a numerical value that gets plugged into the two equation on the right. Each time the slider is moved, the equations need to be updated and reformatted. Thus with each change to the slider setting, MathJax has to wake up from its slumbers and run again to typeset the altered content.</p>
<p>The MathJax program running in the little demo above is the older version, 2.7. Cosmetically, the result is not ideal. With each change in the slider value, the two equations contract a bit, as if pinched between somebody’s fingers, and then snap back to their original size. They seem to wink at us. The progress banner would normally appear in the lower left corner of the browser window, where it is less intrusive. It has a more prominent position here because the demo is encapsulated in an iFrame, which acts as a window within the window. This structure is necessary in order to run two versions of MathJax in a single page. Also, a small gray progress indicator pops up in the lower left corner and hangs around just long enough to grab your attention. It says: “Typesetting math: 100%.” I find these visual distractions pretty annoying. They are analogous to the dreaded FOUC—the “flash of unstyled content”—that appears when a web browser displays the text of a page before the associated stylesheets are fully loaded and processed.</p>
<p>The winking effect is caused by a MathJax feature called Fast Preview. The system does a quick-and-dirty rendering of the math content without calculating <img alt="Math settings submenus" border="0" class="alignright" height="180" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/math-settings-submenus.png" width="350"/> the correct final sizes for the various typographic ele­ments. (Evi­dently that calculation takes a little time). You can turn off Fast Preview by right-clicking or control-clicking one of the equa­tions and then navigating through the sub­menus shown at right. How­ever, you’ll probably judge the result to be worse rather than better. Without Fast Preview, you’ll get a  glimpse of the raw TeX commands. Instead of winking, the equations do jumping jacks.</p>
<p>I am delighted to report that all of this visual noise has been eliminated in the new MathJax. On changing a slider setting, the equations are updated in place, with no unnecessary visual fuss. And there’s no need for a progress indication, because the change is so quick it appears to be instantaneous. See for yourself:</p>


<p>Thus version 3 looks like a big win. There’s a caveat: Getting it to work did not go quite as smoothly as I had hoped. Nevertheless, this is a story with a happy ending.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you have only static math content in your documents, making the switch to MathJax 3 is easy. In your HTML file you change a URL to load the new MathJax version, and convert any configuration options to a new format. As it happens, all the default options work for me, so I had nothing to convert. What’s most important about the upgrade path is what you <em>don’t</em> need to do. In most cases you should not have to alter any of the TeX commands present in the HTML files being processed by MathJax. (There are a <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#input-changes">few small exceptions</a>.)</p>
<p>With dynamic content, further steps are needed. Here is the JavaScript statement I used to reawaken the typesetting engine in MathJax version 2.7:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset", MathJax.Hub, mathjax_demo_box]);
</code></pre>
<p>The statement enters a <code>Typeset</code> command into a queue of pending tasks. When the command reaches the front of the queue, MathJax will typeset any math found inside the HTML element designated by the identifier <code>mathjax_demo_box</code>, ignoring the rest of the document.</p>
<p>In MathJax 3, the <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/typeset.html#typesetting-math-in-a-web-page">documentation</a> suggested I could simply replace this command with a slightly different and more direct one:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>MathJax.typeset([mathjax_demo_box]);
</code></pre>
<p>I did that. It didn’t work. When I moved the slider, the displayed math reverted to raw TeX form, and I found an error message in the JavaScript console:</p>
<p><img alt="AppendChild null error 530x170" border="0" class="centered" height="170" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/appendChild-null-error-530x170.png" width="530"/></p>
<p>What has gone wrong here? JavaScript’s <code>appendChild</code> method adds a new node to the treelike structure of an HTML document. It’s like hanging an ornament from some specified branch of a Christmas tree. The error reported here indicates that the specified branch does not exist; it is <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s not tarry over my various false starts and wrong turns as I puzzled over the source of this bug. I eventually found the cause and the solution in the “issues” section of the MathJax repository on GitHub. Back in September of last year Mihai Borobocea had <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2191">reported a similar problem</a>, along with the interesting observation that the error occurs only when an existing TeX expression is being replaced in a document, not when a new expression is being added. Borobocea had also discovered that invoking the procedure <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> before <code>MathJax.typeset()</code> would prevent the error.</p>
<p>A comment by Cervone explains much of what’s going on:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are correct that you should use <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> if you have removed previously typeset math from the page. (In version 3, there is information stored about the math in a list of typeset expressions, and if you remove typeset math from the page and replace it with new math, that list will hold pointers to math that no longer exists in the page. That is what is causing the error you are seeing . . . )</p></blockquote>
<p>I found that adding <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> did indeed eliminate the error. As a practical matter, that solved my problem. But Borobocea pointed out a remaining loose end. Whereas <code>MathJax.typeset([mathjax_demo_box])</code> operates only on the math inside a specific container, <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> destroys the list of math objects for the entire document, an act that might later have unwanted consequences. Thus it seemed best to reformat all the math in the document whenever any one expression changes. This is inefficient, but with the 20-some equations in the Dotster web page the typesetting is so fast there’s no perceptible delay.</p>
<p>In January a fix for this problem was merged into MathJax 3.0.1, which is now the shipping version. Cervone’s comment on this change says that it “prevents the error message,” which left me with the impression that it might suppress the message without curing the error itself. But as far as I can tell the entire issue has been cleared up. There’s no longer any need to invoke <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In my first experiments with version 3.0 I stumbled onto another bit of weirdness, but it turned out to be a quirk of my own code, not something amiss in MathJax. </p>
<p>I was seeing occasional size variations in typeset math that seemed reminiscent of the winking problem in version 2.7. <img alt="large and small math superimposed" border="0" class="alignright" height="99" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/zs-large-and-small-math.png" width="159"/>Sometimes the initial, automatic typesetting would leave the equations in a slightly smaller size; they would grow back to normal as soon as <code>MathJax.typeset()</code> was applied. In the image at right I have superimposed the two states, with the correct, larger image colored red. It looks like Fast Preview has come back to haunt us, but that can’t be right, because Fast Preview has been removed entirely from version 3.</p>
<p>My efforts to solve this mystery turned into quite a debugging debacle. I got a promising clue from an exchange on the <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax-docs/wiki/Dealing-with-display:none">MathJax wiki</a>, discussing size anomalies when math is composed inside an HTML element temporarily flagged <code>display: none</code>, a style rule that makes the math invisible. In that circumstance MathJax has no information about the surrounding text, and so it leaves the typeset math in a default state. The same mechanism might account for what I was seeing—except that my page has no elements with a <code>display: none</code> style.</p>
<p>I first observed this problem in the Chrome browser, where it is intermittent; when I repeatedly reloaded the page, the small type would appear about one time out of five. What fun! It takes multiple trials just to know whether an attempted fix has had any effect. Thus I was pleased to discover that in Firefox the shrunken type appears consistently, every time the page is loaded. Testing became a great deal easier.</p>
<p>I soon found a cure, though not a diagnosis. While browsing again in the MathJax issues archive and in a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/mathjax-users">MathJax user forum</a>, I came across suggestions to try a different form of output, with mathematical expressions constructed not from text elements in HTML and style rules in CSS but from paths drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics, or SVG. I found that the SVG expressions were stable and consistent in size, and in other respects indistinguishable from their HTML siblings. Again my problem was solved, but I still wanted to know the underlying cause.</p>
<p>Here’s where the troubleshooting report gets a little embarrassing. Thinking I might have a new bug to report, I set out to build a minimal exemplar—the smallest and simplest program that would trigger the bug. I failed. I was starting from a blank page and adding more and more elements of the original program—<code>div</code>s nested inside <code>div</code>s in the HTML, various stylesheet rules in the CSS, bigger collections of more complex equations—but none of these additions produced the slightest glitch in typesetting. So I tried working in the other direction, starting with the complex misbehaving program and stripping away elements until the problem disappeared. But it didn’t disappear, even when I reduced the page to a single equation in a plain white box.</p>
<p>As often happens, I found the answer not by banging my head against the problem but by going for a walk. Out in the fresh air, I finally noticed the one oddity that distinguished the failing program from all of the correctly working ones. Because the Dotster program began life embedded in a WordPress blog post, I could not include a link to the CSS stylesheet in the <code>head</code> section of the HTML file. Instead, a JavaScript function constructed the link and inserted it into the <code>head</code>. That happened <em>after</em> MathJax made its initial pass over the text. At the time of typesetting, the elements in which the equations were placed had no styles applied, and so MathJax had no way of determining appropriate sizes.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When Don Knuth unveiled TeX, circa 1980, I was amazed. Back then, typewriter-style word processing was impressive enough. TeX did much more: real typesetting, with multiple fonts (which Knuth also had to create from scratch), automatic hyphenation and justification, and beautiful mathematics.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, when Cervone created MathJax, I was amazed again—though perhaps not for the right reasons. I had supposed that the major programming challenge would be capturing all the finicky rules and heuristics for building up math expressions—placing and sizing superscripts, adjusting the height and width of parentheses or a radical sign to match the dimensions of the expression enclosed, spacing and aligning the elements of a matrix. Those are indeed nontrivial tasks, but they are just the beginning. My recent adventures have helped me see that another major challenge is making TeX work in an alien environment.</p>
<p>In classic TeX, the module that typesets equations has direct access to everything it might ever need to know about the surrounding text—type sizes, line spacing, column width, the amount of interword “glue” needed to justify a line of type. Sharing this information is easy because all the formatting is done by the same program. MathJax faces a different situation. Formatting duties are split, with MathJax handling mathematical content but the browser’s layout engine doing everything else. Indeed, the document is written in two different languages, TeX for the math and HTML/CSS for the rest. Coordinating actions in the two realms is not straightforward.</p>
<p>There are other complications of importing TeX into a web page. The classic TeX system runs in batch mode. It takes some inputs, produces its output, and then quits. Batch processing would not offer a pleasant experience in a web browser. The entire user interface (such as the buttons and sliders in my Dotster programs) would be frozen for the duration. To avoid this kind of rudeness to the user, MathJax is never allowed to monopolize JavaScript’s single thread of execution for more than a fraction of a second. To ensure this cooperative behavior, earlier versions relied on a hand-built scheme of queues (where procedures wait their turn to execute) and callbacks (which signal when a task is complete). Version 3 takes advantage of a new JavaScript construct called a <em>promise</em>. When a procedure cannot compute a result immediately, it hands out a promise, which it then redeems when the result becomes available.</p>
<p>Wait, there’s more! MathJax is not just a TeX system. It also accepts input written in MathML, a dialect of XML specialized for mathematical notation. Indeed, the internal language of MathJax is based on MathML. And MathJax can also be configured to handle <a href="http://asciimath.org/">AsciiMath</a>, a cute markup language that aims to make even the raw form of an expression readable. Think of it as math with emoticons: Type <code>`oo`</code> and you’ll get \(\infty\), or <code>`:-`</code> for \(\div\).</p>
<p>MathJax also provides an extensive suite of tools for accessibility. Visually impaired readers can have an equation read aloud. As I learned at the January Joint Math Meetings, there are even provisions for generating Braille output—but that’s a subject that deserves a post of its own.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When I first encountered MathJax, I saw it as a marvel, but I also considered it a workaround or stopgap. Reading a short document that includes a single equation entails downloading the entire MathJax program, which can be much larger than the document itself. And you need to download it all again for every other mathy document (unless your browser cache hangs onto a copy). What an appalling waste of bandwidth. </p>
<p>Several alternatives seemed more promising as a long-term solution. The best approach, it seemed to me then, was to have support for mathematical notation built into the browser. Modern browsers handle images, audio, video, SVG, animations—why not math? But it hasn’t happened. Firefox and Safari have limited support for MathML; none of the browsers I know are equipped to deal with TeX.</p>
<p>Another strategy that once seemed promising was the browser plugin. A plugin could offer the same capabilities as MathJax, but you would download and install it only once. This sounds like a good deal for readers, but it’s not so attractive for the author of web content. If there are multiple plugins in circulation, they are sure to have quirks, and you need to accommodate all of them. Furthermore, you need some sort of fallback plan for those who have not installed a plugin.</p>
<p>Still another option is to run MathJax on the server, rather than sending the whole program to the browser. The document arrives with TeX or MathML already converted to HTML/CSS or SVG for display. This is the preferred modus operandi for several large websites, most notably Wikipedia. I’ve considered it for bit-player, but it has a drawback: Running on the server, MathJax cannot provide the kind of on-demand typesetting seen in the demos above.</p>
<p>As the years go by, I am coming around to the view that MathJax is not just a useful stopgap while we wait for the right thing to come along; it’s quite a good approximation to the right thing. As the author of a web page, I get to write mathematics in a familiar and well-tested notation, and I can expect that any reader with an up-to-date browser will see output that’s much like what I see on my own screen. At the same time, the reader also has control over how the math is rendered, via the context menu. And the program offers accessibility features that I could never match on my own.</p>
<p>To top it off, the software is open-source—freely available to everyone. That is not just an economic advantage but also a social one. The project has a community that stands ready to fix bugs, listen to suggestions and complaints, offer help and advice. Without that resource, I would still be struggling with the hitches and hiccups described above.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-034 |  On Proof complexity of Resolution over Polynomial Calculus | 

	Erfan Khaniki</title>
    <summary>The refutation system ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ is a natural extension of resolution refutation system such that it operates with disjunctions of degree $d$ polynomials over ring $R$ with boolean variables. For $d=1$, this system is called ${Res}_R({lin})$. Based on properties of $R$, ${Res}_R({lin})$ systems can be too strong to prove lower bounds for CNFs with current methods. The reachable goal might be proving lower bounds for ${Res}_R({lin})$ when $R$ is a finite field such as $\mathbb{F}_2$. Interestingly, ${Res}_{\mathbb{F}_2}({lin})$ is also fairly strong, and there is no known nontrivial lower bound for it, but for ${Res}^*_R({lin})$ (tree-like ${Res}_R({lin})$) we know exponential lower bounds for every finite field.
 For the stronger systems ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ and ${Res}_R^*({PC}_d)$ for $d&gt;1$ on finite ring $R$, there is no known lower bounds till now. In this paper we will investigate these refutation systems and make some progress toward understanding these systems, including the case $d=1$. We prove a size-width relation for ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ and ${Res}^*_R({PC}_d)$ for every finite ring $R$. This relation is proved by a new idea to reduce the problem to the original Ben-Sasson and Wigderson size-width relation for ${Res}$ and ${Res}^*$ using extension variables. As a by product, we get the following new lower bounds for every finite field $\mathbb{F}$:
(1) We prove the first nontrivial lower bounds for ${Res}_\mathbb{F}({PC}_d)$ for fixed $d$: a nearly quadratic lower bounds for mod $q$ Tseitin formulas ($char(\mathbb{F})\neq q$) for suitable graphs.
(2) We also prove superpolynomial and exponential lower bounds for ${Res}^*_\mathbb{F}({PC}_{d})$ where $d$ is not too large with respect to $n$ for the following principles:
 (a) mod $q$ Tseitin formulas ($char(\mathbb{F})\neq q$),
 (b) Random $k$-CNFs.</summary>

Robert Dorfman was a professor of political economy at Harvard University, who helped create the notion of group testing. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss this notion and its possible application to the current epidemic crisis. We also discuss other mathematical aspects that have clear and immediate value.  <font color="red"><b>Update 03/19/20:</b></font> Israel Cidon in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109506">comment</a> links to an actual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxs11ryS9Dg&amp;feature=emb_logo">implementation</a> of group testing for the virus up to 64 samples from the Technion.<br/>

<p>
The novel coronavirus (and its disease <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19</a>) is the nasty issue we all face today. I live in New York City and can see the reduced foot traffic every day. The issue is discussed every minute on the news. I hope you are all safe, and well. But we are all worried about this. </p>
<p>
The point of group testing is that it can reduce the number of tests needed to find out who has the virus. I assume that we are not using Dorfman’s idea because it does not apply to today’s testing. But it seems like it could fit. One issue is the need for more individual testing kits. As we write this, the US is still well short of the needed supply of kits. Are there situations where group testing can still help economize?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Group Testing </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Dorfman created the notion of <em>group testing</em> in 1943. You could say he was driven by the need to test light bulbs:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16781" height="188" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png?w=300&amp;h=188" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>As Wikipedia group-testing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_testing">article</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> [Suppose] one is searching for a broken bulb among six light bulbs. Here, the first three are connected to a power supply, and they light up (A). This indicates that the broken bulb must be one of the last three (B). If instead the bulbs did not light up, one could be sure that the broken bulb was among the first three. Continuing this procedure can locate the broken bulb in no more than three tests, compared to a maximum of six tests if the bulbs are checked individually. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Okay, Dorfman’s motivation was not light bulbs. It was testing soldiers during WWII for a certain disease, that will go unnamed. This type of testing reduced the number of blood samples needed. What was analogous to connecting groups of light bulbs into one circuit was combining portions of individual blood samples into one sample. If it tested negative then that entire group could be dismissed without further testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Fewer Kits </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The point of using group testing is made stark when you think about recent issues with cruise ships. On one ship there were around <img alt="{3500}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3500}"/> passengers who were eventually found to be almost all okay. I believe only <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/> were infected. This could have been checked by group testing with many fewer than <img alt="{3500}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3500}"/> tests. </p>
<p>
According to the current outbreak <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html">maps</a>, known <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#us">cases</a> in the US are still fairly sparse. Those in New York are mainly in the city, Westchester, and along the Hudson River to Albany. Let’s say we wish assurance that all non-virus related admits to a hospital are free of the virus. Can group testing apply?</p>
<p>
The original version of group testing would apply if it were deemed mandatory that all new admits give a blood sample. Some kinds of coronavirus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing">test kits</a> use blood samples. Taking blood samples might however be as costly and intrusive as having the individual tests to begin with. There are other kinds of tests involving taking swabs, but it is not apparent whether those samples can be combined at scale as readily as blood samples can.</p>
<p>
At least the <em>idea</em> of group testing has interesting connections to other parts of theory. Here is a 2000 <a href="https://www.cs.umn.edu/sites/cs.umn.edu/files/tech_reports/00-007.pdf">survey</a> by Ken’s former Buffalo colleague Hung Ngo with his PhD advisor, Ding-Zhu Du, where the application is to large scale screening of DNA samples. Hung and Ken’s colleague Atri Rudra taught a <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2011/709/">course</a> in Buffalo on group testing in relation to <em>compressed sensing</em>. More recent is a 2015 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7308980">paper</a> that tries to solve problems of counting the number of positive cases, not just whether they exist. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Other Mathematical Effects </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
As we write, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has just declared a cap of 500 attendees for any assembly. This is forcing the suspension of Broadway shows among many other activities. Yesterday the entire SUNY system joined numerous other institutions in moving to distance-only learning after this week.  </p>
<p>
The cap is based on the likelihood of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> persons including someone who is already infected. That likelihood in turn is based on the density of known cases and what is known about the proportion of unknown to known cases. The virus has a long (two weeks) incubation time during which it is contagious but not symptomatic.</p>
<p>
Here is a graph from a PSA <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> posted just today by Alex Tabarrok for the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog (note that the calculations are by <a href="https://biosciences.gatech.edu/people/joshua-weitz">Joshua</a> <a href="http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/">Weitz</a> of Georgia Tech):</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-16782" height="425" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg?w=550&amp;h=425" width="550"/></a></p>
<p>
The <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>-axis is the number of cases (in proportion to the US on the whole) and the <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>-axis is the group size. Which axis is more important—has more effect on the danger? Tabarrok notes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Now here is the most important point. It’s the size of the group, not the number of carriers that most drives the result. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This involves comparing two partial derivatives. The <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> gives a brief worked-out example without using calculus. </p>
<p>
I, Ken, have been connected this week to another example. I was statistically monitoring the World Senior Team Chess Championship, which began last Friday in Prague. Almost 500 players in teams of 4 or 5 players took part. Initially the players were roughly evenly divided between two halls. Effective Tuesday, a cap of 100 was declared for the Czech Republic, so more playing rooms were found and spectators were banned. Today, however, after an update on the density of cases in the Czech Republic, the cap was lowered to 30 effective tomorrow.  Thus the tournament was forced to finish today, two rounds earlier than planned. Even though chess events have a lower size footprint than all of the spectator sports whose seasons have been suspended in recent days, the growth of the outbreak is making cancellation the only reasonable policy for all but the smallest events.</p>
<p>
The main purpose of these and other <em>social isolation</em> measures is to flatten out the growth of cases. The target is not just to contain the outbreak but also to stay below the number of serious cases that our treatment systems can bear at once. Here is one of numerous versions of a <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/flattening-curve-for-covid-19-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-you-help">graphic</a> that is being widely circulated:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-16783" height="223" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg?w=400&amp;h=223" width="400"/></a></p>
<p>
The graphic is not necessarily talking about reducing the number of cases <em>total</em>. The area under both curves is the same. A sentence in accompanying article—</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If individuals and communities take steps to slow the virus’s spread, that means the number of cases of COVID-19 will stretch out across a longer period of time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
—seems to imply that “the number of cases” is the same in both scenarios, but stretched out over time in the latter. The point is how the stretching keeps the <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>-value bounded.  <b>Update 3/15:</b> To complete the thoughts here, we <i>should</i> be talking about reducing the number of cases—see <a href="https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727">this</a>.</p>
<p>
We certainly hope that isolation can reduce that number—i.e., that containment data out of Southeast Asia in particular holds true, as opposed to fears being voiced in the West that the virus will spread to a large percentage of the population over time. See charts <a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca">here</a>, especially chart 7.  This tracking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/22/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/?arc404=true">map</a> has free access and is updated daily.</p>
<p>
What governs the spreading process? This is being understood via simple mathematical models of contagion, such as come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory">percolation theory</a> and its associated <img alt="{R_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R_0}"/> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895684/">factor</a>. Almost a month ago, the Washington Post made an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/coronavirus-how-epidemics-spread-and-end/">interactive</a> showing how epidemics spread according to the parameters in these models. How and whether the COVID-19 pandemic follows these models remains to be seen. Of course we hope it stays on the better side of the equations.  <b>Update 3/15:</b> This new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">animation</a> from the Washington Post shows how the “better side” can arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is group testing a practical <em>mechanism</em> for mapping and constraining the epidemic? How can we promote the understanding of mechanisms and equations and models, not only for those shaping policy but for us who must abide by it and know why.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Harvard University, as well most other places that I know of will be moving to remote lectures. I just gave the last in-person lecture in my <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">cryptography course</a>. I would appreciate technical suggestions on the best format for teaching remotely. At the moment I plan to use Zoom and log-in from both my laptop (for the video) and from my iPad pro (for the interactive whiteboard).  </p>



<p>The one silver lining is that more lectures will be available online. In particular, if you’re teaching algorithms, you might find <a href="https://gt-algorithms.com/">Eric Vigoda’s videos helpful</a>. (If you know of more sources, please let us know.)</p>



<p>I was hoping that reducing meetings and activities will be good for research, but currently find it hard to concentrate on anything except this train-wreck of a situation. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff3affea-63c7-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5">financial times</a> has a chart that summarizes the progress of the  disease in several countries:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7646" src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/http___com.ft_.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.png?w=700"/></figure>



<p>The number of confirmed cases grows by about 33% each day. This growth in confirmed cases is partially due to increased testing  as cases increase – there is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext">some evidence</a>  that the doubling time of the disease (time between <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> infected people to <img alt="2n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2n"/> infected) is about 6 days (rather than the 2.4 days that this figure suggest). However, a doubling time of 6 days still means that the number of cases grows 10-fold in a month, and so if there are 10K actual cases in the U.S., today, there would be 100K by mid April and 1M by mid May.</p>



<p/>



<p>Strong quarantine regimes, contact tracing, and drastically reducing activity and increasing “social distance” can very significantly reduce the base of this exponent. Reducing the base of the exponent is more than simply “delaying the inevitable”. The mortality statistics mask the fact that this can be a very serious illness even for the people who don’t die of it – about 5% of the cases need intensive care (see this <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/12/covid-19-is-rapidly-spreading-in-america-the-country-does-not-look-ready">Economist article</a>). Spreading the infections over time will enable the healthcare system to handle the increased caseload, which will completely overwhelm it otherwise.</p>



<p>Such steps are clearly much easier to achieve before the number of cases is too large to be manageable, but despite having “advance warning” from other countries, this lesson does not seem at the moment to have sunk in, at least here in the U.S. At the moment no such initiatives are taken at the federal level, the states are doing more but still not enough, and it’s up to private companies and institutions to come up with their own policies. As faculty and citizens there is not much we can do about it except support such decisions even when they are <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/12/parents-petition-coronavirus-measure/">unpopular</a>, and just try to make the remote experience as good as possible for us, our colleagues, and our students.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-033 |  New Exponential Size Lower Bounds against Depth Four Circuits of Bounded Individual Degree | 

	Suryajith Chillara</title>
    <summary>Kayal, Saha and Tavenas [Theory of Computing, 2018] showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size $n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases. Further, the bound is superpolynomial only when $\delta$ is $o(d)$. It is natural to ask if the dependence on $\delta$ in the bound could be weakened. Towards this, in an earlier result [STACS, 2020], we showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d = \Theta(\log^2{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{0.2}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\log{n})}$.

  In this paper, we make further progress by proving that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$, and absolute constants $a$ and $b$ such that $\omega(\log^2n)\leq d\leq n^{a}$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{b}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Our bound is obtained by carefully adapting the proof of Kumar and Saraf [SIAM J. Computing, 2017] to the complexity measure introduced in our earlier work [STACS, 2020].</summary>

    <title>The Importance of Networking</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">People skip conferences because of the coronavirus or for <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241717-publish-and-perish/fulltext">global</a> <a href="https://www.change.org/p/organizers-of-data-science-and-machine-learning-conferences-neurips-icml-aistats-iclr-uai-allow-remote-paper-poster-presentations-at-conferences">warming</a> or just because conferences are too expensive and time consuming. I'm certainly <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext">no fan</a> of the current conference structure but I would never want to virtualize all of them. Even if we could completely recreate the conference experience in virtual reality, people would not hang out in the halls without the commitment of having made the physical trip. I made this point in a tweet with a depressing response.<br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<div dir="ltr" lang="en">
At least in CS theory, I don't see any crucial importance. These days it's easy to follow the latest developments online. If you're interested in someone's work, you just email them and start a collaboration. Sooner or later networking in hallways may become a thing of the past.</div>
— Mahdi Cheraghchi (@cheraghchi) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheraghchi/status/1235792583516975104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2020</a></blockquote>


<br/>
<div>
I don't disagree with anything Mahdi says except for the "crucial importance". Great ideas come from chance encounters and random conversations. Many of my research papers would never have happened if not for a conversation had at a conference or on the plane or train rides that took me there. Harken Gilles Brassard's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604072">origin story</a> of quantum cryptography.<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
One fine afternoon in late October 1979, I was swimming at the beach of a posh
hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Imagine my surprise when this complete stranger
swims up to me and starts telling me, without apparent provocation on my part,
about Wiesner’s quantum banknotes! This was probably the most bizarre, and
certainly the most magical, moment in my professional life<sup>6</sup>. Within hours, we had
found ways to mesh Wiesner’s coding scheme with some of the then-new concepts
of public-key cryptography.... The ideas that Bennett and I tossed around on the beach that day resulted
in the first paper ever published on quantum cryptography, indeed the paper
in which the term “Quantum Cryptography” was coined. </blockquote>
And Footnote 6 read as follows.<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
At the risk of taking some of the magic away, I must confess that it was not by accident that
Bennett and I were swimming at the same beach in Puerto Rico. We were both there for the
20th Annual IEEE Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science. Bennett approached
me because I was scheduled to give a talk on relativized cryptography on the last day of the
Symposium and he thought I might be interested in Wiesner’s ideas. By an amazing coincidence,
on my way to San Juan, I had read Martin Gardner’s account of Bennett’s report on
Chaitin’s Omega, which had just appeared in the November 1979 “Mathematical Games” column
of Scientific American—so, I knew the name but I could not recognize Bennett in that swimmer
because I did not know what he looked like.</blockquote>
After we see a slate of conferences held virtually due to the virus, networking may indeed become a thing of the past. But we'll never know the research not done because of people who never connected.</div></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Update (March 13):</strong> One day after I put up this post—a post that many commenters criticized as too alarmist—the first covid cases were detected in Austin.  As a result, UT Austin closed its campus (including my son’s daycare), and at 3:30am, the Austin Independent School District announced its decision to suspend all schools until further notice.  All my remaining plans for the semester (including visits to Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard, CU Boulder, Fermilab, Yale, and CMU) are obviously cancelled.  My family is now on lockdown, in our house, probably at least until the summer.  The war on the virus has reached us.  The “1939” analogy that I mentioned in the post turned out to be more precise than I thought: then, as now, there were intense debates about how just serious the crisis would be, but those debates never even had a chance to get settled by argument; events on the ground simply rendered them irrelevant.</p>



<p><strong>Scott’s foreword:</strong> This week Steve Ebin, a longtime <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader (and occasional commenter) from the San Francisco tech world, sent me the essay below.  Steve’s essay fit too well with my own recent thoughts, and indeed with this blog’s title, for me not to offer to share it here—and to my surprise and gratitude, Steve agreed.</p>



<p>I guess there are only two things I’d add to what Steve wrote.  First, some commenters took me to task for a misplaced emphasis in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4671">my last coronavirus post</a>, and on further reflection, I now concede that they were right.  When a preventable catastrophe strikes the world, what’s always terrified me most are <em>not</em> the ranting lunatics and conspiracy theorists, even if some of those lunatics actually managed to attain the height of power, from where they played a central role in the catastrophe.  No, what’s terrified me more are the blank-faced bureaucrats who’ve signed the paperwork that amounted to death warrants.  Like, for example, the state regulators who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-testing-delays.html?referringSource=articleShare">ordered the Seattle infectious disease expert to stop</a>, after she’d had enough of the government’s failure to allow corona tests, took it upon herself to start testing anyway, and found lots of positive results.  Notably, only some countries have empowered lunatics, but the blank-faced bureaucrats rule everywhere unless something stronger overrides them.</p>



<p>Second, I’ll forever ask myself what went wrong with me, that it took me until metaphorical 1939 to acknowledge the scale of an unfolding catastrophe (on more than a purely intellectual level)—even while others were trying to tell me way back in metaphorical 1933.  Even so, better metaphorical 1939 than metaphorical 1946.</p>



<p><strong>Without further ado, Steve’s essay:</strong></p>



<p>The most expensive meal I ever ate was in San Francisco at a restaurant called Eight Tables. As the name implies, the restaurant has only eight tables. The meal cost $1,000 and featured 12 courses, prepared by award-winning chefs.</p>



<p>The most expensive meal a person ever ate was in late 2019, in China, and consisted of under-cooked bat meat. It cost trillions of dollars. The person who ate it, possibly a peasant, changed the course of the 21st century. The bat he ate contained a virus, and the virus threatened to spread from this man to the rest of humanity.</p>



<p>I’m making up some details, of course. Maybe the man wasn’t a peasant. Or he could have been a woman. Or the bat could have been a pangolin. Or maybe, through a lucky accident (the guy was a loner perhaps), it could have not spread. That could have happened, but it didn’t. Or maybe sometimes that does happen and we don’t know it. These are just accidents of history.</p>



<p>I’m writing this on March 9, 2020. The good news is that the virus, in its current form, doesn’t kill children. I am so thankful for that. The bad news is that the virus does kill adults. The virus is like a grim reaper, culling the sick, the debilitated, and the elderly from the population. It attacks the pulmonary system. I heard a 25-year-old survivor describing how he became unable to control his breathing and could not fall asleep or he would die. Even for healthy young people, the prognosis is often poor. </p>



<p>There were Jews in Europe in the 1930s who sat around tables with the elders of their families and villages and debated whether to leave for America, or Palestine, or South America. Most of them, including my grandmother’s family, didn’t leave, and were largely exterminated. The virus of the time was Nazism, and it too attacked the pulmonary systems of the old and the debilitated, in that case with poisonous gasses.</p>



<p>When you grow up as I did, you are taught to have a paranoia in the back of your mind that there is a major disaster about to happen. That a holocaust, or something of that magnitude, might occur in your lifetime. And so you are never complacent. For your whole life, you’re looking and waiting for a history changing event. You try to ensure that you are willing to follow your thoughts to their logical conclusion and take the necessary actions as a result, unlike many of the Jews of 1930s Europe, who refused to confront the obstacle in front of them until it was too late, and unlike many politicians and world leaders today, who are doing the same.</p>



<p>And the conclusion we must now confront is clear. We are watching a once-in-a-century event unfold. Coronavirus–its mutations, its spawn–will change the course of human history. It will overwhelm our defense system and may kill millions. It may continue to mutate and kill millions more. We will develop painful social measures to slow its spread. We will produce vaccines and better treatment protocols. Some of this will help, but none of this will work perfectly. What will happen to society as this unfolds?</p>



<p>My favorite biblical verse comes from Ecclesiastes: To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. A time to be born, and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to pluck that which is planted. And so on.</p>



<p>The season has changed, and the seven years of famine have begun.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-032 |  On Computing Multilinear Polynomials Using Multi-r-ic Depth Four Circuits | 

	Suryajith Chillara</title>
    <summary>In this paper, we are interested in understanding the complexity of computing multilinear polynomials using depth four circuits in which polynomial computed at every node has a bound on the individual degree of $r$ (referred to as multi-$r$-ic circuits). The goal of this study is to make progress towards proving superpolynomial lower bounds for general depth four circuits computing multilinear polynomials, by proving better and better bounds as the value of $r$ increases.
	
  Recently, Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018) showed that any depth four arithmetic circuit of bounded individual degree $r$ computing a multilinear polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $d=o(n)$, must have size at least $\left(\frac{n}{r^{1.1}}\right)^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{d}{r}}\right)}$ when $r$ is $o(d)$ and is strictly less than $n^{1.1}$. This bound however deteriorates with increasing $r$. It is a natural question to ask if we can prove a bound that does not deteriorate with increasing $r$ or a bound that holds for a "larger" regime of $r$.

  We here prove a lower bound which does not deteriorate with $r$, however for a specific instance of $d = d(n)$ but for a wider range of $r$. Formally, we show that there exists an explicit polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ such that any depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $r&lt;n^{0.2}$ must have size at least $\exp(\Omega(\log^2 n))$. This improvement is obtained by suitably adapting the complexity measure of Kayal et al. (Theory of Computing, 2018). This adaptation of the measure is inspired by the complexity measure used by Kayal et al. (SIAM J. Computing, 2017).</summary>

    <summary>Nisan showed in 1991 that the width of a smallest noncommutative single-(source,sink) algebraic branching program (ABP) to compute a noncommutative polynomial is given by the ranks of specific matrices. This means that the set of noncommutative polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is Zariski-closed, an important property in geometric complexity theory. It follows that approximations cannot help to reduce the required ABP width.

It was mentioned by Forbes that this result would probably break when going from single-(source,sink) ABPs to trace ABPs. We prove that this is correct. Moreover, we study the commutative monotone setting and prove a result similar to Nisan, but concerning the analytic closure. We observe the same behavior here: The set of polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is closed for single-(source,sink) ABPs and not closed for trace ABPs. The proofs reveal an intriguing connection between tangent spaces and the vector space of flows on the ABP.
We close with additional observations on VQP and the closure of VNP which allows us to establish a separation between the two classes.</summary>

    <title>More on uniqueness in Sudoku</title>
    <summary>My first post on this blog, lo these nearly 15 years ago, discussed a program I had written to try to solve Sudoku puzzles deductively (rather than by the easier computational method, backtracking), with the goal of being able to automatically grade the puzzles and automatically generate explanations for how to solve a given puzzle. And a few months later I posted again, on deduction rules that take advantage of the assumption that a puzzle has a unique solution, by ruling out choices that would cause any solution consistent with them to become non-unique. Since then, that part of my solver has been relatively stable, although I have added other rules for Nishio and 2SAT and posted here about more general uniqueness deduction rules in map-coloring puzzles.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/07/20/updated-python-library.html">My first post on this blog</a>, lo these nearly 15 years ago, discussed a program I had written to try to solve Sudoku puzzles deductively (rather than by the easier computational method, backtracking), with the goal of being able to automatically grade the puzzles and automatically generate explanations for how to solve a given puzzle. And a few months later I posted again, on <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/10/15/assuming-uniqueness-in.html">deduction rules that take advantage of the assumption that a puzzle has a unique solution</a>, by ruling out choices that would cause any solution consistent with them to become non-unique.

<p>I’ve also occasionally been using my program to generate puzzles for me to work on, and today it found an interesting test case, a puzzle that it thought would be much more difficult than it turned out to be for me. This mis-rating happened because the uniqueness deduction rules I’m using in my own deductions are stronger than the ones in my program (although some of its other rules are stronger than I typically apply myself). In its initial state, the puzzle looks like:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Sudoku puzzle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-givens.svg"/></p>

<p>My program tells me that it’s at the second highest level of difficulty that it knows about: it has to resort to using 2SAT, but it can successfully solve it that way. (The highest level is for puzzles where it is forced to use backtracking.) Usually, for me, puzzles at that level require me to use written notes to keep track of the deductions, rather than doing it all in my head, but not this time. Using more-or-less standard reasoning, one can fill in the cells of the puzzle to reach the state:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Partially solved Sudoku puzzle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-partial.svg"/></p>

<p>This is where my program gets stuck and has to resort to more powerful deduction rules. But as a human solving this puzzle, here is what I see: In row 3, the two empty cells must contain the pair of digits 3 and 5. In the center right block of nine cells, the two empty cells must again be 3 and 5. And in the center block of cells, the 5 digit is confined to three cells aligned with those two pairs of empty cells. If the 3 digit were also confined to the same three cells in the center block, it and the five would have to occupy the two diagonally aligned cells out of the three, because otherwise they would line up and prevent one of the other pairs of 3-5 cells from having any value. But then the 3-5 cells in row 3, the center block, and column 7 would form a closed system (shown by the red squares below): nothing else outside those cells could affect which of those six cells contains 3, and which contains 5. Within that closed system, there are two solutions, obtained from each other by swapping the locations of the 3 and the 5. But that would violate the assumption of uniqueness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Closed system of cells in a partially solved Sudoku puzzle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-closed.svg"/></p>

<p>Even if the 7 in the center cell weren’t there, the same reasoning would apply. Since this closed system with a non-unique solution would happen automatically if we confine the digit 3 to the same three center-block cells as the digit 5, the digit 3 must be elsewhere in the center block, which can only mean that it is in column 4. Once we make this deduction, the rest of the puzzle falls into place.</p>

<p>My program only has built into it a couple of ad-hoc rules to prevent closed systems of four cells with two solutions, and it misses the one in this example because it involves six cells. It’s making me think that I need a more general description of the possible closed systems (at least the ones involving only two digit values, like this), in order to match the deductions I’m making by hand and make my program’s difficulty estimates more accurate.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In this blog’s now 15-year-history, at Waterloo and then MIT and now UT Austin, I’ve tried to make it clear that I blog <em>always</em> as Scott, never as Dr. Aaronson of Such-and-Such Institution.  (God knows I’ve written a few things that a prudent dean might prefer that I hadn’t—though if I couldn’t honestly say that, in what sense would I even enjoy “academic freedom”?)  Today, though, for <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3167">only about</a> the second time, I’m also writing as a professor motivated by a duty of care toward his students.</p>



<p>A week ago, most of my grad students were in the Bay Area for a workshop; they then returned and spent a week hanging around the CS building like normal.  Yesterday I learned that at least one of those students developed symptoms consistent with covid19.  Of course, it’s much more likely to be a boring cold or flu—but still, in any sane regime, just to be certain, such a person would <strong>promptly get tested</strong>.</p>



<p>After quarantining himself, my student called the “24/7 covid19 hotline” listed in an email from the university’s president, but found no one answering the phone over the weekend.  Yesterday he finally got through—only to be told, flatly, that he couldn’t be tested due to insufficient capacity.  When I heard this, I asked my department chair and dean to look into the matter, and received confirmation that yeah, it sucks, but this is the situation.</p>



<p>If it’s true that, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/opinion/coronavirus-testing-new-york.html?fbclid=IwAR24o0pcDW2n6usYpyIC-bPhGUhoIkYAcvS_R4QvPv8yEdp0KsEF1XJWQv8">as I’ve read</a>, the same story is currently playing itself out all over the country, then this presumably isn’t the fault of anyone in UT’s health service or the city of Austin.  Rather, as they say in the movies, it goes all the way to the top, to the CDC director and ultimately the president—or rather, to the festering wound that now sits where the top used to be.</p>


<p>Speaking of movies, over the weekend Dana and I watched <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contagion-Marion-Cotillard/dp/B006IVBSBU">Contagion</a>, as apparently many people are now doing.  I confess that I’d missed it when it came out in 2011.  I think it’s a cinematic masterpiece.  It freely violates many of the rules of movie narrative: characters are neither done in by their own hubris, nor saved by their faith or by being A-list stars.  But <em>Contagion</em> is also more than a glorified public service announcement about the importance of washing your hands.  It wants to show you the reality of the human world of its characters, and <em>also</em> the reality of a virus, and how the two realities affect each other despite obeying utterly different logic.  It will show a scene that’s important to the charaters for human reasons, and then it will show you the same scene again, except this time making you focus on whose hand touched which surface in which order.<br/><!--StartFragment--></p>
<p>But for all its excellence and now-obvious prescience, there are two respects in which Contagion failed to predict the reality of 2020.  The first is just a lucky throw of the RNA dice: namely, that the real coronavirus is perhaps an order of magnitude less fatal than the movie virus, and for some unknown reason it spares children.  But the second difference is terrifying.  All the public health authorities in the movie are ultra-empowered and competent.  They do badass things like injecting themselves with experimental vaccines.  If they stumble, it’s only in deeply understandable ways that any of us might (e.g., warning their own loved ones to evacuate a city before warning the public).</p>
<p>In other words, when the scriptwriters, writing their disaster movie, tried to imagine the worst, they failed to imagine a US government that would essentially abandon the public, by</p>
<p>(1) botching a simple test that dozens of other countries performed without issue,<br/>(2) preventing anyone else from performing their own tests, and then<br/>(3) turning around and using the lack of positive test results to justify its own inaction.</p>
<p>They failed to imagine a CDC that might as well not exist for all it would do in its hour of need: one that <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1236967513008877568">didn’t even bother to update its website on weekends</a>, and stopped publishing data once the data became too embarrassing.  The scriptwriters <em>did</em> imagine a troll gleefully spreading lies about the virus online, endangering anyone who listened to him.  They failed to imagine a universe where that troll was the president.</p>


<p>“I mean, don’t get me wrong,” they told me.  “Trump is a racist con artist, a demagogue, the precise thing that Adams and Hamilton and Franklin tried to engineer our republic to avoid.  Just, don’t get so <em>depressed</em> about it all the time!  Moaning about how we’re trapped in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3294">freakishly horrible</a> branch of the wavefunction, blah blah.  I mean look on the bright side!  What an incredible run of luck we’ve had, that we elected a president with the mental horizons of a sadistic toddler, and yet <em>in three years he hasn’t caused even one apocalypse</em>.  You’re alive and healthy, your loved ones are alive and healthy.  It could be a lot worse!”</p>



<p>The above, I suspect, is a sentiment that will now forever date any writing containing it to January 2020 or earlier.</p></div>

    <title>Theorist Paul R Young passed away</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the early days of theoretical computer science, say 1960-1990 the main tools used were logic.<br/>
This made sense since, early on:<br/>
<br/>
a) Some of the basic notions like DTIME(T(n)), P, NP used Turing Machines in their definitions<br/>
<br/>
b) Some of the basic notions like reductions were modeled after similar concepts in<br/>
computability theory.<br/>
<br/>
One of the people who did much work in the interface between Logic and TCS was Paul Young.<br/>
He <a href="https://news.cs.washington.edu/2020/03/05/remembering-paul-young-1936-2019/">passed away</a> in December. Here are some highlights of his work:<br/>
<br/>
1) One of the first books that covered both computability and complexity:<br/>
<br/>
An Introduction to the general theory of Algorithms<br/>
by Machtey and Young.<br/>
<br/>
2) In Computability theory all many-one complete sets are computably isomorphic. Berman and<br/>
Hartmanis conjectured that the poly-many-one degree of the NP-complete sets was the same. This<br/>
would mean that all NP-complete sets were poly-isom (all of the known ones are).<br/>
<br/>
Mahaney and Young in the paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>Reductions Among Polynomial Isomorphism Types</i><br/>
<br/>
showed that every many-one poly degree either has one degree or has an infinite number of<br/>
degrees in a very complicated way.<br/>
<br/>
3) Recall that a <i>Cook Reduction from A to B </i>allows many queries to B, whereas a <i>Karp Reduction</i><br/>
only allows one query and your answer must be the same sense as the query.<br/>
Are there  cases where a Cook reduction is faster? Yes, from the paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>Cook reducibility is faster than Karp Reducibility</i><br/>
<br/>
by Longpre and Young<br/>
<br/>
(The original title was going to be <i>Cook is Faster than Karp</i>, but it was changed since it invoked<br/>
images of Cook and Karp in a footrace.  Hmmm. Which one would be faster?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4) The <i>Boolean Hierarchy </i>is a hierarchy of iterations of NP sets. What if instead of starting with P<br/>
one started with RP (Randomized Poly time). What an intriguing notion! To find out read<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Generalized Boolean Hierarchies over RP</i><br/>
<br/>
by  Alberto Bertoni, Danilo Bruschi, Deborah Joseph, Meera Sitharam, Paul Young<br/>
<br/>
5) There are many more, mostly on the theme of the interaction of logic and computer science.<br/>
<br/>
                       I saw him speak on some of these topics and was inspired by how much one could<br/>
take notions of computability and translate them into complexity theory.  The field has gone in a<br/>
different direction since then (more combinatorial) but we still use many of the basic concepts<br/>
like reducibility.  As such we all owe a debit to Paul Young.</div>
