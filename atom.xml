function-value based stationary regret as the performance measure. In this
paper, we propose and analyze bandit algorithms for both general and structured
nonconvex problems with nonstationary (or dynamic) regret as the performance
measure, in both stochastic and non-stochastic settings. First, for general
nonconvex functions, we consider nonstationary versions of first-order and
second-order stationary solutions as a regret measure, motivated by similar
performance measures for offline nonconvex optimization. In the case of
second-order stationary solution based regret, we propose and analyze online
and bandit versions of the cubic regularized Newton's method. The bandit
version is based on estimating the Hessian matrices in the bandit setting,
based on second-order Gaussian Stein's identity. Our nonstationary regret
bounds in terms of second-order stationary solutions have interesting
consequences for avoiding saddle points in the bandit setting. Next, for weakly
quasi convex functions and monotone weakly submodular functions we consider
nonstationary regret measures in terms of function-values; such structured
classes of nonconvex functions enable one to consider regret measure defined in
terms of function values, similar to convex functions. For this case of
function-value, and first-order stationary solution based regret measures, we
provide regret bounds in both the low- and high-dimensional settings, for some
scenarios.

number $\lambda$ of slopes. For proper level graphs, we give an $O(n \log^2 n /
\log \log n)$-time algorithm that either finds such a drawing or determines
that no such drawing exists. Moreover, we consider the partial drawing
extension problem, where we seek to extend an immutable drawing of a subgraph
to a drawing of the whole graph, and the simultaneous drawing problem, which
asks about the existence of drawings of two graphs whose restrictions to their
shared subgraph coincide. We present $O(n^{4/3} \log n)$-time and $O({\lambda}
n^{10/3} \log n)$-time algorithms for these respective problems on proper
level-planar graphs. We complement these positive results by showing that
testing whether non-proper level graphs admit level-planar drawings with
$\lambda$ slopes is $\textsf{NP}$-hard even in restricted cases.

    <title>Evolutionary Dataset Optimisation: learning algorithm quality through evolution</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1564617600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Henry Wilde, Vincent Knight, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Gillard:Jonathan.html">Jonathan Gillard</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13508">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we propose a new method for learning how algorithms perform.
Classically, algorithms are compared on a finite number of existing (or newly
simulated) benchmark data sets based on some fixed metrics. The algorithm(s)
with the smallest value of this metric are chosen to be the `best performing'.
</p>
<p>We offer a new approach to flip this paradigm. We instead aim to gain a
richer picture of the performance of an algorithm by generating artificial data
through genetic evolution, the purpose of which is to create populations of
datasets for which a particular algorithm performs well. These data sets can be
studied to learn as to what attributes lead to a particular progress of a given
algorithm.
</p>
<p>Following a detailed description of the algorithm as well as a brief
description of an open source implementation, a number of numeric experiments
are presented to show the performance of the method which we call Evolutionary
Dataset Optimisation.

    <title>Influence Maximization with Few Simulations</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1564617600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Gal Sadeh, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Cohen:Edith.html">Edith Cohen</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kaplan:Haim.html">Haim Kaplan</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13301">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Influence maximization (IM) is the problem of finding a set of $s$ nodes in a
network with maximum influence. We consider models such as the classic
Independent Cascade (IC) model of Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos
\cite{KKT:KDD2003} where influence is defined to be the expectation over {\em
simulations} (random sets of live edges) of the size of the reachability set of
the seed nodes. In such models the influence function is unbiasedly
approximated by an average over a set of i.i.d.\ simulations. A fundamental
question is to bound the IM {\em sample complexity}: The number of simulations
needed to determine an approximate maximizer. An upper bound of $O( s n
\epsilon^{-2} \ln \frac{n}{\delta})$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the
network and $1-\delta$ the desired confidence applies to all models. We provide
a sample complexity bound of $O( s \tau \epsilon^{-2} \ln \frac{n}{\delta})$
for a family of models that includes the IC model, where $\tau$ (generally
$\tau \ll n$) is the step limit of the diffusion. Algorithmically, we show how
to adaptively detect when a smaller number of simulations suffices. We also
design an efficient greedy algorithm that computes a
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximate maximizer from simulation averages. Influence
maximization from simulation-averages is practically appealing as it is robust
to dependencies and modeling errors but was believed to be less efficient than
other methods in terms of required data and computation. Our work shows that we
can have both robustness and efficiency.

Nature of Computation or as a standalone resource, and are available to anyone

</p>
<p>I emphasize that automata are elementary playgrounds where we can explore the
issues of deterministic and nondeterministic computation. Unlike P vs. NP, we
can prove that nondeterminism is equivalent to determinism, or strictly more
powerful than determinism, in finite-state and push-down automata respectively.
I also correct several historical and aesthetic injustices: in particular, the
Myhill-Nerode theorem and the idea of building minimal DFAs from equivalence
classes of prefixes is restored to its rightful place above the Pumping Lemma
for regular languages. I also discuss the Pumping Lemma for context-free
languages, and briefly discuss counter automata, queue automata, and the
connection between unambiguous context-free languages and algebraic generating
functions.

The affine perimeter of a convex curve is an affine-equivariant number in units of length, zero for polygons and larger for smooth curves. And the limit shape of a convex set is what you get by taking a uniformly random convex subset of a grid within the set, in the limit as the grid becomes very fine; it turns out to be the max-affine-perimeter curve contained in the set.</p>

    <title>An interview with Noga Alon</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Update: and here is a great interview of Noga in English and the interviewer is Narkis Alon, Noga’s youngest daughter and Amalya Duek.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Update</strong>: and here is a <a href="http://www.careeryoga.life/440ebcdf?fbclid=IwAR2BWeyMdhTg2fbdHp5U-D9gCy2oqLZBk2ljRBMhjtyAEtSgqBCt7kMlSFk">great interview</a> of Noga in English and the interviewer is Narkis Alon, Noga’s youngest daughter and Amalya Duek.</p>
<p>I was very happy to interview my academic doctoral  twin and long-time friend Noga Alon.  <a href="https://youtu.be/9PhckP9eJhg">The interview</a> is an initiative of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. (This is my second interview of this kind. See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/15/an-interview-with-yisrael-robert-aumann/">here</a> for an interview with Yisrael Aumann.) The interview is in Hebrew.</p>
<p/>
<p>For our English speaking readers here is a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/rwiEiGqgetU">Numberphile video</a> with Noga.</p>
<p>We agreed in advance that most of the interview would be about mathematics, and  most of the time  we courageously (and perhaps somewhat recklessly)  tried to explain to a large audience  (starting from scratch) some of Noga’s research directions and results. We hope that people will enjoy the beauty of it even with the missing details and background.</p>
<h3>Noga’s parents, family and childhood</h3>
<p>In the first part of the  interview  Noga talked about his family, his parents, Dror and Hemda, his great uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigal_Allon">Yigal Alon</a>, his early childhood, and his early interest in mathematics. Noga liked to solve mathematical riddles from a young age. One reason Noga was drawn to mathematics is that unlike other topics, in mathematics there are absolute truths, and a mathematical proof (when such exists)  is perhaps the only way you can settle a debate. Noga gave an amusing example from his youth regarding the Eurovision song context. Then he mentioned the <a href="https://www.reali.org.il/en/%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%94-%d7%a9%d7%a0%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%a8%d7%99%d7%90%d7%9c%d7%99/">Hebrew Reali school in Haifa</a>, a mathematics teacher there, Yaakov Kaplan,  newly immigrated from the former Soviet Union, who greatly influenced Noga. Noga also talked about his participation in the Israeli Mathematical Olympiad where the two of us first met 45 years ago.  Next, the two of us met during our military service, and in parallel to his service, Noga finished his M. Sc. and Ph. D with Micha A. Perles, who was also my supervisor.</p>
<h3>An hour of mathematics</h3>
<p>The mathematical part of the video starts with Noga’s  overview of combinatorics. Then we moved to specific topics.</p>
<p>(22:40- 33:30) Noga’s negative solution to Shannon’s conjecture about the capacity of two graphs (and a little about Claude Shannon and information theory)</p>
<p>(33:30- 40:25) The combinatorial nullstellensatz and the polynomial method and a little about the game SET</p>
<p>(40:25 – 46:50) The probabilistic method and a little on the history of probability and about Paul Erdos.</p>
<p>(46:50-  54:50)  Streaming algorithms, a topic introduced by Noga Alon, Yossi Matias, and Mario Szegedy, and more generally, about positive and negative results in computer science, and their practical applications.</p>
<p>(54:50 – 59:25)    Expander graphs and “spectroscopy of graphs”</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/noga1.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17717" height="326" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/noga1.png?w=640&amp;h=326" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>59:25  -1:05:40 Ramsey theory</p>
<p>1:05:40-1:12:20 Factoring integers with quantum computers and with classical methods</p>
<p>1:12:00-1:20:00 Combinatorics, economics and game theory:  Noga’s theorem that large committees require a large budget!</p>
<h3>Going back from mathematics to life itself</h3>
<p>After a full hour of mathematics, we returned to life itself. Memories from our years as postdocs at MIT, and our 1993 conference in Jerusalem. Noga talked a little about women in science and in society, about his three daughters, about  the possibility that science, like sport,  can bridge different groups and different peoples, and about politics and prospects for better relations with our Arab neighbors and Iran (Noga is somewhat optimistic and so am I),  prospects about getting old (we are hopeful about it), and advice to young researchers. Noga’s message at the end was that there are many paths to mathematical research and he encouraged young people that like mathematics to follow and enjoy them.</p>

	Sébastien Tavenas</title>
    <summary>Inspired by Nisan's characterization of noncommutative complexity (Nisan 1991), we study different notions of nonnegative rank, associated complexity measures and their link with monotone computations. In particular we answer negatively an open question of Nisan asking whether nonnegative rank characterizes monotone noncommutative complexity for algebraic branching programs. We also prove a rather tight lower bound for the computation of elementary symmetric polynomials by algebraic branching programs in the monotone setting or, equivalently, in the homogeneous syntactically multilinear setting.</summary>

    <title>On the Robustness of Median Sampling in Noisy Evolutionary Optimization</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bian:Chao.html">Chao Bian</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/q/Qian:Chao.html">Chao Qian</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/y/Yu:Yang.html">Yang Yu</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13100">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In real-world optimization tasks, the objective (i.e., fitness) function
evaluation is often disturbed by noise due to a wide range of uncertainties.
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely applied to tackle noisy
optimization, where reducing the negative effect of noise is a crucial issue.
One popular strategy to cope with noise is sampling, which evaluates the
fitness multiple times and uses the sample average to approximate the true
fitness. In this paper, we introduce median sampling as a noise handling
strategy into EAs, which uses the median of the multiple evaluations to
approximate the true fitness instead of the mean. We theoretically show that
median sampling can reduce the expected running time of EAs from exponential to
polynomial by considering the (1+1)-EA on OneMax under the commonly used
one-bit noise. We also compare mean sampling with median sampling by
considering two specific noise models, suggesting that when the 2-quantile of
the noisy fitness increases with the true fitness, median sampling can be a
better choice. The results provide us with some guidance to employ median
sampling efficiently in practice.

    <title>Atomic Embeddability, Clustered Planarity, and Thickenability</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1564531200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Fulek:Radoslav.html">Radoslav Fulek</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/T=oacute=th:Csaba_D=.html">Csaba D. Tóth</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13086">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the atomic embeddability testing problem, which is a common
generalization of clustered planarity (c-planarity, for short) and
thickenability testing, and present a polynomial time algorithm for this
problem, thereby giving the first polynomial time algorithm for c-planarity.
</p>
<p>C-planarity was introduced in 1995 by Feng, Cohen, and Eades as a variant of
graph planarity, in which the vertex set of the input graph is endowed with a
hierarchical clustering and we seek an embedding (crossing free drawing) of the
graph in the plane that respects the clustering in a certain natural sense.
Until now, it has been an open problem whether c-planarity can be tested
efficiently, despite relentless efforts. The thickenability problem for
simplicial complexes emerged in the topology of manifolds in the 1960s. A
2-dimensional simplicial complex is thickenable if it embeds in some orientable
3-dimensional manifold. Recently, Carmesin announced that thickenability can be
tested in polynomial time.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm for atomic embeddability combines ideas from Carmesin's work
with algorithmic tools previously developed for weak embeddability testing. We
express our results purely in terms of graphs on surfaces, and rely on the
machinery of topological graph theory.
</p>
<p>Finally we give a polynomial-time reduction from c-planarity to
thickenability and show that a slight generalization of atomic embeddability to
the setting in which clusters are toroidal graphs is NP-complete.

search algorithms. For graph search, A* can require $\Omega(2^{n})$ expansions,
where $n$ is the number of states within the final $f$ bound. Existing
algorithms that address this problem like B and B' improve this bound to
$\Omega(n^2)$. For tree search, IDA* can also require $\Omega(n^2)$ expansions.
We describe a new algorithmic framework that iteratively controls an expansion
budget and solution cost limit, giving rise to new graph and tree search
algorithms for which the number of expansions is $O(n \log C)$, where $C$ is
the optimal solution cost. Our experiments show that the new algorithms are
robust in scenarios where existing algorithms fail. In the case of tree search,
our new algorithms have no overhead over IDA* in scenarios to which IDA* is
well suited and can therefore be recommended as a general replacement for IDA*.

optimization, and $k$-submodularity is a generalization of submodularity.
Maximization of a $k$-submodular function requires an exponential number of
value oracle queries, and approximation algorithms have been studied. For
unconstrained $k$-submodular maximization, Iwata et al. gave randomized
$k/(2k-1)$-approximation algorithm for monotone functions, and randomized
$1/2$-approximation algorithm for nonmonotone functions. In this paper, we
present improved randomized algorithms for nonmonotone functions. Our algorithm
gives $\frac{k^2+1}{2k^2+1}$-approximation for $k\geq 3$. We also give a
randomized $\frac{\sqrt{17}-3}{2}$-approximation algorithm for $k=3$. We use
the same framework used in Iwata et al. and Ward and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} with
different probabilities.

complexity of equilibrium approximation problems. However, in this paper, we
reveal that they have a conceptual flaw, namely that the solution concept is
not monotonic. By this we mean that if $\varepsilon &lt; \varepsilon'$, then an
$\varepsilon$-approximate solution for a certain generalized circuit is not
necessarily also an $\varepsilon'$-approximate solution. The reason for this
non-monotonicity is the way Boolean operations are modeled. We illustrate that
non-monotonicity creates subtle technical issues in prior work that require
intricate additional arguments to circumvent. To eliminate this problem, we
show that the Boolean gates are a redundant feature: one can simulate stronger,
monotonic versions of the Boolean gates using the other gate types. Arguing at
the level of these stronger Boolean gates eliminates all of the aforementioned
issues in a natural way. We hope that our results will enable new studies of
sub-classes of generalized circuits and enabler simpler and more natural
reductions from generalized circuits to other equilibrium search problems.

a quartic speedup while using exponentially smaller space than the fastest
classical spectral algorithm, and a super-polynomial speedup over classical
algorithms that use only polynomial space. The classical algorithms that we

Ref. 1. In particular, we have an improved threshold for recovery and the

pretending to be a weak verifier talking with all-powerful provers. To achieve
this, simulators need some kind of advantage such as the knowledge of a
trapdoor. In existing zero-knowledge multi-prover protocols, this advantage is
essentially signalling, something that the provers are explicitly forbidden to
do. In most cases, this advantage is stronger than necessary as it is possible
to define a sense in which simulators need much less to simulate. We define a
framework in which we can quantify the simulators' non-local advantage and
exhibit examples of zero-knowledge protocols that are sound against local or
entangled provers but that are not sound against no-signalling provers
precisely because the no-signalling simulation strategy can be adopted by
malicious provers.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>For those who haven’t yet seen it, Erica Klarreich has a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/">wonderful article in </a><em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/">Quanta</a></em> on Hao Huang’s proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture.  <em>This</em> is how good popular writing about math can be.</p>



<p>Klarreich quotes my line from this blog, “I find it hard to imagine that even God knows how to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture in any simpler way than this.”  However, even if God doesn’t know a simpler proof, that of course doesn’t rule out the possibility that <strong>Don Knuth</strong> does!  And indeed, a couple days ago Knuth posted <a href="https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/huang.pdf">his own variant of Huang’s proof</a> on his homepage—in Knuth’s words, fleshing out the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1813084">argument</a> that Shalev Ben-David previously posted on this blog—and then left a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1815290">comment</a> about it here, the first comment by Knuth that I know about on this blog or any other blog.  I’m honored—although as for whether the variants that avoid the Cauchy Interlacing Theorem are actually “simpler,” I guess I’ll leave that between Huang, Ben-David, Knuth, and God.</p>



<p>In <em>Communications of the ACM</em>, Samuel Greengard has a <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/8/238339-the-algorithm-that-changed-quantum-machine-learning/fulltext?mobile=false">good, detailed article</a> on Ewin Tang and her dequantization of the quantum recommendation systems algorithm.  One warning (with thanks to commenter Ted): the sentence “The only known provable separation theorem between quantum and classical is sqrt(<em>n</em>) vs. <em>n</em>” is mistaken, though it gestures in the direction of a truth.  In the <em>black-box</em> setting, we can rigorously prove all sorts of separations: sqrt(<em>n</em>) vs. <em>n</em> (for Grover search), exponential (for period-finding), and more.  In the non-black-box setting, we can’t prove any such separations at all.</p>



<p>Last week I returned to the US from the <a href="https://fqxi.org/conference/home/2019">FQXi meeting</a> in the Tuscan countryside.  This year’s theme was “Mind Matters: Intelligence and Agency in the Physical World.”  I gave a talk entitled “The Search for Physical Correlates of Consciousness: Lessons from the Failure of Integrated Information Theory” (<a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/iitfail.ppt">PowerPoint slides here</a>), which reprised my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1799">blog</a> <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1823">posts</a> critical of IIT from five years ago.  There were thought-provoking talks by many others who might be known to readers of this blog, including Sean Carroll, David Chalmers, Max Tegmark, Seth Lloyd, Carlo Rovelli, Karl Friston … you can see the full schedule <a href="https://fqxi.org/conference/schedule/2019">here</a>.  Apparently video of the talks is not available yet but will be soon.</p>



<p>Let me close this post by sharing two important new insights about quantum mechanics that emerged from my conversations at the FQXi meeting:</p>



<p>(1) In Hilbert space, no one can hear you scream. Unless, that is, you scream the exact same way everywhere, or unless you split into separate copies, one for each different way of screaming.</p>



<p>(2) It’s true that, as a matter of logic, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Schrödinger equation</a> does not imply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule">Born Rule</a>.  Having said that, if the Schrödinger equation were leading a rally, and the crowd started a chant of “BORN RULE! BORN RULE! BORN RULE!”—the Schrödinger equation would just smile and wait 13 seconds for the chant to die down before continuing.</p></div>

    <title>A zipless polycube</title>
    <summary>My latest arXiv preprint is “Some polycubes have no edge-unzipping” (arXiv:1907.08433, with Erik and Marty Demaine and Joe O’Rourke). It’s about polyhedral unfolding, the problem of cutting a polyhedron along some of its edges into a surface that unfolds into a flat polygon in the plane (a “net”). Although it dates back to the work of Albrecht Dürer, we still don’t know a lot about this problem, in general. We don’t know whether every convex polyhedron has an unfolding, and we don’t know whether every polycube has a folding (allowing cuts in the middle of flat faces as long as they are on boundary edges of the cubes making up the polycube).</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My latest arXiv preprint is “Some polycubes have no edge-unzipping” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08433">arXiv:1907.08433</a>, with Erik and Marty Demaine and Joe O’Rourke). It’s about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(polyhedron)">polyhedral unfolding</a>, the problem of cutting a polyhedron along some of its edges into a surface that unfolds into a flat polygon in the plane (a “net”). Although it dates back to the work of Albrecht Dürer, we still don’t know a lot about this problem, in general. We don’t know whether every convex polyhedron has an unfolding, and we don’t know whether every polycube has a folding (allowing cuts in the middle of flat faces as long as they are on boundary edges of the cubes making up the polycube).</p>

<p>The preprint is about a variation of unfolding in which the cut has to form a path through the graph of vertices and edges. If the polyhedron has the topology of a sphere and there are no flat vertices (with a full  total angle of surrounding faces) then all vertices must be touched by a cut, and it’s the same thing to ask for an unfolding that forms a Hamiltonian path. These zipper-unfoldings have previously been studied, notably in joint work by two parent-child groups, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2010/08/12/more-from-cccg.html">Marty and his son Erik, and Anna Lubiw and her two sons Arlo and Jonah from CCCG 2010</a>. The new preprint shows that they don’t always exist for (topologically spherical) polycubes. In particular, the following shape has no flat vertices, but its graph is bipartite and unbalanced enough that it also has no Hamiltonian path.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A zipless polycube" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/zipless.png"/></p>

<p>It does have an unfolding, though (figure made by Erik using <a href="https://github.com/amandaghassaei/OrigamiSimulator">OrigamiSimulator</a>):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Unfolding a zipless polycube" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/zipless.gif"/></p>

<p>The paper also has a smaller example that’s a little tricker to prove zipless. It’s a small enough advance that we probably won’t bother trying to turn it into a conference or journal paper. (If it were just me, I’d probably have just made a blog post about it. And here we are!)</p>

    <title>TR19-099 |  Nearly Optimal Pseudorandomness From Hardness | 

	Dean Doron, 

	David Zuckerman, 

	Dana Moshkovitz, 

	Justin Oh</title>
    <summary>Existing proofs that deduce $\mathbf{BPP}=\mathbf{P}$ from circuit lower bounds convert randomized algorithms into deterministic algorithms with a large polynomial slowdown. We convert randomized algorithms into deterministic ones with little slowdown. Specifically, assuming exponential lower bounds against nondeterministic circuits, we convert any randomized algorithm over inputs of length $n$ running in time $t \ge n$ to a deterministic one running in time $t^{2+\alpha}$ for an arbitrarily small constant $\alpha &gt; 0$. Such a slowdown is nearly optimal, as, under complexity-theoretic assumptions, there are problems with an inherent quadratic derandomization slowdown. We also convert any randomized algorithm that errs rarely into a deterministic algorithm having a similar running time (with pre-processing).

Our results follow from a new, nearly optimal, explicit pseudorandom generator fooling circuits of size $s$ with seed length $(1+\alpha)\log s$, under the assumption that there exists a function $f \in \mathbf{E}$ that requires nondeterministic circuits of size at least $2^{(1-\alpha')n}$, where $\alpha = O(\alpha')$. The construction uses, among other ideas, a new connection between pseudoentropy generators and locally list recoverable codes.</summary>

    <title>Turing to be on the Bank of England 50 pound note, giving me an excuse to talk about Turing</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BILL: Darling, guess who is soon going to be on the Bank of England 50 pound note?<br/>
<br/>
DARLING: Alan Turing. <br/>
<br/>
BILL: How did you deduce that? (She is right, see  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48962557">here</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
DARLING: Since you asked it, it couldn't be a member of the Royal Family (you don't care about that) or some British Politician (you don't care about that either). It had to be a mathematician or computer scientist.<br/>
<br/>
BILL: It could have been Hardy. I wonder if Ramanujan could qualify---do they need to be British? At <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/banknote-characters">this website</a> it says<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course, banknotes need to be universally accepted. We therefore look for UK characters who have made an important contribution to our society and culture through their innovation, leadership or values. We do not include fictional characters, or people who are still living (except the monarch on the front of the note). Finally, we need to have a suitable portrait of the person which will be easy to recognise.</i><br/>
<br/>
(They spell <i>recognise</i> with an s instead of a z, so spellcheck flagged it, but I won't change it.) <br/>
<br/>
Note that people on the banknotes have to be <i>UK characters</i>. I honestly don't know if that means they must be citizens.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY, so here are a few thoughts on Turing.<br/>
<br/>
1) When I visited Bletchley Park there was a booklet that bragged about the fact that Bletchley Park was much better at cracking codes than Germany because  they allowed people to work there based only on ability (unlike Germany) - women worked there, Turing who was Gay worked there. I think this is simplistic. Did any Jews work there (anti-semitism was widespread in England, and the world, at the time)? I doubt any blacks worked there since if they did that would be well known by now (if I am wrong let me know). Women DID work there but was their work respected and used? (I honestly don't know). Did Germany also use women at their codebreaking centers? Was Turing known to be gay (if not then Bletchley gets no points for tolerating him). Was JUST having Turing the reason they could crack codes. Plus I am sure there were other factors aside from merit-only.<br/>
<br/>
2) Turing was given a Pardon for his ``crimes'' in August 2014. When I see things like this I wonder who was against it and why and if they were an obstacle.<br/>
<br/>
a) Human Rights Advocate Peter Tatchell noted that its wrong to just single out Turing. Other people prosecuted under that law who did not help beat the German's in WW II should also be pardoned. The government later DID such a pardon in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
b) Judge Minister Lord McNally objected to the pardon:<br/>
<br/>
<i>A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence. He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort. However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.<br/>
</i><br/>
<br/>
While I disagree with him, I do note that, based on what he wrote and his general record, I think he is not saying this from being anti-gay.  There is  a hard general question here: how does a society right past wrongs? I think pardoning and apologizing is certainly fine, but frankly it seems to weak. What else could a society due? Financial renumeration to living relatives? I don't think giving Inagh Payne (Turing's niece, who I think is still alive) would really help here.<br/>
<br/>
c) <i>At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage<br/>
</i><br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find Chope's reasons. On the one hand, they may be similar to McNally's. On the other hand he is against same sex marriage so its possible (though I do not know this) that he anti-gay and that is why he is against the pardon. If someone can find what his explanation for blocking the Turing bill is, or other evidence that he is anti-gay, please leave it in the comments.<br/>
<br/>
3) Did the delay matter? I was surprised to find out---Yes. Here is the full passage from Wikipedia:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage. The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014,[175] but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons,[176] the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for "gross indecency", with immediate effect.[17] Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be "remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort" and not for his later criminal conviction.[16][18] The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.[177] The Queen's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War.[178] Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested party; neither condition was met in regard to Turing's conviction.[179]</i><br/>
<br/>
This amazed me! I thought the Queen had NO power (too bad--- I wish she could just say NO BREXIT). Or that she formally has power but if she ever used it, it might be blocked somehow and  taken away. So I am surprised she has a power she can use at all.<br/>
<br/>
4) I wonder if the Pardon had to happen before they put him on the Banknote. I have been told that this is a very American Question--- England has no Constitution and operates more on Custom and Tradition than on written rules. <br/>
<br/>
5) I had always assumed that Turing committed suicide. Without going into detail, the Wikipedia site on Turing does give intelligent counterarguments to this. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death">here</a><br/></div>

    <title>Any-order puzzle deduction</title>
    <summary>I recently wrote here about a complication in puzzle-solving where, in using deductive rules based on the assumption that the puzzle has a unique solution, the ordering of the rules could make a difference in how far you get in the solution. And avoiding this ordering issue by keeping track of more information than just the state of the partially solved puzzle leads to its own difficulties. It seemed like keeping this information could lose you in a maze of undecidable modal logic. For instance in the map coloring puzzle described in that post, we might record information about a partial solution like “I don’t know that this cell is forced to be red, but it is necessary for it to be red in order to prevent a non-unique solution”, with the complexity of these statements growing as the solution progressed. Instead, what I wanted was a way to make decisions without worrying about the order of deduction while only remembering a finite amount of state for each puzzle cell. In the ensuing discussion, @axiom suggested that the extra information should be the order of deductions. That’s not a constant amount of information per cell, but as we’ll see below it works to simplify this even more and remember only which cells were the initial givens and which were deduced later.</summary>

That’s not a constant amount of information per cell, but as we’ll see below it works to simplify this even more and remember only which cells were the initial givens and which were deduced later.</p>

<p>To clarify the intuition that deduction order should not matter, I want to formalize the state of a partially-solved puzzle as a collection of bits, initially all true. In map coloring, each bit could represent the possibility that a given cell is a particular color, and we want to eventually have one true bit per cell and the rest false. A deduction is a change to a single bit. Each deduction is triggered by a rule, which typically searches for certain patterns in the state. For instance, in map coloring, the pattern that one cell has only one remaining color whose bit is true can trigger the deduction that the same color’s bit in a neighboring cell must be false. Any given deduction could be triggered by more than one rule, or by more than one instance of the same rule. Then these rules and deductions should obey some natural properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The deductions can only go in one direction. If we deduce that a bit is false, we won’t later change it back to true.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deductions are always valid for the intended puzzle. That is, when a puzzle has a unique solution, we won’t ever deduce anything inconsistent with that solution. (However, when that assumption is violated, anything can happen.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be possible to efficiently identify all deductions that can be triggered from the current state. Ideally this should take polynomial time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a deduction is triggered by one of the rules, it remains triggered until that deduction step is performed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not assuming that the deduction system is complete, i.e., that it will  reach the intended puzzle solution for all puzzles. For most natural puzzle types and most efficiently-searchable sets of deduction rules, it won’t be complete, and most likely (because of NP-completeness or related complexity issues) cannot be both complete and efficiently searchable. But nevertheless, a system of rules obeying these properties always reaches a unique state, independent of deduction order. It is the last of these properties that enforces this order-invariance. By induction on the values in the triggering patterns, each deduction that could be made by some order of deduction steps will eventually be made by a greedy algorithm that chooses deductions in an arbitrary order until it gets stuck.</p>

<p>The “remains triggered until performed” criterion should sound familiar. It is the defining property of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroid</a>, a collection of orderings of items (here, orderings of deductions that could be made by the greedy algorithm) with the property that once an item becomes available to be added to an ordering, it remains available until it actually is added. The antimatroid name is a bit technical and off-putting, but these structures come up all the time in many different applications. I’ve written here about

So why not add puzzle deduction to the list?</p>

<p>A nice side-effect of using deduction rules with these properties is that, if the rules are ordered by difficulty, then a greedy algorithm that always chooses the easiest rule at each step will automatically find a deduction sequence minimizing the difficulty of the hardest rule that it uses. This can be helpful in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0507053">using deduction algorithms to automatically estimate the difficulty of a puzzle for a human solver</a>.</p>

<p>A natural way to achieve the “remains triggered until performed” property for a deduction rule is to use a pattern in the form of a monotonic Boolean combination of state bits (a function that can be expressed using only Boolean and and or operations, without negation) and to trigger a deduction when that combination becomes false. In this way, we achieve a stronger property, that once triggered the deduction remains triggered forever (even after it has already been performed). But as we’ll see below, other kinds of rules can also have the same property.</p>

<p>Now back to map coloring.</p>

<p>We saw in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/06/07/little-knowledge-can.html">my earlier post</a> that it doesn’t work well to use rules like “if one cell has already-colored neighbors of two colors, and only one uncolored neighbor, then that neighbor cannot be either of the same two colors”. These rules are valid (under the assumption that the puzzle solution is unique) but lose information about why the deduction on the neighboring vertex was made, preventing later deductions from being made.</p>

<p>Instead, the insight I ended up using involves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempe_chain">Kempe chains</a>. A Kempe chain, in a colored map, is a maximal connected subset of the cells of two of the colors. If the coloring is to be unique, every Kempe chain must be anchored by one of the original givens of the puzzle, for otherwise we could swap the two colors in the chain without affecting the rest of the graph. So, I’ve started using rules of the form “if this Kempe chain in the partially colored map is not yet anchored, and can reach an anchor only by extending through this other cell, then that cell cannot be a third color”. Here, the Kempe chains that I examine to trigger this rule are maximal connected subsets of the cells whose colors are limited to some set of two colors, allowing cells that are already known to have only one of those two colors. Until we add the extension cell to the chain, the same rule will continue to be triggered, so this passes the any-order requirements above.</p>

<p>This deduction method also fits well into the visualization tools available for manual puzzle-solving in <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">Simon Tatham’s puzzle collection</a>, where I found the map puzzle. This collection’s implementation of the map puzzle shows the givens and solved cells as solid colors, and allows unsolved cells to be marked by dots of any combination of the four colors. So I’ve been using these dots to indicate the remaining colors available for each cell, in cases when the deductions get complicated enough that I can’t just remember them without marking them. A cell that has dots of only one color rather than a solid color is effectively solved (we know what color it is going to end up being) but might still belong to some unanchored Kempe chains. Once all three Kempe chains through a cell of known color have been anchored, I color that cell as solid. In this way, the parts of the solution that might include unanchored Kempe chains typically remain small and distinctively colored, making the chains easy to spot.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Screenshot of the map puzzle from Simon Tatham's puzzle collection" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/map-puzzle-kempe-chain.png"/></p>

<p>The image above shows an example, from one of the hardest built-in difficulty levels of the puzzle (“20x15, 30 regions, Unreasonable”). An orange-brown Kempe chain can be seen in the bottom left, in the two cells colored by orange and brown dots. (Yes, I know these two colors are hard to tell apart; I can’t change them.) Its only escape cell has yellow and brown neighbors, and cannot be green (leaving the orange-brown chain unanchored), so it must be orange. This set of deductions allows us in turn to infer the colors of the other two cells in the chain, and to make them solid (their three Kempe chains all become anchored). The orange escape cell becomes dotted rather than solid, because it is part of a different Kempe chain (colored orange-green) that remains unanchored.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Screenshot of the map puzzle from Simon Tatham's puzzle collection" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/map-puzzle-kempe-chain-2.png"/></p>

<p>This extended deduction rule seems to be working well for the puzzles I’ve tried it on. And by obeying the requirement that deductions remain triggered until performed, it gives me confidence that I’m not hiding any usable information by doing my deductions in the wrong order. There is no wrong order: any order in which I make my deductions will eventually lead me to the same state.</p>

    <title>TR19-098 |  Domain Compression and its Application to Randomness-Optimal Distributed Goodness-of-Fit |

    <summary>We study goodness-of-fit of discrete distributions in the distributed setting, where samples are divided between multiple users who can only release a limited amount of information about their samples due to various information constraints. Recently, a subset of the authors showed that having access to a common random seed (i.e., shared randomness) leads to a significant reduction in the sample complexity of this problem. In this work, we provide a complete understanding of the interplay between the amount of shared randomness available, the stringency of information constraints, and the sample complexity of the testing problem by characterizing a tight trade-off between these three parameters. We provide a general distributed goodness-of-fit protocol that as a function of the amount of shared randomness interpolates smoothly between the private- and public-coin sample complexities. We complement our upper bound with a general framework to prove lower bounds on the sample complexity of this testing problems under limited shared randomness. Finally, we instantiate our bounds for the two archetypal information constraints of communication and local privacy, and show that our sample complexity bounds are optimal as a function of all the parameters of the problem, including the amount of shared randomness.

A key component of our upper bounds is a new primitive of domain compression, a tool that allows us to map distributions to a much smaller domain size while preserving their pairwise distances, using a limited amount of randomness.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A few months ago, I was delighted to see the University of California <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/uc-elsevier-publisher/583909/">holding on to its demands</a> in its negotiations with Elsevier. The U.C. wanted to renegotiate its contract so that, in addition to having access to the subscribed journals, U.C. scholars could publish in them with open access (that is, so that anybody in the world would have free access to the articles written by U.C. scholars).</p>
<p>This seemed like a reasonable model to balance profitability for publishers and open access, but there was no way to agree on it with Elsevier. Meanwhile, U.C. has not renewed its Elsevier subscriptions and Elsevier has cut off access to U.C. libraries.</p>
<p>I was very impressed to see the University of California central administration do something right, so I wondered if this was the kind of portent that is a harbinger of the apocalypse, or just a fluke. Subsequent events suggest the latter.</p>
<p>The University of California has spent a lot of time and money to build a centralized system for job applications and for job applicant review. I was first made aware of this when I chaired the recruiting committee for the Simons Director position. At first we were told that we could solicit applications through the (vastly superior) EECS-built system for job applications and reviews. After the application deadline passed, we were told that, in fact, we could <i>not</i> use the EECS system, and so the already overworked EECS faculty HR person had to manually copy all the data in the central campus system. </p>
<p>The American Mathematical Society has created a wonderfully functional system, called <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs">Mathjobs</a> where applicants for academic mathematics jobs (ranging from postdocs to professorship) can upload their application material once, and their recommenders can upload their letters once, and then all the universities that the candidate applies to have access to this material. Furthermore, if needed, both applicants and recommenders can tailor-make their material for a particular university or universities, if they want to.</p>
<p>Everybody was living happily, but not ever after, because the U.C. central campus administration decided that <i>everybody</i> in the University of California had to use the centralized system for <i>all</i> jobs. Both the AMS and U.C. mathematicians tried to find a reasonable accommodation, such as allowing the U.C. system to access the letters posted on mathjobs. The campus administration reasoned response was roughly “sucks to be you.” There is more of the story in an <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201907/rnoti-p1085.pdf">AMS notices article</a> by the chair of math at U.C. Davis.</p>
<p>Finally, this year <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/nation/article/UC-Berkeley-booted-from-U-S-News-World-Report-14189464.php">U.C. Berkeley</a> will not be listed in the US News and World Report rankings because it has submitted wrong data in the past.</p></div>

    <title>The Advisor/Advisee Relationship</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I've always felt a strong advisor/advisee relationship is the single most important factor in a successful PhD career. At its best, the advisor works closely with the student to successful research agenda and help mentor them through their graduate career and beyond. The advisor/advisee relationship can feel like a parent/child relationship that lasts an entire career. Nothing gives me more pleasure as an academic than to see the success of my current and former students.<br/>
<br/>
Take your time when picking an advisor. Don't choose an advisor based solely on research area or because they are "famous". Pick the advisor that will best guide you to a successful academic career.<br/>
<br/>
At its worst, a bad advisor/advisee relationship will destroy your graduate career, making you feel miserable, perhaps dropping out of graduate school or worse, particularly if a student doesn't feel like they are being treated fairly.<br/>
<br/>
Two incidents prompted this post. On TCS-Stack Exchange, a student has <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/42704/single-author-papers-against-my-advisors-will/42711">authorship issues</a> with their advisor. Unfortunately these kinds of incidents happen more often than one suspects. If you can't work it out with the advisor, go talk to someone about it, another faculty, the graduate or department chair, a grad student ombudsperson if your institution has one. We care about our students, and will work hard to resolve problems.<br/>
<br/>
In a much more <a href="https://medium.com/@huixiangvoice/the-hidden-story-behind-the-suicide-phd-candidate-huixiang-chen-236cd39f79d3">tragic event</a>, a student felt it easier to take his own life than feeling that he had to cover up potential academic misconduct. Again, if you ever find yourself in such a situation please reach out. Giving up is never the answer.</div>

Joel Spencer gave the closing talk of last week’s Random Structures and Algorithms <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/fim/conferences/19th-int-conf-random-structures-algorithms/schedule.html">conference</a> at ETH Zurich.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss his talk and the one that preceded it, which was by Hao Huang on his proof this month of the Boolean sensitivity conjecture.</p>
<p>
Spencer’s <a href="https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/math/mathematical-research/fim-dam/Conferences/2019/19th Int Conf on Random Structures and Algorithms/Abstracts/Spencer_Joel.pdf">talk</a> was titled “Four Discrepancies” and based on a joint <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06898.pdf">paper</a> with Nikhil Bhansal. The main new result in the talk was a case where a bound of <img alt="{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%5Clog+n%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}"/> arising from reasoning about normal distribution can, surprisingly, be improved to a sharp <img alt="{O(\sqrt{n})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\sqrt{n})}"/>. </p>
<p>
We will talk about this first, but then progress to the talk that preceded Spencer’s. It was by Hao Huang, who was extended an invitation right after his announced <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity_1.pdf">proof</a> of the Boolean Sensitivity Conjecture earlier this month. Our ulterior purpose is to ask whether any concrete connections can be found besides both talks addressing problems on the <img alt="{\{-1,+1\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B-1%2C%2B1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{-1,+1\}^n}"/> hypercube.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Discrepancy Games </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
First suppose you get a stream of single bits <img alt="{v_t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv_t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v_t}"/>, each <img alt="{-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-1}"/> or <img alt="{+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{+1}"/>. For each bit, you can say “Keep it” or “Flip it.” In the latter case, your bit <img alt="{w_t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w_t}"/> is <img alt="{-v_t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-v_t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-v_t}"/>. Your goal is to keep the sum <img alt="{\sum_{k=1}^t w_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5Et+w_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sum_{k=1}^t w_k}"/> within a bounded range. OK, this is easy: you can make the sum always be <img alt="{+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{+1}"/> when <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> is odd and <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> when <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> is even by flipping when needed.</p>
<p>
Now suppose the bits come in pairs <img alt="{(v_{t,1},v_{t,2})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28v_%7Bt%2C1%7D%2Cv_%7Bt%2C2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(v_{t,1},v_{t,2})}"/> and your goal is to keep the sum in each coordinate bounded. Again there is a simple strategy: There are four kinds of vectors. For each kind, every time you see it for the second time, flip it. That keeps the contribution of each kind within <img alt="{-1 \ldots +1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1+%5Cldots+%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-1 \ldots +1}"/> in each coordinate. Thus simple reasoning says each coordinate stays within <img alt="{-4 \ldots +4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-4+%5Cldots+%2B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-4 \ldots +4}"/>. </p>
<p>
The trouble with extending this idea to vectors of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> is that the number of kinds is <img alt="{2^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^n}"/> and our simple-minded bounds, while constant in terms of the number <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of vectors given, are exponential in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. Well, we can certainly do better. Going back to the <img alt="{n = 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 2}"/> case, we can maintain a policy of never letting both coordinates become <img alt="{+2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{+2}"/> or both become <img alt="{-2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-2}"/>. This keeps both sums within <img alt="{-2 \ldots +2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-2+%5Cldots+%2B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-2 \ldots +2}"/> regardless of the sequence of the vectors. But for larger vector lengths <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>, how large can the <em>discrepancy</em> among the <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> coordinate sums—relative to zero or to each other—become?</p>
<p>
A final help is if we know the number <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of vectors in any sequence we might be given is bounded. In fact, Spencer’s paper with Bhansal first considers the case <img alt="{T = n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT+%3D+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T = n}"/>. There are two main questions about randomness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Does it matter whether the sequence of vectors given is random or worst-case? <p/>
</li><li>
Can you do better than choosing “keep” or “flip” randomly?
</li></ol>
<p>
Long back, Spencer <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/spencer/sixsigma.pdf">proved</a> that if you can see the whole sequence of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> vectors in advance, then you can always keep the sums within <img alt="{-5.32 \sqrt{n} \ldots +5.32\sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-5.32+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D+%5Cldots+%2B5.32%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-5.32 \sqrt{n} \ldots +5.32\sqrt{n}}"/>, whatever the sequence. If not—if you must decide “keep” or “flip” for each vector before seeing the next—then Spencer had also <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HTxo3kP7_5gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=Ten+Lectures+on+the+Probabilistic+Method+Spencer&amp;ots=hGDS5tiCgB&amp;sig=qP53Ty3AQgVJF2J4wzcmT948mmY#v=onepage&amp;q=Ten Lectures on the Probabilistic Method Spencer&amp;f=false">proved</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> If an adversary can choose the next vector based on your current sums, then the best bound <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> such that you can keep all your sums within absolute value <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> grows as <img alt="{\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CTheta%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%5Clog+n%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n})}"/>. Moreover, up to the constant in the “<img alt="{\Theta,}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CTheta%2C%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Theta,}"/>” with high probability you cannot do any better than choosing the sign for each vector randomly. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
See also his famous <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Probabilistic+Method/+4th+Edition-p-9781119061953">book</a>, <em>The Probabilistic Method</em>, with Noga Alon. The new theorem is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> If the adversary presents vectors uniformly at random, then you <b>can</b> achieve <img alt="{B = O(\sqrt{n})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB+%3D+O%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B = O(\sqrt{n})}"/> with high probability—and not by choosing the signs randomly. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The algorithm defines a kind of <em>potential function</em> and has you play “keep” or “flip” according to which has the lesser growth in potential. The analysis is quite complicated. As usual we refer to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06898.pdf">paper</a> for details. Instead we ask: are there insights to mine here for further advances on the Boolean sensitivity problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Boolean Sensitivity </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We didn’t talk about Boolean sensitivity in our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/tools-and-sensitivity/">post</a> on it. Our purpose now is to convey how many concepts are related, hence how they might connect to discrepancy on the hypercube. </p>
<p>
To get the idea of sensitivity, first consider the parity function <img alt="{f_{\oplus}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B%5Coplus%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{\oplus}}"/>. If you change one bit of any argument <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> you change the value of <img alt="{f_{\oplus}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B%5Coplus%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{\oplus}(x)}"/>.

The OR function <img alt="{f_{\vee}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B%5Cvee%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{\vee}}"/> is intuitively less sensitive, but it too has an argument <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> such that <img alt="{f_{\vee}(x^i) \neq f_{\vee}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B%5Cvee%7D%28x%5Ei%29+%5Cneq+f_%7B%5Cvee%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{\vee}(x^i) \neq f_{\vee}(x)}"/> for all <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>, namely <img alt="{x = 0^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+0%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x = 0^n}"/>.

<p>The OR-of-AND function <img alt="{f_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2}"/> is less sensitive. Say it is an OR of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> blocks, each of <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> variables, and the blocks use disjoint variables so <img alt="{n = km}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+km%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = km}"/>.

So <img alt="{s(f_2) = \max\{k,m\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f_2%29+%3D+%5Cmax%5C%7Bk%2Cm%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s(f_2) = \max\{k,m\}}"/>.

<p>
If we make each block of <img alt="{f_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2}"/> return <em>true</em> if exactly one bit is <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, then we again get sensitivity <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> on the all-<img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> assignment. Now, however, consider the related function <img alt="{f'_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f'_2}"/> (with <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> even, <img alt="{k = 2\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+2%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k = 2\ell}"/>) that is still an OR over blocks, but each block is true when some consecutive pair <img alt="{x_{2\ell - 1},x_{2\ell}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7B2%5Cell+-+1%7D%2Cx_%7B2%5Cell%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x_{2\ell - 1},x_{2\ell}}"/> are both <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> with all other pairs being both <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>. Then we can’t do the same trick with the all-<img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> assignment changing just one bit. So when <img alt="{n = 4\ell^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+4%5Cell%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 4\ell^2}"/> and <img alt="{m = k = 2\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+k+%3D+2%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m = k = 2\ell}"/> we again get sensitivity (no more than) <img alt="{\sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{n}}"/>. </p>
<p>
We can, however, consider <img alt="{f'_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f'_2}"/> to be more sensitive if we can flip more than one bit at a time. Partition <img alt="{[n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{[n]}"/> into <em>blocks</em> <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> of two consecutive bit-places each, and given any <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>, define <img alt="{x^B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5EB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x^B}"/> to be the result of flipping the bits in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. We get <img alt="{n/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n/2}"/> blocks, and the all-<img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> assignment becomes a <em>true</em> case of <img alt="{f'_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f'_2}"/> if any block is flipped. Generally define the <em>block sensitivity</em> by considering any partitions <img alt="{\mathcal{B} = \{B_j\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BB%7D+%3D+%5C%7BB_j%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{B} = \{B_j\}}"/> of <img alt="{[n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{[n]}"/> into disjoint subsets and writing </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  bs(f) = \max_{x,\mathcal{B}} ||\{j: f(x^{B_j}) \neq f(x)\}||. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++bs%28f%29+%3D+%5Cmax_%7Bx%2C%5Cmathcal%7BB%7D%7D+%7C%7C%5C%7Bj%3A+f%28x%5E%7BB_j%7D%29+%5Cneq+f%28x%29%5C%7D%7C%7C.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  bs(f) = \max_{x,\mathcal{B}} ||\{j: f(x^{B_j}) \neq f(x)\}||. "/></p>
<p>Note that not every member of the partition has to flip the function—we can discard the ones that don’t flip and count only the disjoint subsets that do flip the value. So back to our example, we have </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  bs(f'_2) = \frac{n}{2} = \frac{1}{2}s(f'_2)^2.

<p>Andris Ambainis and Xiaoming Sun <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3494">improved</a> the constant from <img alt="{\frac{1}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{1}{2}}"/> asymptotically to <img alt="{\frac{2}{3}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{2}{3}}"/>, but their relation is still quadratic.</p>

<p/><p>
This <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01200762">example</a> of quadratic discrepancy is still the best known lower bound on <img alt="{bs(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f)}"/> in terms of <img alt="{s(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s(f)}"/>. But no one had proved anything better than an exponential upper bound until Huang’s result, from which it follows that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 3</b> <em><a name="Huang"/> For all Boolean functions <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>, <img alt="{bs(f) \leq 2s(f)^4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29+%5Cleq+2s%28f%29%5E4%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f) \leq 2s(f)^4}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This bound is concrete, not just asymptotic. It still leaves a gap between quadratic and quartic. It is, however, the combination of two quadratic upper bounds. One was shown by Nisan and Szegedy in their <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2508255_On_the_Degree_of_Boolean_Functions_as_Real_Polynomials">paper</a>: </p>

<p>in a 1992 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316592900608">paper</a> by Craig Gotsman and Nati Linial. Huang proved this by exploiting a connection to graphs that was also shown by Gotsman and Linial. Consider any red-or-white coloring of the <img alt="{2^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^n}"/> nodes of the hypercube, let <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> be the graph induced by the red nodes, and define <img alt="{g(x) = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%29+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g(x) = 1}"/> if node <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is red, <img alt="{g(x) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g(x) = 0}"/> otherwise. Now if the maximum degree <img alt="{d(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d(G)}"/> of a node in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> is small then every red node has many white neighbors, so the Boolean function <img alt="{g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g}"/> is very sensitive. However, going to each neighbor in the hypercube flips the parity. Hence the function </p>

<p>is <b>not</b> very sensitive.

<p/><p>
The proof uses some Fourier analysis with <img alt="{f = g'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf+%3D+g%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f = g'}"/> as above. It, too, takes only one page of a really short paper. </p>
<p>
The main open question now is whether the 4th-power upper bound in Huang’s theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#Huang">3</a> can be improved to quadratic. It is possible that a deeper application of Fourier analysis may show that cases of quadratic separation from <em>block-sensitivity</em> to <em>degree</em> and <em>degree</em> to <em>sensitivity</em> cannot “amplify” any more than quadratic. This is where there might be some commonality with discrepancy. </p>
<p>
There is a much wider suite of Boolean complexity measures besides <img alt="{s(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s(f)}"/>, <img alt="{bs(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f)}"/>, and <img alt="{\deg(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdeg%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\deg(f)}"/> discussed here. For example, consider how many bits of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> you need to fix in order to preserve the value <img alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x)}"/>. That is, define <img alt="{C(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(f)}"/> to be the maximum over <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> of the minimum size of a set <img alt="{I \subseteq [n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI+%5Csubseteq+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{I \subseteq [n]}"/> such that whenever <img alt="{x'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x'}"/> agrees with <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> on <img alt="{I}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{I}"/>, <img alt="{f(x') = f(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%27%29+%3D+f%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x') = f(x)}"/>. Clearly <img alt="{I}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{I}"/> needs to include at least one bit from each <img alt="{B_j.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB_j.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B_j.}"/> This proves <img alt="{C(f) \geq bs(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28f%29+%5Cgeq+bs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(f) \geq bs(f)}"/>. There are many other relations that might be improved. We end by considering ways of broadening Huang’s techniques.</p>

<p>
Induction shows that <img alt="{A_{n}^{2} = nI}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_%7Bn%7D%5E%7B2%7D+%3D+nI%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A_{n}^{2} = nI}"/>. It follows that 	</p>

<p>implies that 	</p>

<p>So the eigenvalues are <img alt="{\pm \sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm \sqrt{n}}"/> and by trace same number of each.</p>

<p>There is a class of children that have just finished elementary school. Now they all move from elementary school to high school and classes are reshuffled. Each child lists three friends, and the assignment of children into classes ensures that each child will have at least one of these three friends in his class.</p>
<p>One of the children heard from five of his schoolmates that they found that they can make their selections in a way that will ensure that all five will be assigned to the same class!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #993366;">Test your intuition: Is there a strategy for five of the children that will ensure that all five will be assigned to the same class?</span></h3>
<p>Can a larger group of children coordinate their choices to ensure that they will all necessarily be assigned to the same class?</p>

<p><strong>Bonus question:</strong> In case that every child lists only two friends and one of them is guaranteed to be in the same class. Is there a strategy of five children that will ensure they are in the same class?</p>
<p><strong>Answer to Bonus question</strong>: Yes. For three children you let every one choose the other two. For the remaining children you let each one choose two among the three.</p></div>

    <title>TR19-097 |  Reversible Pebble Games and the Relation Between Tree-Like and General Resolution Space | 

	Florian Wörz, 

	Jacobo Toran</title>
    <summary>We show a new connection between the space measure in tree-like resolution and the reversible pebble game in graphs. Using this connection we provide several formula classes for which there is a logarithmic factor separation between the space complexity measure in tree-like and general resolution. We show that these separations are almost optimal by proving upper bounds for tree-like resolution space in terms of general resolution clause and variable space. In particular we show that for any formula F, its tree-like resolution is upper bounded by space(?)log time(?) where ? is any general resolution refutation of F. This holds considering as space(?) the clause space of the refutation as well as considering its variable space. For the concrete case of Tseitin formulas we are able to improve this bound to the optimal bound space(?)log(n), where n is the number of vertices of the corresponding graph.</summary>

    <title>TR19-096 |  On the $\text{AC}^0[\oplus]$ complexity of Andreev&amp;#39;s Problem | 

	Aditya Potukuchi</title>
    <summary>Andreev's Problem asks the following: Given an integer $d$ and a subset of $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q \times \mathbb{F}_q$, is there a polynomial $y = p(x)$ of degree at most $d$ such that  for every $a \in \mathbb{F}_q$, $(a,p(a)) \in S$? We show an $\text{AC}^0[\oplus]$ lower bound for this problem. 

This problem appears to be similar to the list recovery problem for degree $d$-Reed-Solomon codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ which asks the following: Given subsets $A_1,\ldots,A_q$ of $\mathbb{F}_q$, output all (if any) Reed-Solomon codewords contained in $A_1\times \cdots \times A_q$. For our purpose, we study this problem when $A_1, \ldots, A_q$ are random subsets of a given size, which may be of independent interest.</summary>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that <em>X</em> is a bounded-degree polynomial with nonnegative coefficients on the <em>p</em>-biased discrete hypercube. Our main result gives sharp estimates on the logarithmic upper tail probability of X whenever an associated extremal problem satisfies a certain entropic stability property. We apply this result to solve two long-standing open problems in probabilistic combinatorics: the upper tail problem for the number of arithmetic progressions of a fixed length in the <em>p</em>-random subset of the integers and the upper tail problem for the number of cliques of a fixed size in the random graph <img alt="G_{n,p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_%7Bn%2Cp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_{n,p}"/>. We also make significant progress on the upper tail problem for the number of copies of a fixed regular graph <em>H</em> in <img alt="G_{n,p}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_%7Bn%2Cp%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_{n,p}."/> To accommodate readers who are interested in learning the basic method, we include a short, self-contained solution to the upper tail problem for the number of triangles in <img alt="G_{n,p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_%7Bn%2Cp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_{n,p}"/> for all <em>p=p(n)</em> satisfying <img alt="\frac {\log n}{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac+%7B%5Clog+n%7D%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\frac {\log n}{n}"/> <img alt="\ll" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cll&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\ll"/> <img alt="p \ll 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%5Cll+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p \ll 1"/>.</p>
<p>The introduction does a very nice job of presenting the rich history of the problem.  Here is a 2002 paper by Svante Janson and Andrzej Ruciński on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rsa.10031?casa_token=7FoHUVq0w5IAAAAA:AqmK_4tpjDzXErWnGh4qnE2kn4NTupyoW27eSXW7Uwr5l0JgpBP5SG7PaVnJ6Lvr4JhCaSIH2HPv-QTsUg">the infamous upper tail</a>.  (And a lot has happened since then with regard to this problem and on non linear large deviation theory). Following, there is a lovely section with a short solution for the case of triangles.</p>
<p>Forthcoming reference [48] talks about lower tails! Stay tuned!</p></div>

    <title>Answer to both Infinite Hats Problems from the last post</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
(This is a joint post with David Marcus. You'll see why later.)<br/>
<br/>
In a prior  I posed two infinite hat problems. Today I post the solutions. Actually this is a copy of my last post with the solutions added, so it is self contained.<br/>
<br/>
A Hat Problem that you have probably seen:<br/>
<br/>
1) There are an infinite number of people, numbered 1,2,3,...  There are 2 colors of hats. They can all see everyone's hat but their own. <br/>
<br/>
2) The adversary is going to put hats on all the people. They will guess their own hat color<i> at the same time</i>. <br/>
<br/>
3) The people can discuss strategy ahead of time, but must use a deterministic strategy and the adversary knows the strategy.<br/>
<br/>
4) The people want to minimize how many they get wrong. <br/>
<br/>
5) The adversary puts on hats to maximize how many they get wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I ask two questions (the answers are in a document I point to) and one meta-question:<br/>
<br/>
Q1: Is there a solution where they get all but a finite number of the guesses right? (If you have read my prior post on hat puzzles, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/07/two-hat-problems-you-may-or-may-not.html">here</a> then you can do this one.) <br/>
<br/>
Q2: Is there a solution where they get all but at most (say) 18 wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Answers to Q1 and Q2 are <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/infinitehats.pdf">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
How did I get into this problem? I was looking at hat problems a while back. Then  I began discussing Q1 and Q2 by email  (Does the term <i>discussing</i> have as a default that it is by email?) with David Marcus who had just read the chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279974">Problems with a Point</a> on hat puzzles. After a few emails back and fourth, he began looking on the web for answers. He found one. There is a website of hat puzzles! It was MY website papers on  Hat Puzzles! It is  <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/TOPICS/hats/hats.html">here</a>. And on it was a relevant paper <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/TOPICS/hats/infinite-hats-and-ac.pdf">here</a>. We did not find any other source of the problem or its solution. <br/>
<br/>
Q3: How well known is problem Q2 and the solution?  I've seen Q1 around but the only source on Q2 that I know of is that paper, and now this blog post. So, please leave a comment telling me if you have seen Q2 and/or the solution someplace else, and if so where.<br/>
<br/>
The responses to my last post indicated that YES the problem was out there, but the proof that you could not get all-but-18 was not well known. <br/>
<br/>
I THINK that all of the proofs that you can't do all-but-18 in the comment of the last post were essentially the same as the solution I pointed to in this blog. I would be interested if there is an alternative proof. <br/></div>

    <title>TR19-095 |  Unambiguous Catalytic Computation |

    <summary>The catalytic Turing machine is a model of computation defined by Buhrman, Cleve,
Kouck, Loff, and Speelman (STOC 2014). Compared to the classical space-bounded Turing
machine, this model has an extra space which is filled with arbitrary content in addition
to the clean space. In such a model we study if this additional filled space can be used to
increase the power of computation or not, with the condition that the initial content of this
extra filled space must be restored at the end of the computation.
In this paper, we define the notion of unambiguous catalytic Turing machine and prove
that under a standard derandomization assumption, the class of problems solved by an
unambiguous catalytic Turing machine is same as the class of problems solved by a general
nondeterministic catalytic Turing machine in the logspace setting.</summary>

<h2>At last: Neighborly CS spheres!</h2>
<p>The news: Isabella Novik and Hailun Zheng’ paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06115">Highly neighborly centrally symmetric spheres</a>, resolves an old standing problem in this field.</p>
<p>Here is the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1995, Jockusch constructed an infinite family of centrally symmetric 3-dimensional simplicial spheres that are cs-<em>2</em>-neighborly. Here we generalize his construction and show that for all d ≥ 4 and n ≥ d, there exists a centrally symmetric (d − 1)-dimensional simplicial sphere with <em>2n</em> vertices that is cs-[d/2]-neighborly. This result combined with work of Adin and Stanley completely resolves the upper bound problem for centrally symmetric simplicial spheres.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to Isabella and Hailun!</p>

<p><strong>The existence of cs-<img alt="[d/2]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bd%2F2%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="[d/2]"/>-neighborly spheres. </strong>It was an important open question whether  cs <img alt="[d/2]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bd%2F2%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="[d/2]"/>-neighborly simplicial spheres exist. (The only cs-<img alt="([d/2]+1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Bd%2F2%5D%2B1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="([d/2]+1)"/>-neighborly spheres is the boundary complex of the cross polytope.)  The first example (which is not a cross polytope) was given by Grünbaum in 1969 in his paper “The importance of being straight(?).” In 1995  Jockusch constructed an infinite family cs-2-neighborly centrally symmetric 3-dimensional simplicial spheres. This problem has now been solved by Novik and Zheng.</p>
<p><strong>Neighborly centrally symmetric polytopes.  </strong>In the 1960s Grünbaum noted the big difference between neighborly centrally symmetric spheres and centrally symmetric polytopes. He proved (This is Theorem 4.1 in his book “Convex polytopes”) that no cs-2-neighborly 4 polytope with 12 vertices exists.  This is an example of the important themes of “straightening” or “linearizing” combimatorial objects and  of extending theorems from the “straight” or “linear” case to more general combinatorial settings.)</p>
<p>This result by Grünbaum was extended in various directions. Let me mention two major results in the field:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> McMullen and Shephard (1968): A cs <em>d</em>-dimensional polytope with <em>2(d + 2)</em> vertices cannot be more than cs-<em>⌊(d + 1)/3⌋</em>-neighborly.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0507280">Linial and Novik (2006):</a> A cs-2-neighborly <em>d</em>-dimensional polytope has at most  <img alt="2^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^d"/>;</p>
<p>Novik (2017) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09489">constructed</a>  cs-2-neighborly d polytopes with <img alt="2^{d-1}+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bd-1%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^{d-1}+1"/> vertices. She used a 2017 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03411">breakthrough construction</a> by Gerencsér–Harang of an acute set of size <img alt="2^{d-1}+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bd-1%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^{d-1}+1"/> in <img alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb R^d"/>. (A set <em>S</em> is <em>acute</em> if every three points from <em>S </em>determine an acute triangle.)</p>
<p><strong>Face numbers of centrally-symmetric polytopes and spheres. </strong>As the abstract asserts the new construction is related to questions about face numbers of centrally symmetric polytopes, spheres and other cellular objects. In fact, this was the next item in our planned posts on algebraic combinatorics of cellular objects. (The first and only post so far<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/20/beyond-the-g-conjecture-algebraic-combinatorics-of-cellular-spaces-i/"> is here</a>.) Here is a recent survey by Isabella Novik  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09310">A tale on centrally symmetric  polytopes and spheres</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Upper bound theorems.</strong> Neighborly polytopes and spheres are the equality cases of the upper bound theorem (proved by McMullen for polytopes and by Stanley for spheres). A version of the upper bound inequality for centrally symmetric spheres was proved by Adin and Stanley and the new construction shows that the Adin-Stanley inequality is tight. For more on the upper bound theorem and neighborliness see Section 2 of my 2000 survey  <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/VIS.pdf">Combinatorics with geometric flavor. </a> See also the post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/how-the-g-conjecture-came-about/">How the g-conjecture came about</a> and  the post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/09/10/how-the-proof-of-the-upper-bound-theorem-for-spheres-was-found/" rel="bookmark">Richard Stanley: How the Proof of the Upper Bound Theorem (for spheres) was Found.</a></p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>While I wait to board a flight at my favorite location on earth—Philadelphia International Airport—I figured I might as well blog something to mark the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Apollo 11.  (Thanks also to Joshua Zelinsky for a Facebook post that inspired this.)</p>



<p>I wasn’t alive for Apollo, but I’ve been alive for 3/4 of the time <em>after</em> it, even though it now seems like ancient history—specifically, like a Roman cathedral being gawked at by a medieval peasant, like an achievement by some vanished, more cohesive civilization that we can’t even replicate today, let alone surpass.</p>



<p>Which brings me to a depressing mystery: why do so many people now deny that humans walked on the moon at all?  Like, why <em>that</em> specifically?  While they’re at it, why don’t they also deny that WWII happened, or that the Beatles existed?</p>



<p>Surprisingly, skepticism of the reality of Apollo seems to have gone all the way back to the landings themselves.  One of my favorite stories growing up was of my mom, as a teenager, working as a waitress at an Israeli restaurant in Philadelphia, on the night of Apollo 11 landing.  My mom asked for a few minutes off to listen to news of the landing on the radio.  The owners wouldn’t grant it—explaining that it was all Hollywood anyway, just some actors in spacesuits on a sound stage, and obviously my mom wasn’t so naïve as to think anyone was <em>actually</em> walking to the moon?</p>



<p>Alas, as we get further and further from the event, with no serious prospect of ever replicating it past the stage of announcing an optimistic timetable (nor, to be honest, any scientific <em>reason</em> to replicate it), as the people involved die off, and as our civilization becomes ever more awash in social-media-fueled paranoid conspiracies, I fear that moon-landing denalism will become more common.</p>



<p>Because here’s the thing: Apollo could happen, but <em>only</em> because of a wildly improbable, once-in-history confluence of social and geopolitical factors.  It was economically insane, taking 100,000 people and 4% of the US federal budget for some photo-ops, a flag-planting, some data and returned moon rocks that had genuine scientific value but could’ve been provided much more cheaply by robots.  It was dismantled immediately afterwards like a used movie set, rather than leading to any greater successes. Indeed, manned spaceflight severely <em>regressed</em> afterwards, surely mocking the expectations of every last science fiction fan and techno-utopian who was alive at that time.</p>



<p>One could summarize the situation by saying that, in certain respects, the Apollo program really <strong>was</strong> “faked.”  It’s just that the way they “faked” it, involved actually landing people on the moon!</p></div>

<p>This is a continuation of <a class="liinternal" href="https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/">Julien Mairal</a>‘s guest post on CNNs, see <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/07/10/guest-post-by-julien-mairal-a-kernel-point-of-view-on-convolutional-neural-networks-part-i/">part I here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Stability to deformations of convolutional neural networks</strong></p>
<p>In their <a class="lipdf" href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/zhang17f/zhang17f.pdf">ICML paper</a> Zhang et al. introduce a functional space for CNNs with one layer, by noticing that for some dot-product kernels, smoothed variants of rectified linear unit activation functions (ReLU) live in the corresponding RKHS, see also <a class="lipdf" href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/zhangd16.pdf">this paper</a> and <a class="lipdf" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/sicomp.pdf">that one</a>. By following a similar reasoning with multiple layers, it is then possible to show that the functional space described in <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/07/10/guest-post-by-julien-mairal-a-kernel-point-of-view-on-convolutional-neural-networks-part-i/">part I</a> <img alt="\{ f_w: x \mapsto \langle w , \Phi_n(x_0) \rangle; w \in L^2(\Omega,\mathcal{H}_n) \}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="20" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3e321e5f0406c9879f25b6b1d69a5fc3_l3.png?resize=298%2C20&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="298"/> contains CNNs with such smoothed ReLU, and that the norm <img alt="\|f_w\|" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="19" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-62e1a48032624994ba16c4e26421676e_l3.png?resize=34%2C19&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="34"/> of such networks can be controlled by the spectral norms of filter matrices. This is consistent with previous measures of complexity for CNNs, see <a class="lipdf" href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7204-spectrally-normalized-margin-bounds-for-neural-networks.pdf">this paper</a> by Bartlett et al.</p>
<p>A perhaps more interesting finding is that the abstract representation <img alt="\Phi_n(x)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3ca9a5351b772e88bebe85e7e4a13632_l3.png?resize=45%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="45"/>, which only depends on the network architecture, may provide near-translation invariance and stability to small image deformations while preserving information—that is, <img alt="x" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1b9fbfb207b6d17d74b33c6d8342a1a4_l3.png?resize=10%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> can be recovered from <img alt="\Phi_n(x)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3ca9a5351b772e88bebe85e7e4a13632_l3.png?resize=45%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="45"/>. The original characterization we use was introduced by Mallat in <a class="lipdf" href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~mallat/papiers/ScatCPAM.pdf">his paper</a> on the scattering transform—a multilayer architecture akin to CNNs based on wavelets, and was extended to <img alt="\Phi_n" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-273242b8e92b3a9f4dc13c62b2785bd3_l3.png?resize=21%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="21"/> by Alberto Bietti, who should be credited for all the hard work here.</p>
<p>Our goal is to understand under which conditions it is possible to obtain a representation that (i) is near-translation invariant, (ii) is stable to deformations, (iii) preserves signal information.

<p>The stability bound and a few additional results tell us a few things about the network architecture: (a) small patches lead to more stable representations (the dependency is hidden in <img alt="C_1" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-782c65cbd411fb8862688afc92bc1eea_l3.png?resize=19%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="19"/>); (b) signal preservation for discrete signals requires small subsampling factors (and thus small pooling) between layers. In such a setting, the scale parameter <img alt="\sigma_n" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="11" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c0142846a2999e170f7beec7be1523f2_l3.png?resize=18%2C11&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="18"/> still grows exponentially with <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a63eb5ff0272d3119fa684be6e7acce8_l3.png?resize=11%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> and near translation invariance may be achieved with several layers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we may now come back to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality from part 1, and note that if <img alt="\Phi_n" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-273242b8e92b3a9f4dc13c62b2785bd3_l3.png?resize=21%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="21"/> is stable, the RKHS norm <img alt="\|f\|" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="19" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-afe70184469e7e3a14405a7193eedf29_l3.png?resize=24%2C19&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="24"/> is then a natural quantity that provides stability to deformations to the prediction function <img alt="f" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c7d97b919a3b73617cf2fbb375fff3b1_l3.png?resize=10%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/>, in addition to measuring model complexity in a traditional sense.</p>
<p><strong>Feature learning in RKHSs and convolutional kernel networks</strong></p>
<p>The previous paragraph is devoted to the characterization of convolutional architectures such as CNNs but the previous kernel construction can in fact be used to derive more traditional kernel methods. After all, why should one spend efforts defining a kernel between images if not to use it?</p>
<p>This can be achieved by considering finite-dimensional approximations of the previous feature maps. In order to shorten the presentation, we simply describe the main idea based on the Nystrom approximation and refer to <a class="lipdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6184-end-to-end-kernel-learning-with-supervised-convolutional-kernel-networks.pdf">the paper</a> for more details. Approximating the infinite-dimensional feature maps <img alt="x_k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="11" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3ad23c5c360c3f33031a5d000d37416f_l3.png?resize=17%2C11&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="17"/> (see the figure at the top of <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/07/10/guest-post-by-julien-mairal-a-kernel-point-of-view-on-convolutional-neural-networks-part-i/">part I</a>) can be done by projecting each point in <img alt="\mathcal{H}_k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bc26f0de4084a72b9e625a080bd5d674_l3.png?resize=22%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="22"/> onto a <img alt="p_k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5c72bc331dc0008f57d454e7071dc39e_l3.png?resize=17%2C12&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="17"/>-dimensional subspace <img alt="\mathcal{F}_k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b08b176c0bf0adbd9cbe41b31147e1f7_l3.png?resize=20%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> leading to a finite-dimensional feature map <img alt="\tilde{x}_k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5f55b75318f3b8da67917ee0b0e190ce_l3.png?resize=17%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="17"/> akin to CNNs, see the figure at the top of the post.</p>

It remains now to choose the anchor points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>kernel approximation:</strong> a first approach consists of using a variant of the Nystrom method, see <a class="lipdf" href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1866-using-the-nystrom-method-to-speed-up-kernel-machines.pdf">this paper</a> and <a class="lipdf" href="http://home.cse.ust.hk/~twinsen/nystrom.pdf">that one</a>. When plugging the corresponding image representation in a linear classifier, the resulting approach behaves as a classical kernel machine. Empirically, we observe that the higher the number of anchor points, the better the kernel approximation, and the higher the accuracy. For instance, a two-layer network with a <img alt="300k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-81a4466abb5fecba81f8a3aa055a1a14_l3.png?resize=36%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="36"/>-dimensional representations achieves about <img alt="86\%" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0eea28372ada596bc618b4b94fee69ec_l3.png?resize=32%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="32"/> accuracy on CIFAR-10 without data augmentation (see <a class="liinternal" href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/mairal/ckn-cudnn-matlab">here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>back-propagation, feature selection</strong>: learning the anchor points <img alt="Z" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-cc9f8fff9fd24060bc054e78f01d5bfb_l3.png?resize=12%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="12"/> can also be done as in a traditional CNN, by optimizing them end-to-end. This allows using deeper lower-dimensional architectures and empirically seems to perform better when enough data is available, e.g., <img alt="92\%" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-659ab3cccda2422f955af880d20646cf_l3.png?resize=32%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="32"/> accuracy on CIFAR-10 with simple data augmentation. There, the subspaces <img alt="\mathcal{F}_k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b08b176c0bf0adbd9cbe41b31147e1f7_l3.png?resize=20%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> are not learned anymore to provide the best kernel approximation, but the model seems to perform a sort of feature selection in each layer’s RKHS <img alt="\mathcal{H}_k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bc26f0de4084a72b9e625a080bd5d674_l3.png?resize=22%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="22"/>, which is not well understood yet (This feature selection interpretation is due to my collaborator Laurent Jacob).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the first CKN model published <a class="lipdf" href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5348-convolutional-kernel-networks.pdf">here</a> was based on a different approximation principle, which was not compatible with end-to-end training. We found this to be less scalable and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Other links between neural networks and kernel methods</strong></p>
<p>Finally, other links between kernels and infinitely-wide neural networks with random weights are classical, but they were not the topic of this blog post (they should be the topic of another one!). In a nutshell, for a large collection of weights distributions and nonlinear functions <img alt="s: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b4680e3f9e8274687d2d04f0a262ed00_l3.png?resize=76%2C13&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="76"/>, the following quantity admits an analytical form</p>

<p>where the terms <img alt="s(w^\top x)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="19" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-da82e444bbc3a5e594b7edbf0b1ba3a0_l3.png?resize=56%2C19&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="56"/> may be seen as an infinitely-wide single-layer neural network. The first time such a relation appears is likely to be in <a class="liexternal" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.446.9306&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">the PhD thesis</a> of Radford Neal with a Gaussian process interpretation, and it was revisited later by <a class="lipdf" href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v2/leroux07a/leroux07a.pdf">Le Roux and Bengio</a> and by <a class="lipdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3628-kernel-methods-for-deep-learning.pdf">Cho and Saul</a> with multilayer models.</p>
<p>In particular, when <img alt="s" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3bcfb3f0b6b04be3b598743cd774dd78_l3.png?resize=8%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="8"/> is the rectified linear unit and <img alt="w" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-78d46af3f19bae0d88ac0cabd450a296_l3.png?resize=13%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="13"/> follows a Gaussian distribution, it is known that we recover the arc-cosine kernel. We may also note that <a class="lipdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines.pdf">random Fourier features</a> also yield a similar interpretation.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>by Nataly Brukhim, Naman Agarwal and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">this paper</a> </em></p>
<p>In a famous 1906 competition at a local fair in Plymouth, England, participants were asked to guess the weight of an ox. Out of a crowd of hundreds, no one came close to the ox’s actual weight, but the average of all guesses was almost correct. How is it that combining the opinions of laymen can somehow arrive at highly reasoned decisions, despite the weak judgment of individual members? This concept of harnessing wisdom from weak rules of thumb to form a highly accurate prediction rule, is the basis of ensemble methods and <b>boosting</b>. Boosting is a theoretically sound methodology that has transformed machine learning across a variety of applications; in classification and regression tasks, online learning, and many more.</p>
<p>In the case of online learning, examples for training a predictor are not available in advance, but are revealed one at a time. Online boosting combines a set of online prediction rules, or <i>weak learners. </i>At every time step, each weak learner outputs a prediction, suffers some loss and is then updated accordingly. The performance of an online learner is measured using the <i>regret</i> criterion, which compares the accumulated loss over time with that of the best fixed decision in hindsight. A <i>Boosting</i> algorithm can choose which examples are fed to each of the weak learners, as well as the losses they incur. Intuitively, the online booster can encourage some weak learners to become really good in predicting certain common cases, while allowing others to focus on edge cases that are harder to predict. Overall, the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/beygelzimer15.pdf">online</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04820">boosting</a> framework can achieve low regret guarantees based on the learners’ individual regret values.</p>
<p>However, online learning can become more challenging when our actions have consequences on the environment. This can be illustrated with the following experiment: imagine learning to balance a long pole on your hand. When you move your hand slightly, the pole tilts. You then move your hand in the opposite direction, and it bounces back and tilts to the other side. One jerk the wrong way might have you struggling for a good few seconds to rebalance. In other words, a <u>sequence of decisions</u> you made earlier determines whether or not the pole is balanced at any given time, rather than the single decision you make at that point.<img alt="" class=" aligncenter" height="129" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.jpeg?w=136&amp;h=129" title="" width="136"/></p>
<p>More generally, consider cases when our environment has a <b>state, </b>and is in some sense “remembering” our past choices. A stateful framework, able to model a wide range of such phenomena, is a <i>dynamical system</i>. A dynamical system can be thought of as a function that determines, given the current state, what the state of the system will be in the next time step. Think of the physical dynamics that determines our pole’s position based on sequential hand movements. Other intuitive examples are the fluctuations of stock prices in the stock market, or the local weather temperatures; these can all be modeled with dynamical systems.</p>
<p>So how can boosting help us make better predictions for a dynamical system? In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">recent work</a> we propose an algorithm, which we refer to as DynaBoost, that achieves this goal. In the paper we provide theoretical regret bounds, as well as an empirical evaluation in a variety of applications, such as online control and time-series prediction.</p>
<p><b>Learning for Online Control</b></p>
<p>Control theory is a field of applied mathematics that deals with the control of various physical processes and engineering systems. The objective is to design an action rule, or <i>controller</i>, for a dynamical system such that steady state values are achieved quickly, and the system maintains stability.</p>
<p>Consider a simple Linear Dynamical System (LDS):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+A+x_t+%2B+B+u_t+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t + w_t"/></p>
<p>where <img alt="x_t,u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t%2Cu_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t,u_t"/> are the state and control values at time t, respectively. Assume a known transition dynamics specified by the matrices A and B, and an arbitrary disturbance to the system given by <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>. The goal of the controller is to minimize a convex cost function <img alt="c_t(x_t,u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28x_t%2Cu_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(x_t,u_t)"/>.</p>
<p>A provably optimal controller for the Gaussian noise case (where <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> are normally distributed) and when the cost functions are quadratic, is the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). LQR computes a pre-fixed matrix K such that <img alt="u_t^{LQR} = K x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BLQR%7D+%3D+K+x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t^{LQR} = K x_t"/>. In other words, LQR computes a linear controller – which linearly maps the state into a control at every time step.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/agarwal19c/agarwal19c.pdf">recent advancement</a> in online control considers <i>arbitrary</i> disturbances, as opposed to normally distributed noise. In this more general setting, there is no closed form for the optimal controller. Instead, it is proposed to use a weighted sum of previously observed noises, i.e., <img alt="u_t^{WL} = K x_t + \sum_{i=1}^H M_i w_{t-i} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BWL%7D+%3D+K+x_t+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EH+M_i+w_%7Bt-i%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t^{WL} = K x_t + \sum_{i=1}^H M_i w_{t-i} "/> , where <img alt="M_1,...,M_H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%2C...%2CM_H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="M_1,...,M_H"/> are learned parameters, updated in an online fashion. This method is shown to attain vanishing average regret compared to the best fixed linear controller in hindsight, and is applicable for general convex cost functions as opposed to only quadratics.</p>
<p>Crucially, the state-dependent term <img alt="Kx_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Kx_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="Kx_t"/> is not learned. Since the learned parameters of the above controller therefore considers only a fixed number of recent disturbances, we can apply existing <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">online convex optimization</a> techniques developed for <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6025-online-learning-for-adversaries-with-memory-price-of-past-mistakes">learning with loss functions that have bounded memory</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Boosting for Online Control</strong></p>
<p>Using the insights described above to remove state in online control, we can now use techniques from online boosting. DynaBoost maintains multiple copies of the base-controller above, with each copy corresponding to one stage in boosting. At every time step, the control <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> is obtained from a convex combination of the base-controllers’ outputs <img alt="u_t^{WL(1)},...,u_t^{WL(N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BWL%281%29%7D%2C...%2Cu_t%5E%7BWL%28N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t^{WL(1)},...,u_t^{WL(N)}"/>. To update each base-controller’s parameters, DynaBoost feeds each controller with a <i>residual</i> <i>proxy </i>cost function, and seeks to obtain a minimizing point in the direction of the residual loss function’s gradient. Stability ensures that minimizing regret over the proxy costs (which have finite memory) suffices to minimize overall regret. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">our paper</a> for the detailed description of the algorithm and its regret guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>Sanity check experiment</strong></p>
<p>We first conducted experiments for the standard LQR setting with i.i.d. Gaussian noise and known dynamics. We applied our boosting method to the non-optimal controller with learned parameters (Control-WL), and we observe that boosting improves its loss and achieves near-optimal performance (here the optimal controller is given by the fixed LQR solution). We have tested an LDS of different dimensions <img alt="d = 1,10,100" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%3D+1%2C10%2C100&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="d = 1,10,100"/>, and averaged results over multiple runs.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="182" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null.png?w=624&amp;h=182" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p><strong>Correlated noise experiment</strong></p>
<p>When the disturbances are not independently drawn, the LQR controller is not guaranteed to perform optimally. We experimented with two LDS settings with correlated disturbances in which (a) the disturbances <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> are generated from a Gaussian random-walk, and (b) where they are generated by a sine function applied to the time index. In these cases, boosted controllers perform better compared to the “weak” learned controller, and can also outperform the fixed LQR solution. We have also tested a Recurrent Neural Network, and observed that boosting is effective for RNNs as well.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="266" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-1.png?w=624&amp;h=266" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p><strong>Inverted Pendulum experiment</strong></p>
<p>A more challenging experiment with a non-linear dynamical system is the Inverted Pendulum experiment. This is very similar to the pole balancing example we discussed above, and is a standard benchmark for control methods. The goal is to balance the inverted pendulum by applying torque that will stabilize it in a vertically upright position, in the presence of noise. In our experiments, we used correlated disturbances from a Gaussian random-walk. We follow the dynamics implemented in <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a>, and test the performance of different controllers: LQR, a learned controller, and boosting. The video below visualizes this experiment:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"/>
<p>When averaging the loss value over multiple experiment runs, we get the following plot:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="276" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-2.png?w=369&amp;h=276" title="" width="369"/></p>
<p>It can be seen that the learned controller performs much better than the LQR in the presence of correlated noise, and that boosting can improve its stability and achieve lower average loss.</p>
<p><b>Boosting for Time-Series Prediction</b></p>
<p>Similarly to the control setting, in time-series prediction tasks it is sufficient to use fixed horizons, and online boosting can be efficiently applied here as well. In time-series prediction, the data is often assumed to be generated from an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j w_j + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Ek+%5Calpha_i+x_%7Bt-i%7D+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Eq+%5Cbeta_j+w_j+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j w_j + w_t"/></p>
<p>In words, each data point <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t"/> is given by a weighted sum of previous points, previous noises and a new noise term <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>, where <img alt="\alpha,\beta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%2C%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\alpha,\beta"/> are the coefficients vectors.</p>
<p>To test our boosting method, We experimented with 4 simulated settings: 1) normally distributed noises, 2) coefficients of the dynamical system slowly change over time, 3) a single, abrupt, change of the coefficients, and, 4) correlated noise: Gaussian random walk.</p>
<p>The weak learners tested here are the ARMA-ONS (online newton step) and ARMA-OGD (online gradient descent) algorithms for time-series prediction (See <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Anava13.pdf">this</a> paper for more details). We applied our boosting method, as well as a fast version of it, which applies to quadratic loss functions (we used squared difference in this case).</p>

<p>We can see in the plots above that all weak learners’ loss values (red) can be improved by online boosting methods (blue). A similar observation arises when experimenting with real-world data; we experimented with the Air Quality dataset from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI Machine Learning repository</a>, that contains hourly averaged measurements of air quality properties from an Italian city throughout one year, as measured by chemical sensors. We apply similar weak learners to this task, as well as our boosting algorithms. Here we again obtain better averaged losses for boosted methods (blue) compared to the baselines (red).</p>

<h2>Dan Romik on the Riemann zeta function</h2>
<p>Recently when I was thinking about the Riemann zeta function, I had the double thrill of discovering some new results about it, and then later finding out that my new ideas were closely related to some very classical ideas due to two icons of twentieth-century mathematics, George Pólya and Pál Turán. When you are trying to stand on the shoulders of giants, it’s nice to see other giants right there beside you trying to do the same!</p>
<p>It all goes back to one of the most famous problems in mathematics, the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Both Pólya and Turán were rather enamored with this problem and published about it extensively; Pólya was said to have been preoccupied with the problem to the very end of his life.(1) And they both recognized that an important first step in trying to prove something about the zeros of the zeta function is having a good representation<br/>
for the Riemann zeta function. After all, there are many different formulas that can be used to define or compute the zeta function. If you don’t choose the right one, you probably won’t get very far with your analysis.</p>
<p>Pólya in one of his famous attacks on the problem considered the representation of the zeta function (or more precisely of the Riemann xi function, which is a symmetrized and better-behaved version of the zeta function; see below) as a Fourier transform—a standard representation due (essentially) to Riemann. I’ll have more to say about that later.</p>
<p>Turán also looked at the Riemann xi function, and instead of working with one of the standard “named” representations such as the Fourier transform or Taylor series, looked around a bit more intentionally for a representation of the function that seemed particularly suited to answering the specific question of whether the zeros all lie on a line. In a 1950 address to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, he put forward his ideas about what he thought was the correct representation to look at: the infinite series expansion of the xi function in the Hermite polynomials. About eighty years after Turán’s discovery, my own investigations led me to discover [5] that the Hermite polynomials are not the only polynomials in which it’s interesting to expand the Riemann xi function. It turns out that there are at least two other families of polynomials for which the respective expansions are no less (and, in some ways, more) well-behaved. My motto for these polynomial families, which are known to experts in special functions but have until now been somewhat esoteric (though I hope that is about to change), is that they are “the coolest polynomials that you never heard of.”</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the technical details so that I can explain why these new expansions are interesting, and how they relate to Turán’s work and ultimately back to Pólya’s ideas and one of the particular threads that grew out of them. First, define the Riemann xi function as</p>
<p><img alt="\displaystyle \xi(s) = \frac12 s(s-1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma\left(\frac{s}{2}\right) \zeta(s) \qquad (s\in\mathbb{C}), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cxi%28s%29+%3D+%5Cfrac12+s%28s-1%29+%5Cpi%5E%7B-s%2F2%7D+%5CGamma%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bs%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29+%5Czeta%28s%29+%5Cqquad+%28s%5Cin%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \xi(s) = \frac12 s(s-1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma\left(\frac{s}{2}\right) \zeta(s) \qquad (s\in\mathbb{C}), "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{\Gamma(z)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%28z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Gamma(z)}"/> is the Euler gamma function and <img alt="{\zeta(s)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Czeta%28s%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\zeta(s)}"/> is the Riemann zeta function. It’s also common to denote<br/>
<img alt="\displaystyle \Xi(t) = \xi\left(\frac12+it\right) \qquad (t\in\mathbb{C}). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5CXi%28t%29+%3D+%5Cxi%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac12%2Bit%5Cright%29+%5Cqquad+%28t%5Cin%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \Xi(t) = \xi\left(\frac12+it\right) \qquad (t\in\mathbb{C}). "/></p>
<p>This is Riemann’s “capital xi” function, which is still usually referred to as Riemann’s xi function. (This seems reasonable: the two functions are the same up to a trivial linear change of variables.) The main point of these definitions is that <img alt="{\Xi(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi(t)}"/> is an entire function of the complex variable <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/>, and that RH can now be reformulated as the statement that the zeros of <img alt="{\Xi(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi(t)}"/> all lie on the real line. Moreover, the famous functional equation satisfied by the Riemann zeta function maps to the statement that <img alt="{\Xi(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi(t)}"/> is an even function.<br/>
Now consider the following four ways of representing the xi function:</p>
<p><img alt="\displaystyle \Xi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n a_{2n} t^{2n},~~~~~(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5CXi%28t%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%28-1%29%5En+a_%7B2n%7D+t%5E%7B2n%7D%2C%7E%7E%7E%7E%7E%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \Xi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n a_{2n} t^{2n},~~~~~(1)"/></p>
<p><img alt="\displaystyle \Xi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n b_{2n} H_{2n}(t),~~~~~(2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5CXi%28t%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%28-1%29%5En+b_%7B2n%7D+H_%7B2n%7D%28t%29%2C%7E%7E%7E%7E%7E%282%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \Xi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n b_{2n} H_{2n}(t),~~~~~(2)"/></p>
<p><img alt="\displaystyle\Xi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n c_{2n} f_{2n}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right),~~~~~(3)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%5CXi%28t%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%28-1%29%5En+c_%7B2n%7D+f_%7B2n%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29%2C%7E%7E%7E%7E%7E%283%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle\Xi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n c_{2n} f_{2n}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right),~~~~~(3)"/></p>
<p><img alt="\displaystyle \Xi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n d_{2n} g_{2n}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right).~~~~~(4)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5CXi%28t%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%28-1%29%5En+d_%7B2n%7D+g_%7B2n%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29.%7E%7E%7E%7E%7E%284%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \Xi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n d_{2n} g_{2n}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right).~~~~~(4)"/></p>
<p>Here, the first representation (1) is simply the Taylor expansion of <img alt="{\Xi(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi(t)}"/>, which contains only even terms since <img alt="{\Xi(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi(t)}"/> is an even function. The numbers <img alt="{a_{2n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a_{2n}}"/> are (up to the <img alt="{(-1)^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28-1%29%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(-1)^n}"/> sign factor) the Taylor coefficients. Some attempts have been made to understand them, and one interesting and fairly trivial observation (again going back to facts already known to Riemann) is that they are all positive. Some additional and less trivial things can be said—see for example Section 6.1 of my paper [5], and the recent paper by Griffin, Ono, Rolen and Zagier [2]. But at the end of the day, no one has yet succeeded in using the Taylor expansion to prove anything new about the location of the zeros.</p>
<p>The second representation (2) is the infinite series expansion of <img alt="{\Xi(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi(t)}"/> in the classical sequence of Hermite polynomials, defined by the well-known formula</p>
<p><img alt="\displaystyle H_n(t) = (-1)^n e^{t^2} \frac{d^n}{dt^n} \left( e^{-t^2} \right). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+H_n%28t%29+%3D+%28-1%29%5En+e%5E%7Bt%5E2%7D+%5Cfrac%7Bd%5En%7D%7Bdt%5En%7D+%5Cleft%28+e%5E%7B-t%5E2%7D+%5Cright%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle H_n(t) = (-1)^n e^{t^2} \frac{d^n}{dt^n} \left( e^{-t^2} \right). "/></p>
<p>This is the representation whose use was advocated by Turán. His reasoning was that expanding a function of a complex variable (for example, in the simplest case, a polynomial) in monomials <img alt="{t^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t^n}"/> doesn’t provide useful information to easily decide if the function has only real zeros, because the monomials have, roughly speaking, radial symmetry: their level curves are concentric circles. The Hermite polynomials on the other hand, at least heuristically, have level curves that are closer to being straight lines parallel to the real axis, Turán argued; thus, they are more suited to the geometry of the problem we are trying to solve.</p>
<p>Turán’s case for supporting the Hermite polynomials as the right basis to use is quite detailed—you can read about it in his papers [6,7,8] (and no, he was not able to actually prove anything about the zeros of <img alt="{\Xi(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi(t)}"/>; this is a common theme in most of the attacks on RH to date…). I’ll simply mention that again one interesting and fairly easy observation is that the coefficients <img alt="{b_{2n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb_%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b_{2n}}"/> in the expansion (2)—adjusted through the introduction of the sign factor <img alt="{(-1)^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28-1%29%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(-1)^n}"/>—end up being positive numbers. Their asymptotic behavior can also be analyzed: I prove a result about this in my paper (though it’s not particularly pretty).</p>
<p>Now comes the part that to me seems the most exciting, involving the expansions (3) and (4). These are the expansions in the more exotic families of polynomials</p>
<p><img alt="\displaystyle f_n(x)=(-i)^n \sum_{k=0}^n 2^k\binom{n+\frac12}{n-k}\binom{-\frac34+ix}{k}," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+f_n%28x%29%3D%28-i%29%5En+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5En+2%5Ek%5Cbinom%7Bn%2B%5Cfrac12%7D%7Bn-k%7D%5Cbinom%7B-%5Cfrac34%2Bix%7D%7Bk%7D%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle f_n(x)=(-i)^n \sum_{k=0}^n 2^k\binom{n+\frac12}{n-k}\binom{-\frac34+ix}{k},"/></p>
<p><img alt="\displaystyle g_n(x)= (-i)^n \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{(n+k+1)!}{(n-k)!(3/2)_k^2} \binom{-\frac34+ix}{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+g_n%28x%29%3D+%28-i%29%5En+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5En+%5Cfrac%7B%28n%2Bk%2B1%29%21%7D%7B%28n-k%29%21%283%2F2%29_k%5E2%7D+%5Cbinom%7B-%5Cfrac34%2Bix%7D%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle g_n(x)= (-i)^n \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{(n+k+1)!}{(n-k)!(3/2)_k^2} \binom{-\frac34+ix}{k}"/></p>
<p>(where <img alt="{(3/2)_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%283%2F2%29_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(3/2)_n}"/> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_and_rising_factorials">Pochhammer symbol</a>), mildly rescaled by replacing <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>  with <img alt="{t/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t/2}"/>. In the terminology of the theory of orthogonal polynomials, the family <img alt="{f_n(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_n%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_n(x)}"/> is a special case of a two-parameter family <img alt="{P_n^{(\lambda)}(x;\phi)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_n%5E%7B%28%5Clambda%29%7D%28x%3B%5Cphi%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P_n^{(\lambda)}(x;\phi)}"/> known as the Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials, with the parameters taking the particular values <img alt="{\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}, \lambda=\frac{3}{4}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%2C+%5Clambda%3D%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}, \lambda=\frac{3}{4}}"/>. Similarly, the family <img alt="{g_n(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg_n%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g_n(x)}"/> is a special case of the four-parameter family <img alt="{p_n(x;a,b,c,d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_n%28x%3Ba%2Cb%2Cc%2Cd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_n(x;a,b,c,d)}"/> known as the continuous Hahn polynomials, with the parameters taking the particular values <img alt="{a=b=c=d=\frac{3}{4}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%3Db%3Dc%3Dd%3D%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a=b=c=d=\frac{3}{4}}"/>. Their main characterizing property is that they are orthogonal sequences of polynomials for two specific weight functions on <img alt="{\mathbb{R}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{R}}"/>: the <img alt="{f_n(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_n%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_n(x)}"/> are orthogonal with respect to the weight function <img alt="{w_1(x)=\left|\Gamma\left(\frac34+ix\right)\right|^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_1%28x%29%3D%5Cleft%7C%5CGamma%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac34%2Bix%5Cright%29%5Cright%7C%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w_1(x)=\left|\Gamma\left(\frac34+ix\right)\right|^2}"/>, and the <img alt="{g_n(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg_n%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g_n(x)}"/> are orthogonal with respect to <img alt="{w_2(x)=\left|\Gamma\left(\frac34+ix\right)\right|^4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_2%28x%29%3D%5Cleft%7C%5CGamma%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac34%2Bix%5Cright%29%5Cright%7C%5E4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w_2(x)=\left|\Gamma\left(\frac34+ix\right)\right|^4}"/>. Again, fairly esoteric. But interesting!</p>
<p>There are several things that make the expansions (3)–(4) well-behaved. First, the coefficients <img alt="{c_{2n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c_{2n}}"/>, <img alt="{d_{2n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d_{2n}}"/> are again positive. This actually seems pretty relevant for questions like RH: for example, if we consider “toy” versions of (1)–(3) in which the coefficient sequences <img alt="{a_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a_n}"/>, <img alt="{b_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b_n}"/> and <img alt="{c_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c_n}"/> are replaced by the sequence <img alt="{\alpha^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha^n}"/> for fixed <img alt="{0&lt;\alpha&lt;1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%3C%5Calpha%3C1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0&lt;\alpha&lt;1}"/>, all three expansions sum up to rescaled cosines, which are entire functions that of course have only real zeros. (Without the <img alt="{(-1)^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28-1%29%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(-1)^n}"/> factor, we would get a hyperbolic cosine, which has imaginary zeros.)</p>
<p>Second, one can derive asymptotics for <img alt="{c_{2n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c_{2n}}"/> and <img alt="{d_{2n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d_{2n}}"/>, and they are quite a bit nicer than the asymptotic formulas for the Taylor and Hermite expansion coefficients. In my paper, I proved that <img alt="\displaystyle c_{2n} \sim A \sqrt{n} e^{-B \sqrt{n}}, \qquad d_{2n} \sim C n^{4/3} e^{-D n^{2/3}} \qquad \textrm{as }n\rightarrow\infty, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+c_%7B2n%7D+%5Csim+A+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D+e%5E%7B-B+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D%2C+%5Cqquad+d_%7B2n%7D+%5Csim+C+n%5E%7B4%2F3%7D+e%5E%7B-D+n%5E%7B2%2F3%7D%7D+%5Cqquad+%5Ctextrm%7Bas+%7Dn%5Crightarrow%5Cinfty%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle c_{2n} \sim A \sqrt{n} e^{-B \sqrt{n}}, \qquad d_{2n} \sim C n^{4/3} e^{-D n^{2/3}} \qquad \textrm{as }n\rightarrow\infty, "/> where <img alt="{A,B,C,D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%2CC%2CD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A,B,C,D}"/> are the constants <img alt="\displaystyle A = 16\sqrt{2}\pi^{3/2}, \qquad B = 4\sqrt{\pi}, \qquad C = \frac{128 \times 2^{1/3} \pi^{2/3} e^{-2\pi /3}}{\sqrt{3}}, \qquad D = 3 (4\pi)^{1/3}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+A+%3D+16%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%5Cpi%5E%7B3%2F2%7D%2C+%5Cqquad+B+%3D+4%5Csqrt%7B%5Cpi%7D%2C+%5Cqquad+C+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B128+%5Ctimes+2%5E%7B1%2F3%7D+%5Cpi%5E%7B2%2F3%7D+e%5E%7B-2%5Cpi+%2F3%7D%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%2C+%5Cqquad+D+%3D+3+%284%5Cpi%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle A = 16\sqrt{2}\pi^{3/2}, \qquad B = 4\sqrt{\pi}, \qquad C = \frac{128 \times 2^{1/3} \pi^{2/3} e^{-2\pi /3}}{\sqrt{3}}, \qquad D = 3 (4\pi)^{1/3}. "/></p>
<p>Third, the expansions have some conceptual meaning: (3) turns out to be equivalent to the expansion of the elementary function <img alt="{\frac{d^2}{du^2} (u \coth(\pi u))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2%7D%7Bdu%5E2%7D+%28u+%5Ccoth%28%5Cpi+u%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{d^2}{du^2} (u \coth(\pi u))}"/>, <img alt="{u&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u&gt;0}"/>, in an orthogonal basis of functions related to the Laguerre polynomials <img alt="{L_n^{1/2}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_n%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_n^{1/2}(x)}"/>. And analogously, (4) arises out of the expansion of a certain auxiliary function <img alt="{\tilde{\nu}(u)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde%7B%5Cnu%7D%28u%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\tilde{\nu}(u)}"/> (I won’t define it here) in yet another classical family of orthogonal polynomials, the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.</p>
<p>Fourth (and fifth, sixth, …): the expansions are just… nice, in the sense that they arise in a way that seems natural when one asks certain questions, that they have excellent convergence properties, and that the coefficients <img alt="{c_{2n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c_{2n}}"/> and <img alt="{d_{2n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d_{2n}}"/> have several elegant formulas, each revealing something interesting about them. Read the paper to understand more.</p>
<p>I said I will get back to Pólya’s work on RH. This post is already quite long so I will say only a little bit about this. One of Pólya’s major discoveries was that there are operations on entire functions that (under certain mild assumptions) preserve the property of the function having only real zeros. Specifically this is the case for the operation of multiplying the Fourier transform of the function by the factor <img alt="{e^{\lambda u^2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7B%5Clambda+u%5E2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e^{\lambda u^2}}"/> for <img alt="{\lambda&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\lambda&gt;0}"/>  (where <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> is the frequency variable). This opens the way to defining a family of deformations <img alt="{\Xi_\lambda(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi_%5Clambda%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi_\lambda(t)}"/> of the Riemann xi function arising out of this operation, and trying to generalize RH by asking for which values of <img alt="{\lambda}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\lambda}"/> it is the case that <img alt="{\Xi_\lambda(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi_%5Clambda%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi_\lambda(t)}"/> has only real zeros. Since Pólya’s work, and important later extensions of it by De Bruijn and Newman, this has become a very active topic of research, nowadays referred to under the name of the De Bruijn-Newman constant.<br/>
See the recent survey of Newman and Wu [3], a 2018 paper by Rodgers and Tao [4] proving a major conjecture of Newman, and the recent paper [9] by the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2018/12/28/polymath-15-eleventh-thread-writing-up-the-results-and-exploring-negative-t/">Polymath15 project</a> (mentioned by Gil in his <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/dan-romik-studies-the-riemanns-zeta-function-and-other-zeta-news/">earlier post</a>), for the latest on this subject.</p>
<p>The connection I found between this topic and the idea of expanding the Riemann xi function in families of orthogonal polynomials is the following: expansions such as (2)–(4) suggest yet another natural way of “deforming” the Riemann xi function by adding a parameter <img alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha}"/>: simply multiply the <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>th term in the expansion by <img alt="{\alpha^{2n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%5E%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha^{2n}}"/> (the linear operator that does this is called the Poisson kernel, and generalizes the standard Poisson kernel from complex analysis and the theory of harmonic functions). It turns out—and is actually easy to prove, and really isn’t terribly surprising in the grand scheme of things—that in the case of the Hermite expansion (2), this family of deformations is the same, up to some trivial reparametrization, as the family of deformations <img alt="{\Xi_\lambda(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CXi_%5Clambda%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Xi_\lambda(t)}"/> that was studied in connection with the work of Pólya, De Bruijn, Newman and their successors. A nice connection between two threads of research that were not previously recognized as being related to each other, I think. Furthermore, this suggests that the Poisson kernel and associated deformations may yet have an important role to play in the context of the new expansions in the orthogonal polynomial families <img alt="{f_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_n}"/> and <img alt="{g_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g_n}"/>, where we get genuinely new families of deformations of the Riemann xi function. I explore this idea in my paper and it leads to some interesting things.</p>
<p>So let’s summarize. The key questions you are no doubt wondering about are: where does any of this lead? And do these new ideas say anything really useful or especially relevant for the Riemann hypothesis? The answer is that I don’t know (and I’m wondering about the same things). That being said, these orthogonal polynomial expansions seem quite interesting in their own right. The Riemann zeta function is a mysterious object, and there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindel%C3%B6f_hypothesis">other things</a> we wish to understand about it beside where its zeros are, so it’s always good to have additional points of view from which to approach it. Moreover, even on the question of the zeros there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic that this approach may have something useful to offer; see Chapter 7 of my paper for a brief discussion of why that is the case.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>(1) Alexanderson writes in [1, p. 259]: “A week or so before he died, Pólya asked me to look on his desk at home for some papers on which he said he had written down some interesting ideas he had for proving RH. Of course I could find no such notes, but until the day he died he was thinking about that famous problem.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) Turán’s Hungarian Academy of Sciences talk was published in a rather obscure French-language paper [6] that seems to have been largely forgotten. It’s an interesting read nonetheless, and to make it more accessible to anyone who may be interested, I recently translated it to English.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) Turán mentions in [8] that he discovered the results on the Hermite expansion in 1938–39, but they were not published until much later. Clearly this was not a convenient time in history for publishing such discoveries; Turán, a Hungarian Jew, spent much of World War II interned in labor camps in Hungary.</p></div>
