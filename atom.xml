    <title>TR21-144 |  Towards Uniform Certification in QBF | 

	Leroy Chew, 

	Friedrich Slivovsky</title>
    <summary>We pioneer a new technique that allows us to prove a multitude of previously open simulations in QBF proof complexity. In particular, we show that extended QBF Frege p-simulates clausal proof systems such as IR-Calculus, IRM-Calculus, Long-Distance Q-Resolution, and Merge Resolution.
  These results are obtained by taking a technique of Beyersdorff et al. (JACM 2020) that turns strategy extraction into simulation and combining it with new local strategy extraction arguments.



This approach leads to simulations that are carried out mainly in propositional logic, with minimal use of the QBF rules. Our proofs therefore provide a new, largely propositional interpretation of the simulated systems.
We argue that these results strengthen the case for uniform certification in QBF solving, since many QBF proof systems now fall into place underneath extended QBF Frege.</summary>

    <title>The Complexity of Bipartite Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>

attracted attention as a platform for building quantum devices capable of
performing tasks that are out of reach for classical devices. There is
therefore significant interest, from the perspective of computational
complexity theory, in solidifying the mathematical foundation for the hardness
of simulating these devices. We show that, under the standard
Anti-Concentration and Permanent-of-Gaussians conjectures, there is no
efficient classical algorithm to sample from ideal Gaussian boson sampling
distributions (even approximately) unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.
The hardness proof holds in the regime where the number of modes scales
quadratically with the number of photons, a setting in which hardness was
widely believed to hold but that nevertheless had no definitive proof.
</p>
<p>Crucial to the proof is a new method for programming a Gaussian boson
sampling device so that the output probabilities are proportional to the
permanents of submatrices of an arbitrary matrix. This technique is a
generalization of Scattershot BosonSampling that we call BipartiteGBS. We also
make progress towards the goal of proving hardness in the regime where there
are fewer than quadratically more modes than photons (i.e., the high-collision
regime) by showing that the ability to approximate permanents of matrices with
repeated rows/columns confers the ability to approximate permanents of matrices
with no repetitions. The reduction suffices to prove that GBS is hard in the
constant-collision regime.

infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces which must be truncated to perform
simulations of real-time dynamics on classical or quantum computers. To analyze
the truncation error, we develop methods for bounding the rate of growth of
local quantum numbers such as the occupation number of a mode at a lattice
site, or the electric field at a lattice link. Our approach applies to various
models of bosons interacting with spins or fermions, and also to both abelian
and non-abelian gauge theories. We show that if states in these models are
truncated by imposing an upper limit $\Lambda$ on each local quantum number,
and if the initial state has low local quantum numbers, then an error at most
$\epsilon$ can be achieved by choosing $\Lambda$ to scale polylogarithmically
with $\epsilon^{-1}$, an exponential improvement over previous bounds based on
energy conservation. For the Hubbard-Holstein model, we numerically compute a
bound on $\Lambda$ that achieves accuracy $\epsilon$, obtaining significantly
improved estimates in various parameter regimes. We also establish a criterion
for truncating the Hamiltonian with a provable guarantee on the accuracy of
time evolution. Building on that result, we formulate quantum algorithms for
dynamical simulation of lattice gauge theories and of models with bosonic
modes; the gate complexity depends almost linearly on spacetime volume in the
former case, and almost quadratically on time in the latter case. We establish
a lower bound showing that there are systems involving bosons for which this
quadratic scaling with time cannot be improved. By applying our result on the
truncation error in time evolution, we also prove that spectrally isolated
energy eigenstates can be approximated with accuracy $\epsilon$ by truncating
local quantum numbers at $\Lambda=\textrm{polylog}(\epsilon^{-1})$.

No young researcher could have had the knowledge base or maturity to be able to put the pieces together the way that Babai did.</p></blockquote><p>Babai's proof is an exceptional story, but it is exceptional. Most CS theorists have done their best work early in their career. I got myself into a <a href="https://twitter.com/fortnow/status/1447681436513882112">twitter discussion</a> on the topic. For me, I'm proud of the research I did through my forties, but I'll always be best known, research wise, for my work on interactive proofs around 1990. It would be hard to run a scientific study to determine cause and effect but here are some reasons, based on my own experiences, on why we don't see research dominated by the senior people in theory.</p><p/><b>The field changes - </b>Computation complexity has moved from a computational-based discipline to one now dominated by combinatorics, algebra and analysis. I'm not complaining, a field should evolve over time but it plays less to my strengths. It's hard to teach this old dog new tricks.<div><b>The fruit hanged lower - </b>there were important problems with easier proofs available then not available now<div><b>Responsibilities </b>- You have fewer as a PhD student, postdoc or assistant professor.</div><div><b>Family - </b>becomes more of a focus.</div><div><b>Taking on new jobs - </b>Many academics, though not all, take on administrative roles at their university or , or leave academics completely. </div><div><b>The young people have the new ideas </b>- And older people get settled in their ways</div><div><b>The thrill is gone or at least decays - </b>Your first theorem, your first talk, your first conference paper gives you a level of excitement that's hard to match.</div><div><b>Existentialism - </b>The realization that while computing has no doubt changed the world, my research, for the most part, hasn't.</div><div><b>Cognitive Decline</b> - Probably the most controversial but for me I find it hard to focus on problems like I used to. Back in the day I prided myself on knowing all the proofs of my theorems, now I can't even remember the theorems.</div><div><br/></div><div>Honestly there is just nothing wrong with taking on new roles, writing books, surveys and blogs, focusing on teaching and mentorship and service and leaving the great research to the next generation.</div><div><p/></div></div></div>

<p><i>In a series of two blog posts, we dive into how to build practical certified defenses against adversarial patches.
In Part I below, we give an overview of smoothing-based defenses, a popular class of certified defenses, and walk through a specific example of using de-randomized smoothing to defend against adversarial patch attacks.
In <a href="https://gradientscience.org/smoothed-vit">Part II</a>, we discuss our latest work that demonstrates how using vision transformers with de-randomized smoothing (smoothed ViTs) can significantly improve these defenses. Our approach not only provides better certified defenses against adversarial patches but also maintains standard accuracy and inference times at levels comparable to that of regular (non-robust) models. Thanks to these improvements, smoothed ViTs become a truly viable alternative to regular models.

<p>Adversarial examples are small modifications of inputs that can induce machine learning models to misclassify those inputs. These attacks can be roughly categorized into two broad classes: small, synthetic perturbations that are visually indistinguishable from the original input, and physically realizable attacks that can break deployed machine learning systems in the wild. One popular attack in the latter category, known as adversarial patches, maliciously perturbs a bounded region in the image (typically a square).</p>

</div>

<p>Adversarial patches can be used to undermine a variety of vision-based tasks—in particular, have been used to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09665">deceive image classifiers</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11897">manipulate object detectors</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10053">disrupt optical flow estimation</a>. Such attacks tend to be relatively easy to implement too as they just require, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08945">printing adversarial stickers</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14667">creating adversarial pieces of clothing</a>,or <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2976749.2978392">manufacturing adversarial glasses</a>.</p>

<p>While several heuristic defenses have been proposed to protect against adversarial patches, some of these defenses were shown to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06693">not be fully effective</a>. This is unfortunately <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08347">a fairly common theme in adversarial examples research</a>.</p>

<p>Certified defenses attempt to alleviate such empirical evaluation problems by providing robustness guarantees that are provable. However, certified guarantees tend to be modest and come at a steep cost. For instance, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10733">recently proposed certified defenses against adversarial patches</a> can guarantee only 14%  robust accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, certified models are often substantially slower (by even 2-4 orders of magnitude) and significantly less accurate (in terms of standard accuracy) than non-robust models, which severely limits their practicality.</p>

<h2 id="smoothing-models-for-provable-robustness">Smoothing models for provable robustness</h2>
<p>We begin our discussion of certified defenses with an overview of smoothing, a general strategy for creating models that are provably robust to adversarial attacks. They revolve around the idea of deriving a (robust) prediction by aggregating many  variations  of the original input (e.g., ones that correspond to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918">adding Gaussian noise</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09272">masking parts of the input</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08450">augmenting it with generative models</a>). The underlying intuition is that while it might be easy for an adversary to attack a single input, it is much harder for them to simultaneously attack all of the input variations. Thus, instead of directly classifying the original input, we classify each of such variations of that input and then output the most frequently predicted class—if the number of variations that agree with this class is high enough then the prediction is guaranteed to be robust.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into the details! To create a smoothed classifier, we change the typical  forward pass of our classifier (often referred to as the base classifier) into a three-step procedure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Construct variations of the input.</li>
  <li>Classify all input variations individually.</li>
  <li>Output the most frequently predicted class.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, once we have such a smoothed classifier, how can we certify its robustness? The key assumption for certification is that an adversary can only affect a limited number of input variations. If this is true, certification amounts to a simple counting problem: if the difference between the first- and second-most frequently predicted classes is larger than what an adversary could ever change via their manipulation, then the prediction is guaranteed to be robust! Importantly, for this approach to work well, it is key that these variations remain informative of the correct class while remaining hard for the adversary to perturb many of them simultaneously. This gives rise to a natural trade-off between robustness and accuracy.</p>

<p>By choosing different types of input variations, smoothing techniques can defend against different types of adversarial attacks. For example, smoothing classifiers with random additive noise can provide certified defenses against adversarial <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918">L2</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08118">L1</a> attacks. On the other hand, smoothing over “pixel flows” can provide <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10783">certified defenses against Wasserstein perturbations</a>. One can even “smooth” the entire pipeline of both training and inference (treating it as a single module), to get robustness to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03018">data poisoning attacks</a>. In general, if we can construct a set of input variations so that the adversary can only affect some fraction of them, we can use smoothing to defend against the corresponding attacks!</p>

<h2 id="derandomized-smoothing-a-smoothing-defense-against-patch-attacks">Derandomized Smoothing: A Smoothing Defense against Patch Attacks</h2>

<p>How can we use smoothing to defend against adversarial patches specifically? Recall that to be able to create a smoothing defense, we need to come up with a way to generate variations of an image that limit the effect of an adversarial patch and still be indicative of the correct class label. Here, we exploit a key property of adversarial patches: they are limited to a small, contiguous region of the input image.</p>

<p>Specifically, for each variation, we mask out all of the image except for a small region. In most of these variations, the adversarial patch will be fully masked, and thus cannot affect the model’s prediction by construction. This technique was originally introduced in a certified defense known as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10733">derandomized smoothing (Levine &amp; Feizi, 2020)</a>. Typically, we leave a column of the image unmasked as shown in the figure below, otherwise known as a column ablation (check out the original paper for some other ablation types).</p>

<div id="ablation_figure">
    <div>
        <div class="seventhblock">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
    Example of column ablations for an input image. Most of the image is masked out except for a column of the image. An adversarial patch can only affect a column ablation if the patch itself is located within the ablation, thus limiting the effect of an adversary. Click on the image to see other column ablations for the same image. 
</div>

<h2 id="certified-guarantee-against-patch-attacks">Certified guarantee against patch attacks</h2>

<p>Now that we have our smoothed classifier, how can we prove that the prediction is robust to patch attacks? Since a patch is of limited size, an adversary can only affect the few image variations that physically overlap with the patch. Consequently, if the margin of the winning prediction is large enough, then we can guarantee robustness to adversarial patches.</p>

<div class="footnote">
A simplified demonstration of the derandomized smoothing defense for patch robustness. Here, an image of a duck is split into column ablations (our choice of input variation), each of which are classified individually. Since 6 out of 8 column ablations are classified as duck, the smoothed model predicts that this is a duck. A 32x32 patch is only large enough to affect at most 2 column ablations, which is not enough to change the prediction. Thus, this prediction is certifiably robust to 32x32 patches. In contrast, a 64x64 patch can affect up to 3 column ablations and can potentially flip the most frequent class to boat, and so the model is not certifiably robust to 64x64 patches. 
</div>

<p>To make this more precise, let $\Delta$ be the number of ablations that a patch could simultaneously affect (in the worst case). If the winning margin is at least $2\Delta$, then the smoothing defense guarantees that the predicted class is robust to this patch size. The fraction of examples which meet this certification threshold is typically referred to as certified accuracy.</p>

<div class="footnote">
 For adversarial patch attacks of size m x m, and column ablation size $b$, we have $\Delta=m+b-1$
</div>

<h2 id="challenges-for-certified-patch-defenses">Challenges for Certified Patch Defenses</h2>

<p>Although certified patch defenses can provide guarantees against adversarial attacks, like many other certified defenses, they face several major challenges that limit their practicality:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They provide relatively modest guarantees, and can only guarantee robustness for a relatively small fraction of inputs and/or only a small patch size.</li>
  <li>The standard accuracy is typically much lower than that of a standard, non-robust model, forcing on the practitioners an unfavorable “trade-offs” between robustness and accuracy.</li>
  <li>Inference times tend to be several orders of magnitude larger than that of a standard, non-robust model, making certified defenses difficult to deploy in real-time settings.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the <a href="https://gradientscience.org/smoothed-vit">next post</a>, we discuss our latest work on making certified defenses much more practical. Specifically, we show how leveraging vision transformers (ViT) enables better handling of input variations and significant improvement of the margins for certification. With some straightforward modifications to the ViT architecture, we are also able to develop certifiably robust models that not only outperform previous certified defenses but also have practical inference times and standard accuracies.</p></div>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/smoothing">previous post</a>, we gave an overview of smoothing-based approaches to certified defenses, and described a certified patch defense known as de-randomized smoothing. In our latest work, we show how to leverage vision transformers (ViTs) to significantly improve such certified patch defenses along all possible axes: standard accuracy, certified accuracy, and speed. In fact, with some straightforward modifications, our certified ViTs not only enable significantly better certified robustness but they also maintain standard accuracy and inference times that are comparable to that of regular (non-robust) models. This progress marks a substantial step forward for certified defenses as a practical alternative to regular models.

     <b>An overview of the Smoothed ViT.</b>
</div>

<p>The main appeal of certified defense is their ironclad guarantees: a certified result leaves no room for doubt and is not prone to blind-spots of empirical evaluation. However, practitioners care not only about certified performance: the accuracy and the inference speed of the model are equally important factors too. Unfortunately, nearly all certified defenses come at a severe price: (1) the standard accuracy plummets in comparison to a standard model and/or (2) inference time is orders of magnitude slower than that of a standard model.</p>

<div class="footnote">
A standard ResNet-50 can achieve about 76% accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark, and takes less than 1 second to make a prediction on a typical GPU. In contrast, top-performing certified defenses such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10733">Levine &amp; Feizi (2020)</a> reports 44% standard accuracy and takes 150 seconds to make a prediction on similar hardware. 
</div>

<p>This trade-off between robustness and performance can be untenable even for safety-critical applications. For example, object detection systems deployed in autonomous vehicles need to recognize obstacles and signs quickly in real time. Consequently, in addition to being robust, these systems also need to be fast and accurate.</p>

<p>To approach this tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, we take a closer look at certified defenses from an architectural perspective. Specifically, smoothing defenses use a backbone architecture that is typically implemented using classic convolutional networks, the default choice across much of computer vision. But are these architectures really the best tool for the job?</p>

<p>In our work, we show that when moving from standard models to certified defenses, it may be worth it to rethink the core architecture behind them. Specifically, we find that smoothing-based patch defenses can drastically improve when using vision transformers (ViTs) instead of convolutional networks as their backbone. With some additional adjustments to the transformer architecture, we not only achieve superior certified accuracy to prior work but also reach standard accuracies and inference times comparable to a standard, non-robust ResNet!</p>

<h2 id="rethinking-smoothing-backbones">Rethinking smoothing backbones</h2>

<p>Recall from the <a href="https://gradientscience.org/smoothing">previous post</a> that smoothing defenses use a base classifier to make predictions on many variations of the original input. For patch defenses, this amounts to using the base classifier to classify column ablations (i.e., masked images that only reveal a small column of the original image). Consequently, the accuracy of the base classifier at classifying columns of an image directly translates into the performance of the certified defense.</p>

<p>In the light of this observation, it is crucial to realize that convolutional networks typically process complete (i.e., not masked) images. So, this type of architecture might not actually be best suited for classifying the highly masked images used in smoothing defenses.</p>

<p>Why might we expect convolutions to be suboptimal for masked images? CNNs slide filters across the image and grow the receptive field across layers of the network. This large receptive field, while usually being a strength of CNNs for standard settings, forces the network to process a large amount of masked pixels when processing ablated images. Since these pixels carry no information, the network must learn to detect and ignore these masked regions (in addition to performing unnecessary computation).</p>

<h2 id="vision-transformers-for-ablated-images">Vision transformers for ablated images</h2>

<p>Unlike CNNs, vision transformers (ViTs) use attention modules instead of convolutions as their main building block. Crucially, attention modules can ignore masked regions instead of processing them.</p>

<p>To test out this intuition, we measured the accuracy of various convolutional and ViT architectures at classifying column ablations. It turns out that ViTs are significantly better at this task—for example, on ImageNet, a ViT-S has 12% higher accuracy at classifying column ablations than a similarly sized ResNet-50.</p>

</div>



<p>These improvements in ablation accuracy directly boosts both the certified and standard accuracies for the smoothed model. For example, the increase in ablation accuracy improves  the certified accuracy of a smoothed ViT-S by 13% (as compared to a similarly sized ResNet-50) and the standard accuracy by 12%.</p>

<p>With some additional adjustments to the certification procedure <a href="https://gradientscience.org/certivited.pdf">described in our paper</a>, our largest certifiably robust vision transformer can reach 73% standard accuracy—only 3% off from the standard accuracy of a regular, non-robust ResNet-50, and almost 30% higher than previous versions of de-randomized smoothing!</p>

<h2 id="modifying-vits-to-speed-up-inference-time">Modifying ViTs to Speed up Inference Time</h2>

<p>Also, recall that a smoothed classifier tends to be significantly slower than a standard model because it needs to classify a large number of input variations for each input image. Indeed, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918">traditional randomized smoothing approaches</a> have used upwards of 100,000 variations, resulting in a forward pass that is 4-5 orders of magnitude slower than a standard model. These costs are infeasible in scenarios where decisions need to be made in a fraction of a second, such as autonomous driving. As <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10733">Levine &amp; Feizi</a> have shown, for patch defenses, a move towards <em>deterministic</em> smoothing (as opposed to randomized) can result in a great speed up (by reducing the number of variations needed to be classified). However, the resulting solution is still two orders of magnitude slower than standard models.</p>

<p>In order to speed up inference (much) further, we leverage the token-based nature of ViTs to gracefully handle image ablations. Specifically, note that ViTs process images as tokens, where each token represents a contiguous patch of the input image. Since the runtime of a ViT is proportional to the number of tokens, a natural approach to speed up inference is to simply drop the masked out tokens, as shown in the following figure:</p>

<div id="token_figure">
    <div>
        <div class="seventhblock">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
    Vision transformers split images into patches, which are processed by the transformer architecture. When processing column ablated images, we can simply pass only the tokens in the ablation to significantly reduce the computational complexity of smoothing. 
</div>
<div class="seventhblock token_column"/><img src="https://gradientscience.org/' + imgUrl + '"/>

<p>We modify the ViT architecture to drop fully masked tokens in such a manner. As expected, this significantly speeds up the inference time of the smoothed model! Indeed, with this optimization, our smoothed ViT-S is faster than a smoothed ResNet-50 by an order of magnitude. In our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/certivited.pdf">paper</a>, we discuss how additional improvements to the certification procedure can make our ViT architectures <i>another</i> order of magnitude faster. In total, our fastest smoothed ViT is actually comparable in terms of inference speed to a standard, non-robust ResNet.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Smoothed ViTs present a simple but effective way to achieve state-of-the art certified accuracy. These models are also realistically deployable, as they maintain similar accuracy and inference speed as non-robust models. The key here is the vision transformer’s inherent ability to quickly and accurately process image ablations. These advancements are thus a step towards certified defenses that can be practically deployed in real-world scenarios.</p>

    <title>Relevant neighbors</title>
    <summary>I have a new preprint, “Finding Relevant Points for Nearest-Neighbor Classification”, arXiv:2110.06163, to appear in January at the SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA22). It’s about points in Euclidean spaces of dimension three or more, but I thought it would make a good warm-up to discuss here the one-dimensional version of the same problem, solved (together with the 2d version) by Bremner, Demaine, Erickson, Iacono, Langerman, Morin, and Toussaint in their paper “Output-sensitive algorithms for computing nearest-neighbour decision boundaries”, Discrete Comput. Geom. 2005.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I have a new preprint, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06163">“Finding Relevant Points for Nearest-Neighbor Classification”, arXiv:2110.06163</a>, to appear in January at the <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/sosa22">SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA22)</a>. It’s about points in Euclidean spaces of dimension three or more, but I thought it would make a good warm-up to discuss here the one-dimensional version of the same problem, solved (together with the 2d version) by Bremner, Demaine, Erickson, Iacono, Langerman, Morin, and Toussaint in their paper <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00454-004-1152-0">“Output-sensitive algorithms for computing nearest-neighbour decision boundaries”, <em>Discrete Comput. Geom.</em> 2005</a>.</p>

<p>So in this problem, you have a collection of real-valued data points with known discrete classifications (say, a finite set of colors), and you want to guess the color of new points whose color is not already given. Nearest neighbor classification means simply that, to guess the color of \(x\), you find the closest known point \(y\) and guess that \(x\) has the same color as \(y\). One easy way to do this would be to store the known points in a sorted list and use binary search. There’s lots more to say about this (for instance its use in combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_projection">random projections</a> for high-dimensional approximate nearest neighbors) but for today I want to focus on the size of this sorted list. We can store a list that is potentially much smaller, but always produces the same results, by keeping only points that have a neighbor with a different classification.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="One-dimensional nearest neighbor classification on a full data set and the data set trimmed to its relevant points" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/1d-nnc.svg"/></p>

<p>These points with differently-classified neighbors are the “relevant points” of the preprint title. Another way of describing them is that a point is relevant if deleting it would change the classification of some other (unknown) points in space that might later be queried. Among the set of decision boundaries, the ones separating parts of space with different classifications are the ones defined by relevant points. So if we store a nearest-neighbor data structure with only relevant points, we will get the same answer as if we store all known points. But because we’re storing fewer points, it will take less memory and less time (especially if the reduced memory allows it to fit into cache).</p>

<p>If you have the points given to you in sorted order, then it’s easy enough to scan through them in that order, keeping track of which pairs have different classifications, and produce a filtered sequence of the relevant ones. Here it is in Python (with apologies for the low-contrast syntax coloring):</p>

<p>However, as Bremner et al observed, sorting an input to make it usable by this scan does more work than necessary, because we don’t need the sorted ordering of all the other points between the relevant ones. Instead, we can use an idea resembling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect">quickselect</a>, where we modify the quicksort algorithm to stop recursing in subproblems where sorting is unnecessary. For finding relevant points, these subproblems are the homogeneous ones, in which all points have the same classification as each other. Bremner et al combined this idea with a version of quicksort that always partitions its subproblems at the exact median, in order to achieve a good worst-case time bound, but if we’re happy with expected analysis we can use the same random-pivoting idea as the more usual form of quicksort:</p>

<p>The time complexity of this algorithm can be analyzed much like <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2007/10/09/blum-style-analysis-of.html">the analysis of quickselect</a>, by observing that the time is proportional to the number of comparisons with pivots, computing the probability that each possible comparison happens, and summing. In quicksort, two distinct elements at distance \(d\) from each other in the final sorted output are compared whenever one of them is the first to be chosen as a pivot in the interval between them, which happens with probability exactly \(2/(d+1)\). In quickrelevant, this same probability holds for pairs that are separated by one of the decision boundaries. But pairs of elements that are within the same homogeneous block are less likely to be compared, because of the possibility that the recursion will stop before it separates or compares them.</p>

<p>If a pair of elements lies within a single block, has distance \(d\) separating them, and is $e$ units from both ends of the block, then it will only be compared if one of the two elements is first to be chosen in at least one of the two intervals of length \(d+e\) extending from the two elements towards an end of their block. This happens with probability at most \(4/(d+e)\), because there are two ways of choosing which element to pick first as the pivot and two ways of choosing which extended interval it is first in.</p>

<p>If we sum up these probabilities, for pairs involving a single element that is \(e\) units from its nearest block boundary among a set of \(n\) elements, we get \(O\bigl(\log(n/e)\bigr)\) as the expected contribution to the total time for that one element. If we sum the contributions from the elements within a block, for a block of length \(\ell_i\), we get a total expected contribution from that block of \(O\bigl(\ell_i\log(n/\ell_i)\bigr)\). And if we have \(k\) relevant points and \(O(k)\) blocks, and we sum over all blocks, the total time is maximized when all the blocks are of equal size, \(\Theta(n/k)\), for which we get total time \(O(n\log k)\).</p>

<p>For quicksort and quickselect, it’s possible to be more careful in the analysis, derive exact formulas for the probability of making each comparison, and from them get an analysis of the expected number of comparisons that does not use \(O\)-notation for its leading term; see my linked post on the quickselect analysis. Probably it’s possible here too but it looks messier. Maybe it would make a good undergraduate research project. One thing to be careful of is that the comparisons are not over in the homogeneous case; finding the min and max simultaneously, in a block of length \(\ell_i\), takes roughly \(3\ell_i/2\) comparisons. But that should only be a lower-order term compared to the \(O(n\log k)\) leading term of the analysis.</p>

    <title>TR21-143 |  Hitting Sets For Regular Branching Programs | 

	Edward Pyne</title>
    <summary>We construct an explicit $\varepsilon$-hitting set generator (HSG) for regular ordered branching programs of length $n$ and $\textit{unbounded width}$ with a single accept state that has seed length
    \[O(\log(n)(\log\log(n)+\log(1/\varepsilon))).\]
    Previously, the best known seed length for regular branching programs of width $w$ with a single accept state was by Braverman, Rao, Raz and Yehudayoff (FOCS 2010, SICOMP 2014) and Hoza Pyne and Vadhan (ITCS 2021), which gave
    \[O(\log(n)(\log\log(n)+\min\{\log(w),\log(n)\}+\log(1/\varepsilon))).\]
    We also give a simple co-HSG for the model with optimal seed length $O(\log n)$.
    
    For the more restricted model of $\textit{permutation}$ branching programs, Hoza Pyne and Vadhan (ITCS 2021) constructed a PRG with seed length matching our HSG, and then Pyne and Vadhan (CCC 2021) developed an error-reduction procedure that gave an HSG (in fact a ``weighted PRG'') with seed length $\widetilde{O}(\log(n)\sqrt{\log(n/\varepsilon)}+\log(1/\varepsilon)).$ We show that if an analogous error-reduction result could be obtained for our HSG, there is an explicit HSG for general ordered branching programs of width $w=n$ with seed length $\widetilde{O}(\log^{3/2}n)$, improving on the $O(\log^2n)$ seed length of Nisan (Combinatorica 1992).</summary>

    <title>Machine learning is not nonparametric statistics.</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Many times in my career, I’ve been told by respected statisticians that machine learning is nothing more than nonparametric statistics. The longer I work in this field, the more I think this view is both misleading and unhelpful. Not only can I never get a consistent definition of what “nonparametric” means, but the jump from statistics to machine learning is considerably larger than most expect. Statistics is an important tool for understanding machine learning and randomness is valuable for machine learning algorithm design, but there is considerably more to machine learning than what we learn in elementary statistics.</p>

<p>Machine learning at its core is the art and science of <em>prediction</em>. By prediction, I mean the general problem of leveraging regularity of natural processes to guess the outcome of yet unseen events. As before, we can formalize the prediction problem by assuming a population of $N$ individuals with a variety of attributes. Suppose each individual has an associated variable $X$ and $Y$. The goal of prediction is to guess the value of $Y$ from $X$ that minimizes some error metric.</p>

<p>A classic prediction problem aims to find a function that makes the fewest number of incorrect predictions across the population.  Think of this function like a computer program that takes $X$ as input and outputs a prediction of $Y$. For a fixed prediction function, we can sum up all of the errors made on the population. If we divide by the size of the population, this is the mean error rate of the function.</p>

<p>A particularly important prediction problem is classification. In classification, the attribute $Y$ takes only two values: the input $X$ could be some demographic details about a person, and $Y$ would be whether or not that person was taller than 6 feet. The input $X$ could be an image, and $Y$ could be whether or not the image contains a cat. Or the input could be a set of laboratory results about a patient, and $Y$ could be whether or not the patient is afflicted by a disease. Classification is the simplest and most common prediction problem, one that forms the basis of most contemporary machine learning systems.</p>

<p>For classification problems, it is relatively straightforward to compute the best error rate achievable. First, for every possible value of the attribute $X$, collect the subgroup of individuals of the population with that value. Then, the best assignment for the prediction function is the one that correctly labels the majority of this subgroup. For example, in our height example, we could take all women, aged 30, born in the United States, and reside in California. Then the optimal label for this group would be decided based on whether there are more people in the group who are taller than 6 feet or not. (Answer: no).</p>

<p>This minimum error rule is intuitive and simple, but computing the rule exactly requires examining the entire population. What can we do if we work from a subsample? Just as was the case in experiment design, we’d like to be able to design good prediction functions from a small sample of the population so we don’t have to inspect all individuals. For a <em>fixed</em> function, we could use the same law-of-large-numbers approximations to estimate the best decision. That is, if we decide in advance upon a prediction function, we could estimate the percentage of mistakes on the population by gathering a random sample and computing the proportion of mistakes on this subset. Then we could apply a standard confidence interval analysis to extrapolate to the population.</p>

<p>However, what if we’d like to find a good predictor on the population using only a set of examples sampled from the population. We immediately run into an issue: to find the best prediction function, we needed to observe all possible values of $X$. What if we’d like to make predictions about an individual with a set of attributes that was not observed in our sample?</p>

<p>How can we build accurate population-level predictors from small subsamples? In order to solve this problem, we must make some assumptions about the relationship between predictions at related, but different values of $X$. We can restrict our attention to a set of functions that respect regularity properties that we think the predictions should have. Then, with a subsample from the population, we find the function that minimizes the error on the sample and obeys the prescribed regularity properties.</p>

<p>This optimization procedure is called <em>”empirical risk minimization”</em>  and is the core predictive algorithm of machine learning. Indeed, for all of the talk about neuromorphic deep networks with fancy widgets, most of what machine learning does is try to find computer programs that make good predictions on the data we have collected and that respect some sort of rudimentary knowledge that we have about the broader population.</p>

<p>The flexibility in defining what “knowledge” or “regularity” means complicates the solution of such empirical risk minimization problems. What does the right set of functions look like? There are three immediate concerns:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What is the right <em>representation</em>? The set needs to contain enough functions to well approximate the true population prediction function. There are a variety of ways to express complex functions, and each expression has its own benefits and drawbacks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The set of functions needs to be simple to search over, so we don’t have to evaluate every function in our set as this would be too time consuming. Efficient search for high quality solutions is called <em>optimization</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will the predictor <em>generalize</em> to the broader population? The functions cannot be too complex or else they will fail to capture the regularity and smoothness of the prediction problem (estimating functions of too high complexity is colloquially called “overfitting”).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Balancing representation, optimization, and generalization gets complicated quickly, and this is why we have a gigantic academic and industrial field devoted to the problem.</p>

<p>I’m repeating myself at this point, but I again want to pound my fist on the table and reiterate that nothing in our development here requires that the relationship between the variables $X$ and $Y$ be probabilistic. Statistical models are often the starting point of discussion in machine learning, but such models are just a convenient way to describe populations and their proportions. Prediction can be analyzed in terms of a deterministic population, and, just as we discussed in the case of randomized experiments, randomness can be introduced as a means of sampling the population to determine trends. Even generalization, which is usually studied as a statistical phenomenon, can be analyzed in terms of the randomness of the sampling procedure with no probabilistic modeling of the population.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some sort of knowledge about the population is necessary. The more we know about how prediction varies based on changes in the covariates, the better a predictor we can build. Engineering such prior knowledge into appropriate function classes and optimization algorithms form the art and science of contemporary machine learning.</p>

<p>This discussion highlights that while we <em>can</em> view prediction through the lens of statistical sampling, pigeonholing it as simply “nonparametric statistics” does not do the subject justice. While the <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/28/rct/">jump from mean estimation to causal RCTs is small</a>, the jump from mean estimation to prediction is much less immediate. And in machine learning practice, the intuitions from statistics often don’t apply. For example, conventional wisdom from statistics tells us that evaluating multiple models on the same data set amounts to multiple hypothesis testing, and will lead to overfitting on the test set. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">there</a> <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9117-a-meta-analysis-of-overfitting-in-machine-learning">is</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02168">more</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14444">and</a> <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/shankar20c.html">more</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10498">evidence</a> that using a train-test split leads does not lead to overfitting. Instead, the phenomena we see is that dataset benchmarks can remain useful for decades. Another common refrain from statistics is that model complexity must be explicitly constrained in order to extrapolate to new data, but this also  <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/3/250713-understanding-deep-learning-still-requires-rethinking-generalization/fulltext">does not seem to apply at all to machine learning practice</a>.</p>

<p>Prediction predates probability and statistics by centuries. As Moritz and I chronicle in the introduction to <a href="http://mlstory.org">Patterns, Predictions, and Actions</a> astronomers were using pattern matching to predict celestial motions, and the astronomer Edmund Halley realized that similar techniques could be used to predict life expectancy when pricing annuities. Moreover, even though modern machine learning embraced contemporary developments in statistics by Neyman, Pearson, and Wald, the tools quickly grew more sophisticated and separate from core statistical practice. In the next post, I’ll discuss an early example of this divergence between machine learning and statistics, describing some of the theoretical understanding of the Perceptron in the 1960s and how its analysis was decidedly different from the theory advanced by statisticians.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Today I would like to discuss the Khot-Naor approximation algorithm for the 3-XOR problem, and an open question related to it.</p>
<p><span id="more-4566"/></p>
<p>In 3-XOR, we have a system of linear equations modulo 2, with three variables per equation, that might look something like</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{ll} x_1 + x_2 + x_4 &amp; \equiv 0 \pmod 2\\ x_1 + x_5 + x_6 &amp; \equiv 1 \pmod 2\\ x_2 + x_3 + x_4 &amp; \equiv 1 \pmod 2\\ x_5 + x_3 + x_6 &amp; \equiv 1 \pmod 2 \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bll%7D+x_1+%2B+x_2+%2B+x_4+%26+%5Cequiv+0+%5Cpmod+2%5C%5C+x_1+%2B+x_5+%2B+x_6+%26+%5Cequiv+1+%5Cpmod+2%5C%5C+x_2+%2B+x_3+%2B+x_4+%26+%5Cequiv+1+%5Cpmod+2%5C%5C+x_5+%2B+x_3+%2B+x_6+%26+%5Cequiv+1+%5Cpmod+2+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>The above system is not satisfiable (if we add up the left-hand sides we get 0, if we add up the right-hand sides we get 1), but it is possible to satisfy <img alt="{3/4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the equations, for example by setting all the variables to 1. In Max 3-XOR problem (which we will simply refer to as “3-XOR” from now on), given a system of equations mod 2 with three variables per equation, we want to find an assignment that satisfies as many equations as possible.</p>
<p>Either setting all the variables to zero or setting all the variables to one will satisfy half of the equations, and the interesting question is how much better than 1/2 it is possible to do on a given instance. <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/070691140">Khot and Naor</a> provide an algorithm that, given an instance in which it is possible to satisfy an <img alt="{1/2 + \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2+%2B+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> fraction of equations, finds a solution that satisfies at least <img alt="{1/2 + \epsilon \cdot O \left( \sqrt{\frac {\log n} n} \right)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2+%2B+%5Cepsilon+%5Ccdot+O+%5Cleft%28+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac+%7B%5Clog+n%7D+n%7D+%5Cright%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> fraction of equations, where <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the number of variables. The algorithm is randomized, it runs in polynomial time, and it succeeds with high probability. I believe that it is still the state of the art in terms of worst-case approximation guarantee.</p>
<p>Like the approximation algorithm for sparsest cut in Abelian Cayley graphs implied by the result of Bauer et al. that was the subject of the last two posts, the result of Khot and Naor <em>does not</em> prove a bound on the integrality gap of a relaxation of the problem.</p>
<p>I will describe the Khot-Naor algorithm and describe how it manages to use convex optimization to provide an approximation algorithm, but without establishing an integrality gap bound. I thank my student Lucas Pesenti for explaining the algorithm to me and for thinking together about this problem.</p>
<p>If our 3-XOR instance has <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> equations and <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> variables, then the problem of maximizing the number of satisfied equations can be rewritten as</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac m2 + \max_{x \in \{ -1 , +1 \}^n} \ \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} x_i x_j x_k " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac+m2+%2B+%5Cmax_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B+-1+%2C+%2B1+%5C%7D%5En%7D+%5C+%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+c_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+x_i+x_j+x_k+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> so that our goal is to approximate the combinatorial optimization problem</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \max_{x \in \{ -1 , +1 \}^n} \ \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} x_i x_j x_k " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmax_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B+-1+%2C+%2B1+%5C%7D%5En%7D+%5C+%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+c_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+x_i+x_j+x_k+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> Up to a constant factor loss in the approximation guarantee, Khot and Naor show that the above is equivalent to <a name="tensornorm"/></p>

<p>Before continuing, let us recall that if <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an <img alt="{n \times n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> matrix, then its <img alt="{\ell_\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-to-<img alt="{\ell_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> operator norm has the characterization</p>

<p>We could also define the “Grothendieck norm” <img alt="{|| M ||_{Grot}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%7C+M+%7C%7C_%7BGrot%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of a matrix as the following natural semidefinite programming relaxation of the <img alt="{\ell_\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-to-<img alt="{\ell_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> norm:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{lll} \max &amp; \sum_{i,j} M_{i,j} \langle x_i , y_j\rangle \\ {\rm s.t.}\\ &amp; || x_i ||^2 = 1 &amp; i = 1,\ldots,n\\ &amp; ||y_j ||^2 = 1 &amp; i = j,\ldots,n \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Blll%7D+%5Cmax+%26+%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+M_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%5Clangle+x_i+%2C+y_j%5Crangle+%5C%5C+%7B%5Crm+s.t.%7D%5C%5C+%26+%7C%7C+x_i+%7C%7C%5E2+%3D+1+%26+i+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2Cn%5C%5C+%26+%7C%7Cy_j+%7C%7C%5E2+%3D+1+%26+i+%3D+j%2C%5Cldots%2Cn+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> where the <img alt="{x_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{y_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are arbitrary vectors. The Grothendieck inequality is</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  || M||_{\infty \rightarrow 1 } \leq || M ||_{Grot} \leq O(1) \cdot || M ||_{\infty \rightarrow 1 }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7C%7C+M%7C%7C_%7B%5Cinfty+%5Crightarrow+1+%7D+%5Cleq+%7C%7C+M+%7C%7C_%7BGrot%7D+%5Cleq+O%281%29+%5Ccdot+%7C%7C+M+%7C%7C_%7B%5Cinfty+%5Crightarrow+1+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> where the <img alt="{O(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an absolute constant, known to be less than <img alt="{1.8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Furthermore, the above inequality has a constructive proof, and it leads to a polynomial time constant factor approximation for the problem of finding values <img alt="{x_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{y_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in <img alt="{\pm 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that maximize <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#inftoone">(2)</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, we can see problem <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#tensornorm">(1)</a> as the natural generalization of <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#inftoone">(2)</a> to tensors, and one would like to see a semidefinite programming relaxation of <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#tensornorm">(1)</a> achieving something resembling the Grothendieck inequality, but with a loss of something like <img alt="{\tilde O(\sqrt n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+O%28%5Csqrt+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. As I mentioned above, this remains an open question, as far as I know.</p>
<p>The idea of Khot and Naor is the following. Suppose that we are given an instance <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of problem <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#tensornorm">(1)</a>, and suppose that <img alt="{x^*,y^*,z^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%2A%2Cy%5E%2A%2Cz%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an optimal solution, and let us call</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \epsilon = \sum_{i,j,k} T_{i,j,k} x^*_i y^*_j z^*_k " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cepsilon+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+T_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+x%5E%2A_i+y%5E%2A_j+z%5E%2A_k+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> the value of the optimum (the algorithm will not need to know or guess <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>).</p>
<p>The key step is now to see that if we pick a <em>random</em> <img alt="{x \in \{-1,1\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, there is at least a <img alt="{1/n^{O(1)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Fn%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> probability that</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{i,j,k} T_{i,j,k} x_i y^*_j z^*_k \geq \epsilon \cdot \Omega \left(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{n}} \right) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+T_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+x_i+y%5E%2A_j+z%5E%2A_k+%5Cgeq+%5Cepsilon+%5Ccdot+%5COmega+%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog+n%7D%7Bn%7D%7D+%5Cright%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> This is a bit difficult, but it is really easy to see that with <img alt="{1/n^{O(1)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Fn%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> probability we have <a name="main"/></p>
<p><a name="main"/></p><a name="main">
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle   \sum_{i,j,k} T_{i,j,k} x_i y^*_j z^*_k \geq \epsilon \cdot \Omega \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}} \right) \ \ \ \ \ (3)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+++%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+T_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+x_i+y%5E%2A_j+z%5E%2A_k+%5Cgeq+%5Cepsilon+%5Ccdot+%5COmega+%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%7D+%5Cright%29+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%283%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
</a><p><a name="main"/><a name="main"/> and we can do that by seeing that by defining a vector <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that <img alt="{w_i = \sum_{j,k} T_{i,j,k} y^*_j z^*_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_i+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bj%2Ck%7D+T_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+y%5E%2A_j+z%5E%2A_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so that</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \langle x, w \rangle = \sum_{i,j,k} T_{i,j,k} x_i y^*_j z^*_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clangle+x%2C+w+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+T_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+x_i+y%5E%2A_j+z%5E%2A_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> So we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \langle x^*,w \rangle = \epsilon " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clangle+x%5E%2A%2Cw+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cepsilon+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> which, using Cauchy-Schwarz, gives</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  || w||^2 \geq \epsilon^2 /n " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7C%7C+w%7C%7C%5E2+%5Cgeq+%5Cepsilon%5E2+%2Fn+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> Now, for a random <img alt="{x\sim \{ -1,1\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Csim+%5C%7B+-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} \langle x,w \rangle^2 = || w||^2 \geq \epsilon^2 /n " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Clangle+x%2Cw+%5Crangle%5E2+%3D+%7C%7C+w%7C%7C%5E2+%5Cgeq+%5Cepsilon%5E2+%2Fn+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> and</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} \langle x,w \rangle^4 \leq n^{O(1)} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Clangle+x%2Cw+%5Crangle%5E4+%5Cleq+n%5E%7BO%281%29%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> so by Paley–Zygmund we have, let’s say</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb P} \left[ \langle x,w \rangle^2 \geq \frac {\epsilon^2}{2n} \right] \geq \frac 1 {n^{O(1)}} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+P%7D+%5Cleft%5B+%5Clangle+x%2Cw+%5Crangle%5E2+%5Cgeq+%5Cfrac+%7B%5Cepsilon%5E2%7D%7B2n%7D+%5Cright%5D+%5Cgeq+%5Cfrac+1+%7Bn%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> which, together with the definition of <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and the fact that the distribution of <img alt="{\langle x, w\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+x%2C+w%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is symmetric around zero, gives us the claim <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#main">(3)</a>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that we have been lucky and that we have found such an <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We define the matrix</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  X_{j,k} = \sum_i T_{i,j,k} x_i " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++X_%7Bj%2Ck%7D+%3D+%5Csum_i+T_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+x_i+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> and we see that our claim can be written as</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  y^{*T} X z^* \geq \epsilon \cdot \Omega \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}} \right) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y%5E%7B%2AT%7D+X+z%5E%2A+%5Cgeq+%5Cepsilon+%5Ccdot+%5COmega+%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%7D+%5Cright%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> At this point we just apply the algorithm implied by the Grothendieck inequality to the matrix <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and we find <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in <img alt="{\{ -1,1 \}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B+-1%2C1+%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  y^T X z \geq \epsilon \cdot \Omega \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}} \right)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y%5ET+X+z+%5Cgeq+%5Cepsilon+%5Ccdot+%5COmega+%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%7D+%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> meaning that</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{i,j,k} T_{i,j,k} x_i y_j z_k \geq \epsilon \cdot \Omega \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}}\right) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+T_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+x_i+y_j+z_k+%5Cgeq+%5Cepsilon+%5Ccdot+%5COmega+%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%7D%5Cright%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Summarizing, our algorithm is to pick a random vector <img alt="{x\sim \{-1,1\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Csim+%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and to find a constant-factor approximation for the problem <a name="xfixed"/></p>
<p><a name="xfixed"/></p><a name="xfixed">
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle   \max_{y,z \in \{-1,1\}^n} \ \sum_{i,j,k} T_{i,j,k} x_iy_jz_k \ \ \ \ \ (4)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+++%5Cmax_%7By%2Cz+%5Cin+%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D+%5C+%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+T_%7Bi%2Cj%2Ck%7D+x_iy_jz_k+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%284%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
</a><p><a name="xfixed"/><a name="xfixed"/> using semidefinite programming. We do that <img alt="{n^{O(1)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> times, and take the best solution.</p>
<p>The analysis can be turned into an upper bound certificate in the following way. For the (suboptimal) analysis using Paley-Zygmund, we only need the entries of the random <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be 4-wise independent, and there are distributions on <img alt="{\{-1,1\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where the entries are unbiased and 4-wise independent, and such that the sample space is of size polynomial in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Thus, one could write an SDP relaxation of <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#xfixed">(4)</a> for each <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the support of such a distribution, and then take the maximum of these SDPs, multiply it by <img alt="{O(\sqrt n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and it would be a certified upper bound. Such an upper bound, however, would not come from a relaxation of the 3-XOR problem, and I find it really strange that it is not clear how to turn these ideas into a proof that, say, the standard degree-4 sum-of-squares semidefinite programming relaxation of 3-XOR has an integrality gap at most <img alt="{\tilde O(\sqrt n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+O%28%5Csqrt+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p></div>

    <title>I have a book out on muffins (you prob already know that)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><i>Lance</i>: How come you haven't blogged on your muffin book? You've blogged about two books by Harry Lewis (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/10/how-have-computers-changed-society.html">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/08/what-are-most-important-46-papers-in.html">here</a>) one book by the lesswrong community (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/09/review-of-blog-book-based-on-less-wrong.html">here</a>), and you even did a mashup of a post by two different Scott A's (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/08/combing-two-posts-blankface-scott-aa.html">here</a>),  but not on your own work.</p><p><i>Bill</i>: I thought I did a post on my muffin book.</p><p><i>Lance</i>: No. You have blogged <i>about </i>the muffin problem, and sometimes you <i>mention</i> either the book or the problem in passing, but you haven't had a post that says</p><p><i><b>HEY, I wrote a book!</b></i></p><p>And this is all the more strange since you asked me to have the book on our blog page. </p><p><i>Bill: </i>(Searches blog with keyword muffin and finds no ref to muffin book). Well pierce my ears and call be drafty! I have not posted on the muffin book! Do you recall my thoughts on when to tell people you are working on a book?</p><p><i>Lance</i>: No</p><p><i>Bill</i>:  I had a college roommate who was an aspiring science fiction writer who told me there are two kinds of people: Those who talk about writing a book, and those who write a book. I have adapted this to:</p><p><i><b>Do not tell people you are writing a book until you are picking out the cover art.</b></i></p><p><i>Lance: </i>I posted about my book when I hadn't even decided on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/06/name-my-book.html">the title</a>. But your cover art is picked out (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Muffin-Morsels-Problem-Mathematics/dp/9811215170">here</a>).  And, by the way, its very nice, though it makes me hungry. So I think you can begin talking about the book.</p><p><i>Bill</i>: Indeed! I will!</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><b>Hey I have a book! (See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Muffin-Morsels-Problem-Mathematics/dp/9811215170">here</a> to buy it on amazon.) </b></p><p><b>Title: Mathematical Muffin Morsels: Nobody Wants a Small Piece</b></p><p><b>by Gasarch, Metz, Prinz, Smolyak</b></p><p><b>(The other authors were undergraduates when we wrote the book. Prinz and Smolyak are now grad students in CS, Metz is in Finance.) </b></p><p><b>Origin: </b></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">Martin Gardner</a> wrote a Mathematics Recreational column for Scientific American for many years, starting in 1956 and ending in the early 1980s. For many STEM people of my generation (Using my <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/10/nature-vs-nurture-close-to-my-birthday.html">fake birthday</a> of Oct 1, 1960, I am 62 years old) Martin Gardner's columns were both an inspiration and an early exposure to mathematics. His columns also made the line between Mathematical Recreation and so-called serious mathematics thin or nonexistent. (See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/FRED/gardner.pdf">here</a> for a review of Martin Gardner in the 21st century, a book about the kind of math Gardner wrote of. The book makes a mockery of the distinction between recreational and serious mathematics.) He passed away in 2010 at the age of 95.</p><p>There is a gathering in his honor that is hold roughly every 2 years, called <a href="https://www.gathering4gardner.org/">Gathering For Gardner</a>. (It was cancelled in Spring 2020 and Spring 2021 because of COVID- though its in Atlanta where the CDC is, so they could have had it as an experiment and told the CDC the results). You have to be invited to goto it. I got an invite for 2016 from my contact at World Scientific who published my previous book, <i>Problems with a Point: Exploring Math and Computer Science co-authored with Clyde Kruskal </i> (I had two blogs on it, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/02/problems-with-point-exploring-math-and.html">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/04/problems-with-point-not-plug-just-some.html">here</a>, and you can buy it on amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279974">here</a>.) I did three posts on G4G-2016 (<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/04/some-short-bits-from-gathering-for.html">here</a>, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/05/some-more-bits-from-gathering-for.html">here</a>, and <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/search?q=Gathering">here</a>).</p><p>Aside from seeing some great talks that I understood and liked, I also picked up a pamphlet titled:</p><p><b>The Julia Robinson Math Festival</b></p><p><b>A Sample of Mathematical Puzzles</b></p><p><b>Compiled By Nancy Blackman</b></p><p>One of the problems, credited to Alan Frank, was</p><p>How can you divide and distribute 5 muffins for 3 students so that everyone gets 5/3 and the smallest piece is as big as possible?</p><p>They had some other values for muffins and students as well. </p><p>I solved the (5,3) problem and the other ones as well. That was fun. </p><p>When I got home I began looking at the problem for m muffins and s students. I let f(m,s) be the biggest smallest piece possible for giving out m muffins to s students. I proved a general theorem, called the <i>Floor-Ceiling theorem</i>, that always gives an upper bound, FC(m,s) on f(m,s). I worked out formulas for </p><p>f(m,1) (trivial), </p><p>f(m,2) (trivial), </p><p>f(m,3) (its always FC(m,3),</p><p> f(m,4) (its always FC(m,4)).</p><p>While working on f(m,5) I found that  f(m,5) was always FC(m,5) EXCEPT for m=11. So what's up with f(11,5)?  </p><p>By the Floor Ceiling theorem f(11,5) \le 11/25. We (at that point several ugrads and HS students had joined the project)  were unable to find a protocol that would show f(11,5)\ge 11/25. Personally I thought there WAS such an protocol but perhaps it was more complicated than the ones we had found (We were finding them by hand using some easy linear algebra.) Perhaps a computer program was needed. We did find a protocol for f(11,5)\ge 13/30, which surely was not optimal. </p><p>While on an Amtrak I began working out the following train of thought: The protocol for f(11,5)\le 11/25 MUST have </p><p>(1) every muffin cut into two pieces,</p><p>(2) 3 students get 4 pieces, </p><p>(3) 2 students get 5 pieces. </p><p>While working on getting a protocol for f(11,5)\le 11/25 with these properties I found that... <i>there could be no such protocol</i>! Then by reworking what I did I found that f(11,5)\le 13/30. So it was done! and we had a new technique, which we call <i>The Half Method. </i>To see the full proof see my slides <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/MUFFINS/muffintalkGen.pdf">here</a></p><p>The story above is typical: We get f(m,k) for all 1\le k\le SOMETHING, we get stuck, and then we find ANOTHER technique to show upper bounds (which in this case are limits on how well we can do). This happened about 8 times depending on how you count.  After a while we realized that this could not just be an article, this was a book! World Scienfiic agreed to publish it, and its out now.</p><p>Misc Notes</p><p>1) I got a conference paper out of it, in the Fun with Algorithms Conference, with some of the co-authors on the book, and some other people. <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/frontdoor.php?source_opus=8806">here is the conf paper</a>.</p><p>2) Early on we realized that f(m,s) = (m/s)f(s,m) so we only had to look at the m&gt;s case.</p><p>3) The fact that f(m,s) exists and is rational is not obvious, but is true. In fact, f(m,s) can be found by a mixed-int program. </p><p>4) Late on in the process I found that there was a by-invite-only math newsgroup that had discussed the problem, and in fact was where Alan Frank first posted it. I obtained their materials and found that they had already shown f(m,s)=(m/s)f(s,m) and also that the answer is always rational and exists. Aside from that our results did not overlap.</p><p>5) Even later in the process Scott Huddleston emailed me (out of the blue) that he had a program that solved the muffin problem quickly. I was skeptical at first, but he did indeed have a whole new way to look at the problem and his code was very fast (I had Jacob Prinz, one of the co-authors on the book, recode it). Later Richard Chatwin (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08726">here</a>) seems to have proven that Scott's method always works. The approach of Scott and Richard is where to go if you want to do serious further research on Muffins. My book is where you want to go if you want to learn some easy and fun math (a HS student could read it). </p><p>6) I co-authored a column with Scott H, Erik Metz, Jacob Prinz on Muffins, featuring his technique, in Lane's complexity column, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/sigmuffins.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>7) I had an REU student, Stephanie Warman, write a muffin package based on the book.</p><p>8) I gave a talk an invited talk on The Muffin Problem  at a Joint AMS-MAA meeting. </p><p>9) I gave a talk at Gathering for Gardner 2018 on The Muffin Problem. </p><p>10) I often give talks on it to groups of High School students.</p><p>11) When I teach Discrete Math Honors I talk about it and assign problems on it- it really is part of the course. As such its a good way to reinforce the pigeon hole principle. </p><p>12) I contacted Alan Frank about my work. We arranged to meet at an MIT combinatorics seminar where I was to give a talk on muffins. He brought 11 muffins, with 1 cut (1/2,1/2), 2 cut (14/30,16/30),</p><p>and 8 cut (13/30,17/30) so that the 11 of us could each get 11/5 with smallest piece 13/30. </p><p>13) Coda: </p><p>Why did I keep working on this problem?  I kept working on it because I kept hitting barriers and (with co-authors) breaking them with new techniques that were interesting.  If early on a barrier was not breakable then I would have stopped. If (say) Floor-ceiling solved everything than I might have gotten a paper out of  this, but surely not a book.</p><p>Lesson for all of us: look around you! Its not clear what is going to inspire a project!</p><p>Lasting effect: I am reluctant to throw out old math magazines and pamphlets since you never know when one will lead to a book.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title xml:lang="en-US">Gaussian BosonSampling, higher-order correlations, and spoofing: An update</title>
    <summary xml:lang="en-US">In my last post, I wrote (among other things) about an ongoing scientific debate between the group of Chaoyang Lu at USTC in China, which over the past year has been doing experiments that seek to demonstrate quantum supremacy via Gaussian BosonSampling; and the group of Sergio Boixo at Google, which had a recent paper […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5859">last post</a>, I wrote (among other things) about an ongoing scientific debate between the group of Chaoyang Lu at USTC in China, which over the past year has been doing experiments that seek to demonstrate quantum supremacy via Gaussian BosonSampling; and the group of Sergio Boixo at Google, which had a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11525">recent paper</a> on a polynomial-time classical algorithm to sample approximately from the same distributions.  I reported the facts as I understood them at the time.  Since then, though, a long call with the Google team gave me a new and different understanding, and I feel duty-bound to share that here.</p>



<p>A week ago, I considered it obvious that if, using a classical spoofer, you could beat the USTC experiment on a metric like total variation distance from the ideal distribution, then you would’ve completely destroyed USTC’s claim of quantum supremacy.  The reason I believed <em>that</em>, in turn, is a proposition that I hadn’t given a name but needs one, so let me call it <strong>Hypothesis H</strong>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The only way a classical algorithm to spoof BosonSampling can possibly do well in total variation distance, is by correctly reproducing the high-order correlations (correlations among the occupation numbers of large numbers of modes) — because that’s where the complexity of BosonSampling lies (if it lies anywhere).</p></blockquote>



<p>Hypothesis H had important downstream consequences.  Google’s algorithm, by the Google team’s own admission, does not reproduce the high-order correlations.  Furthermore, because of limitations on both samples and classical computation time, Google’s paper calculates the total variation distance from the ideal distribution only on the marginal distribution on roughly 14 out of 144 modes.  On that marginal distribution, Google’s algorithm does do better than the experiment in total variation distance.  Google presents a claimed extrapolation to the full 144 modes, but eyeballing the graphs, it was far from clear to me what would happen: like, maybe the spoofing algorithm would continue to win, but maybe the experiment would turn around and win; who knows?</p>



<p>Chaoyang, meanwhile, made a clear prediction that the experiment would turn around and win, because of</p>



<ol><li>the experiment’s success in reproducing the high-order correlations,</li><li>the admitted failure of Google’s algorithm in reproducing the high-order correlations, and</li><li>the seeming impossibility of doing well on BosonSampling <em>without</em> reproducing the high-order correlations (Hypothesis H).</li></ol>



<p>Given everything my experience told me about the central importance of high-order correlations for BosonSampling, I was inclined to agree with Chaoyang.</p>



<p>Now for the kicker: it seems that Hypothesis H is false.  A classical spoofer could beat a BosonSampling experiment on total variation distance from the ideal distribution, without even bothering to reproduce the high-order correlations correctly.</p>



<p>This is true because of a combination of two facts about the existing noisy BosonSampling experiments.  The first fact is that the contribution from the order-k correlations falls off like 1/exp(k).  The second fact is that, due to calibration errors and the like, the experiments already show significant deviations from the ideal distribution on the order-1 and order-2 correlations.</p>



<p>Put these facts together and what do you find?  Well, suppose your classical spoofing algorithm takes care to get the low-order contributions to the distribution exactly right.  Just for that reason alone, it could already win over a noisy BosonSampling experiment, as judged by benchmarks like total variation distance from the ideal distribution, or for that matter linear cross-entropy.  Yes, the experiment will beat the classical simulation on the higher-order correlations.  But because those higher-order correlations are exponentially attenuated anyway, they won’t be enough to make up the difference.  The experiment’s lack of perfection on the low-order correlations will swamp everything else.</p>



<p>Granted, I still don’t know for sure that this <em>is</em> what happens — that depends on whether I believe Sergio or Chaoyang about the extrapolation of the variation distance to the full 144 modes (my own eyeballs having failed to render a verdict!).  But I now see that it’s logically possible, maybe even plausible.</p>



<p>So, let’s imagine for the sake of argument that Google’s simulation wins on variation distance, even though the experiment wins on the high-order correlations.  In that case, what would be our verdict: would USTC have achieved quantum supremacy via BosonSampling, or not?</p>



<p>It’s clear what each side could say.</p>



<p>Google could say: by a metric that Scott Aaronson, the coinventor of BosonSampling, thought was perfectly adequate as late as last week — namely, total variation distance from the ideal distribution — we won.  We achieved lower variation distance than USTC’s experiment, and we did it using a fast classical algorithm.  End of discussion.  No moving the goalposts after the fact.</p>



<p>Google could even add: BosonSampling is a <em>sampling</em> task; it’s right there in the name!  The only purpose of any benchmark — whether Linear XEB or high-order correlation — is to give evidence about whether you are or aren’t sampling from a distribution close to the ideal one.  But that means that, if you accept that we <em>are</em> doing the latter better than the experiment, then there’s nothing more to argue about.</p>



<p>USTC could respond: even if Scott Aaronson <em>is</em> the coinventor of BosonSampling, he’s extremely far from an infallible oracle.  In the case at hand, his lack of appreciation for the sources of error in realistic experiments caused him to fixate inappropriately on variation distance as the success criterion.  If you want to see the quantum advantage in our system, you have to deliberately subtract off the low-order correlations and look at the high-order correlations.</p>



<p>USTC could add: from the very beginning, the whole point of quantum supremacy experiments was to demonstrate a clear speedup on <em>some</em> benchmark — we never particularly cared which one!  That horse is out of the barn as soon as we’re talking about quantum supremacy at all — something the Google group, which itself reported the first quantum supremacy experiment in Fall 2019, again for a completely artificial benchmark — knows as well as anyone else.  (The Google team even has experience with adjusting benchmarks: when, for example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03074">Pan and Zhang</a> pointed out that Linear XEB as originally specified is pretty easy to spoof for random 2D circuits, the most cogent rejoinder was: OK, fine then, add an extra check that the returned samples are sufficiently different from one another, which kills Pan and Zhang’s spoofing strategy.)  In that case, then, why isn’t a benchmark tailored to the high-order correlations as good as variation distance or linear cross-entropy or any other benchmark?</p>



<p>Both positions are reasonable and have merit — though I confess to somewhat greater sympathy for the one that appeals to my doofosity rather than my supposed infallibility!</p>



<p>OK, but suppose, again for the sake of argument, that we accepted the second position, and we said that USTC gets to declare quantum supremacy as long as its experiment does better than any known classical simulation at reproducing the high-order correlations.  We’d still face the question: does the USTC experiment, in fact, do better on that metric?  It would be awkward if, having won the right to change the rules in its favor, USTC still lost even under the new rules.</p>



<p>Sergio tells me that USTC directly reported experimental data only for up to order-7 correlations, and at least individually, the order-7 correlations are easy to reproduce on a laptop (although <em>sampling</em> in a way that reproduces the order-7 correlations might still be hard—a point that Chaoyang confirms, and where further research would be great).  OK, but USTC also reported that their experiment seems to reproduce up to order-19 correlations.  And order-19 correlations, the Google team agrees, are hard to sample consistently with on a classical computer by any currently known algorithm.</p>



<p>So then, why don’t we have direct data for the order-19 correlations?  The trouble is simply that it would’ve taken USTC an astronomical amount of computation time.  So instead, they relied on a statistical extrapolation from the observed strength of the lower-order correlations — there we go again with the extrapolations!  Of course, if we’re going to let Google rest its case on an extrapolation, then maybe it’s only sporting to let USTC do the same.</p>



<p>You might wonder: why didn’t we have to worry about any of this stuff with the <em>other</em> path to quantum supremacy, the one via random circuit sampling with superconducting qubits?  The reason is that, with random circuit sampling, all the correlations except the highest-order ones are completely trivial — or, to say it another way, the reduced state of any small number of output qubits is exponentially close to the maximally mixed state.  This is a real difference between BosonSampling and random circuit sampling—and even 5-6 years ago, we knew that this represented an advantage for random circuit sampling, although I now have a deeper appreciation for just how great of an advantage it is.  For it means that, with random circuit sampling, it’s easier to place a “sword in the stone”: to say, for example, <em>here</em> is the Linear XEB score achieved by the trivial classical algorithm that outputs random bits, and lo, our experiment achieves a higher score, and lo, we challenge anyone to invent a fast classical spoofing method that achieves a similarly high score.</p>



<p>With BosonSampling, by contrast, we have various metrics with which to judge performance, but so far, for none of those metrics do we have a plausible hypothesis that says “<em>here’s</em> the best that any polynomial-time classical algorithm can possibly hope to do, and it’s completely plausible that even a noisy current or planned BosonSampling experiment can do better than that.”</p>



<p>In the end, then, I come back to the exact same three goals I would’ve recommended a week ago for the future of quantum supremacy experiments, but with all of them now even more acutely important than before:</p>



<ol><li>Experimentally, to increase the fidelity of the devices (with BosonSampling, for example, to observe a larger contribution from the high-order correlations) — a much more urgent goal, from the standpoint of evading classical spoofing algorithms, than further increasing the dimensionality of the Hilbert space.</li><li>Theoretically, to design better ways to verify the results of sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments classically — ideally, even ways that could be applied via polynomial-time tests.</li><li>For Gaussian BosonSampling in particular, to get a better understanding of the plausible limits of classical spoofing algorithms, and exactly how good a noisy device needs to be before it exceeds those limits.</li></ol>



<p>Thanks so much to Sergio Boixo and Ben Villalonga for the conversation, and to Chaoyang Lu and Jelmer Renema for comments on this post.  Needless to say, any remaining errors are my own.</p></div>

<p> The reader will see that our argument could also prove (roughly as done by Bauer et al.) that <img alt="{\phi(G^t) \leq O(\sqrt d) \cdot \phi(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%28G%5Et%29+%5Cleq+O%28%5Csqrt+d%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, simply by reasoning about distributions of cuts instead of reasoning about ARV solutions, which would give <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#buser">(2)</a> more directly. By reasoning about ARV solutions, however, we are also able to establish <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#arvapx">(3)</a>, which we think is independently interesting.</p>
<p>It remains to prove <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#rw">(4)</a>. I will provide a completely self-contained proof, including the definition of Cayley graphs and of the ARV relaxation, but, first, here is a summary for the reader already familiar with this material: we take an optimal solution of ARV for <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and bound how well it does for <img alt="{G^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We need to understand how much bigger is the fraction of edges cut by the solution in <img alt="{G^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> compared to the fraction of edges cut in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; a random edge in <img alt="{G^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is obtained by randomly sampling <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> generators and adding them together, which is roughly like sampling <img alt="{t/d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%2Fd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> times each generator, each time with a random sign. Because of cancellations, we expect that the sum of these <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> random generators can be obtained by summing roughly <img alt="{\sqrt{t/d}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bt%2Fd%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> copies of each of the <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> generators, or <img alt="{\sqrt{td}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Btd%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> generators in total. So a random edge of <img alt="{G^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> corresponds roughly to <img alt="{\sqrt{td}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Btd%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> edges of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and this is by how much, at most, the fraction of cut edges can grow.</p>
<p><b>2. Definitions </b></p>
<p>Now we present more details and definition. Recall that if <img alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a group, for which we use additive notation, and <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a set or multiset of group elements, then the Cayley graph <img alt="{Cay(\Gamma,S)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BCay%28%5CGamma%2CS%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the graph that has a vertex for every group element and an edge <img alt="{(x,x+s)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x%2Cx%2Bs%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for every group element <img alt="{x\in \Gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Cin+%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and every element <img alt="{s\in S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%5Cin+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We restrict ourselves to undirected graphs, so we will always assume that if <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an element of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then <img alt="{-s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-s%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is also an element of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (with the same multiplicity, if <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if a multiset). Note that the resulting undirected graph is <img alt="{|S|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CS%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-regular.</p>
<p>Several families of graphs can be seen to be Cayley graphs, including cycles, cliques, balanced complete bipartite graphs, hypercubes, toruses, and so on. All the above examples are actually Cayley graphs of <em>Abelian</em> groups. Several interesting families of graphs, for example several families of expanders, are Cayley graphs of non-Abelian groups, but the result of this post will apply only to Abelian groups.</p>
<p>To define the ARV relaxation, let us take it slowly and start from the definition of the sparsest cut problem. The edge expansion problem <img alt="{\phi(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is closely related to the <em>sparsest cut</em> problem, which can be defined as</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sigma(G) := \min_{x \in \{0,1\}^V} \ \ \frac{x^T L_G x}{x^T L_K x } " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csigma%28G%29+%3A%3D+%5Cmin_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5EV%7D+%5C+%5C+%5Cfrac%7Bx%5ET+L_G+x%7D%7Bx%5ET+L_K+x+%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> where <img alt="{L_G = I - A/d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_G+%3D+I+-+A%2Fd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the normalized Laplacian of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{L_K = I - J/n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_K+%3D+I+-+J%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the normalized Laplacian of the clique on <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> vertices. We wrote it this way to emphasize the similarity with the computation of the second smallest normalized Laplacian eigenvalue, which can be written as</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \lambda_2 (G) = \min_{x \in R^V : \ x \perp {\bf 1}} \ \ \frac {x^T L_G x}{x^Tx } = \min_{x\in R^V} \frac {x^T L_G x}{x^T L_K x} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda_2+%28G%29+%3D+%5Cmin_%7Bx+%5Cin+R%5EV+%3A+%5C+x+%5Cperp+%7B%5Cbf+1%7D%7D+%5C+%5C+%5Cfrac+%7Bx%5ET+L_G+x%7D%7Bx%5ETx+%7D+%3D+%5Cmin_%7Bx%5Cin+R%5EV%7D+%5Cfrac+%7Bx%5ET+L_G+x%7D%7Bx%5ET+L_K+x%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> where the second equality is perhaps not obvious but is easily proved (all the solutions <img alt="{x\perp {\bf 1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Cperp+%7B%5Cbf+1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> have the same cost function on both sides, and the last expression is shift invariant, so there is no loss in optimizing over all <img alt="{{\mathbb R}^V}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%5EV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or just in the space <img alt="{\perp {\bf 1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cperp+%7B%5Cbf+1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>). We see that the computation of <img alt="{\lambda_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is just a relaxation of the sparsest cut problem, and so we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \lambda_2(G) \leq \sigma(G) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda_2%28G%29+%5Cleq+%5Csigma%28G%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> We can write the sparsest cut problem in a less algebraic version as</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{L_G \bullet X}{L_K\bullet X} = \frac{\sum_i x_i^T L_G x_i}{\sum_i x_i^T L_Kx_i} \geq \min_i \frac{ x_i^T L_G x_i}{x_i^T L_Kx_i} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7BL_G+%5Cbullet+X%7D%7BL_K%5Cbullet+X%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_i+x_i%5ET+L_G+x_i%7D%7B%5Csum_i+x_i%5ET+L_Kx_i%7D+%5Cgeq+%5Cmin_i+%5Cfrac%7B+x_i%5ET+L_G+x_i%7D%7Bx_i%5ET+L_Kx_i%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>

<p> which is a relaxation of sparsest cut because the “triangle inequality” constraints that we introduced are satisfied by 1-dimensional 0/1 solutions. Thus we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \lambda_2 (G) \leq ARV(G) \leq \phi(G) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda_2+%28G%29+%5Cleq+ARV%28G%29+%5Cleq+%5Cphi%28G%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p><b>3. The Argument </b></p>
<p>Let us take any solution for ARV, and let us symmetrize it so that the symmetrized solution <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> satisfies</p>

<p> That is, make sure that the contribution of each edge to the numerator of the cost function depends only on the generator that defines the edge, and not on the pair of endpoints.</p>
<p>It is easier to see that this symmetrization is possible if we view our solution as a PSD matrix <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In this case, for every group element <img alt="{g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we can let <img alt="{X_g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX_g%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be the solution (with the same cost) obtained by permuting rows and columns according to the mapping <img alt="{v \rightarrow g+ v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv+%5Crightarrow+g%2B+v%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; then we can consider the solution <img alt="{\frac 1n \sum_{g\in V} X_g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac+1n+%5Csum_%7Bg%5Cin+V%7D+X_g%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which satisfies the required symmetry condition.</p>

<p>So every solution of ARV for <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is also a solution for <img alt="{G^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with a cost that increases at most by a <img alt="{O(\sqrt {dt})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+%7Bdt%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> factor, which proves <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#rw">(4)</a> as promised.</p>
<p><b>4. A Couple of Interesting Questions </b></p>
<p>We showed that ARV has integrality gap at most <img alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for every <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-regular Abelian Cayley graph, but we did not demonstrate a rounding algorithm able to achieve an <img alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> approximation ratio.</p>
<p>If we follow the argument, starting from an ARV solution of cost <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, choosing <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the order of <img alt="{1/d\epsilon^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Fd%5Cepsilon%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> we see that <img alt="{G^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> has an ARV solution (the same as before) of cost at most, say, <img alt="{1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and so <img alt="{\lambda_2(G^t) \leq 1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_2%28G%5Et%29+%5Cleq+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, implying that <img alt="{\lambda_2(G) \leq O(1/t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_2%28G%29+%5Cleq+O%281%2Ft%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and so Fiedler’s algorithm according to a Laplacian eigenvalue finds a cut of sparsity at most <img alt="{O(\sqrt{1/t}) = O(\sqrt d \cdot \epsilon )}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7B1%2Ft%7D%29+%3D+O%28%5Csqrt+d+%5Ccdot+%5Cepsilon+%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>We can also see that if <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the matrix corresponding to an ARV solution of value <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then one of the eigenvectors <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> must be a test vector of Rayleigh quotient at most <img alt="{1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for the Laplacian <img alt="{G^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is order of <img alt="{1/d\epsilon^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Fd%5Cepsilon%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. However it is not clear how to get, from such a vector, a test vector for the Laplacian of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of Rayleigh quotient at most <img alt="{O(\sqrt {1/t} )}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+%7B1%2Ft%7D+%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for the Laplacian of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, though one such vector should be <img alt="{A^k x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%5Ek+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for a properly chosen <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the range <img alt="{1,\ldots, t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5Cldots%2C+t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>If this actually work, then the following, or something like that, would be a rounding algorithm: given a PSD solution <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of ARV of cost <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, consider PSD matrices of the form <img alt="{A^t X A^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%5Et+X+A%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which do not necessarily satisfy the triangle inequalities any more, for <img alt="{t = 1,\ldots, 1/d\epsilon^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2C+1%2Fd%5Cepsilon%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and try to round them using a random hyperplane. Would this make sense for other classes of graphs?</p>
<p>It is plausible that sparsest cut in Abelian Cayley graphs has actually a constant-factor approximation in polynomial or quasi-polynomial time, and maybe either that ARV achieves constant-factor approximation.</p></div>

Giorgio Parisi has just been awarded the 2021 Physics Nobel Prize for his work on the disorder in systems of all kinds. At the same time Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann won for their joint work on the physical modeling of the Earth’s climate and reliably predicting global warming.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I look at some aspects of this year’s <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/summary/">prizes</a>.</p>
<p>
Small issue: I do believe in human-caused global warming, but shouldn’t the citation read: <i>for reliably predicting the future temperature of the planet</i>? Currently it reads a bit like <i>for reliably predicting the <b>rise</b> in the global stock market</i>, as if the outcome not the model were primary. </p>
<p>
Oh well. Every year there are Nobel prizes awarded for things that have at least some computational aspect. This year’s prize is certainly for something related to computation. One aspect that we are hoping for is Aspect—Alain Aspect. Ken was among <a href="https://www.insidescience.org/news/nine-nobel-prize-predictions-2021">those</a> <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211005-invisibility-cloak-and-quantum-physics-tipped-for-nobel-prize">tipping</a> him, John Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for this year’s prize—for their work demonstrating quantum entanglement and non-classical experimental outcomes. This work spans substantial areas of quantum computing.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> General Comments </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The Nobel committee’s technical <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2021/10/sciback_fy_en_21.pdf">review</a> of the prizewinning trio’s accomplishments ends with an expansive comment: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Clearly this year’s Laureates have made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of complex physical systems in their broadest sense, from the microscopic to the global. They show that without a proper accounting of disorder, noise and variability, determinism is just an illusion. Indeed, the work recognized here reflects in part the comment ascribed to Richard Feynman (Nobel Laureate 1965), that he “Believed in the primacy of doubt, not as a blemish on our ability to know, but as the essence of knowing.”</em></p><em>

Recognizing the work of this troika reflects the importance of understanding that no single prediction of anything can be taken as inviolable truth, and that without soberly probing the origins of variability we cannot understand the behavior of any system. Therefore, only after having considered these origins do we understand that global warming is real and attributable to our own activities, that a vast array of the phenomena we observe in nature emerge from an underlying disorder, and that embracing the noise and uncertainty is an essential step on the road towards predictability. </em>

For some general comments by Parisi, see his <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/parisi/interview/">interview</a>. He says lots of neat stuff including:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Well, things that <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> Well, my mentor Nicola Cabibbo was usually saying that we should work on a problem only if working on the problem is fun. So, I mean, fun is not very clear what it means, but it’s something that we find deeply interesting, and that we strongly believe that it is <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> I mean you won’t find fun in <i>unclear</i> because one gets a new idea of something unexpected and so on. So I tried to work on something that was interesting and which I believed that had some capacity to add something. </em>

</p><p/><h2> His Trick </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The Nobel citation says: “One of the many theoretical tools Professor Parisi has used to establish his theory is the so-called ‘replica trick’—a mathematical method which takes a disordered system, replicates it multiple times, and compares how different replicas of the system behave. You can do this, for instance, by compressing marbles in a box, which will form a different configuration each time you make the compression. Over many repetitions, Parisi knew, telling patterns might emerge.” They point to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2722">paper</a> from talks by Parisi in 2013 also involving Flaviano Morone, Francesco Caltagirone, and Elizabeth Harrison. </p>
<p>
The trick has a Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replica_trick">page</a>, which says that its crux “is that while the disorder averaging is done assuming <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be an integer, to recover the disorder-averaged logarithm one must send <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> continuously to zero. This apparent contradiction at the heart of the replica trick has never been formally resolved, however in all cases where the replica method can be compared with other exact solutions, the methods lead to the same results.” </p>
<p>
The mathematical identity underlying the replica trick is </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \ln Z = \lim_{n\rightarrow 0}\frac{Z^n - 1}{n}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cln+Z+%3D+%5Clim_%7Bn%5Crightarrow+0%7D%5Cfrac%7BZ%5En+-+1%7D%7Bn%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>The <img alt="{Z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(statistical_mechanics)">partition function</a> of a physical system or some related thermodynamical measure. The power <img alt="{Z^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> represents <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> independent copies of the system—if <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an integer, that is. But instead we treat <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as a real number going to zero. The formal justification is best seen via a Taylor series expansion: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}  \lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \frac{Z^n - 1}{n} &amp;=&amp; \lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \frac{-1 + e^{n \ln Z}}{n}\\ &amp;=&amp; \lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \frac{-1 + 1 + n \ln Z + \frac{1}{2!} (n \ln Z)^2 + \frac{1}{3!} (n \ln Z)^3 + \dots}{n}\\ &amp;=&amp; \ln Z + \lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{1}{2!} (n \ln Z)^2 + \frac{1}{3!} (n \ln Z)^3 + \dots}{n}\\ &amp;=&amp; \ln Z. \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+0%7D+%5Cfrac%7BZ%5En+-+1%7D%7Bn%7D+%26%3D%26+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+0%7D+%5Cfrac%7B-1+%2B+e%5E%7Bn+%5Cln+Z%7D%7D%7Bn%7D%5C%5C+%26%3D%26+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+0%7D+%5Cfrac%7B-1+%2B+1+%2B+n+%5Cln+Z+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%21%7D+%28n+%5Cln+Z%29%5E2+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%21%7D+%28n+%5Cln+Z%29%5E3+%2B+%5Cdots%7D%7Bn%7D%5C%5C+%26%3D%26+%5Cln+Z+%2B+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+0%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%21%7D+%28n+%5Cln+Z%29%5E2+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%21%7D+%28n+%5Cln+Z%29%5E3+%2B+%5Cdots%7D%7Bn%7D%5C%5C+%26%3D%26+%5Cln+Z.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
But on the whole, this strikes me as a silly idea. Suppose that you have a nasty function <img alt="{f(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="{n=1,2,3,\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D1%2C2%2C3%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. How do you try to understand the behavior of <img alt="{f(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? Several ideas come to mind: </p>
<ol>
<li>
Try to see how <img alt="{f(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> grows as <img alt="{n \rightarrow \infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? <p/>
</li><li>
Try to get an approximate formula for <img alt="{f(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> grows? <p/>
</li><li>
Try to understand <img alt="{f(0)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%280%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>?
</li></ol>
<p>Wait, this is nuts. How can the value <img alt="{f(0)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%280%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> help us understand the limit of 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(1),f(2),\dots,f(1000000),\dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%281%29%2Cf%282%29%2C%5Cdots%2Cf%281000000%29%2C%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Indeed.  Another form is that </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{\partial Z^n}{\partial n} = \frac{\partial e^{n\ln Z}}{\partial n} = (\ln Z)Z^n \to \ln Z \text { as } n \to 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+Z%5En%7D%7B%5Cpartial+n%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+e%5E%7Bn%5Cln+Z%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial+n%7D+%3D+%28%5Cln+Z%29Z%5En+%5Cto+%5Cln+Z+%5Ctext+%7B+as+%7D+n+%5Cto+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
The trick here is that instead of letting <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> go to infinity they set <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to zero. This is crazy. But it is so crazy that it yields a ton of insight into the behavior for large <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. I wish I could understand this better. Perhaps it could help us with our problems like <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? </p>
<p>
Indeed, one of Parisi’s main applications is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_glass">spin glass</a> models, which are <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-relationship-between-the-Ising-model-and-spin-glasses">related</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model">Ising model</a> and likewise have associated problems that are <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-hard. This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05907">applies</a> even to a spin-glass model for which Parisi showed that exact solutions are computable.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Manabe and Hasselmann </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The prize for Manabe is well summed by the title to this Italian news <a href="https://www.greenandblue.it/2021/10/06/news/syukuro_suki_manabe_lo_scienziato_che_ha_messo_il_clima_nei_computer-321057100/?ref=drla-1">article</a>, which translates as, “The scientist who put the climate into computers.” The article’s subhead makes a point that deserves further reflection: “Without his models it would have been impossible to do experiments on the climate.” Stated positively and picking up “reliable” from the Nobel citation, the point is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Having reliable climate models has made it possible to do experiments on the climate. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Now we cannot actually <em>do</em> experiments <em>on</em> the climate—short of setting off a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter">nuclear winter</a> or erecting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere">Dyson sphere</a>, maybe. We can observe changes caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Nino">El Niño</a> events and shifts in the jet stream, for instance, and try to build the framework of a controlled experiment around them. But that’s all. </p>
<p>
So what is meant is that the models are robust enough, and have proven themselves on predictions at smaller or broader scales, that we can confidently regard computational experiments with them as indicative of real-world outcomes. The article mentions being able to tell what would happen if we made mountains disappear or shuffled the continents around. But in line with what we said in the intro, the logic sounds circular or self-confirming unless its reasonableness is explained more. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2021/10/05/nobel-prize-physics/">article</a> on the prizes stops short of saying that Manabe’s modeling of the effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a truly confirmed prediction, but it does say that his 50 years of modeling choices have had an almost 1.000 batting average.</p>
<p>
Hasselmann is hailed for supplying a different piece that promotes confidence and accounting of causality. This is to demonstrate consistent effects of short-term local weather events on longer-term global climate. To those like us not versed in the background, this might again sound circular: didn’t the global configuration cause the local event? One particular effect Hasselmann traced is of weather events on ocean currents. The chain from atmosphere to storm to ocean sub-surface is non-circular. </p>
<p>
Perhaps all this can be put as pithily as John Wheeler’s non-circular explanation of general relativity: “Matter tells space-time how to curve, and curved space-time tells matter how to move.” But until then, we feel a need to hallow a more fundamental story of how computational modeling works and why it is effective.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One day we will see a more computationally-oriented Nobel Prize, but how soon? Until then, best to all working on theory. You are Laureates in our eyes.</p>

<p><span id="more-4562"/></p>
<p>The starting point is the Cheeger inequalities on graphs.</p>

<p>Those inequalities are called Cheeger inequality because the upper bound is the discrete analog of a result of Cheeger concerning Riemann manifolds. There were previous posts about this <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/the-cheeger-inequality-in-manifolds/">here</a> and <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/proof-of-the-cheeger-inequality-in-manifolds/">here</a>, and for our current purposes it will be enough to recall that, roughly speaking, a Riemann manifold defines a space on which we can define real-valued and complex-valued functions, and such functions can be integrated and differentiated. Subsets <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of a Riemann manifold have, if they are measurable, a well defined volume, and their boundary <img alt="{\partial S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpartial+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> a well defined lower-dimensional volume; it possible to define a Cheeger constant of a manifold in a way that is syntactically analogous to the definition of edge expansion:</p>

<p>Having made this long premise, the point of this post is that the inequality</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \phi(G) \geq \frac {\lambda_2}2 \ , " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi%28G%29+%5Cgeq+%5Cfrac+%7B%5Clambda_2%7D2+%5C+%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> which is the easy direction to show in the graph case, does not hold for manifolds.</p>
<p>The easy proof for graphs is that if <img alt="{(S,V-S)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28S%2CV-S%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the cut that realizes the minimum edge expansion, we can take <img alt="{x = {\bf 1}_S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+%7B%5Cbf+1%7D_S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, or rather the projection of the above vector on the space orthogonal to <img alt="{{\bf 1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and a two-line calculation gives the inequality.</p>
<p>If, however, <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a subset of points of the manifold that realizes the Cheeger constant, we cannot define <img alt="{f(\cdot)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5Ccdot%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be the indicator of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, because the function would not be smooth and its gradient would be undefined.</p>
<p>We could think of rescuing the proof by taking a smoothed version of the indicator of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, something that goes to 1 on one side and to 0 on the other side of the cut, as a function of the distance from the boundary. The “quadratic form” of such a function, however, would depend not just on the area of the boundary of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, but also on how quickly the volume of the subset of the manifold at distance <img alt="{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from the boundary of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> grows as a function of <img alt="{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>If the Ricci curvature of the manifold is negative, this volume grows very quickly, and the quadratic form of the smoothed function is very bad. The graph analog of this would be a graph made of two expanders joined by a bridge edge, and the problem is that the analogy between graphs and manifolds breaks down because “infinitesimal distance” in the manifold corresponds to any <img alt="{o(\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> distance on the graph, and although the bridge edge is a sparse cut in the graph, it is crossed by a lot of paths of length <img alt="{o(\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, or at least this is the best intuition that I have been able to build about what breaks down here in the analogy between graphs and manifolds.</p>
<p>If the Ricci curvature of the manifold is non-negative and the dimension is bounded, there is however an inequality in manifolds that goes in the direction of the “easy graph Cheeger inequality,” and it has the form</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \lambda_2 \leq 10 \phi^2 (M) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda_2+%5Cleq+10+%5Cphi%5E2+%28M%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> This is the <em>Buser inequality</em> for manifolds of non-negative Ricci curvature, and note how strong it is: it says that <img alt="{\phi(M)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%28M%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\sqrt{\lambda_2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Clambda_2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> approximate each other up to the constant factor <img alt="{2\sqrt{10}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Csqrt%7B10%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>If the Ricci curvature <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is negative, and <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the dimension of the manifold, then one has the inequality</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \lambda_2 \leq 2 \sqrt{|R| \cdot (n-1)} \cdot \phi(M) + 10 \phi^2 (M) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda_2+%5Cleq+2+%5Csqrt%7B%7CR%7C+%5Ccdot+%28n-1%29%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%28M%29+%2B+10+%5Cphi%5E2+%28M%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Given the importance that curvature has in the study of manifolds, there has been considerable interest in defining a notion of curvature for graphs. For example curvature relates to how quickly balls around a point grow with the diameter the ball, a concept that is of great importance in graphs as well; curvature is a locally defined concept that has a global consequences, and in graph property testing one is precisely interested in understanding global properties based on local ones; and a Buser-type inequality in graphs would be very interesting because it would provide a class of graphs for which Fiedler’s algorithm provides constant-factor approximation for sparsest cut.</p>
<p>There have been multiple attempts at defining notions of curvature for graphs, the main ones being Olivier curvature and Bakry-Emery curvature. Each captures some but not all of the useful properties of Ricci curvature in manifolds. My (admittedly, poorly informed) intuition is that curvature in manifold is defined “locally” but, as we mentioned above, “local” in graphs can have multiple meanings depending on the distance scale, and it is difficult to come up with a clean and usable definition that talks about multiple distance scales.</p>
<p>Specifically to the point of the Buser inequality, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2561.pdf">Bauer et al</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00516.pdf">Klartag et al</a> prove Buser inequalities for graphs with respect to the Bakry-Emery definition. Because Cayley graphs of Abelian groups happen to have curvature 0 according to this definition, their work gives the following result:</p>

<p>(Klartag et al. state the result as above; Bauer et al. state it only for certain groups, but I think that their proof applies to all Abelian groups)</p>
<p>In particular, the above statement implies that if we have a <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-regular Abelian Cayley graph then <img alt="{\sqrt {\lambda_2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt+%7B%5Clambda_2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> provides an approximation of the sparsest cut up to a multiplicative error <img alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and that Fiedler’s algorithm is an <img alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> approximate algorithm for sparsest cut in Abelian Cayley graphs.</p>
<p>At some point in 2015 (or maybe 2014, during the Simons program on spectral graph theory?), I read the paper of Bauer at al. and wondered about a few questions. First of all, is there a way to prove the above theorem without using any notion of curvature?</p>
<p>Secondly, the theorem implies that Fiedler’s algorithm has a good approximation, but it does so in a very unusual way: we have <img alt="{\lambda_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that is a continuous relaxation of the sparsest cut problem, and we have Fiedler’s algorithm that, as analyzed by Cheeger’s inequality, provides a somewhat bad rounding, and finally the Buser inequality is telling us that the relaxation has very poor integrality gap on all Abelian Cayley graphs, and so even though the rounding seems bad it is actually good compared to the integral optimum. There should be an underlying reason for all this, meaning some other relaxation that has an actual integrality gap for sparsest cut that is at most <img alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>I mentioned these questions to Shayan Oveis Gharan, and we were able to prove that if <img alt="{ARV(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BARV%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the value of the Arora-Rao-Vazirani (or Goemans-Linial) semidefinite programming relaxation of sparsest cut, then, for all <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-regular Cayley graphs, we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \lambda_2 \leq O(d) \cdot (ARV(G))^2 \leq O(d) \cdot \phi^2 (G) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda_2+%5Cleq+O%28d%29+%5Ccdot+%28ARV%28G%29%29%5E2+%5Cleq+O%28d%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%5E2+%28G%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> which proves the above theorem and, together with the Cheeger inequality <img alt="{\lambda_2 \geq \phi^2(G)/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_2+%5Cgeq+%5Cphi%5E2%28G%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, also shows</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \phi (G) \leq O(\sqrt d) \cdot ARV(G) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi+%28G%29+%5Cleq+O%28%5Csqrt+d%29+%5Ccdot+ARV%28G%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> that is, the ARV relaxation has integrality gap at most <img alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on Abelian Cayley graphs. I will discuss the proof (which is a sort of “sum-of-squares version” of the proof of Bauer et al.) in the next post.</p></div>

Let us now sample our spread! <em>(Adding another semistreaming paper who achieved similar results to another posted paper. -Ed)</em></p>



<p id="block-db4c65bf-46c4-4c3e-ad70-d3348de84ff3"><strong>A Lower Bound on the Complexity of Testing Grained Distributions</strong> by Oded Goldreich and Dana Ron (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/129/">ECCC</a>). A discrete distribution is called \(m\)-grained if all probabilities are integer multiples of \(1/m\). This paper studies the complexity of testing this property of distributions. For simplicity, consider the property of being \(n/2\)-grained, where the support size is \(n\). The classic lower bound for testing uniformity shows that \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) samples are required to distinguish the uniform distribution from a distribution uniform on \(n/2\) elements. Thus, we get a lower bound of \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) for testing \(n/2\)-grainedness (if I am permitted to use that word). This paper proves a lower bound of \(\Omega(n^c)\), for all constant \(c &lt; 1\). It is conjectured that the lower bound is actually \(\Omega(n/\log n)\), which would match the upper bound (for any label-invariant property).</p>



<p><strong>Testing Distributions of Huge Objects</strong> by Oded Goldreich and Dana Ron (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/133/">ECCC</a>). This paper introduced a new model that marries distribution testing with property testing on strings. The “object” of interest is a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over strings of length \(n\). We wish to test if \(\mathcal{D}\) possesses some property. The tester can get a random string \(x\) from the distribution, and can query any desired index of \(x\). The distance between distributions is defined using the earthmover distance (where we use the Hamming distance between strings). This model is called the DoHO (Distributions of Huge Objects) model. There are many questions posed and connections drawn to classical property testing and distribution testing. What I find interesting is a compelling application: the distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) may represent noisy or perturbed versions of a single object. The DoHO model gives a natural generalization of standard property testing to noisy objects. This paper considers problems such as testing if \(\mathcal{D}\) is: a random perturbation of a string, or a random cyclic shift, or a random isomorphism of a graph. </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Time and Space Algorithms for Correlation Clustering via Sparse-Dense Decompositions</strong> by Sepehr Assadi and Chen Wang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14528.pdf">arXiv</a>). Correlation clustering is a classic problem where edges in a graph are labeled ‘+’ or ‘-‘, denoting whether these edges should be uncut or cut. The aim is to cluster the graph minimizing the total “disagreements” (cut ‘+’ edges or uncut ‘-‘ edges). This paper gives an \(O(1)\)-approximation algorithm that runs in \(O(n\log^2n)\) time; this is the first sublinear time approximation algorithm for this problem. Correlation clustering has seen results for the property testing/sublinear algorithms community, first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5105">Bonchi, Garcia Soriano, and Kutzkov</a>. But previous results were essentially on the dense graph model, giving \(O(\epsilon n^2)\) error assuming adjacency matrix input. This paper considers access to the adjacency list of ‘+’ edges. Interestingly (from a technical standpoint), the key tool is a new <em>sparse-dense</em> decomposition. Such decompositions emerged from the seminal work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08886">Assadi-Chen-Khanna</a> for sublinear \((\Delta+1)\)-colorings, and it is great to see applications beyond coloring.</p>



<p><strong>Sublinear-Time Computation in the Presence of Online Erasures</strong> by Iden Kalemaj, Sofya Raskhodnikova, and Nithin Varma (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08745">arXiv</a>). Can property testing be done when portions of the input are hidden? This question was first raised by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05786">Dixit-Raskhodnikova-Thakurta-Varma</a>, who gave a model of <em>erasure-resilient testing.</em> There is an adversary who hides (erases) part of the input function; queries to those parts just yield a dummy symbol. This paper defines an online version of this model. There is an erasure parameter \(t\). On each query by the property tester, the adversary can erase \(t\) values of the function. Consider the property of classic linearity of functions \(f:\{0,1\}^d \rightarrow \{0,1\}\). The BLR tester queries triples of pairs \((x,y, x \oplus y)\). Observe how this tester is easily defeated by our adversary, by erasing the value \(f(x\oplus y)\). One of the main results of this paper is a \(O(1/\varepsilon)\)-query tester for linearity, that works for any constant erasure parameter \(t\). Note that this matches the bound for the standard setting. There are a number of results for other classic properties, such as monotonicity (sortedness) and Lipschitz.</p>



<p>S<strong>ublinear Time Eigenvalue Approximation via Random Sampling</strong> by Rajarshi Bhattacharjee, Cameron Musco, and Archan Ray (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07647">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of estimating all the eigenvalues of a real, symmetric \(n \times n\) matrix \(M\) with bounded entries, in sublinear time. The main result shows that the eigenvalues of a uniform random \(O(\epsilon^{-4}\log n)\) principal submatrix can be used to approximate all eigenvalues of \(M\) up to additive error \(\epsilon n\). One can think of this as a sort of concentration inequality for eigenvalues. This result follows (and builds upon) work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06441">Bakshi-Chepurko-Jayaram</a> on property testing semidefiniteness. The key idea is that eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues have small infinity norm: intuitively, since all entries in \(M\) are bounded, such an eigenvector must have its mass spread out among many coordinates. Hence, we can get information about it by randomly sampling a few coordinates. The paper also shows that approach of taking principal submatrices requires taking \(\Omega(\epsilon^{-2})\) columns/rows.</p>



<p><strong>Deterministic Graph Coloring in the Streaming Model</strong> by Sepehr Assadi, Andrew Chen, and Glenn Sun (arXiv). This is technically not a sublinear algorithms paper<em> (well ok, streaming is sublinear, but we tend not to cover the streaming literature. Maybe we should? – Ed.)</em> But, I think that the connections are of interest to our community of readers. The main tool of sublinear \((\Delta+1)\)-coloring algorithm of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08886">Assadi-Chen-Khanna</a> is the palette sparsification lemma (\(\Delta\) is the maximum degree). This lemma shows that vertices can randomly shorten their ”palette” of colors, after which all colorings from these palettes lead to very few monochromatic edges. This is an immensely powerful tool, since one can get immediately sublinear complexity algorithms in many models: adjacency list, streaming, distributed. Is the randomness necessary? Note that these algorithms run in \(\Omega(n)\) time/space, so it is conceivable that deterministic sublinear algorithms exists. This paper shows that randomization is necessary in the semi-streaming model (space \(O(n poly(\log n))\)). Indeed, there exist no deterministic semi-streaming algorithms that can achieve even \(\exp(\Delta^{o(1)})\) colorings.</p>



<p><strong>Adversarially Robust Coloring for Graph Stream</strong> by Amit Chakrabarti, Prantar Ghosh, and Manuel Stoeckl (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11130">arXiv</a>). This paper studies the same problem as the above, but presents the results in a different way. In a randomized algorithm, we normally think of an adversary that fixes a (hard) input, and the algorithm then makes its random decisions. An adaptive adversary is one that changes the input (stream) based on the decisions of an algorithm. In this definition, a robust algorithm is one that can give correct answers, even for adversarially generated output. A deterministic algorithm is automatically robust. This paper show that there do not exist semi-streaming algorithms that can achieve \((\Delta+1)\)-colorings. The quantitative lower bound is weaker (\(\Omega(\Delta^2)\) colors), but it is against a stronger adversary.</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Every multivariate polynomial P(X) can be written as a sum of monomials, i.e. a sum of products of variables and field constants. In general, the size of such an expression is the number of monomials that have a non-zero coefficient in P.</p>
<p>What happens if we add another layer of complexity, and consider sums of products of sums (of variables and field constants) expressions? Now, it becomes unclear how to prove that a given polynomial P(X) does not have small expressions. In this result, we solve exactly this problem.</p>
<p>More precisely, we prove that certain explicit polynomials have no polynomial-sized “Sigma-Pi-Sigma” (sums of products of sums) representations. We can also show similar results for Sigma-Pi-Sigma-Pi, Sigma-Pi-Sigma-Pi-Sigma and so on for all “constant-depth” expressions.</p>

<p>Today the Italian academic community, along with lots of other people, was delighted to hear that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Parisi">Giorgio Parisi</a> is one of the three recipients of the 2021 Nobel Prize for Physics.</p>
<p>Parisi has been a giant in the area of understanding “complex” and “disordered” systems. Perhaps, his most influential contribution has been his “replica method” for the analysis of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. His ideas have led to several breakthroughs in statistical physics by Parisi and his collaborators, and they have also found applications in computer science: to tight analyses on a number of questions about combinatorial optimization on random graphs, to results on random constraint satisfaction problems (including the famous connection with random k-SAT analyzed by Mezard, Parisi and Zecchina) and random error correcting codes, and to understanding the solution landscape in optimization problems arising from machine learning. Furthermore these ideas have also led to the development and analysis of algorithms.</p>
<p>The news was particularly well received at Bocconi, where most of the faculty of the future CS department has done work that involved the replica method. (Not to be left out, even I <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05648">have recently used replica methods</a>.)</p>
<p>Mezard and Montanari have written a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/RESEARCH/book.html">book-length treatment</a> on the interplay between ideas from statistical physics, algorithms, optimization, information theory and coding theory that arise from this tradition. Readers of <em>in theory</em> looking for a shorter exposition aimed at theoretical computer scientists will enjoy these <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/08/11/replica-method-for-the-machine-learning-theorist-part-1-of-2/">notes posted by Boaz Barak</a>, or <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2018/03/14/statistical-physics-dictionary/">this even shorter post by Boaz</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I will try to give a sense to the reader of what the replica method for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model looks like when applied to the average-case analysis of optimization problems, stripped of all the physics. Of course, without the physics, nothing makes any sense, and the interested reader should look at Boaz’s posts (and to references that he provides) for an introduction to the context. I did not have time to check too carefully what I wrote, so be aware that several details could be wrong.</p>
<p>What is the typical value of the max cut in a <img alt="{G_{n,\frac 12}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_%7Bn%2C%5Cfrac+12%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> random graph with <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> vertices?</p>
<p>Working out an upper bound using union bounds and Chernoff bound, and a lower bound by thinking about a greedy algorithm, we can quickly convince ourselves that the answer is <img alt="{\frac {n^2}{4} + \Theta(n^{1.5})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac+%7Bn%5E2%7D%7B4%7D+%2B+%5CTheta%28n%5E%7B1.5%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Great, but <em>what is the constant in front of the <img alt="{n^{1.5}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B1.5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>?</em> This question is answered by the <em>Parisi formula</em>, though this fact was not rigorously established by Parisi. (Guerra proved that the formula gives an upper bound, Talagrand proved that it gives a tight bound.)</p>
<p>Some manipulations can reduce the question above to the following question: suppose that I pick a random <img alt="{n\times n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> symmetric matrix <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, say with zero diagonal, and such that (up to the symmetry requirement) the entries are mutually independent and each entry is equally likely to be <img alt="{+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or <img alt="{-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, or perhaps each entry is distributed according to a standard normal distribution (the two versions can be proved to be equivalent), what is the typical value of</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \max _{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } \ \ \frac 1{n^{1.5}} x^T M x " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmax+_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+%5C+%5C+%5Cfrac+1%7Bn%5E%7B1.5%7D%7D+x%5ET+M+x+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> up to <img alt="{o_n(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo_n%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> additive terms,?</p>
<p>As a first step, we could replace the maximum with a “soft-max,” and note that, for every choice of <img alt="{\beta&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \max _{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } \ \ x^T M x \leq \frac 1 \beta \log \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } e^{\beta x^T Mx} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmax+_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+%5C+%5C+x%5ET+M+x+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac+1+%5Cbeta+%5Clog+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+x%5ET+Mx%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> The above upper bound gets tighter and tighter for larger <img alt="{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so if we were able to estimate</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} \log \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } e^{\beta x^T Mx} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Clog+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+x%5ET+Mx%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> for every <img alt="{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (where the expectation is over the randomness of <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) then we would be in good shape.</p>
<p>We could definitely use convexity and write</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} \max _{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } \ \ x^T M x \leq \frac 1 \beta \mathop{\mathbb E} \log \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } e^{\beta x^T Mx} \leq \frac 1 \beta \log \mathop{\mathbb E} \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } e^{\beta x^T Mx} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Cmax+_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+%5C+%5C+x%5ET+M+x+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac+1+%5Cbeta+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Clog+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+x%5ET+Mx%7D+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac+1+%5Cbeta+%5Clog+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+x%5ET+Mx%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> and then use linearity of expectation and independence of the entries of <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to get to</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \leq \frac 1 \beta \log \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } \prod_{1\leq i &lt; j\leq n} \mathop{\mathbb E} e^{2\beta M_{i,j} x_i x_j } " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cleq+%5Cfrac+1+%5Cbeta+%5Clog+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+%5Cprod_%7B1%5Cleq+i+%3C+j%5Cleq+n%7D+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+e%5E%7B2%5Cbeta+M_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+x_i+x_j+%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> Now things simplify quite a bit, because for all <img alt="{i&lt;j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%3Cj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> the expression <img alt="{M_{i,j} x_i x_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+x_i+x_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, in the Rademacher setting, is equally likely to be <img alt="{+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or <img alt="{-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so that, for <img alt="{\beta = o(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta+%3D+o%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we have</p>

<p> so that</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac 1 \beta \log \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } \prod_{1\leq i &lt; j\leq n} \mathop{\mathbb E} e^{2\beta M_{i,j} x_i x_j } \leq \frac {O(n)}{\beta} + O(\beta n^2) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac+1+%5Cbeta+%5Clog+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+%5Cprod_%7B1%5Cleq+i+%3C+j%5Cleq+n%7D+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+e%5E%7B2%5Cbeta+M_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+x_i+x_j+%7D+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac+%7BO%28n%29%7D%7B%5Cbeta%7D+%2B+O%28%5Cbeta+n%5E2%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> which, choosing <img alt="{\beta = 1/\sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta+%3D+1%2F%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, gives an <img alt="{O(n^{1.5})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B1.5%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> upper bound which is in the right ballpark. Note that this is exactly the same calculations coming out of a Chernoff bound and union bound. If we optimize the choice of <img alt="{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> we unfortunately do not get the right constant in front of <img alt="{n^{1.5}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B1.5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>So, if we call</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F := \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } e^{\beta x^T Mx} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F+%3A%3D+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+x%5ET+Mx%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> we see that we lose too much if we do the step</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} \log F \leq \log \mathop{\mathbb E} F " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Clog+F+%5Cleq+%5Clog+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+F+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> But what else can we do to get rid of the logarithm and to reduce to an expression in which we take expectations of products of independent quantities (if we are not able to exploit the assumption that <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> has mutually independent entries, we will not be able to make progress)?</p>
<p>The idea is that if <img alt="{k&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a small enough quantity (something much smaller than <img alt="{1/\log F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F%5Clog+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), then <img alt="{F^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is close to 1 and we have the approximation</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \log F^k \approx F^k-1 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clog+F%5Ek+%5Capprox+F%5Ek-1+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> and we obviously have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \log F^k = k \log F " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clog+F%5Ek+%3D+k+%5Clog+F+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> so we can use the approximation</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \log F \approx \frac 1k (F^k - 1) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clog+F+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac+1k+%28F%5Ek+-+1%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> and</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} \log F \approx \frac 1k (\mathop{\mathbb E} F^k - 1) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Clog+F+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac+1k+%28%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+F%5Ek+-+1%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>

<p> Note that the above expression involves choices of <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-tuples of feasible solutions of our maximization problem. These are the “replicas” in “replica method.”</p>
<p>The above expression does not look too bad, and note how we were fully able to use the independence assumption and “simplify” the expression. Unfortunately, it is actually still very bad.

For large <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and large number of blocks, we can approximate the choice of such matrices by writing down a system of differential equations, the <em>Parisi equations</em>, and we are going to assume that such equations do indeed describe an optimal <img alt="{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and so a solution to the integral, and so they give as a computation of <img alt="{(\mathop{\mathbb E} F^k - 1)/k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+F%5Ek+-+1%29%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>After all this, we get an expression for <img alt="{(\mathop{\mathbb E} F^k - 1)/k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+F%5Ek+-+1%29%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for every sufficiently large integer <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, as a function of <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> up to lower order errors. What next? Remember how we wanted <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be a tiny real number and not a sufficiently large integer? Well, we take the expression, we forget about the error terms, and we set <img alt="{k=0\ldots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D0%5Cldots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>1. Huge congratulations to the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/summary/">winners</a> of this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syukuro_Manabe">Syukuro Manabe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Hasselmann">Klaus Hasselmann</a> for climate modelling, and separately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Parisi">Giorgio Parisi</a> for statistical physics.  While I don’t know the others, I had the great honor to get to know Parisi three years ago, when he was chair of the committee that awarded me the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3955">Tomassoni-Chisesi Prize in Physics</a>, and when I visited Parisi’s department at Sapienza University of Rome to give the prize lecture and collect the award.  I remember Parisi’s kindness, a lot of good food, and a lot of discussion of the interplay between theoretical computer science and physics.  Note that, while much of Parisi’s work is beyond my competence to comment on, in computer science he’s very well-known for applying statistical physics methods to the analysis of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0212002">survey propagation</a>—an algorithm that revolutionized the study of random 3SAT when it was introduced two decades ago.</p>

<p>2. Two weeks ago, a group at Google <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11525">put out a paper</a> with a new efficient classical algorithm to simulate the recent Gaussian BosonSampling experiments from USTC in China.  They argued that this algorithm called into question USTC’s claim of BosonSampling-based quantum supremacy.  Since then, I’ve been in contact with Sergio Boixo from Google, Chaoyang Lu from USTC, and Jelmer Renema, a Dutch BosonSampling expert and friend of the blog, to try to get to the bottom of this.  Very briefly, the situation seems to be that Google’s new algorithm outperforms the USTC experiment on one particular metric: namely, <em>total variation distance from the ideal marginal distribution, if (crucially) you look at only a subset of the optical modes</em>, <em>say 14 modes out of 144 total</em>.  Meanwhile, though, if you look at the k<sup>th</sup>-order correlations for large values of k, then the USTC experiment continues to win.  With the experiment, the correlations fall off exponentially with k but still have a meaningful, detectable signal even for (say) k=19, whereas with Google’s spoofing algorithm, you choose the k that you want to spoof (say, 2 or 3), and then the correlations become nonsense for larger k.</p>



<p>Now, given that you were only ever <em>supposed</em> to see a quantum advantage from BosonSampling if you looked at the k<sup>th</sup>-order correlations for large values of k, and given that we already knew, from the work of Leonid Gurvits, that <em>very</em> small marginals in BosonSampling experiments would be easy to reproduce on a classical computer, my inclination is to say that USTC’s claim of BosonSampling-based quantum supremacy still stands.  On the other hand, it’s true that, with BosonSampling especially, more so than with qubit-based random circuit sampling, we currently lack an adequate theoretical understanding of what the <em>target</em> should be.  That is, which numerical metric should an experiment aim to maximize, and how well does it have to score on that metric before it’s plausibly outperforming any fast classical algorithm?  One thing I feel confident about is that, whichever metric is chosen—Linear Cross-Entropy or whatever else—it needs to capture the k<sup>th</sup>-order correlations for large values of k.  No metric that’s insensitive to those correlations is good enough.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>3. Like many others, I was outraged and depressed that MIT <a href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/mit-abandons-its-mission-and-me">uninvited Dorian Abbot</a> (see also <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mit-cancels-geophysicists-lecture-after-activists-outrage-over-his-views-diversity-1635371">here</a>), a geophysicist at the University of Chicago, who was slated to give the Carlson Lecture in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences about the atmospheres of extrasolar planets.  The reason for the cancellation was that, totally unrelatedly to his scheduled lecture, Abbot had <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/diversity-problem-campus-opinion-1618419">argued in <em>Newsweek</em></a> and elsewhere that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives should aim for equality for opportunity rather than equality of outcomes, a Twitter-mob decided to go after him in retaliation, and they succeeded.  It should go without saying that it’s perfectly reasonable to <strong>disagree</strong> with Abbot’s stance, to <strong>counterargue</strong>—if those very concepts haven’t gone the way of floppy disks.  It should also go without saying that the MIT EAPS department chair is <em>free</em> to bow to social-media pressure, as he did, rather than standing on principle … just like I’m <em>free</em> to criticize him for it.  To my mind, though, cancelling a scientific talk because of the speaker’s centrist (!) political views completely, 100% validates the right’s narrative about academia, that it’s become a fanatically intolerant echo chamber.  To my fellow progressive academics, I beseech thee in the bowels of Bertrand Russell: <em>why would you commit such an unforced error?</em></p>



<p>Yes, one can <em>imagine</em> views (e.g., open Nazism) so hateful that they might justify the cancellation of unrelated scientific lectures by people who hold those views, as many physicists after WWII refused to speak to Werner Heisenberg.  But it seems obvious to me—as it would’ve been obvious to everyone else not long ago—that no matter where a reasonable person draws the line, Abbot’s views as he expressed them in <em>Newsweek</em> don’t come within a hundred miles of it.  To be more explicit still: if Abbot’s views justify deplatforming him as a planetary scientist, then <strong>all my quantum computing and theoretical computer science lectures deserve to be cancelled too</strong>, for the many attempts I’ve made on this blog over the past 16 years to share my honest thoughts and life experiences, to write like a vulnerable human being rather than like a university press office.  While I’m sure some sneerers gleefully embrace that implication, I ask everyone else to consider how deeply they believe in the idea of academic freedom at all—keeping in mind that such a commitment <em>only ever gets tested</em> when there’s a chance someone might denounce you for it.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> Princeton’s James Madison Program has <a href="https://jmp.princeton.edu/events/climate-and-potential-life-other-planets">volunteered</a> to host Abbot’s Zoom talk in place of MIT.  The talk is entitled “Climate and the Potential for Life on Other Planets.”  Like probably hundreds of others who heard about this only because of the attempted cancellation, I plan to attend!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Unrelated Bonus Update:</span></strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=934eLObPLmM">Here’s a neat YouTube video</a> put together by the ACM about me as well as David Silver of AlphaGo and AlphaZero, on the occasion of our ACM Prizes in Computing.</p></div>

    <title>How have computers changed society? Harry Lewis (with co-authors) have a book out on that.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> (Disclosure - Harry Lewis was my PhD advisor.)</p><p><br/></p><p>It seems like just a few weeks ago I I blogged about a book of Harry Lewis's that was recently available (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/08/what-are-most-important-46-papers-in.html">here</a>).  And now I am blogging about another one. Writing two books in two years seems hard! I can only think of one other computer scientist who has done that recently (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Muffin-Morsels-Problem-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B08BJ4G2Z1/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gasarch&amp;qid=1626492618&amp;sr=8-2">here</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279729/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gasarch+point&amp;qid=1626492655&amp;sr=8-2">here</a>).</p><p><br/></p><p>In 2008 Abelson, Ledeen, and Lewis wrote </p><p><i>Blown to Bits: Your Life, Liberty, and Happiness after the Digital Explosion</i></p><p>which I reviewed in SIGACT news, see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/bitsbook.pdf">here</a></p><p><br/></p><p>Both computers and society have changed since 2008. Hence an update was needed. </p><p>In 2021 Adelson, Ledeen, Lewis, and Seltzer wrote a second edition.</p><p><br/></p><p>Should you buy the new version if you bought the old version? </p><p>1) Not my problem- I got them both for free since I reviewed them. </p><p>2) Not your problem- The second edition is available free-on-line <a href="https://www.bitsbook.com/thebook/">here</a>. Is that a link to some dark corner of the dark web? No, its the formal webpage about the book. So the book is available free-on-line legally, if you care (and even if you don't care). </p><p>3) If you like paper, the book is on amazon. (If you don't like paper, the book is still on amazon). </p><p><br/></p><p>I reviewed it in SIGACT news. A non-paywalled link: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/b2bits2.pdf">here</a> (is that link legal? I have no idea.) </p><p>In this post I'll just mention two things that changed since the last book</p><p>1) Shared Music and pirating were an issue back in 2008.  It does not seem to be anymore since there is now a variety of services that seem to make pirating not worth it: itunes, streaming services, and some bands give it away for free and ask you to pay what its worth. Movies are still struggling with this issue. </p><p>2) AI systems that reinforce existing bias is a new problem.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>Generating fibbinary numbers, three ways</title>
    <summary>I just added to Wikipedia two articles on the Jordan–Pólya numbers and fibbinary numbers, two integer sequences used in my recent paper on Egyptian fractions. Jordan–Pólya numbers are the products of factorials, while the fibbinary numbers are the ones with binary representations having no two consecutive 1’s. The OEIS page on the fibbinary numbers, A003714, lists many ways of generating this sequence algorithmically, of which most are boring or slow (generate all binary numbers and test which ones belong to the sequence; you can test if a variable x is fibbinary by checking that x&amp;(x&gt;&gt;1) is zero).

Jordan–Pólya numbers are the products of factorials, while the fibbinary numbers are the ones with binary representations having no two consecutive 1’s. The OEIS page on the fibbinary numbers, <a href="https://oeis.org/A003714">A003714</a>, lists many ways of generating this sequence algorithmically, of which most are boring or slow (generate all binary numbers and test which ones belong to the sequence; you can test if a variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> is fibbinary by checking that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x&amp;(x&gt;&gt;1)</code> is zero). I thought it might be interesting to highlight two of those methods that are a little more clever and generate these numbers in small numbers of operations.</p>

<p>Some functional languages, and in part Python even though it’s mostly not functional, have a notion of a stream, a potentially infinite sequence of values generated by a coroutine. In Python, you can program these using <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">simple generators</a> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yield</code> keyword. I wrote here long ago about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2011/10/02/generating-permutations-with.html">methods for using generators recursively</a>: a generator can call itself, manipulate the resulting sequence of values, and pass them on to its output. It’s actually a very old idea, used for instance to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number">regular numbers</a> by Dijkstra <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~black/AdvancedProgramming/Lectures/Smalltalk%20II/Dijkstra%20on%20Hamming%27s%20Problem.pdf">in his 1976 book <em>A Discipline of Programming</em></a>. Reinhard Zumkeller used the same idea to generate the fibbinary numbers in Haskell, based on the observation that the sequence of positive fibbinary numbers can be generated, starting from the number 1, by two operations, doubling smaller values or replacing a smaller value \(x\) with \(4x+1\). Here is is, translated into Python:</p>

<p>It’s elegant, but has a couple of minor flaws. First, it omits the number \(0\), and while it can be modified to include \(0\), the modifications make the code messier. But second, it takes more than a constant amount of time per element to generate each sequence element. A fibbinary number \(x\) has to be generated from a sequence of smaller elements by repeated doubling and quadrupling, and that takes \(\log x\) steps per element. Even if we assume those steps to take constant time each, generating the first \(n\) elements in this way takes time \(\Theta(n\log n)\). It’s better than the \(\Theta(n^{\log_\varphi 2})\approx n^{1.44}\) that you would get from generate-and-test, but still not as good as we might hope for. One way to fix this would be to memoize the generator, so that the recursive calls look at a stored copy of the sequence generated by the outer call rather than generating the same sequence redundantly, but this again makes the code messier and also takes more storage than necessary.</p>

<p>Instead, Jörg Arndt observed that you can generate each fibbinary number directly from the previous one by a process closely resembling binary addition. Adding one to a binary number sets the first available bit from zero to one, and zeros out all the smaller bits; here, a bit is available if it is already zero. Finding the next fibbinary number does the same thing, but with a different definition of availability: a bit is available if both it and the next larger bit are zero. We can find the available bit using binary addition on a modified word that fills in bits whose neighbor is nonzero. Using this idea, we can generate the fibbinary numbers in a constant number of bitwise binary word-level operations per number. Here it is again in Python, translated from Arndt’s C++ and simplified based on <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@efroach76/107037399683569338">a comment by efroach76</a>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fibbinary</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">y</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It’s even possible to use the same idea to generate the fibbinary numbers in a constant amortized number of bit-level operations per number, although this ends up being a little less efficient in practice because high-level languages end up translating all these bit operations into word operations anyway.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fibbinary</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;=~</span> <span class="n">y</span>
            <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">|=</span> <span class="n">y</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The inner loop ends immediately at fibbinary numbers whose successor is odd (at positions given by the ones of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_word">Fibonacci word</a>), whose fraction of the total is \(1-1/\varphi\approx 0.382\), where \(\varphi\) is the golden ratio. It ends in two steps for the remaining values when their next bit is odd, in the same proportion, and so on. So the average number of steps for the inner loop adds in a geometric series to \(O(1)\).</p>
