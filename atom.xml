<p>A few hours ago <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/combinatorial_theory">the first issue of <em>Combinatorial Theory</em></a> was published. I am happy and proud to take part in this new endeavor. The editorial speaks for itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is the first issue of our new journal, </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. It is owned by mathematicians, dedicated to Diamond Open Access publishing with no fees for authors or readers, and committed to an inclusive view of the vibrant worldwide community in Combinatorics. The journal shares a similar scope with the long-running </em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A<em>(JCT A), owned by Elsevier. In 2020, almost all of the editors of JCT A resigned, deciding that it was the time to found a premier Combinatorics journal owned by mathematicians, not by a commercial publisher. Thus was born </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. That birth has allowed us to rethink how and what we publish. We are proud to have assembled a broad and diverse team of editors. We are also pleased with two new features in our editorial process: </em>doubly-anonymous refereeing<em> to mitigate implicit biases during peer review, and the inauguration of </em>Expository Article<em> submissions to encourage inclusion of valuable well-written expositions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also have warm feelings toward <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A</em> and the earlier <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory</em> (before it split to Ser A and Ser B), which was among the first journals of combinatorics, had important role for the development of our field, and which is still running under new editors.</p>

persistence modules over a finite poset. Informally, a homological invariant is
one that respects some exact structure and takes values in the free abelian
group generated by a finite set of indecomposable modules. We focus in
particular on groups generated by "spread modules", which are sometimes called
"interval modules" in the persistence theory literature. We show that both the
dimension vector and rank invariant are equivalent to homological invariants
taking values in groups generated by spread modules. We also show that that the
free abelian group generated by the "single-source" spread modules gives rise
to a new invariant which is finer than the rank invariant.

    <title>Training Multi-Layer Over-Parametrized Neural Network in Subquadratic Time</title>

networks to minimize the empirical risk induced by a loss function. In the
typical setting of over-parametrization, the network width $m$ is much larger
than the data dimension $d$ and number of training samples $n$
($m=\mathrm{poly}(n,d)$), which induces a prohibitive large weight matrix $W\in
\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ per layer. Naively, one has to pay $O(m^2)$ time to
read the weight matrix and evaluate the neural network function in both forward
and backward computation. In this work, we show how to reduce the training cost
per iteration, specifically, we propose a framework that uses $m^2$ cost only
in the initialization phase and achieves a truly subquadratic cost per
iteration in terms of $m$, i.e., $m^{2-\Omega(1)}$ per iteration.
</p>
<p>To obtain this result, we make use of various techniques, including a shifted
ReLU-based sparsifier, a lazy low rank maintenance data structure, fast
rectangular matrix multiplication, tensor-based sketching techniques and
preconditioning.

simplicial complex of the same homotopy type. This algorithm, although
well-known in the literature, requires some work to make it computationally
tractable. We pay close attention to weak simplicial approximation, which we
implement for generalized barycentric and edgewise subdivisions. We also
propose a new subdivision process, based on Delaunay complexes. In order to
facilitate the computation of a simplicial approximation, we introduce a
simplification step, based on edge contractions. We define a new version of
simplicial mapping cone, which requires less simplices. Last, we illustrate the
algorithm with the real projective spaces, the 3-dimensional lens spaces and
the Grassmannian of 2-planes in $\mathbb{R}^4$.

recently, with problems such as matching size estimation, component counting,
and the evaluation of bounded degree constant query testable properties shown
to admit surprisingly space efficient algorithms.
</p>
<p>The main result of this paper is a space efficient single pass random order
streaming algorithm for simulating nearly independent random walks that start
at uniformly random vertices. We show that the distribution of $k$-step walks
from $b$ vertices chosen uniformly at random can be approximated up to error
$\varepsilon$ per walk using $(1/\varepsilon)^{O(k)} 2^{O(k^2)}\cdot b$ words
of space with a single pass over a randomly ordered stream of edges, solving an
open problem of Peng and Sohler [SODA `18]. Applications of our result include
the estimation of the average return probability of the $k$-step walk (the
trace of the $k^\text{th}$ power of the random walk matrix) as well as the
estimation of PageRank. We complement our algorithm with a strong impossibility
result for directed graphs.

to the other by changing one vertex at a time so that all the intermediate
paths are also shortest paths. This problem has several natural applications,
namely: (a) revamping road networks, (b) rerouting data packets in synchronous
multiprocessing setting, (c) the shipping container stowage problem, and (d)
the train marshalling problem.
</p>
<p>When modelled as graph problems, (a) is the most general case while (b), (c)
and (d) are restrictions to different graph classes. We show that (a) is
intractable, even for relaxed variants of the problem. For (b), (c) and (d), we
present efficient algorithms to solve the respective problems. We also
generalize the problem to when at most $k$ (for a fixed integer $k\geq 2$)
contiguous vertices on a shortest path can be changed at a time.

science. We study the fully dynamic setting in which we want to maintain good
clusters efficiently when input points (from a metric space) can be inserted
and deleted. Many clustering problems are $\mathsf{APX}$-hard but admit
polynomial time $O(1)$-approximation algorithms. Thus, it is a natural question
whether we can maintain $O(1)$-approximate solutions for them in subpolynomial
update time, against adaptive and oblivious adversaries. Only a few results are
known that give partial answers to this question. There are dynamic algorithms
for $k$-center, $k$-means, and $k$-median that maintain constant factor
approximations in expected $\tilde{O}(k^{2})$ update time against an oblivious
adversary. However, for these problems there are no algorithms known with an
update time that is subpolynomial in $k$, and against an adaptive adversary
there are even no (non-trivial) dynamic algorithms known at all.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we complete the picture of the question above for all these
clustering problems. 1. We show that there is no fully dynamic
$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for any of the classic clustering problems above
with an update time in $n^{o(1)}h(k)$ against an adaptive adversary, for an
arbitrary function $h$. 2. We give a lower bound of $\Omega(k)$ on the update
time for each of the above problems, even against an oblivious adversary. 3. We
give the first $O(1)$-approximate fully dynamic algorithms for $k$-sum-of-radii
and for $k$-sum-of-diameters with expected update time of $\tilde{O}(k^{O(1)})$
against an oblivious adversary. 4. Finally, for $k$-center we present a fully
dynamic $(6+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with an expected update time of
$\tilde{O}(k)$ against an oblivious adversary.

computationally difficult problem. Elbassioni has proposed an algorithm based
on reverse search with a delay of $O(k\cdot
min\{(n-k),k\Delta\}\cdot(k(\Delta+\log{k})+\log{n}))$, where $n$ is the number
of vertices and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of input graph \cite{6}. In this
short note, we present an algorithm with an improved delay of $O(k\cdot
min\{(n-k),k\Delta\}\cdot(k\log{\Delta}+\log{n}))$ by introducing a new
neighborhood definition. This also improves upon the current best delay bound
$O(k^2\Delta)$\cite{4} for this problem for large $k$.

computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for
enumerating all connected induced subgraphs of a given order from connected
undirected graphs. The first algorithm is a variant of a previous well-known
algorithm. The algorithm enumerates all connected induced subgraphs of order
$k$ in a bottom-up manner. The data structures that leads to unit time element
checking and linear space are presented. Different from previous algorithms
that either work in a bottom-up manner or in a reverse search manner, an
algorithm that enumerates all connected induced subgraphs of order $k$ in a
top-down manner by recursively deleting vertices is proposed. The data
structures used in the implementation are also presented. The correctness and
complexity of the top-down algorithm is analysed and proven. Experimental
result show that the variant bottom-up algorithm outperforms the other
algorithms for enumerating connected induced subgraphs of small order, and the
top-down algorithm is fastest among the state-of-the-art algorithms for
enumerating connected induced subgraphs of large order.

$uv$-path of length at most $t$ for every $uv\in E$. It is known that every
$n$-vertex graph admits a $(2k-1)$-spanner with $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges for $k\geq
1$. This bound is the best possible for $1\leq k\leq 9$ and is conjectured to
be optimal due to Erd\H{o}s' girth conjecture.
</p>
<p>We study $t$-spanners for $t\in \{2,3\}$ for geometric intersection graphs in
the plane. These spanners are also known as \emph{$t$-hop spanners} to
emphasize the use of graph-theoretic distances (as opposed to Euclidean
distances between the geometric objects or their centers). We obtain the
following results: (1) Every $n$-vertex unit disk graph (UDG) admits a 2-hop
spanner with $O(n)$ edges; improving upon the previous bound of $O(n\log n)$.
(2) The intersection graph of $n$ axis-aligned fat rectangles admits a 2-hop
spanner with $O(n\log n)$ edges, and this bound is the best possible. (3) The
intersection graph of $n$ fat convex bodies in the plane admits a 3-hop spanner
with $O(n\log n)$ edges. (4) The intersection graph of $n$ axis-aligned
rectangles admits a 3-hop spanner with $O(n\log^2 n)$ edges.

keeping some vertices unmatched. We study three related online matching
problems with the constraint of matching every vertex, i.e., with no
rejections. We adopt a model in which vertices arrive in uniformly random order
and the non-negative edge-weights are arbitrary. For the capacitated online
bipartite matching problem, in which the vertices of one side of the graph are
offline and those of the other side arrive online, we give a 4.62-competitive
algorithm when the capacity of each offline vertex is 2. For the online general
(non-bipartite) matching problem, where all vertices arrive online, we give a
3.34-competitive algorithm. We also study the online roommate matching problem
(Huzhang et al. 2017), in which each room (offline vertex) holds 2 persons
(online vertices). Persons derive non-negative additive utilities from their
room as well as roommate. In this model, with the goal of maximizing the social
welfare, we give a 7.96-competitive algorithm. This is an improvement over the
24.72 approximation factor in (Huzhang et al. 2017).

Q. Locke III <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07065">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The strength of gnomes lies in their coordinated action. Being small and
subtle creatures themselves, the forest gnomes can form large swarms acting as
one giant creature. This unusual defense strategy required a lot of skill and
training as directing a swarm is not an easy task! Initially, gnomes used
leader-based control algorithms, although those have proven to be vulnerable to
abuse and failure.
</p>
<p>After thorough research and study, gnomes developed their own leaderless
consensus algorithm based on very simple rules. It is based on local broadcast
(gossip) in an open network of a known radius $r$. One of the gnomes proposes a
plan which then spreads gnome to gnome. If there is agreement, all gnomes act
\emph{all at once}. If there are conflicting plans (an extreme rarity), they
try again. The resulting swarm reaction time is exactly the swarm round-trip
time $2rt$, where $t$ is the command relay time. The algorithm is
non-Byzantine; all gnomes must be sane and sober.

arbitrary metric space that maintains an optimal $2+\epsilon$ approximation in
$O(k \cdot \operatorname{polylog}(n,\Delta))$ amortized update time. Here, $n$
is an upper bound on the number of active points at any time, and $\Delta$ is
the aspect ratio of the data. Previously, the best known amortized update time
was $O(k^2\cdot \operatorname{polylog}(n,\Delta))$, and is due to Chan,
Gourqin, and Sozio. We demonstrate that the runtime of our algorithm is optimal
up to $\operatorname{polylog}(n,\Delta)$ factors, even for insertion-only
streams, which closes the complexity of fully dynamic $k$-centers clustering.
In particular, we prove that any algorithm for $k$-clustering tasks in
arbitrary metric spaces, including $k$-means, $k$-medians, and $k$-centers,
must make at least $\Omega(n k)$ distance queries to achieve any non-trivial
approximation factor.
</p>
<p>Despite the lower bound for arbitrary metrics, we demonstrate that an update
time sublinear in $k$ is possible for metric spaces which admit locally
sensitive hash functions (LSH). Namely, we demonstrate a black-box
transformation which takes a locally sensitive hash family for a metric space
and produces a faster fully dynamic $k$-centers algorithm for that space. In
particular, for a large class of metrics including Euclidean space, $\ell_p$
spaces, the Hamming Metric, and the Jaccard Metric, for any $c &gt; 1$, our
results yield a $c(4+\epsilon)$ approximate $k$-centers solution in $O(n^{1/c}
\cdot \operatorname{polylog}(n,\Delta))$ amortized update time, simultaneously
for all $k \geq 1$. Previously, the only known comparable result was a $O(c
\log n)$ approximation for Euclidean space due to Schmidt and Sohler, running
in the same amortized update time.

Villa Real <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07018">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>This paper investigates scheduling policies for file retrieval in linear
storage devices, such as magnetic tapes. Tapes are the technology of choice for
long-term storage in data centers due to their low cost per capacity,
reliability, and data security. While scheduling problems associated with data
retrieval in tapes are classical, existing works focus on more straightforward
heuristic approaches due to limited computational times imposed by standard
tape specifications. Our first contribution is a theoretical investigation of
three standard policies, presenting their worst-case performance and special
cases of practical relevance for which they are optimal. Next, we show that the
problem is polynomially solvable via two interleaved recursive models, albeit
with high computational complexity. We leverage our previous results to develop
two new scheduling policies with constant-ratio performance and low
computational cost. Finally, we investigate properties associated with the
online variant of the problem, presenting a new constant-factor competitive
algorithm. Our numerical analysis on synthetic and real-world tapes from an
industry partner provides insights into dataset configurations where each
policy is more effective, which is of relevance to data center managers. In
particular, our new best-performing policy is practical for large datasets and
significantly improves upon standard algorithms in the area.

through feedforward neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU)
activation. Recent literature has explored the use of a single neural network
to model either uncertain or complex elements within an objective function.
However, it is well known that ensembles of neural networks produce more stable
predictions and have better generalizability than models with single neural
networks, which suggests the application of ensembles of neural networks in a
decision-making pipeline. We study how to incorporate a neural network ensemble
as the objective function of an optimization model and explore computational
approaches for the ensuing problem. We present a mixed-integer linear program
based on existing popular big-$M$ formulations for optimizing over a single
neural network. We develop two acceleration techniques for our model, the first
one is a preprocessing procedure to tighten bounds for critical neurons in the
neural network while the second one is a set of valid inequalities based on
Benders decomposition. Experimental evaluations of our solution methods are
conducted on one global optimization problem and two real-world data sets; the
results suggest that our optimization algorithm outperforms the adaption of an
state-of-the-art approach in terms of computational time and optimality gaps.

    <title>Factorization and pseudofactorization of weighted graphs</title>

decompositions of $G$ into Cartesian products of smaller graphs. When $G$ is
isomorphic to a Cartesian graph product, we call the factors of this product a
factorization of $G$. When $G$ is isomorphic to an isometric subgraph of a
Cartesian graph product, we call those factors a pseudofactorization of $G$.
Prior work has shown that an unweighted graph's pseudofactorization can be used
to generate a canonical isometric embedding into a product of the smallest
possible pseudofactors. However, for arbitrary weighted graphs, which represent
a richer variety of metric spaces, methods for finding isometric embeddings or
determining their existence remain elusive, and indeed pseudofactorization and
factorization have not previously been extended to this context. In this work,
we address the problem of finding the factorization and pseudofactorization of
a weighted graph $G$, where $G$ satisfies the property that every edge
constitutes a shortest path between its endpoints. We term such graphs minimal
graphs, noting that every graph can be made minimal by removing edges not
affecting its path metric. We generalize pseudofactorization and factorization
to minimal graphs and develop new proof techniques that extend the previously
proposed algorithms due to Graham and Winkler [Graham and Winkler, '85] and
Feder [Feder, '92] for pseudofactorization and factorization of unweighted
graphs. We show that any $m$-edge, $n$-vertex graph with positive integer edge
weights can be factored in $O(m^2)$ time, plus the time to find all pairs
shortest paths (APSP) distances in a weighted graph, resulting in an overall
running time of $O(m^2+n^2\log\log n)$ time. We also show that a
pseudofactorization for such a graph can be computed in $O(mn)$ time, plus the
time to solve APSP, resulting in an $O(mn+n^2\log\log n)$ running time.

    <title>Flow Metrics on Graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1639526400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Lior Kalman, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Krauthgamer:Robert.html">Robert Krauthgamer</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06916">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given a graph with non-negative edge weights, there are various ways to
interpret the edge weights and induce a metric on the vertices of the graph. A
few examples are shortest-path, when interpreting the weights as lengths;
resistance distance, when thinking of the graph as an electrical network and
the weights are resistances; and the inverse of minimum $st$-cut, when thinking
of the weights as capacities.
</p>
<p>It is known that the 3 above-mentioned metrics can all be derived from flows,
when formalizing them as convex optimization problems. This key observation led
us to studying a family of metrics that are derived from flows, which we call
flow metrics, that gives a natural interpolation between the above metrics
using a parameter $p$.
</p>
<p>We make the first steps in studying the flow metrics, and mainly focus on two
aspects: (a) understanding basic properties of the flow metrics, either as an
optimization problem (e.g. finding relations between the flow problem and the
dual potential problem) and as a metric function (e.g. understanding their
structure and geometry); and (b) considering methods for reducing the size of
graphs, either by removing vertices or edges while approximating the flow
metrics, and thus attaining a smaller instance that can be used to accelerate
running time of algorithms and reduce their storage requirements.
</p>
<p>Our main result is a lower bound for the number of edges required for a
resistance sparsifier in the worst case. Furthermore, we present a method for
reducing the number of edges in a graph while approximating the flow metrics,
by utilizing a method of [Cohen and Peng, 2015] for reducing the size of
matrices. In addition, we show that the flow metrics satisfy a stronger version
of the triangle inequality, which gives some information about their structure
and geometry.

    <title>Near-Optimal Distributed Degree+1 Colouring</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If you are interested in graph colouring, and specifically in distributed algorithms for that classic problem, I strongly recommend the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00604" target="_blank">recent paper</a> posted by Magnús M. Halldórsson, Fabian Kuhn, Alexandre Nolin and Tigran Tonoyan. (For the record, three of the authors work, or have worked, in my department at Reykjavik University, so I am biased.) </p><p>The above-mentioned paper addresses the problem of finding a proper colouring of a graph when each node <i>v</i> has a palette of degree(<i>v</i>)+1 colours at its disposal. The paper resolves an open problem in distributed colouring and simplifies known results in doing so. As a byproduct of their results, the authors obtain improved streaming and sub-linear time algorithms.   See the paper for much more information on the context for this result and the technical details. </p><p>Congratulations to the authors!</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m on the ICALP 2022 program committee (PC) and was apparently the first to complain when I saw the draft call for papers, and I asked that the requirement that <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=17">submissions must be in LIPIcs style</a> be put to a vote.  Despite substantial support among the PC for not requiring the majority of authors to squander their time formatting in an exotic style submissions that will be rejected, the Supreme Court blocked the vote.  Their main rationale seems to be ensuring correspondence between submissions and proceedings.  Ironically, at the same time other conferences are allowing authors to publish in proceedings an <em>abridged </em>version of the (accepted) submission, to make it easier to publish the paper in a journal (which may not want to have a full version already in a conference).  We are at the nadir in history where human effort is systematically wasted to produce versions that do not even pretend to be useful for readers — only to check boxes.</p>



<p>When I was at the IAS and was briefed about logistics, I was stunned when they asked me if I type my own papers, or if I needed help with that.  I guess the next level will be if you need help with formatting your submissions.</p>



<p>Picture a 100-year old retired scientist who followed the field for 75 years, and who wants to make one more contribution.  Even though they are no match for the raw power of a 15-year old, their ability to draw connections almost makes up for it, and their perspective is invaluable to the community.  This scientist, whose equipment consists of a desktop from two human generations ago, miraculously held together and kept working through sheer love and intimate knowledge, is now being asked to format their paper in LIPIcs style… or to ask someone else to do it for them (talk about fostering collaboration).</p>



<p>Here’s a non-exclusive list of true, terrible things about conferences, most of which were discussed earlier on this blog (see tag <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia-tcs/">utopia-tcs</a>):</p>



<ol><li>Requiring submissions in proceedings format.</li><li>Pre-registering papers by a deadline different than the submission deadline.</li><li>Requiring authors to submit a separate 2-page summary of the paper.</li><li>Ultra-strict page limits, summary rejection for any deviation.</li><li>Suddenly being forced on a short notice to submit a dummy .pdf so that PC assignments can be made.</li><li>Extending the list of topics two days before the deadline.</li><li>Moving deadlines.</li><li>Forcing authors to check multiple times the call for papers and/or constantly monitor email for any of these last-minute changes.</li><li>In the lucky case of acceptance, following up with a barrage of emails involving minutiae such as underfull \hbox.</li><li>Writing “this only takes 60 seconds.”  For me (and, apparently, many others — otherwise why delay answering emails that take 10 seconds to answer?) attending to <em>any</em> task, following <em>any</em> instruction, even “blink” or “say yes” has a huge fix cost, maybe 30 minutes.  So I translate 60 seconds to 31 minutes.</li><li>Hosting the conference in places which are inconvenient, for the attendees and planet earth.</li><li>Hosting the conference at times which are inconvenient for the attendees.</li><li>Requiring in-person PC meetings whose outcome does not justify the costs.</li></ol>



<p>As usual, people in a position of power do not have much incentive to fight to change the very practices that put them in that position in the first place.  But even this cynical remark doesn’t tell the whole story, since the practices got <em>worse</em> with time, unlike the case of journals.  One impression I have is that people have gotten so used to buggy software, constant updates, and general techno slavery that they just accept all of this as another inevitable misery in life… and by far not the worst!  This last point is important, as I think a seeping philosophy that permeates much of the discussion and the decisions is that much more important things are at stake, so who cares about this?  If you really want to spend cycles fixing something, then what about X?  (It’s fun to think where you end up if you stretch this point.)  But another life is possible.</p>



<p>One day, I will throw in my two cents and launch a new journal.  Besides being electronic and free (like ToC) it will have the following features.</p>



<ol><li>Papers, if accepted, will appear in the authors’ chosen format.  No conversion, and no additional effort, will be required for publication.  All the effort will be exclusively directed at improving the content of the paper.</li><li>Submissions can be by pdf attachment or by overlay, but not only to arxiv: to *any* repository.  In particular, authors will not be required to get their paper to compile on the arxiv.</li><li>The identities of the reviewers will be made public (in case of acceptance).  This I am still debating, but so far I am leaning towards it.  The problem that this is trying to address is that while you get reputation points for being on a program committee or on an editorial board, you don’t get many for being an unknown journal referee who is actually supposedly doing the hard work or finally really checking the proofs.  Instead with public identities people can show off the hard work and their role in the community, as happens on more recent platforms like say stackexchange.</li><li>Authors will be free to submit anonymously, or not.  This choice will be made by the authors, not dictated by a committee.</li><li>And perhaps the most consequential thing that I am still debating, should all submissions be public? (Maybe not.)</li></ol>



<p/>



<p>To finish on a high note, a great thing about conferences is the fast turn-around.  It is really depressing — in other fields — to have to wait so long for any quantifiable feedback on your work, and this is definitely something which I liked about the TCS community.  But, to come back to the mood of the post, this good aspect (and others) of conferences can probably be kept while rethinking the not so good.  (For example, there could be a journal with deadlines similar to conferences, which is also what happens for grant proposals etc.)</p>

    <title>TR21-179 |  Smoothed Complexity of Learning Disjunctive Normal Forms, Inverting Fourier Transforms, and Verifying Small Circuits | 

	tatsuie tsukiji</title>
    <summary>This paper aims to derandomize the following problems in the smoothed analysis of Spielman and Teng. Learn Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), invert Fourier Transforms (FT), and verify small circuits' unsatisfiability. Learning algorithms must predict a future observation from the only $m$ i.i.d. samples of a fixed but unknown joint-distribution $P(G(x),y)$ to explain an $\eta$-noisy target. Inverters must retrieve the hidden parameter $\theta$. The smoothed analysis can weaken the adversarial distribution $P(x,y)$ by injecting an appropriate perturbation $G$ with larger min-entropy $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G)$.  We will establish 1--10 for planted functions (Goldreich's PRG) $f_\theta(x) = f(\theta \circ x_1,\ldots,\theta \circ x_d)$ with variables $x_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,2n-1\}$ plugged into $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor)\oplus x_i$ in 1--4, $\theta\circ x_i := \theta_i \cdot \lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor \cdot (-1)^{x_i}\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 5--6, and $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor) \cdot (-1)^{x_i} \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 7. 8--10 will verify the unsatisfiability of small circuits in the worst case analysis (i.e., $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$). Suppose $\log n \gg \log (ds/\varepsilon) + k$ in 1--4. Randomly pick an example $(X,Y)$ from the observed $m$ data in 4.

1. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$, $\mathrm{Max}k\mathrm{CSP}$ of any $k$-variate predicate $f$ requires the sample size $\Omega(n^{(k-\epsilon)/2}) \le m \le \tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ to distinguish between $|\max_\theta P(y=f_\theta(x)) - \max_\theta P'(y=f_\theta(x))| \ge \Omega(1)$ and $P(x,y) \equiv P'(x,y)$ in $n^{O(k)}$ time by given access to both samplers $P(x,y)$ and $P'(x,y)$.
2. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log s$, the planted $s$-term DNF demands $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log s)}$ for $c$ less than 1, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log s + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than 1, to make $n^{O(\log s)}$-time PAC learning (even under a slight noise).
3. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log 1/\varepsilon$, the $\mathrm{planted}$ $\mathrm{AND}$ needs $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$ for $c$ less than $1$, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log(1/\varepsilon) + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than $1$, to make $(\eta+\varepsilon)$-accurate agnostic learning in $n^{O(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$-time.
4. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(\log s)$, the $\mathrm{monotone}$ $\mathrm{DNF}$ with expanding $s$-terms is PAC learnable from $m = n\cdot \mathrm{poly}(s)$ data with $\mathrm{Pr}[\lfloor{{X_{i}/2}}\rfloor, \lfloor{{X_{i'}/2}}\rfloor] \ge {1}/{n^{1+\epsilon}}$  in $n \cdot \tilde{O}(s^{\log d})$ time.
5. LPN and LWE over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p\ge n^{\Omega(1)}$ hiding small secrets $\forall i, |\theta_i| = O(1)$ are breakable in polynomial time. 
6. GapSVP$_{\tilde{O}(n^2)}$ is breakable within polynomial time.
7. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(n)$, any $2^{n/2}$ by $2^{n/2}$ matrix with sparsity $2^{n-n^{\epsilon}}$ demands $\exp(n^{\Omega(1)})$ size $\mathrm{PH^{cc}}$ protocol unless it is learnable from $m = \exp(n^{\epsilon})$ data in $\exp(n^{\epsilon})$ time.
8. $\mathrm{VP} \ne \mathrm{VNP}$ or $\forall k, \mathrm{quasi}$-$NP \not\subset \mathrm{NC}^k$.
9. $\mathrm{PIT} \in \mathrm{DTIME}[n^{\mathrm{poly}(\log \log n)}]$ or $\forall \epsilon, \forall k, \mathrm{NTIME}[2^{n^{\epsilon}}] \not\subset \mathrm{SIZE}[n^k]$.
10. $\mathrm{quasi}$-$\mathrm{NP} \not\subset \mathrm{TC}^0$.</summary>

    <title>Did Lane Hemaspaandra invent the Fib numbers?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> (I abbreviate Fibonacci by Fib throughout. Lane Hemaspaandra helped me with this post.) </p><p>We all learned that Fib invented or discovered the Fib Numbers:</p><p>f_0=1,</p><p>f_1=1, and</p><p>for all n\ge 2, f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}.</p><p>We may have learned that they come up in nature (NOT true, see <a href="https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/fibonacc.htm">here</a>) or that they were important in mathematics (questionable--see this blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/01/how-important-are-fib-numbers-in-math.html">here</a> which says no, but some comments give good counterarguments). You also learned that Fibonacci was the mathematician who first studied them. Also not true!  This one surprised me. </p><p>1) I came across this blog post: <a href="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2021/11/16/why-names-matter/">here</a> that says they were invented by Hemachandra first. Wow--I then recalled that Lane Hemaspaandra's birth surname  was Lane Hemachandra (he married Edith Spaan and they are now both Hemaspaandra). So naturally I emailed him to ask how a 20th-century person could invent something earlier than 1170. He told me a picture of him in the basement ages while he stays young. </p><p>2) It would be nice to say OH, let's call them Hemachandra numbers (would that be  easier than convincing the world to use tau instead of pi,? See <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">The Tau Manifesto</a>) and let students know that there were people other than Europeans who did math back then. But even that story is not as simple as it seems. Lane emailed me this article: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/fibfibs.pdf">here</a> that tells the whole muddled story. (In what follows I leave out the accents.)</p><p>Virahanka seems to be the formulator of the Fib recurrence, though not quite the numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry.  He did this between 600 and 800 AD.</p><p>Gopala, in work prior to 1135, was aware of Virhanka's work. In particular he know about the inductive rule. But he also set the initial values and generated numbers, so he was the first to have the sequence we now call the Fib numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry. </p><p>Hemachandra in 1150 also formulated them, independently.  His motivation was Sanskrit poetry.</p><p>(I will learn some Sanskrit poetry the next time I teach Discrete Math so I can give the students an application of the material!)</p><p>So does Virhanka win? Hardly:</p><p>Acarya Pingala's writings from the 5th or 6th century BC (YES- BC!) indicate that he knew about the Fib numbers in the context of (you guessed it!) Sanskrit poetry. </p><p>3) I would support changing the name of the Fib Numbers to the Pingala numbers. This is both good and bad news for Lane:</p><p>a) Bad news in that he does not get a sequence of number that shares his pre-marriage name.</p><p>b) Good news in that if I settled on Hemachandra numbers then Lane and Edith would have to decide if 0 or 1 or 2 of them want to change their name to Hemachandra. I would guess not--too complicated. Plus one name change in a life is enough. </p><p>4) The story (especially  the articles I pointed to) shows just how complicated history can get. Even a straightforward question like:</p><p><i>Who first formulated the Fib Numbers?</i></p><p>might not have a well-defined answer. Perhaps this is  the wrong question since if people formulate the concept independent of each other, they should all get some credit.  Even if the authors are 1000 years apart. </p><p><i>Side note</i>: Independent Discovery may be harder to assert now since, with the web,  Alice could have seen Bob's paper so it may be hard to call Alice's discovery independent. As I have mentioned before on this blog, my students have a hard time with the notion of Cook and Levin coming up with NP-completeness independently  since  surely one would have posted it and the other would have seen it. An era before posting was possible! Unimaginable to them. Sometimes even to me. </p></div>

    <title>TR21-177 |  Johnson Coverage Hypothesis: Inapproximability of k-means and k-median in $\ell_p$-metrics | 

	Vincent Cohen-Addad, 

	Karthik  C. S., 

	Euiwoong Lee</title>
    <summary>k-median and k-means are the two most popular objectives for clustering algorithms. Despite intensive effort, a good understanding of the approximability of these objectives, particularly in $\ell_p$-metrics, remains a major open problem. In this paper, we significantly improve upon the hardness of approximation factors known in literature for these objectives in $\ell_p$-metrics. 
 
We introduce a new hypothesis called the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis (JCH), which roughly asserts that the well-studied k-max coverage problem on set systems is hard to approximate to a factor greater than $1-\frac{1}{e}$, even when the membership graph of the set system is a subgraph of the Johnson graph. We then show that together with generalizations of the embedding techniques introduced by Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19), JCH implies hardness of approximation results for k-median and k-means in $\ell_p$-metrics for factors which are close to the ones obtained for general metrics. In particular, assuming JCH we show that it is hard to approximate the k-means objective:

$\bullet$ Discrete case: To a factor of 3.94 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.73 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.56 and 1.17 respectively, obtained under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).

$\bullet$ Continuous case: To a factor of 2.10 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.36 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.07 in the $\ell_2$-metric obtained under UGC (and to the best of our knowledge, the continuous case of k-means in $\ell_1$-metric was not previously analyzed in literature).
 
We also obtain similar improvements under JCH for the k-median objective. Additionally, we prove a weak version of JCH using the work of Dinur et al. (SICOMP'05) on Hypergraph Vertex Cover, and recover all the results stated above of Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19) to (nearly) the same inapproximability factors but now under the standard NP$\neq$P assumption (instead of UGC).

Finally, we establish a strong connection between JCH and the long standing open problem of determining the Hypergraph Turan number. We then use this connection to prove improved SDP gaps (over the existing factors in literature) for k-means and k-median objectives.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Gerhard Ringel considered in 1959 the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider a finite family of circles such that every point in the plane is included in at most two circles. What is the minimum number of colors needed to color the circles so that tangent circles are colored with different colors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ringel 1959 circle problem</strong> is the question if this minimum number of colors is bounded.</p>
<p>I mentioned the problem in a post about <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/04/13/coloring-problems-for-arrangements-of-circles-and-pseudocircles/">eight coloring problems for arrangements of circles and pseudocircles</a>, three years ago. (For another recently solved conjecture by Ringel see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/01/27/ringel-conjecture-solved-congratulations-to-richard-montgomery-alexey-pokrovskiy-and-benny-sudakov/">this post</a>.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05042">recent arXiv paper</a> James Davies, Chaya Keller, Linda Kleist, Shakhar Smorodinsky, and Bartosz Walczak solved the problem and showed that any finite number of colors does not suffices. In fact the proved considerably more. The paper is</p>
<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05042">A solution to Ringel circle problem,</a></h3>
<p>and here is the abstract</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We construct families of circles in the plane such that their tangency graphs have arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number. This provides a strong negative answer to Ringel’s circle problem (1959). The proof relies on a (multidimensional) version of Gallai’s theorem with polynomial constraints, which we derive from the Hales-Jewett theorem and which may be of independent interest.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the authors.</p>
