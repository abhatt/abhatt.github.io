deterministic (here called {\it confluent}) tile self-assembly systems (1-TAS)
and prove the standing conjecture that such systems do not have universal
computational power. We call a TAS whose maximal assemblies contain at least
one ultimately periodic assembly path {\it para-periodic}. We observe that a
confluent 1-TAS has at most one maximal producible assembly, $\alpha_{max}$,
that can be considered a union of path assemblies, and we show that such a
system is always para-periodic. This result is obtained through a superposition
and a combination of two paths that produce a new path with desired properties,
a technique that we call \emph{co-grow} of two paths. Moreover we provide a
characterization of an $\alpha_{max}$ of a confluent 1-TAS as one of two
possible cases, so called, a grid or a disjoint union of combs. To a given
$\alpha_{max}$ we can associate a finite labeled graph, called \emph{quipu},
such that the union of all labels of paths in the quipu equals $\alpha_{max}$,
therefore giving a finite description for $\alpha_{max}$. This finite
description implies that $\alpha_{max}$ is a union of semi-affine subsets of
$\mathbb{Z}^2$ and since such a finite description can be algorithmicly
generated from any 1-TAS, 1-TAS cannot have universal computational power.

simple folds (folding along one line at a time) under the infinite all-layers
model introduced by [Akitaya et al., 2017], in which each simple fold is
defined by an infinite line and must fold all layers of paper that intersect
this line. This model is motivated by folding in manufacturing such as
sheet-metal bending. We improve on [Arkin et al., 2004] by giving a
deterministic $O(n)$-time algorithm to decide simple foldability of 1D crease
patterns in the all-layers model. Then we extend this 1D result to 2D, showing
that simple foldability in this model can be decided in linear time for
unassigned axis-aligned orthogonal crease patterns on axis-aligned 2D
orthogonal paper. On the other hand, we show that simple foldability is
strongly NP-complete if a subset of the creases have a mountain-valley
assignment, even for an axis-aligned rectangle of paper.

high-dimensional nearest neighbor search problem (NNS) are based on space
partitions of the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^d$. Inspired by recent theoretical
work on NNS for general metric spaces [Andoni, Naor, Nikolov, Razenshteyn,
Waingarten STOC 2018, FOCS 2018], we develop a new framework for constructing
such partitions that reduces the problem to balanced graph partitioning
followed by supervised classification. We instantiate this general approach
with the KaHIP graph partitioner [Sanders, Schulz SEA 2013] and neural
networks, respectively, to obtain a new partitioning procedure called Neural
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Neural LSH). On several standard benchmarks for
NNS, our experiments show that the partitions found by Neural LSH consistently
outperform partitions found by quantization- and tree-based methods.

metamer mismatch volumes. Unlike prior art techniques, our methods do not make
any assumptions on the shape of spectra on the boundary of the mismatch
volumes. Both methods utilize a spherical sampling approach, but they calculate
mismatch volumes in two different ways. The first method uses a linear
programming optimization, while the second is a computational geometry approach
based on half-space intersection. We show that under certain conditions the
theoretically maximal metamer mismatch volume is significantly larger than the
one approximated using a prior art method.

non-uniform cellular automata (CAs). The cells of non-uniform CAs, we have
considered here, can use different Wolfram's rules to generate their next
states. We report an algorithm which decides whether or not a configuration of
a given (non-uniform) cellular automaton is reachable from another
configuration. A characterization tool, named Reachability tree, is used to
develop theories and the decision algorithm for the CREP. Though the worst case
complexity of the algorithm is exponential in time and space, but the average
performance is very good.

demonstrate in theory and practice that the proposed algorithm significantly

Though a
number of methods have been developed in the past decades, it is still quite
challenging to design quality guaranteed algorithms with low complexities for
the problems. Our idea is inspired by the greedy method, Gonzalez's algorithm,
for solving the problem of ordinary $k$-center clustering. Based on some novel
observations, we show that this greedy strategy actually can handle
$k$-center/median/means clustering with outliers efficiently, in terms of
qualities and complexities. We further show that the greedy approach yields
small coreset for the problem in doubling metrics, so as to reduce the time
complexity significantly. Moreover, a by-product is that the coreset
construction can be applied to speedup the popular density-based clustering
approach DBSCAN.

    <title>Machine Learning and Wind Turbines</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IwXAr_ptgYo/XEYxZWFiAzI/AAAAAAABmPw/6t_lphNZigA3sXSix1MpcmKNANZFiGkawCLcBGAs/s1600/Turbines.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IwXAr_ptgYo/XEYxZWFiAzI/AAAAAAABmPw/6t_lphNZigA3sXSix1MpcmKNANZFiGkawCLcBGAs/s320/Turbines.png" width="320"/></a></div>
<br/>
My daughter Molly spent six weeks on an environmental program in China last summer. When she got back she had to do a report on machine learning and wind turbines used for clean energy generation. What does machine learning have to do with wind turbines? Plenty it turns out and it tell us a lot about the future of programming.<br/>
<br/>
Sudden changes in wind can cause damage to the blades of the turbine. Maintenance is very expensive especially for turbines in the sea and a broken turbine generates no electricity. To catch these changes ahead of time you can mount a Lidar on top of the turbine.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9LFv8FGZNG8/XEYxYFyCYDI/AAAAAAABmPs/TLY7-bfPWhMWjRLl8Jn9ixXrTBa_sAk7ACLcBGAs/s1600/Turbine%2BLidar.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9LFv8FGZNG8/XEYxYFyCYDI/AAAAAAABmPs/TLY7-bfPWhMWjRLl8Jn9ixXrTBa_sAk7ACLcBGAs/s320/Turbine%2BLidar.jpg" width="320"/></a></div>
<br/>
The Lidar can detect wind gusts from about 100 meters ahead, giving about 10 seconds to react. In that time you can rotate the blades, or the whole turbine itself to minimize any damage. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5zLp6UuC70">video</a> describing the situation.<br/>
<br/>
<center>

</center>
<br/>
How do you do the computations to convert the Lidar data into accurate representations of wind gusts and then how to best adjust for them? You could imagine some complex fluid dynamics computation, which gets even more complex when you several wind turbines in front of each other. Instead you can use the massive amount of data you have collected by sensors on the turbine and the Lidar information and train a neural network. Training takes a long time but a trained network can quickly determine a good course of action. Now neural networks can always make mistakes but unlike self-driving cars, a mistake won't kill anyone, just possibly cause more damage. Since on average you can save considerable maintenance costs, using ML here is a big win.<br/>
<br/>
I've obviously over simplified the above but I really like this example. This is not an ML solution to a standard AI question like image recognition or playing chess. Rather we are using ML to make a difficult computation tractable mostly by using ML on available data and that changes how we think about programming complex tasks.</div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Suppose you want to sell a car and there are 10 agents willing to buy it. You are not sure how much they could pay but for each of them you know a probability distribution of how high the offer will be. For example, a car salon would always pay 10K  but some person might offer 5K or 15K with equal probability. The best you could do is to first negotiate with all of them and then pick the highest bid. Unfortunately, you cannot do so - after seeing each offer you must irrevocably choose either to sell the car or to refuse the offer. What is the best strategy to maximize your revenue in this case?</p>
<p>In turns out that this is a well-studied optimization problem with a simple strategy that guarantees you can (on expectation) earn at least half as much as a hypothetical prophet, who knows all the bids in advance. This result is known as the prophet inequality. What is more surprising, this strategy would work even if you are a car retailer and want to sell five cars. Moreover, you might want to have some constraints, for example you do not want to sell two cars to buyers from the same city, or have multiple kinds of cars with different evaluations, and you can always guarantee an expected revenue comparable to the one of the prophets.</p>
<p>This problem not only exploits beautiful math but also has important applications in internet ad display. Actually, whenever you type a query into a web search engine, the ad system performs this kind of car-selling game with the ad suppliers, who offer different bids for their ad to be displayed to you.</p>
<p>Here is a link to our recent work with new developments in this theory: <a href="http://ieee-focs.org/FOCS-2018-Papers/pdfs/59f790.pdf">http://ieee-focs.org/FOCS-2018-Papers/pdfs/59f790.pdf</a></p>

the approximate $k$-cover problem seeks for a size-$k$ subset of $V$ that has
the maximum weighted coverage by \emph{sampling only a few hyperedges} in
$\mathcal{E}$. The problem has emerged from several network analysis
applications including viral marketing, centrality maximization, and landmark
selection. Despite many efforts, even the best approaches require $O(k n \log
n)$ space complexities, thus, cannot scale to, nowadays, humongous networks
without sacrificing formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose BCA, a family
of algorithms for approximate $k$-cover that can find $(1-\frac{1}{e}
-\epsilon)$-approximation solutions within an \emph{$O(\epsilon^{-2}n \log n)$
space}. That is a factor $k$ reduction on space comparing to the
state-of-the-art approaches with the same guarantee. We further make BCA more
efficient and robust on real-world instances by introducing a novel adaptive
sampling scheme, termed DTA.

save travel time. However, transportation system with ride-sharing is currently
inefficient due to low occupancy rate, high travel demand and some other

an exact algorithm to solve this problem with maximizing the number of

unconstrained binary polynomial optimization problem. We call this method PQCR
(Polynomial Quadratic Convex Reformulation). The resolution is based on a
3-phase method. The first phase consists in reformulating (P) into a quadratic
program (QP). For this, we recursively reduce the degree of (P) to two, by use
of the standard substitution of the product of two variables by a new one. We
then obtain a linearly constrained binary program. In the second phase, we
rewrite the quadratic objective function into an equivalent and parametrized
quadratic function using the equality x 2 i = x i and new valid quadratic
equalities. Then, we focus on finding the best parameters to get a quadratic
convex program which continuous relaxation's optimal value is maximized. For
this, we build a semidefinite relaxation (SDP) of (QP). Then, we prove that the
standard linearization inequalities, used for the quadratization step, are
redundant in (SDP) in presence of the new quadratic equalities. Next, we deduce
our optimal parameters from the dual optimal solution of (SDP). The third phase
consists in solving (QP *), the optimal reformulated problem, with a standard
solver. In particular, at each node of the branch-and-bound, the solver
computes the optimal value of a continuous quadratic convex program. We present
computational results on instances of the image restoration problem and of the
low autocorrelation binary sequence problem. We compare PQCR with other
convexification methods, and with the general solver Baron 17.4.1 [39]. We
observe that most of the considered instances can be solved with our approach
combined with the use of Cplex [24].

property of graphs (or other relational structures) in the sense that, for each
size of graph, there is an LP defining a polyhedral lift that separates the
integer points corresponding to graphs with the property from those
corresponding to graphs without the property. We show that this is equivalent,
with at most polynomial blow-up in size, to families of symmetric Boolean
circuits with threshold gates. In particular, when we consider polynomial-size
LPs, the model is equivalent to definability in a non-uniform version of
fixed-point logic with counting (FPC). Known upper and lower bounds for FPC
apply to the non-uniform version. In particular, this implies that the class of
graphs with perfect matchings has polynomial-size symmetric LPs while we obtain
an exponential lower bound for symmetric LPs for the class of Hamiltonian
graphs. We compare and contrast this with previous results (Yannakakis 1991)
showing that any symmetric LPs for the matching and TSP polytopes have
exponential size. As an application, we establish that for random, uniformly
distributed graphs, polynomial-size symmetric LPs are as powerful as general
Boolean circuits. We illustrate the effect of this on the well-studied
planted-clique problem.

</p>
<p>Garg and Schneider also considered an {\em auxiliary matching} model in which
Alice gets as an additional input a random matching $M$ over the numbers
$[1,2N]$, and storing this input does not count towards the memory used by
Alice. They showed that is this model there is a strategy for Alice that ties
with probability at least $1 - \frac{1}{N}$, and uses only $O(\sqrt{N} (\log
N)^2)$ memory. We show how to modify Alice's strategy so that it uses only
$O((\log N)^3)$ space.

distributions ${\bf p}=(p_1, \ldots , p_n)$ and ${\bf q}=(q_1, \ldots , q_m)$,
respectively, denote by ${\cal C}({\bf p}, {\bf q})$ the set of all couplings
of ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf q}$, that is, the set of all bivariate probability
distributions that have ${\bf p}$ and ${\bf q}$ as marginals. In this paper, we
study the problem of finding a joint probability distribution in ${\cal C}({\bf
p}, {\bf q})$ of \emph{minimum entropy} (equivalently, a coupling that
\emph{maximizes} the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$), and we discuss
several situations where the need for this kind of optimization naturally
arises. Since the optimization problem is known to be NP-hard, we give an
efficient algorithm to find a joint probability distribution in ${\cal C}({\bf
p}, {\bf q})$ with entropy exceeding the minimum possible at most by {1 bit},
thus providing an approximation algorithm with an additive gap of at most 1
bit. Leveraging on this algorithm, we extend our result to the problem of
finding a minimum--entropy joint distribution of arbitrary $k\geq 2$ discrete
random variables $X_1, \ldots , X_k$, consistent with the known $k$ marginal
distributions of the individual random variables $X_1, \ldots , X_k$. In this
case, our algorithm has an { additive gap of at most $\log k$ from optimum.}
</p>
<p>We also discuss several related applications of our findings and {extensions
of our results to entropies different from the Shannon entropy.}

</blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, while attending a Dagstuhl program on Equilibrium Computation, I embarked on one of the traditional long hikes through the beautiful woods surrounding Schloss Dagstuhl and happened to be walking next to a senior member of the Operations Research community. In no time we got immersed in a lively discussion on the style of research going on in Algorithmic Game Theory. We both agreed that the progress made in a matter of a few years was nothing short of phenomenal. At this point, my colleague remarked that AGT was no exception and that when TCS researchers enter a new area, they go in with such energies and enthusiasm that in no time not only is all low hanging fruit gone but in fact the entire area is devoid of any reasonable open problems! “They attack the area like swarms of locusts devouring foliage in biblical lands, consuming not only fruit and leaves but even shrubs and twigs,” he added. “Yes, and only sh*t is left behind!” I chimed in.</p>
<p>As AGT is reaching that stage, with researchers yearning for new issues/problems for their students and their own research and grant proposals, there is a reprieve emerging on the horizon: a program at Simons on “<a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/market2019">Online and Matching-Based Market Design</a>” in Fall 2019.</p>
<p>This is by no means a new area. In fact, the first such market, for matching medical residents to hospitals, dates back to 1920s, well before the classic — and by now Nobel Prize winning — work of Gale and Shapley on the stable matching problem, which provided the canonical algorithm for this market. In recent years, the advent of the Internet and the relocation of our most important activities to online platforms have led to an explosion of such marketplaces (for examples, see the Simons web page) and they have been occupying an ever-increasing fraction of our economy.</p>
<p>AGT, CS and Economics have already had a massive impact via these markets. My own experience comes from Google’s multi-billion dollar Adwords market in which sophisticated algorithmic ideas have also played a central role, e.g., see the Simons talk “<a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/vijay-vazirani-4-30-18">Google’s AdWords Market: How Theory Influenced Practice</a>“.</p>
<p>Clearly, the stakes are high. There is a real opportunity of extending the already existing highly inter-disciplinary theory in substantial ways and making an even bigger impact. Considering this and the enthusiasm of the researchers who have agreed to be participants in this program, Federico Echenique, Nicole Immorlica and I have launched the project of publishing a comprehensive volume of contributed chapters on this topic. More information on this will be coming soon.</p></div>

Joseph Wedderburn and Leonard Dickson proved Wedderburn’s “Little” Theorem: that every finite ring with the zero-product property is a field. Which of them proved it first is hard to tell.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss the issue of finding simple proofs for simple facts—not just Wedderburn’s theorem but the zero-product property on which it leans.</p>

Dickson did not believe the <em>result</em> and tried to build a counterexample. Instead he found a lemma that convinced him it was true and used it to give a simpler proof. They gave back-to-back presentations on 20 January, 1905, Wedderburn wrote up his paper with his proof and two more based on the lemma, which Wedderburn ascribed to an earlier paper by George Birkhoff and Harry Vandiver. Dickson wrote a paper with his approach, saying in a footnote:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> First proved by Wedderburn … Following my simpler proof above, and using the same lemma, Wedderburn constructed two further simpler proofs. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
However, Wedderburn’s first proof was found to have a gap. As <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/lag/man/099.pdf">detailed</a> by Michael Adam and Birte Specht, the gap was a statement that was not false <em>per se</em> but whose vague argument used only properties from a class of weaker structures in which it can fail. So:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Who first proved the theorem? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Other Proofs, Other Properties </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our sources linked above differ on whether the gap was noticed at the time or anytime before Emil Artin remarked on it in 1927. Artin didn’t discuss the gap but gave his own proof instead. There <a>seems</a> <a href="https://www.theoremoftheday.org/Docs/WedderburnShamil.pdf">to</a> <a href="https://ysharifi.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/wedderburns-little-theorem-1/">be</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedderburn's_little_theorem#Proof">consensus</a> that the “proof from the Book” was <a href="http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~hfinkeln/seminarium/eindige_delingsring_is_lichaam.pdf">given</a> by Ernst Witt four years later in 1931. But two other proofs, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2311457?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">by</a> Israel Herstein and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/glasgow-mathematical-journal/article/grouptheoretic-proof-of-a-theorem-of-maclaganwedderburn/7BBA5D9EA9EDEE000BAE4859EDE64DA6">by</a> Hans Zassenhaus, receive prominent mention. </p>
<p>
As our sources attest, interest in finding other proofs continues. The surprise in the theorem, which is that finiteness and the zero-product property force the multiplication to be commutative, informs what happens in other mathematical structures. Proofs that draw on results about these structures create connections among many areas. The shortest proof drawing on deeper results was a two-page <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2312328">paper</a> in the summer 1964 <em>Monthly</em> by Theodore Kaczynski (of <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/unabomber">ill</a> <a href="https://www.biography.com/news/unabomber-ted-kaczynski-today">note</a>). We won’t try to compare all these proofs, but will try to flip the question by focusing on the other property involved—the zero-product property:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If <img alt="{a \cdot b = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Ccdot+b+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a \cdot b = 0}"/> then <img alt="{a = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a = 0}"/> or <img alt="{b = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b = 0}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Given a ring <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> with this property, how easy is it to prove? If <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> has inverses then it is immediate, else multiplying both sides of <img alt="{a\cdot b = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5Ccdot+b+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a\cdot b = 0}"/> by <img alt="{a^{-1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a^{-1}}"/> in front and <img alt="{b^{-1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b^{-1}}"/> in back would yield the contradiction <img alt="{1 = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1 = 0}"/>. And we know if <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> is finite then this property makes it a field. So our quest for a different angle leads us to thinking about infinite rings. </p>
<p>
Incidentally, a ring with the zero-product property is called a <em>domain</em>. If the multiplication is commutative then it is an <em>integral domain</em>, though Serge Lang preferred the term <em>entire ring</em>. Our example goes beyond the integers though.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> No Zero-Divisors I </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A natural example that arises is the ring of integer polynomials over multiple variables. Thus for two variables <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y}"/> the elements of this ring are 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}x^{i}y^{j}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+c_%7Bij%7Dx%5E%7Bi%7Dy%5E%7Bj%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}x^{i}y^{j}. "/></p>
<p>It is easy to see that they form a ring with the usual high school rules for adding and multiplying polynomials. The ring is an integral domain in general.</p>
<p>
To show this, we claim that it has no zero-divisors. Suppose that it does: let <img alt="{f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29+%5Ccdot+g%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y) = 0}"/>. Then let 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = \sum_{k} f_{k}(x) y^{k}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+f_%7Bk%7D%28x%29+y%5E%7Bk%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = \sum_{k} f_{k}(x) y^{k}, "/></p>
<p>and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  g(x,y) = \sum_{k} g_{k}(x) y^{k}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+g_%7Bk%7D%28x%29+y%5E%7Bk%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  g(x,y) = \sum_{k} g_{k}(x) y^{k}. "/></p>
<p>Assume that the maximum degree in <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> for <img alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x,y)}"/> is <img alt="{df}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bdf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{df}"/> and is <img alt="{dg}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bdg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{dg}"/> for <img alt="{g(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g(x,y)}"/>. Then <img alt="{f_{df}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bdf%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{df}(x)}"/> and <img alt="{g_{df}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg_%7Bdf%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g_{df}(x)}"/> are both non-zero polynomials in one variable. It is clear by induction that <img alt="{f_{df}(x) \cdot g_{dg}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bdf%7D%28x%29+%5Ccdot+g_%7Bdg%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{df}(x) \cdot g_{dg}(x)}"/> is not zero. This proves the claim.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> No Zero-Divisors II </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The trouble with the above property of polynomials is that it is only about formal objects. In many applications to computer science we want to view polynomials as objects that can be evaluated. So a natural issue is a slightly different property: Suppose that <img alt="{F(x,y,\dots)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%2Cy%2C%5Cdots%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(x,y,\dots)}"/> and <img alt="{G(x,y,\dots)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%28x%2Cy%2C%5Cdots%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G(x,y,\dots)}"/> are two integral polynomials. Suppose further that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(a,b,\dots) \cdot G(a,b,\dots) = 0, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28a%2Cb%2C%5Cdots%29+%5Ccdot+G%28a%2Cb%2C%5Cdots%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(a,b,\dots) \cdot G(a,b,\dots) = 0, "/></p>
<p>for all integers <img alt="{a,b,\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a,b,\dots}"/>. Then it clearly must be the case that either <img alt="{F=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F=0}"/> identically or <img alt="{G=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G=0}"/> identically. Right?</p>
<p>
The trouble is that this seems to be obvious but how do we prove that it is true? Note, it must be the case that some use of the fact that <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> and <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> are polynomials. The fact is not true for more complex functions. For example, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \cos(\pi x) \cdot \sin(\pi x) = 0, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Ccos%28%5Cpi+x%29+%5Ccdot+%5Csin%28%5Cpi+x%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \cos(\pi x) \cdot \sin(\pi x) = 0, "/></p>
<p>for all integers <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. But neither the function <img alt="{\cos(\pi x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccos%28%5Cpi+x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cos(\pi x)}"/> nor <img alt="{\sin(\pi x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csin%28%5Cpi+x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sin(\pi x)}"/> is identically zero for all integers.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Proof </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is a relatively simple proof of the fact. It uses the famous Schwarz-Zippel (SZ) Theorem. See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">here</a> for our discussion of the theorem. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Let <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> be in <img alt="{\mathbb{F}[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5Bx_1%2Cx_2%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_n%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{F}[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]}"/> be a non-zero polynomial of total degree <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> over a field <img alt="{\mathbb{F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{F}}"/>.

<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \Pr[P(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)=0] \leq \frac{d}{|S|}.

"/></p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
The S-Z lemma of course has manifest applications throughout complexity theory. Often it is used in design of randomized algorithms. What we found interesting is that here we use it for a different purpose: to prove a structural property of polynomials.</p>
<p>
Back to our fact. Assume that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(a,b) \cdot G(a,b) = 0, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28a%2Cb%29+%5Ccdot+G%28a%2Cb%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(a,b) \cdot G(a,b) = 0, "/></p>
<p>for all integers <img alt="{a \in S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Cin+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a \in S}"/> and <img alt="{b \in S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%5Cin+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b \in S}"/> for some finite set. Now either <img alt="{F(a, b)=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28a%2C+b%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(a, b)=0}"/> or <img alt="{G(a, b)=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%28a%2C+b%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G(a, b)=0}"/> must be true for at least one half of the values in <img alt="{S \times S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS+%5Ctimes+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S \times S}"/>. Assume that it is <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/>. Then by the S-Z theorem it must be that <img alt="{F=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F=0}"/> always if the set <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> is large enough. Therefore, the fact is proved.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is there a simpler proof of this key fact? Is it possible to find an easier reference in the literature of this basic fact of polynomials? We have yet to discover one—any help would be appreciated.</p>

Godel Prize for outstanding paper in TCS. (Godel mentioned P vs NP in a letter to Von Neumann. I've heard it said that its too bad they didn't work on it-- either it would be solved or we'd know its hard. Frankly, I think enough smart people have worked on it that we already know its hard.)<br/>
<br/>
Knuth Prize for outstanding contributions to foundations of Computer Science. (its a greater honor to have a prize  named after you in your lifetime then to win a prize!)<br/>
<br/>
Dijkstra Prize (I wonder if having `ijk' in his name inspired him to work in algorithms)<br/>
<br/>
Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award.<br/>
<br/>
Lawler Award for Humanitarian Contributions within CS and Informatics.<br/>
<br/>
ACM Distinguished Service Award<br/>
<br/>
Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award (best student paper at STOC)<br/>
<br/>
The Best Paper award (Best paper at STOC, Best paper at FOCS)<br/>
<br/>
(The last two I doubt you can nominate someone for.)<br/>
<br/>
A few thoughts on the Godel Prize:<br/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
1) You can win the Godel Prize twice and some people have: Goldwasser, Hastad, Arora, Szegedy, Spielman, Teng. Spielman-Teng have won it as a team twice.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
2) GLAD there is no limit to how many can win. If a paper has a lot of people on it (and this has happened) then FINE, they're all winners! According to The Big Bang Theory (the TV show, not the theory) in Physics at most 3 can win a Nobel Prize in Physics for the same breakthrough in a given year. The show itself shows how stupid the policy is.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
3) I either knew and forgot or never knew that DPDA Equiv is decidable! Glad to now it just in time for teaching Automata theory this spring.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
4) Looking over the list reminded me that there are some papers in the intersection of those I want to read and those I am able to read! Though not many. Most I want to read but they seem hard.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
5) The Kanellakis award is for theory that is PRACTICAL. Could someone win a Godel AND a Kannellakis award for the same paper (or set of papers). I found one sort-of case ( (a) below) and one definite case ( (b) below).</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
a) Moshe and Wolpert won the 2000 Godel Prize for Temporal Logic and Finite Automata (I should also read that before my class starts)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Holtzmann, Kurshan, Vardi, and Wolpert won the 2005 Kanellakis prize for Formal Verification Tools.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I assume the two works are related.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
b) Freund and Schapire won the 2003 Godel Prize and the 2004 Kanellakis Award, both for their work on boosting in Machine Learning.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
6) Why is it the  Godel <i>Prize </i>and the Kanellakis <i>Award? </i>What is the diff between a prize and an award? A quick Google Search says that an Award is a token of effort and merit, while a Prize is something you win in a competition. I doubt that applies. I suspect they are called Prize and Award from historical accident. Does anyone know?</div>
<div>
<br/></div>

    <title>TR19-008 |  Efficiently factoring polynomials modulo $p^4$ | 

	Ashish Dwivedi, 

	Rajat Mittal, 

	Nitin Saxena</title>
    <summary>Polynomial factoring has famous practical algorithms over fields-- finite, rational \&amp; $p$-adic. However, modulo prime powers it gets hard as there is non-unique factorization and a combinatorial blowup ensues. For example, $x^2+p \bmod p^2$ is irreducible, but $x^2+px \bmod p^2$ has exponentially many factors! We present the first randomized poly($\deg f, \log p$) time algorithm to factor a given univariate integral $f(x)$ modulo $p^k$, for a prime $p$ and $k \leq 4$. Thus, we solve the open question of factoring modulo $p^3$ posed in (Sircana, ISSAC'17). 

Our method reduces the general problem of factoring $f(x) \bmod p^k$ to that of {\em root finding} in a related polynomial $E(y) \bmod\langle p^k, \varphi(x)^\ell \rangle$ for some irreducible $\varphi \bmod p$. We could efficiently solve the latter for $k\le4$, by incrementally transforming $E(y)$. Moreover, we discover an efficient and strong generalization of Hensel lifting to lift factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ to those  $\bmod\ p^4$ (if possible). This was previously unknown, as the case of repeated factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ forbids classical Hensel lifting.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>[Guest post by </em><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/noahmiller"><em>Noah Miller</em></a><em> – a Harvard Physics Ph.D student that took our seminar. Noah’s webpage contains wonderful and extensive notes that can be of interest to computer scientists. –Boaz]</em></p>



<p/>



<p>(The following blog post serves as an introduction to the following notes:)</p>



<p><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/noahmiller/files/firewall.pdf">Black Holes, Hawking Radiation, and the Firewall</a></p>



<p>There are many different types of “theoretical physicists.” There are theoretical astrophysicists, theoretical condensed matter physicists, and even theoretical biophysicists. However, the general public seems to be most interested in the exploits of what you might call “theoretical high energy theorists.” (Think Stephen Hawking.)</p>



<p>The holy grail for theoretical high energy physicists (who represent only a small fraction of all physicists) would be to find a theory of quantum gravity. As it stands now, physicists have two theories of nature: quantum field theory (or, more specifically, the “Standard Model”) and Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Quantum field theory describes elementary particles, like electrons, photons, quarks, gluons, etc. General relativity describes the force of gravity, which is really just a consequence of the curvature of spacetimes. </p>



<p>Sometimes people like to say that quantum field theory describes “small stuff” like particles, while general relativity describes “big stuff” like planets and stars. This is maybe not the best way to think about it, though, because planets and stars are ultimately just made out of a bunch of quantum particles.</p>



<p>Theoretical physicists are unhappy with having two theories of nature. In order to describe phenomena that depend on both quantum field theory and general relativity, the two theories must be combined in an “ad hoc” way. A so-called “theory of everything,” another name for the currently unknown theory of “quantum gravity,” would hypothetically be able to describe all the phenomena we know about. Just so we’re all on the same page, they don’t even have a fuly worked out hypothesis. (“String theory,” a popular candidate, is still not even a complete “theory” in the normal sense of the word, although it could become one eventually.)</p>



<p>So what should these high energy theoretical physicists do if they want to discover what this theory of quantum gravity is? For the time being, nobody can think up an experiment that would be sensitive to quantum gravitation effects which is feasible with current technology. We are limited to so-called “thought experiments.”</p>



<p>This brings us to Hawking radiation. In the 1970’s, Stephen Hawking considered what would happen to a black hole once quantum field theory was properly taken into account. (Of course, this involved a bit of “ad hoc” reasoning, as mentioned previously.) Hawking found that, much to everybody’s surprise, the black hole evaporated, realeasing energy in the form of “Hawking radiation” (mostly low energy photons). More strangely, this radiation comes out exactly in the spectrum you would expect from something “hot.” For example, imagine heating a piece of metal. At low temperatures, it emits low energy photons invisible to the human eye. Once it gets hotter, it glows red, then yellow, then perhaps eventually blue. The spectrum of light emitted follows a very specific pattern. Amazingly, Hawking found that the radiation which black holes emit follow the exact same pattern. By analogy, they have a temperature too!</p>



<p>This is more profound than you might realize. This is because things which have an temperature should also have an “entropy.” You see, there are two notions of “states” in physics: “microstates” and “macrostates.” A microstate gives you the complete physical information of what comprises a physical system. For example, imagine you have a box of gas, which contains many particles moving in a seemingly random manner. A “microstate” of this box would be a list of all the positions and momenta of every last particle in that box. This would be impossible to measure in pratice. A “macrostate,” on the other hand, is a set of microstates. You may not know what the exact microstate your box of gas is in, but you can measure macroscopic quantities (like the total internal energy, volume, particle number) and consider the set of all possible microstates with those measured quantities.</p>



<p>The “entropy” of a macrostate is the logarithm of the number of possible microstates. If black holes truly are thermodynamic systems with some entropy, that means there should be some “hidden variables” or microstates to the black hole that we currently don’t understand. Perhaps if we understood the microstates of the black hole, we would be much closer to understanding quantum gravity!</p>



<p>However, Hawking also discovered something else. Because the black hole is radiating out energy, its mass will actually decrease as time goes on. Eventually, it should disappear entirely. This means that the information of what went into the black hole will be lost forever.</p>



<p>Physicists did not like this, however, because it seemed to them that the information of what went into the black hole should never be lost. Many physicists believe that the information of what went into the black hole should somehow be contained in the outgoing Hawking radiation, although they do not currently understand how. According to Hawking’s original calculation, the Hawking radiation only depends on a parameters of the black hole (like its mass) and have nothing to do with the many finer details on what went in, the exact “microstate” of what went in.</p>



<p>However, physicists eventually realized a problem with the idea that the black hole releases its information in the form of outgoing Hawking radiation. The problem has to do with quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, it is impossible to clone a qubit. That means that if you threw a qubit in a black hole and then waited for it to eventually come out in the form of Hawking radiation, then the qubit could no longer be “inside” the black hole. However, if Einstein is to be believed, you should also be able to jump into the black hole and see the qubit on the inside. This seems to imply that the qubit is cloned, as it is present on both the inside and outside of the black hole.</p>



<p>Physicists eventually came up with a strange fix called “Black Hole Complementarity” (BHC). According to BHC, according to people outside the black hole, the interior does not exist. Also, according to people who have entered the black hole, the outside ceases to exist. Both descriptions of the world are “correct” because once someone has entered the black hole, they will be unable to escape and compare notes with the person on the outside.</p>



<p>Of course, it must be emphasized that BHC remains highly hypothetical. People have been trying to poke holes in it for a long time. The largest hole is the so called “Firewall Paradox,” first proposed in 2012. Essentially, the Firewall paradox tries to show that the paradigm of BHC is self-contradictory.  In fact, it was able to use basic quantum mechanics to show that, under some reasonable assumptions, the interior of the black hole <em>truly</em> doesn’t exist, and that anyone who tries to enter would be fried at an extremely hot “firewall!” Now, I don’t think most physicists actually believe that black holes really have a firewall (although this might depend on what day of the week you ask them). The interesting thing about the Firewall paradox is that it derives a seemingly crazy result from seemingly harmless starting suppositions. So these suppositions would have to be tweaked in the theory of quantum gravity order to get rid of the firewall.</p>



<p>This is all to say that all this thinking about black holes really might help physicists figure out something about quantum gravity. (Then again, who can really say for sure.)</p>



<p>If you would like to know more about the Firewall paradox, I suggest you read my notes, pasted at the top of this post!</p>



<p>The goal of the notes was to write an introduction to the Black Hole Information Paradox and Firewall Paradox that could be read by computer scientists with no physics background.</p>



<p>The structure of the notes goes as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Special relativity</li><li>General relativity</li><li>Quantum Field Theory (in which I ambitiously tell you what QFT actually is!)</li><li>Statistical Mechanics (this is the best part)</li><li>Hawking radiation</li><li>The information paradox</li></ol>



<p>Because the information paradox touches on all areas of physics, I thought it was necessary to take “zero background, infinite intelligence” approach, introducing the all the necessary branches of physics (GR, QFT, Stat Mech) in order to understand what the deal with Hawking radiation really is, and why physicists think it is so important. I think it is safe to say that if you read these notes, you’ll learn a non-trivial amount of physics.</p></div>

    <summary>An orientation of an undirected graph is the directed graph that you get by assigning a direction to each edge. Several kinds of orientations have been studied. For instance, in a graph with even vertex degrees, an Eulerian orientation makes the numbers of incoming and outgoing degrees equal at each vertex. In a bridgeless graph, a strong orientation makes the resulting directed graph strongly connected. In finite connected graphs, every Eulerian orientation is strong, but that is untrue in infinite graphs. Consider, for instance, the graph of unit distances on the integers, which is Eulerian (every vertex has degree two) but has no strong orientation (every edge is a bridge). Even when a strong orientation exists, an Eulerian orientation might not be strong: the graph of distance-1 and distance-2 integers, with the orientation from smaller to larger numbers, is Eulerian but not strong. So when does an Eulerian strong orientation exist? The answer turns out to be: whenever the obvious obstacles are not present. Every bridgeless connected even-degree infinite graph has an Eulerian strong orientation.</summary>

<p>To prove this, we can use a convenient tool for dealing with infinite orientations by looking only at finite graphs, a result of Rado from 1949 that is simultaneously a predecessor and generalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s_theorem_(graph_theory)">De Bruijn–Erdős theorem on graph colorings</a>. Suppose each element in some infinite set  has a finite set of labels, and we choose an assignment of labels for each finite subset of . These choices may be inconsistent with each other, so there may be no way of labeling all of  consistently with all of the choices. But Rado proved (assuming the axiom of choice) that there exists a global labeling that, on every finite subset, is consistent with the assignment to one of its finite supersets. Another way of thinking about this is that if certain finite patterns must be avoided, and every finite subset has a labeling that avoids them, then some global labeling will also avoid them.<sup id="fnref:rado"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/orientations-infinite-graphs.html#fn:rado">1</a></sup> The De Bruijn–Erdős theorem is the case where the elements are vertices, the labels are colors, and the patterns to be avoided are pairs of equal color on adjacent vertices. In our case the set elements will be edges, the labels will be which way to orient each edge, and the choice of assignment will be some way of defining a “good” orientation for finite subgraphs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Graph vertices can be labeled by color; edges, by orientation" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/graph-labels.svg"/></p>

<p>So suppose we’re given a finite subgraph  of an infinite 2-edge-connected even-degree graph. What kind of orientation on  should we look for? A complication is that  might have bridges or odd-degree vertices. So we’ll try to come as close as we can to what we want, an Eulerian strong orientation, while taking those deficiencies into account. Let’s define a good orientation of  to be an orientation that is almost Eulerian, in that at each vertex the in-degree and out-degree differ by at most one, and almost strong, in that each edge of  that belongs to an undirected cycle also belongs to a directed cycle. Another way of stating the almost strong condition is that the strongly connected components of the oriented graph should coincide with the 2-edge-connected components, or blocks, of the undirected graph.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A good orientation of a graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/good-orientation.svg"/></p>

<p>The existence of a good orientation of an arbitrary finite undirected graph (also having some other stronger properties) was proven in the 1960s by Nash-Williams.<sup id="fnref:nw"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/orientations-infinite-graphs.html#fn:nw">2</a></sup> But now Rado’s method proves that every infinite graph also has a good orientation. If we find a global orientation that’s nearly-Eulerian on a supergraph of the star of neighbors of every vertex, then it must be nearly-Eulerian. And if it’s almost strong on a supergraph of every cycle, then it must be almost strong. This proves the theorem that a bridgeless connected even-degree infinite graph has an Eulerian strong orientation, because every good orientation in these graphs must be Eulerian and strong. Nash-Williams already considered the infinite case of his orientation theorem, but wrote that the details were too heavy to include. Perhaps he didn’t know about Rado’s theorem (despite it being published in the same journal), which makes the extension from finite to infinite easy.</p>

<p>The same method of extending finite to infinite orientations can also be used to study notions of graph sparseness including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboricity">arboricity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)">degeneracy</a>, and pseudoarboricity. Historically the pseudoarboricity of infinite graphs was first. A graph has pseudoarboricity at most  if it can be oriented so that each vertex has out-degree  (or equivalently if it can be partitioned into subgraphs each with out-degree one). In the 1950 paper in which he first announced the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem, Erdős used it to prove that, when such an orientation is given, the resulting graph can be -colored.<sup id="fnref:e"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/orientations-infinite-graphs.html#fn:e">3</a></sup> But he didn’t write about the conditions under which such an orientation exists. Rado’s theorem shows that they are the same as in the finite case: an outdegree- orientation exists if and only if every finite -vertex subgraph has at most  edges.</p>

<p>A graph has degeneracy at most  if it has an acyclic orientation so that each vertex has out-degree . Unlike in the finite case, infinite graphs with low degeneracy might have high minimum degree; for instance, there exist graphs with degeneracy one in which all vertices have infinite degree. A finite -degenerate graph can be -colored greedily, and the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem shows that even in the infinite case such a coloring exists. Rado’s theorem shows that infinite graphs with pseudoarboricity  are -degenerate, and that a graph is -degenerate if and only if every finite subgraph has a vertex with degree at most . As in the case of Eulerian strong orientations, this involves checking the orientation only on two kinds of finite subgraphs, stars and cycles.</p>

<p>Arboricity is based on forests and there are multiple incompatible definitions of infinite forests. But the one we want to use is that a forest is a 1-degenerate graph. A graph has arboricity  if its edges can be partitioned into  forests. This is clearly at least as large as the degeneracy (no Rado needed). Rado’s theorem shows that infinite graphs with arboricity  are -degenerate, and that a graph has arboricity at most  if and only if every finite -vertex subset has at most  edges.</p>

<br/>Computer scientists tend to obsess about privacy and we've had a privacy/security debate for decades now. But now machine learning has really given us a whole new spin on what privacy protects and takes away.<br/>
<div>
<br/>
I take an open approach and basically allow Google to know everything about my life. Google knows where I've been--sometimes my Pixel asks me which store in a shopping center I visited and I give up that info. Google knows who I communicate with, what websites I visit, what music and movies I listen to and watch, all my photos, what temperature makes me comfortable and so on.<br/>
<br/>
What do I get? A Google ecosystem that knows me sometimes better than I know myself. Google works best when it learns and integrates. I get asked to download maps for trips Google knows I'm about to take. I have Google assistant throughout my house, in my phone, in my car and it tailor answers and sometimes even the questions that I need answers to. If anything I wish there was further integration, like Google Voice should ring my office phone only when I'm in the office.<br/>
<br/>
Georgia Tech now forces us to use Microsoft Exchange for email. Outlook is not a bad email program but its capabilities, especially for search, does not work as well and think of all that unused knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I trust Google to keep my information safe, with a random password and 2-factor encryption and even if someone would manage to break in they would find I'm a pretty boring person with an unhealthy obsession of opera (the musical form not the browser).<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't work for everyone and companies should make it easy to keep your info secure. But I say go use your machine learning on me and find ways to make my life easier and more fun, and sure send me some targeted ads as payment. The Internets will find a way to discover you anyway, might as well take advantage. </div></div>

    <title>TR19-007 |  Lower Bounds for Linear Decision Lists | 

	Arkadev Chattopadhyay, 

	Meena Mahajan, 

	Nikhil Mande, 

	Nitin Saurabh</title>
    <summary>We demonstrate a lower bound technique for linear decision lists, which are decision lists where the queries are arbitrary linear threshold functions.
We use this technique to prove an explicit lower bound by showing that any linear decision list computing the function $MAJ \circ XOR$ requires size $2^{0.18 n}$.  This completely answers an open question of Tur{\'a}n and Vatan [FoCM'97]. We also show that the spectral classes $PL_1, PL_\infty$, and the polynomial threshold function classes $\widehat{PT}_1, PT_1$,  are incomparable to linear decision lists.</summary>

    <summary>We show that any Boolean function with approximate rank $r$ can be computed by bounded error quantum protocols without prior entanglement of complexity $O( \sqrt{r} \log r)$. In addition, we show that any Boolean function with approximate rank $r$ and discrepancy $\delta$ can be computed by deterministic protocols of complexity $O(r)$, and private coin bounded error randomized protocols of complexity $O((\frac{1}{\delta})^2 + \log r)$. Our results yield lower bounds on approximate rank. We also obtain a strengthening of Newman's theorem with respect to approximate rank.</summary>
