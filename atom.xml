    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A life that was all covid, cancellations, and Trump, all desperate rearguard defense of the beleaguered ideals of the Enlightenment, would hardly be worth living.  So it was an exquisite delight, these past two weeks, to forget current events and write an <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/bb.pdf">18-page survey article</a> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy Beaver function</a>: the staggeringly quickly-growing function that probably encodes a huge portion of all interesting mathematical truth in its first hundred values, if only we could know those values or exploit them if we did.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s the title, abstract, and link:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/bb.pdf"><strong>The Busy Beaver Frontier</strong></a><br/>by Scott Aaronson</p><p>The Busy Beaver function, with its incomprehensibly rapid growth, has captivated generations of computer scientists, mathematicians, and hobbyists.  In this survey, I offer a personal view of the BB function 58 years after its introduction, emphasizing lesser-known insights, recent progress, and especially favorite open problems.  Examples of such problems include: when does the BB function first exceed the Ackermann function?  Is the value of BB(20) independent of set theory?  Can we prove that BB(n+1)&gt;2<sup>BB(n)</sup> for large enough n?  Given BB(n), how many advice bits are needed to compute BB(n+1)?  Do all Busy Beavers halt on all inputs, not just the 0 input?  Is it decidable whether BB(n) is even or odd?</p></blockquote>



<p>The article is slated to appear soon in <em>SIGACT News</em>.  I’m grateful to Bill Gasarch for suggesting it—even with everything else going on, this was a commission I felt I couldn’t turn down!</p>



<p>Besides Bill, I’m grateful to the various Busy Beaver experts who answered my inquiries, to Marijn Heule and Andy Drucker for suggesting some of the open problems, to Marijn for creating a figure, and to Lily, my 7-year-old daughter, for raising the question about the first value of n at which the Busy Beaver function exceeds the Ackermann function.  (Yes, Lily’s covid homeschooling has included multiple lessons on very large positive integers.)</p>



<p>There are still a few days until I have to deliver the final version. So if you spot anything wrong or in need of improvement, don’t hesitate to leave a comment or send an email.  Thanks in advance!</p>



<p>Of course Busy Beaver has been an obsession that I’ve returned to many times in my life: for example, in that <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html">Who Can Name the Bigger Number?</a> essay that I wrote way back when I was 18, in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a></em>, in my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3445">public lecture at Festivaletteratura</a>, and in my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2725">2016 paper with Adam Yedidia</a> that showed that the values of all Busy Beaver numbers beyond the 7910<sup>th</sup> are independent of the axioms of set theory (Stefan O’Rear has since shown that independence starts at the 748<sup>th</sup> value or sooner).  This survey, however, represents the first time I’ve tried to take stock of BusyBeaverology <em>as a research topic</em>—collecting in one place all the lesser-known theorems and empirical observations and open problems that I found the most striking, in the hope of inspiring not just contemplation or wonderment but actual progress.</p>



<p>Within the last few months, the world of <em>deep mathematics that you can actually explain to a child</em> lost two of its greatest giants: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a> (who died of covid, and who I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4732">eulogized here</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Graham">Ron Graham</a>.  One thing I found poignant, and that I didn’t know before I started writing, is that Conway and Graham <em>both</em> play significant roles in the story of the Busy Beaver function.  Conway, because most of the best known candidates for Busy Beaver Turing machines turn out, when you analyze them, to be testing variants of the notorious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz Conjecture</a>—and Conway is the one who proved, in 1972, that the set of “Collatz-like questions” is Turing-undecidable.  And Graham because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number">Graham’s number</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory">Ramsey theory</a>—a candidate for the biggest number that’s ever played a role in mathematical research—and because of the <a href="https://googology.wikia.org/wiki/User_blog:Wythagoras/The_nineteenth_Busy_Beaver_number_is_greater_than_Graham%27s_Number!">discovery</a>, four years ago, that the 18<sup>th</sup> Busy Beaver number exceeds Graham’s number.</p>



<p>(“Just how big is Graham’s number?  So big that the <em>17<sup>th</sup> Busy Beaver number</em> is not yet known to exceed it!”)</p>



<p>Anyway, I tried to make the survey pretty accessible, while still providing enough technical content to sink one’s two overgrown front teeth into (don’t worry, there are no such puns in the piece itself).  I hope you like reading it at least 1/BB(10) as much as I liked writing it.</p></div>

machines into servers in the cloud, we consider the online problem of packing
items with random sizes into unit-capacity bins. Items arrive sequentially, but
upon arrival an item's actual size is unknown; only its probabilistic
information is available to the decision maker. Without knowing this size, the
decision maker must irrevocably pack the item into an available bin or place it
in a new bin. Once packed in a bin, the decision maker observes the item's
actual size, and overflowing the bin is a possibility. An overflow incurs a
large penalty cost and the corresponding bin is unusable for the rest of the
process. In practical terms, this overflow models delayed services, failure of
servers, and/or loss of end-user goodwill. The objective is to minimize the
total expected cost given by the sum of the number of opened bins and the
overflow penalty cost. We present an online algorithm with expected cost at
most a constant factor times the cost incurred by the optimal packing policy
when item sizes are drawn from an i.i.d. sequence of unknown length. We give a
similar result when item size distributions are exponential with arbitrary
rates.

    <title>Improved Distance Sensitivity Oracles with Subcubic Preprocessing Time</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1595462400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Ren:Hanlin.html">Hanlin Ren</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11495">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the problem of building Distance Sensitivity Oracles (DSOs).
Given a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ with edge weights in $\{1, 2, \dots, M\}$, we
need to preprocess it into a data structure, and answer the following queries:
given vertices $u,v\in V$ and a failed vertex or edge $f\in (V\cup E)$, output
the length of the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ that does not go through $f$.
Our main result is a simple DSO with $\tilde{O}(n^{2.7233}M)$ preprocessing
time and $O(1)$ query time. Moreover, if the input graph is undirected, the
preprocessing time can be improved to $\tilde{O}(n^{2.6865}M)$. The
preprocessing algorithm is randomized with correct probability $\ge 1-1/n^C$,
for a constant $C$ that can be made arbitrarily large. Previously, there is a
DSO with $\tilde{O}(n^{2.8729}M)$ preprocessing time and
$\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ query time [Chechik and Cohen, STOC'20].
</p>
<p>At the core of our DSO is the following observation from [Bernstein and
Karger, STOC'09]: if there is a DSO with preprocessing time $P$ and query time
$Q$, then we can construct a DSO with preprocessing time $P+\tilde{O}(n^2)\cdot
Q$ and query time $O(1)$. (Here $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides
$\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ factors.)

where we are given a set $P$ of $n$ points, a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of
balls, and parameters $L$ and $U$. The goal is to find a minimum-sized subset
$\mathcal{B}'\subseteq \mathcal{B}$ and an assignment of the points in $P$ to
$\mathcal{B}'$, such that each point $p\in P$ is assigned to a ball that
contains $p$ and for each ball $B_i\in \mathcal{B}'$, at least $L$ and at most
$U$ points are assigned to $B_i$. We obtain an LP rounding based constant
approximation for LUC by violating the lower and upper bound constraints by
small constant factors and expanding the balls by again a small constant
factor. Similar results were known before for covering problems with only the
upper bound constraint. We also show that with only the lower bound constraint,
the above result can be obtained without any lower bound violation.
</p>
<p>Covering problems have close connections with facility location problems. We
note that the known constant-approximation for the corresponding lower- and
upper-bounded facility location problem, violates the lower and upper bound
constraints by a constant factor.

chordal sparsity is positive semidefinite for all $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ if and
only if there exists a sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomial $\sigma(x)$ such that
$\sigma(x)P(x)$ can be decomposed into a sum of sparse SOS matrices, each of
which is zero outside a small principal submatrix. Second, we establish that
setting $\sigma(x)=(x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2)^\nu$ for some integer $\nu$
suffices if $P(x)$ is even, homogeneous, and positive definite. Third, we prove
a sparse-matrix version of Putinar's Positivstellensatz: if $P(x)$ has chordal
sparsity and is positive definite on a compact semialgebraic set
$\mathcal{K}=\{x:g_1(x)\geq 0,\ldots,g_m(x)\geq 0\}$ satisfying the Archimedean
condition, then $P(x) = S_0(x) + g_1(x)S_1(x) + \cdots + g_m(x)S_m(x)$ for
matrices $S_i(x)$ that are sums of sparse SOS matrices, each of which is zero
outside a small principal submatrix. Using these decomposition results, we
obtain sparse SOS representation theorems for polynomials that are quadratic
and correlatively sparse in a subset of variables. We also obtain new
convergent hierarchies of sparsity-exploiting SOS reformulations to convex
optimization problems with large and sparse polynomial matrix inequalities.
Analytical examples illustrate all our decomposition results, while large-scale
numerical examples demonstrate that the corresponding sparsity-exploiting SOS
hierarchies have significantly lower computational complexity than traditional
ones.

vertices and outputs a maximum weight independent set of $G$. If $G$ does not
contain any cycle on $k$ or more vertices as an induced subgraph ($G$ is a
$C_{\geq k}$-free graph), the algorithm runs in time $n^{O(k^3 \log^5 n)}$, and
therefore for fixed $k$ is a quasi-polynomial time algorithm. $C_{\geq 4}$-free
graphs (also known as chordal graphs) have a well known polynomial time
algorithm. A subexponetial time algorithm for $C_{\geq 5}$-free graphs (also
known as long-hole-free graphs) was found in 2019 [Chudnovsky et al., Arxiv'19]
followed by a polynomial time algorithm for $C_{\geq 5}$-free graphs in 2020
[Abrishami et al., Arxiv'20]. For $k &gt; 5$ only a quasi-polynomial time
approximation scheme [Chudnovsky et al., SODA'20] was known. Our work is the
first to exhibit conclusive evidence that Independent Set on $C_{\geq k}$-free
graphs is not NP-complete for any integer $k$. This also generalizes previous
work of ours [Gartland and Lokshtanov, FOCS'20], with an additional factor of
$\log^2(n)$ in the exponent, where we provided a quasi-polynomial time
algorithm for graphs that exclude a path on $k$ vertices as an induced
subgraph.

given memory models. Such an algorithm checks whether the executions of a
shared-memory concurrent program are consistent under the axioms defined by a
model. For memory models like SC and TSO, checking consistency is NP-complete.
Our framework shows, that despite the hardness, fast deterministic consistency
algorithms can be obtained by employing tools from fine-grained complexity. The
framework is based on a universal consistency problem which can be instantiated
by different memory models. We construct an algorithm for the problem running
in time O*(2^k), where k is the number of write accesses in the execution that
is checked for consistency. Each instance of the framework then admits an
O*(2^k)-time consistency algorithm. By applying the framework, we obtain
corresponding consistency algorithms for SC, TSO, PSO, and RMO. Moreover, we
show that the obtained algorithms for SC, TSO, and PSO are optimal in the
fine-grained sense: there is no consistency algorithm for these running in time
2^o(k) unless the exponential time hypothesis fails.

their pairwise distances (or cost) $c(uv)$, and moreover each city $v$ comes
with an associated positive integer request $r(v)$.
</p>
<p>The goal is to find a minimum-cost path, starting at city $s$ and ending at
city $t$, that visits each city $v$ exactly $r(v)$ times.
</p>
<p>We present a $\frac32$-approximation algorithm for the metric Many-visits
Path TSP, that runs in time polynomial in $n$ and poly-logarithmic in the
requests $r(v)$.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm can be seen as a far-reaching generalization of the
$\frac32$-approximation algorithm for Path TSP by Zenklusen (SODA 2019), which
answered a long-standing open problem by providing an efficient algorithm which
matches the approximation guarantee of Christofides' algorithm from 1976 for
metric TSP.
</p>
<p>One of the key components of our approach is a polynomial-time algorithm to
compute a connected, degree bounded multigraph of minimum cost.
</p>
<p>We tackle this problem by generalizing a fundamental result of Kir\'aly, Lau
and Singh (Combinatorica, 2012) on the Minimum Bounded Degree Matroid Basis
problem, and devise such an algorithm for general polymatroids, even allowing
element multiplicities.
</p>
<p>Our result directly yields a $\frac32$-approximation to the metric
Many-visits TSP, as well as a $\frac32$-approximation for the problem of
scheduling classes of jobs with sequence-dependent setup times on a single
machine so as to minimize the makespan.

Analysis (TDA) in a new direction. TDA quantifies topological shapes hidden in

clustering of a finite set in a metric space. Equivalently, the 0D persistence
captures only edge-lengths of a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Both SL dendrogram

stable-under-noise mergegram, which outperforms previous isometry invariants on

    <title>New Data Structures for Orthogonal Range Reporting and Range Minima Queries</title>

variants of the orthogonal range searching problem.
</p>
<p>First, we describe a data structure that supports two-dimensional orthogonal
range minima queries in $O(n)$ space and $O(\log^{\varepsilon} n)$ time, where
$n$ is the number of points in the data structure and $\varepsilon$ is an
arbitrarily small positive constant. Previously known linear-space solutions
for this problem require $O(\log^{1+\varepsilon} n)$ (Chazelle, 1988) or
$O(\log n\log \log n)$ time (Farzan et al., 2012). A modification of our data
structure uses space $O(n\log \log n)$ and supports range minima queries in
time $O(\log \log n)$. Both results can be extended to support
three-dimensional five-sided reporting queries.
</p>
<p>Next, we turn to the four-dimensional orthogonal range reporting problem and
present a data structure that answers queries in optimal $O(\log n/\log \log n
+ k)$ time, where $k$ is the number of points in the answer. This is the first
data structure that achieves the optimal query time for this problem.
</p>
<p>Our results are obtained by exploiting the properties of three-dimensional
shallow cuttings.

    <title>Improved lower and upper bounds on the tile complexity of uniquely self-assembling a thin rectangle non-cooperatively in 3D</title>

Summers</a>, Logan Withers <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11093">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We investigate a fundamental question regarding a benchmark class of shapes
in one of the simplest, yet most widely utilized abstract models of algorithmic
tile self-assembly. Specifically, we study the directed tile complexity of a $k
\times N$ thin rectangle in Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model, assuming
that cooperative binding cannot be enforced (temperature-1 self-assembly) and
that tiles are allowed to be placed at most one step into the third dimension
(just-barely 3D). While the directed tile complexities of a square and a
scaled-up version of any algorithmically specified shape at temperature 1 in
just-barely 3D are both asymptotically the same as they are (respectively) at
temperature 2 in 2D, the bounds on the directed tile complexity of a thin
rectangle at temperature 2 in 2D are not known to hold at temperature 1 in
just-barely 3D. Motivated by this discrepancy, we establish new lower and upper
bounds on the directed tile complexity of a thin rectangle at temperature 1 in
just-barely 3D. We develop a new, more powerful type of Window Movie Lemma that
lets us upper bound the number of "sufficiently similar" ways to assign glues
to a set of fixed locations. Consequently, our lower bound,
$\Omega\left(N^{\frac{1}{k}}\right)$, is an asymptotic improvement over the
previous best lower bound and is more aesthetically pleasing since it
eliminates the $k$ that used to divide $N^{\frac{1}{k}}$. The proof of our
upper bound is based on a just-barely 3D, temperature-1 counter, organized
according to "digit regions", which affords it roughly fifty percent more
digits for the same target rectangle compared to the previous best counter.
This increase in digit density results in an upper bound of
$O\left(N^{\frac{1}{\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\right\rfloor}}+\log N\right)$, that
is an asymptotic improvement over the previous best upper bound and roughly the
square of our lower bound.

    <title>Optimal $\ell_1$ Column Subset Selection and a Fast PTAS for Low Rank Approximation</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Arvind V. Mahankali, David P. Woodruff Carnegie Mellon University) <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10307">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the problem of entrywise $\ell_1$ low rank approximation. We give
the first polynomial time column subset selection-based $\ell_1$ low rank
approximation algorithm sampling $\tilde{O}(k)$ columns and achieving an
$\tilde{O}(k^{1/2})$-approximation for any $k$, improving upon the previous
best $\tilde{O}(k)$-approximation and matching a prior lower bound for column
subset selection-based $\ell_1$-low rank approximation which holds for any
$\text{poly}(k)$ number of columns. We extend our results to obtain tight upper
and lower bounds for column subset selection-based $\ell_p$ low rank
approximation for any $1 &lt; p &lt; 2$, closing a long line of work on this problem.
</p>
<p>We next give a $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for entrywise
$\ell_p$ low rank approximation, for $1 \leq p &lt; 2$, that is not a column
subset selection algorithm. First, we obtain an algorithm which, given a matrix
$A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, returns a rank-$k$ matrix $\hat{A}$ in
$2^{\text{poly}(k/\varepsilon)} + \text{poly}(nd)$ running time such that:
$$\|A - \hat{A}\|_p \leq (1 + \varepsilon) \cdot OPT +
\frac{\varepsilon}{\text{poly}(k)}\|A\|_p$$ where $OPT = \min_{A_k \text{ rank
}k} \|A - A_k\|_p$. Using this algorithm, in the same running time we give an
algorithm which obtains error at most $(1 + \varepsilon) \cdot OPT$ and outputs
a matrix of rank at most $3k$ --- these algorithms significantly improve upon
all previous $(1 + \varepsilon)$- and $O(1)$-approximation algorithms for the
$\ell_p$ low rank approximation problem, which required at least
$n^{\text{poly}(k/\varepsilon)}$ or $n^{\text{poly}(k)}$ running time, and
either required strong bit complexity assumptions (our algorithms do not) or
had bicriteria rank $3k$. Finally, we show hardness results which nearly match
our $2^{\text{poly}(k)} + \text{poly}(nd)$ running time and the above additive
error guarantee.

    <title>The Pitfalls of Average-Case Differential Privacy</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Differential privacy protects against extremely strong adversaries—even ones who know the entire dataset except for one bit of information about one individual.  Since its inception, people have considered ways to relax the definition to assume a more realistic adversary.  A natural way to do so is to incorporate some distributional assumptions. That is, rather than considering a worst-case dataset, assume the dataset is drawn from some distribution and provide some form of “average-case” or “Bayesian” privacy guarantee with respect to this distribution. This is especially tempting as it is common for statistical analysis to work under distributional assumptions.</p>

<p>In this post and in a planned follow-up post, we will discuss some pitfalls of average-case or Bayesian versions of differential privacy.  To avoid keeping you in suspense:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The average-case assumptions in relaxations of differential privacy are qualitatively different to and much more brittle than the typical assumptions made about how the data is generated.</li>
  <li>Average-case relaxations do not satisfy the strong composition properties that have made differential privacy so successful.</li>
  <li>It is safer to use distributional assumptions in the accuracy analysis instead of the privacy analysis. That is, we can provide average-case utility and worst-case privacy. Recent work has shown that this model can capture most of the advantages of distributional assumptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will show some illustrative examples for each of these points, but we will be purposefully vague as to exactly which alternative definition we are considering, as these issues arise in a wide variety of definitions.  Our hope is not to shut down discussion of these relaxations, or to single out specific definitions as flawed.  There are specific concrete applications where average-case differential privacy might be useful, and our goal is to highlight some issues that must be carefully considered in each application.</p>

<h3 id="assumptions-about-nature-vs-assumptions-about-the-adversary">Assumptions about nature vs. assumptions about the adversary?</h3>

<p>In any reasonable definition of privacy, we have to think about whom we are hiding sensitive information from.  This person—“the adversary”—could be a stranger, a close friend, a relative, a corporation we do business with, or the government, and who they are affects what information they have access to and what defenses are appropriate.   How the adversary can access the private system defines the <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/\trustmodels">trust model</a>. Distributional assumptions correspond to the adversary’s side information.  Our key point is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assumptions incorporated into the definition of privacy are assumptions about the adversary and these are qualitatively different from assumptions about “nature,” which is the process that generates the data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, suppose an employer learns that two of its employees have expensive medical conditions. On its own, this information does not identify those employees and this privacy intuition could be formalized via distributional assumptions. But these distributional assumptions will break if the employer later receives some side information. For example, the other healthy employees may voluntarily disclose their medical status or the employer may find out that, before you were hired, that number was only one. (Incidentally, this is an example of a failure of composition, which we will discuss in another post.)</p>

<p>This example illustrates how assumptions about the adversary that might seem reasonable in a vacuum can be invalidated by context. Plus, assumptions about the adversary can be invalidated by <em>future</em> side information, and you can’t retract a privacy leak once it happens the way you can a medical study. So assumptions about the adversary are much less future-proof than assumptions about nature.</p>

<h3 id="all-models-are-wrong-but-some-are-useful">All models are wrong, but some are useful</h3>

<p>One justification for incorporating distributional assumptions into the privacy definition is that the person using the data is often making these assumptions anyway—for example, that the data is i.i.d. Gaussian, or that two variables have some underlying linear relationship to be discovered.  So, if the assumption were false, wouldn’t we already be in trouble?  Not really.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important to remember the old saw “all models are wrong, but some are useful.”  Some models have proven themselves useful for statistical purposes, but that does not mean they are useful as a basis for privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, our methods may be robust to the relatively friendly ways that nature deviates from the model, but we can’t trust adversaries to be as friendly.</p>

<p>For a toy example, suppose we model our data as coming from a normal distribution \( N(\mu,\sigma^2) \), but actually the data is collected at two different testing centers, one of which rounds its measurements to the nearest integer and the other of which provides two decimal places of precision.  This rounding makes the model wrong, but won’t significantly affect our estimate of the mean.  However, just looking at the estimate of the mean might reveal that someone in the dataset went to the second testing center, potentially compromising that person’s privacy.</p>

<p>A more natural setting where this issue arises is in dealing with <em>outliers</em> or other extreme examples, which we will discuss in the next section.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-for-outliers">Privacy for outliers</h3>

<p>The usual worst-case definition of differential privacy provides privacy for everyone, including outliers.  Although there are lots of ways to achieve differential privacy, in order to compare definitions, it will help to restrict attention to the basic approach based on calibrating noise to sensitivity:</p>

<p>Suppose we have a private dataset \( x \in \mathcal{X}^n \) containing the data of \( n \) individuals, and some real-valued query \( q : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathbb{R} \).  The standard way to release an estimate of \( q(x) \) is to compute
\[
M(x) = q(x) + Z \cdot \sup_{\textrm{neighboring}~x’,x”} |q(x’) - q(x”)|
\]
where 
\(
\sup_{\textrm{neighboring}~x’,x”} |q(x’) - q(x”)|
\)
is called the “worst-case sensitivity” of \( q \) and \( Z \) is some noise, commonly drawn from a Laplace or Gaussian distribution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the worst-case sensitivity may be large or even infinite for basic statistics of interest, such as the mean \( q(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i} x_i \) of unbounded real values.  There are a variety of differentially private algorithms for addressing this problem,<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1">1</a></sup> but that is not what this post is about.  It’s tempting to, instead, try to scale the noise to some notion of “average-case sensitivity,” with the goal of satisfying some average-case version of differential privacy.  For example, suppose the data is drawn from some normal distribution \( N(\mu,\sigma^2) \) and the neighboring datasets \( x', x'' \) are each \( n \) i.i.d. samples from this distribution, but differing on exactly one random sample.  Then the worst-case sensitivity of the mean is infinite:
\[
\sup_{\textrm{neighboring}~x’,x”} |q(x’) - q(x”)| = \infty,
\]
but the average-sensitivity is proportional to \(1/n\):
\[
\mathbb{E}_{\textrm{neighboring}~x’, x”}(|q(x’) - q(x”)|) \approx \frac{\sigma}{n}.
\]
Thus, under an average-case privacy guarantee, we can estimate the mean with very little noise.</p>

<p>But what happens to privacy if this assumption fails, perhaps because of outliers?  Imagine computing the average wealth of a subset of one hundred Amazon employees who test positive for COVID-19, and discovering that it’s over one billion dollars.  Maybe Jeff Bezos isn’t feeling well?<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Yes, this example is a little contrived, since you probably shouldn’t have computed the empirical mean of such skewed data anyway. But, if this fact leaks out, you can’t just go back in time and truncate the data or compute the median instead. Privacy tends to be high-stakes both because of the potential consequences of a breach and the inability to retract or correct a privacy violation after it is discovered.</p>

<p>In the next section we’ll see a slightly more complex example where average-case privacy / average-case sensitivity fails to protect privacy even when the distributional assumptions hold.</p>

<h3 id="example-pairwise-correlations-and-linear-regression">Example: pairwise correlations and linear regression</h3>

<p>Suppose our dataset \( X \) is a matrix \( \{-1,+1\}^{n \times (d+1)} \) where each row \( X_i \) corresponds to one person’s data and each column corresponds to one feature.  For simplicity, let’s suppose our distributional assumption is that the dataset is completely uniform—each bit is sampled independently and uniformly from \( \{-1,+1\} \).  We’ll think of the first \( d \) columns as “features” and the last column as a “secret label.”</p>

<p>First, consider the set of pairwise correlations between each feature and the secret label:
\[
q_j(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} X_{i,j} X_{i,d+1}
\]
for \( j = 1,\dots,d \).  Note that \( q_j(X) \) has mean 0 and variance \( n \) under our distributional model of the data.</p>

<p>Now, suppose we have a weight vector \( w \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \) and want to estimate the weighted average of correlations
\[
q(X) = \sum_{j = 1}^{d} w_j q_j(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{d} w_{j} X_{i,j} X_{i,d+1}
\]
This statistic may look a little odd, but it’s pretty close to computing the average squared error of the linear predictor \( \hat X_{i,d+1} = \sum_{j=1}^{d} w_j X_{i,j} \) given by the weight vector \( w \), which is a natural thing to estimate.</p>

<p>The worst-case sensitivity of \(q\) is proportional to \( \|w\|_1 \).<br/>
However, it’s not too hard to show that, under our distributional model, the average-case sensitivity is much lower; it is proportional to \( \| w \|_2 \).  Thus, using average-case privacy may allow us to add significantly less noise.</p>

<p>What could go wrong here?  Well, we’ve implicitly assumed that the weights \( w \) are independent of the data \( X \).  That is, the person specifying the weights has no knowledge of the data itself, only its distribution.  Suppose the weights are specified by an adversary who has learned the \( d \) features of the first individual (although there is nothing special about considering the first individual), who sets the weights to \(w = (X_{1,1},\dots,X_{1,d}) \).  Another calculation shows that, in this case, <em>even when our model of the data is exactly correct</em>, the query \( q(X) \) has mean \( d \cdot X_{1,d+1} \) and standard deviation approximately \( \sqrt{nd} \).  Thus, if \( d \gg n \) we can confidently determine the secret label \( X_{1,d+1} \)  of the first individual from the value \( q(X) \).  Moreover, adding noise of standard deviation \( \ll d \) will not significantly affect the adversary’s ability to learn the secret label.  But, earlier, we argued that average-case sensitivity is proportional to \( \|w \|_2 = \sqrt{d} \), so this form of average-case privacy fails to protect a user’s data in this scenario!  Note that adding noise proportional to \( \|w\|_1 = d \) would satisfy (worst-case) differential privacy and would thwart this adversary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What went wrong is that the data satisfied our assumptions, but the adversary’s beliefs about the data did not!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The set of reasonable distributions to consider for the adversary’s beliefs may look very different from the set of reasonable distributions to consider for your analysis of the data.  You may think that it’s not reasonable for the attacker to choose this weight vector \( w \) containing a lot of prior information about an individual, but assuming that the attacker cannot obtain or specify such a vector is very different from assuming that the data is uniform, and requires its own justification.</p>

<p>Before wrapping up, let’s just make a couple more observations about this example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This attack is pretty robust. The assumption that the data is uniform with independent features can be relaxed significantly.  It’s also not necessary for the adversary to exactly know all the features of the first user, all we need is for the weights to have correlation \( \gg \sqrt{nd} \) with the features.  For example, if the dataset is genomic data, having the data of a relative might suffice.</li>
  <li>This problem isn’t specific to high-dimensional data with \( d \gg n \).  If we allow more general types of “queries”, then a similar attack is possible when there are only \( d \approx \log n \) features.</li>
  <li>To make this example as crisp as possible, we allowed an adversarial data analyst to specify the weight vector \( w \).  You might think examples like this can’t arise if the algorithm designer specifies all of the queries internally, but ensuring that requires great care (as we’ll see in our upcoming post about composition).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As we have discussed, the main issue that arises in average-case or Bayesian versions of differential privacy is that we must make strong assumptions about the adversary. A simple distributional assumption about the data, which may be entirely reasonable for statistical analysis, entails assuming a naïve adversary with essentially no side information, which is not reasonable from a privacy perspective.</p>

<p>In a future post, we will discuss <em>composition</em>, which is a key robustness property and really the secret to differential privacy’s success.  As we’ll see, average-case versions of differential privacy do not enjoy strong composition properties the way worst-case differential privacy does, which makes them much harder to deploy.</p>

<p>Incorporating assumptions about the adversary into the privacy guarantee requires great care; and it is safest to make fewer assumptions, which quickly pushes us towards the worst-case definition of differential privacy. Nevertheless, assumptions about the adversary are often made implicitly and it is worth studying how to make these explicit.</p>

<p>So, is there are role for distributional assumptions in differential privacy? Yes! Although we’ve discussed the pitfalls of making the <em>privacy guarantee</em> contingent on distributional assumptions, none of these pitfalls apply to making the <em>utility guarantee</em> contingent on distributional assumptions, as is normally done in statistical analysis.  In recent years, this combination—worst-case privacy, average-case utility—has been fruitful, and seems to allow many of the benefits that average-case privacy definitions seek to capture.  For example, recent work has shown that worst-case differential privacy permits accurate mean and covariance estimation of unbounded data under natural modeling assumptions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03908" title="Vishesh Karwa, Salil Vadhan.

    <summary>The purpose of this note is to state and prove a lower bound on the capacity of a real stable polynomial $p(x)$ which is based only on its value and gradient at $x=1$. This result implies a sharp improvement to a similar inequality proved by Linial-Samorodnitsky-Wigderson in 2000. Such inequalities have played an important role in the recent work on operator scaling and its generalizations and applications.</summary>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">latest paper</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>, we explore adversarial
robustness as an avenue for training computer vision models with more transferrable
features. We find that robust models outperform their standard counterparts on
a variety of transfer learning tasks.</i></p>

<h2 id="what-is-transfer-learning">What is transfer learning?</h2>

<p>Transfer learning is a paradigm where one leverages information
from a “source” task to better solve another “target” task. Particularly when there is little training data or compute available for solving the target
task, transfer learning provides a simple and efficient way to obtain performant
machine learning models.</p>

<p>Transfer learning has already proven its utility in many ML contexts. In natural language processing, for example, one can leverage language models pre-trained on large
text corpora to beat state-of-the-art performance on
tasks like query answering, entity recognition or part-of-speech classification.</p>

<p>In our work we focus on computer vision; in this context, a standard—and
remarkably successful—transfer learning pipeline is “ImageNet pre-training.”
This pipeline starts with a deep neural network trained on the <a href="http://image-net.org">ImageNet-1K</a>
dataset, and then refines this pre-trained model for a target task. The target task can range
from classification of smaller datasets (e.g., <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR</a>) to more complex
tasks like object detection (e.g., <a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/">VOC</a>).</p>

<p>Although there are many ways in which one can refine a pre-trained model, we
will restrict our attention to the two most popular methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fixed-feature</strong>: In fixed-feature transfer learning, we replace the final
(linear) layer of the neural network with a new layer that has the correct
number of outputs for the target task. Then, keeping the rest of the layers
<em>fixed</em>, we train the newly replaced layer on the target task.</li>
  <li><strong>Full-network</strong>: In full-network transfer learning, we also replace the last
layer but do not freeze any layers afterwards. Instead, we use the pre-trained
network
as a sort of “initialization,” and continue training <em>all</em> the layers on the
target task.</li>
</ul>

<p>When at least a moderate amount of data is available, full-network transfer
learning typically outperforms the fixed-feature strategy.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-improve-transfer-learning">How can we improve transfer learning?</h2>

<p>Although we don’t have a comprehensive understanding of what makes transfer
learning algorithms tick, there has been a long line of work focused on identifying 
factors that improve (or worsen) performance (examples include
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5774">[1]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08614">[2]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08974">[3]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08328">[4]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792">[5]</a>).</p>

<p>By design, the pre-trained ImageNet model itself plays a major role here:
indeed, a recent study by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08974">Kornblith, Shlens, and Le</a> finds that
pre-trained models which achieve a higher ImageNet accuracy also perform better when
transferred to downstream classification tasks, with a tight linear
correspondence between ImageNet accuracy and the accuracy on the target task:</p>

<p><img alt="A scatter plot of ImageNet accuracy versus downstream     transfer accuracy showing the linear relation." class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/ksl.png"/></p>
<div class="footnote">

Each dot is a pre-trained model whose $x$ coordinate is given by its 
ImageNet accuracy and $y$ coordinate is given by its downstream 
accuracy on the target task (after the corresponding refinement on that task).
</div>

<p>But is improving ImageNet accuracy of the pre-trained model the <em>only</em> way to improve transfer learning performance?</p>

<p>After all, we want to obtain models that have learned broadly applicable features from the
source dataset. ImageNet accuracy likely correlates with the quality of
features that a model has learned, but may not fully describe the downstream
utility of these features.
Ultimately, the nature of learned features stems from the <em>priors</em> placed on
them during training. For example, there have been studies of the (sometimes
implicit) priors imposed by architectural components (e.g., <a href="https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep_image_prior">convolutional layers</a>),
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/10618600152418584">data</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09071">augmentation</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00401">loss functions</a> and even
<a href="https://stats385.github.io/assets/lectures/Stanford_Donoho_class_Nov_19.pdf">gradient descent</a> on neural network training.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">our paper</a>, we study another prior: <em>adversarial robustness</em>.
Adversarial robustness—a rather frequent subject on this blog—refers to
model’s invariance to small (often imperceptible) perturbations of natural
inputs, called <a href="https://gradientscience.org/intro_adversarial">adversarial examples</a>.</p>

<p>Standard neural networks (i.e., trained with the goal of maximizing
accuracy) are extremely vulnerable to such adversarial examples. For example,
with just a tiny perturbation to the pig image below, a pre-trained ImageNet
classifier will predict it as an “airliner” with 99% confidence:</p>

<p><img alt="An adversarial example: a pig on the left which is imperceptibly perturbed to be classified as an airliner on the right." src="https://gradientscience.org/images/piggie.png"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
A "pigs-can-fly" adversarial example: The "pig" image on the left is correctly classified by a standard ML model, but its imperceptibly perturbed counterpart on the right is classified as an "airliner" with 99% confidence.
</div>

<p>Adversarial robustness is thus typically induced at training time by replacing
the standard loss minimization objective with a <em>robust optimization</em> objective
(see our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_opt_pt1">post on robust optimization</a> for more background):</p>



<p>The above objective trains models to be robust to image perturbations that are
small in (pixel-wise) $\ell_2$ (Euclidean) normIn reality, an $\ell_2$ ball doesn't perfectly capture the
set of imperceptible perturbations we want models to be robust to—but robustness with respect to this fairly rudimentary notion of perturbations turns out to be already non-trivial and very helpful.. 
The parameter $\varepsilon$ is a hyperparameter
governing the intended degree of invariance of the resulting models to the
corresponding perturbations. Setting 
$\varepsilon = 0$ corresponds to standard training, and increasing $\varepsilon$
asks the model to be robust to increasingly large perturbations.
In short, the objective asks the model to minimize risk on not only the 
training datapoints but also the entire radius-$\varepsilon$
neighbourhood around them.</p>

<p><em>[A quick plug: Our <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">robustness</code> Python library</a>, used for the code release of this paper, enables one to easily train and manipulate both standard and adversarially robust models.]</em></p>

<p>Although adversarial robustness has been initially studied solely through the lens of machine learning security, a line
of recent work (including some that’s been <a href="https://gradientscience.org/adv">previously</a> 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_apps">covered</a> on this blog) has begun to study
adversarially robust models in their own right, framing adversarial robustness
as a prior that forces models to learn features that are locally stable.
These works have found that on the one hand, adversarially robust models tend
to attain lower accuracy than their standardly-trained
counterparts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, recent work suggests that the feature
representations of robust models carry several advantages over those of
standard models, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12152">better-behaved</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09797">gradients</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08640">representation
invertibility</a>, and more <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10190">specialized
features</a>.
We’ve actually discussed some of these observations in earlier posts on this
blog—see, e.g., our posts about 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_reps">representation learning</a> and 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_apps">image synthesis</a>.</p>

<p>These desirable properties
might suggest that robust neural networks are learning better feature
representations than standard networks, which could improve transfer
performance.</p>

<h3 id="adversarial-robustness-and-transfer-learning">Adversarial robustness and transfer learning</h3>

<p>So in summary, we have standard models with high accuracy on the source task but
little (or no) robustness; and we have adversarially robust models, which are
worse in terms of ImageNet accuracy, but have the “nice”
representational properties identified and discussed by prior works. Which
models are better for transfer learning?</p>

<p>To answer this question, we trained and examined a large collection
of standard and robust ImageNet models, while grid searching over a wide range of
hyperparameters and architectures to find the best model of each type. (All
models are available for download via our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/robust-models-transfer">code/model
release</a> and more
details on our training procedure can be found there and in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">our
paper</a>). We then performed transfer
learning (using both fixed-feature and full-network refinement) from each
trained model to 12 downstream classification tasks.</p>

<p>It turns out that 
adversarially robust source models fairly consistently outperform their standard counterparts in
terms of downstream accuracy. In the table below, we compare the accuracies of
the best standard model (searching over hyperparameters and
architecture) and the best robust model (searching over the
previous factors as well as robustness level $\varepsilon$):</p>

<p><img alt="Table showing that robust models     perform better than their standard counterparts." class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/results-table.svg" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
    The main result: Adversarially robust models outperform their standard counterparts when transferred to downstream classification tasks.
</div>

<p>This difference in performance tends to be particularly striking in the context of fixed-feature transfer learning. The following graph shows, for each architecture and
downstream classification task, the best standard model compared to the best
robust model in that setting. As we can see, adversarially robust models
improve on the performance of their standard counterparts, and the gap tends to
<em>increase</em> as networks increase in width:</p>

<p><img alt="A bar chart showing that robust models improve on     standard ones even without taking the maximum over architectures." class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/LogisticRegression.svg"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
    Adversarially robust models tend to improve over standard networks for
    individual architectures too. (An analogous graph for full-network
    transfer learning is given in Figure 3 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">our paper</a>.)
</div>

<p>Adversarial robustness improved downstream transfer
performance even when the target task was not a classification one. For example, the
following table compares standard and robust pre-training for use in downstream
object detection and instance segmentation:</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/../assets/robust-transfer-learning/obj-det-results.svg" style="width: 80%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
</div>

<h3 id="robustness-versus-accuracy">Robustness versus accuracy</h3>

<p>So it seems like robust models, despite being less accurate on the source task, are actually
better for transfer learning purposes. Indeed, the linear relation between
 ImageNet accuracy and transfer performance observed in prior work (see our discussion above) doesn’t seem
 to hold when the robustness parameter is varied. Compare the graphs below to the ones at the very start of this post:</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/wide_resnet50_4_LogisticRegression.svg"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
    Source-task (ImageNet) versus target (fixed-feature) accuracy for models with the same
    architecture while varying the robustness levels. Each dot is a
    WideResNet-50x4 model with $x$ coordinate given by source-task accuracy and
    $y$ coordinate given by fixed-feature transfer learning accuracy.
    Contrast the trends here with the "fixed-feature" trend in the first
    figure of this post—the linear trend depicted there largely disappears as less
    accurate but more robust models perform better in terms of transfer.
</div>

<p>How do we reconcile our observations with these trends observed by prior work?</p>

<p>We hypothesize that robustness and accuracy have <em>disentangled</em> effects on
transfer performance. That is, for a fixed level of robustness, higher
accuracy on the source task helps transfer, and for a fixed level of
accuracy, increased robustness helps transfer. Indeed, as shown below, for a
fixed level of robustness, the accuracy-transfer relation tends to hold
strongly:</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/fixed-robustness.svg"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
Even though robust models appear to break the linear
accuracy-transfer trend, this trend is actually preserved for a fixed value of
robustness. Each dot in the graph is a different architecture, trained for the same level of robustness ($\varepsilon = 3.0$). The $x$ coordinate is source task (ImageNet) accuracy, and the $y$ coordinate is the downstream accuracy on each target dataset.
</div>

<p>In addition to reconciling our results with those of prior work, these findings suggest that ongoing work on developing more accurate robust models
may have the added benefit of further improving transfer learning performance.</p>

<h3 id="other-empirical-mysteries-and-future-work">Other empirical mysteries and future work</h3>

<p>This post discussed how adversarially robust models might constitute a promising
avenue for improving transfer learning, and already often outperform standard
models in terms of downstream accuracy. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">our paper</a>, 
we study this phenomenon more closely: for example, we examine the effects of
model width, and we compare adversarial robustness to other notions of
robustness. We also uncover a few somewhat mysterious properties: for example,
resizing images seems to have a non-trivial effect on the relationship between
robustness and downstream accuracy.</p>

<p>Finally, while our work provides evidence that adversarially
robust computer vision models transfer better, understanding precisely <em>why</em> this is the case remains open. More broadly, the results we
observe indicate that we still do not yet fully understand (even empirically)
the ingredients that make transfer learning successful. We hope that our work
prompts an inquiry into the underpinnings of modern transfer learning.</p></div>

    <title>Erdos-Turan for k=3 is True!</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(All of the math in this post is summarized (without proofs) in a writeup by Erik Metz and myself which you can find <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/3apblog.pdf">here</a>. It is a pdf file so you can click on links in it to get to the papers it refers to.

If you know of others then let me know so I can add them to this post.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a sequel to <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/12/breakthrough-result-on-density-and-3.html">A BREAKTHROUGH result on density and 3-AP's</a> and <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/06/big-news-on-w3r.html">Big news on W(3,r)!</a><br/>
<br/>
For this post N is large, and all inequalites have a big-O or a big-Omega.<br/>
<br/>
For this post [N] is {1,...,N}<br/>
<br/>
Let<br/>
<br/>
r(N) be the least w such that if A is a subset of [N] and |A|  &gt;  w, then A has a 3-AP.<br/>
<br/>
There has been a long sequence of results getting smaller and smaller upper bounds on r(N).<br/>
<br/>
The motivation for getting these results is that if r(N) is &lt; N/(log N)^{1+\delta} with delta&gt;0 then the following holds:<br/>
<br/>
If sum_{x\in A} 1/x diverges then A has a 3-AP.<br/>
<br/>
This is the k=3 case of one of the Erdos-Turan Conjectures.<br/>
<br/>
Bloom and Sisack HAVE gotten N/(log N)^{1+delta} so they HAVE gotten ET k=3. Wow!<br/>
<br/>
1) I am NOT surprised that its true.<br/>
<br/>
2) I am SHOCKED and DELIGHTED that it was proven.  Shocked because the results leading up to it (see the write up referenced at the beginning of this post) seemed Zeno-like, approaching the result needed got but not getting there. Delighted because... uh, as the kids say, just cause.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard that k=4 really is much harder (see my comments and Gil's response on his blog post, pointed to at the beginning of this post)  and it is true that there has been far less progress on that case (the write up I pointed to at the beginning of this post says what is known). Hence I will again be <i>shocked </i>if it is proven.  So, unlike The Who (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDfAdHBtK_Q">here</a>) I CAN be fooled again. That's okay--- I will  be <i>delighted</i>. (ADDED LATER- there are more comments no Gil's website, from Thomas Bloom and Ben Green about what is likely to happen in the next 10 years.)<br/>
<br/>
Erdos offered a prize of $3000 for a proof that A has, for all k, a k-AP.  The prize is now $5000. After Erdos passed away Ronald Graham became the Erdos-Bank and paid out the money when people solved a problem Erdos put a bounty on. What happens now? (If I have the facts wrong and/or if you know the answer, please leave a polite and enlightening comment.)<br/>

    <summary>We show that testing Hamiltonicity in the bounded-degree graph model requires a linear number of queries. This refers to both the path and the cycle versions of the problem, and similar results hold also for the directed analogues.
In addition, we present an alternative proof for the known fact that testing Independent Set Size (in this model) requires a linear number of queries.</summary>

    <title>TR20-108 |  Query Complexity of Global Minimum Cut | 

	Arijit Bishnu, 

	Arijit Ghosh, 

	Gopinath Mishra, 

	Manaswi Paraashar</title>
    <summary>In this work, we resolve the query complexity of global minimum cut problem for a graph by designing a randomized algorithm for approximating the size of minimum cut in a graph, where the graph can be accessed through local queries like \textsc{Degree}, \textsc{Neighbor}, and \textsc{Adjacency} queries.

Given $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, the algorithm with high probability outputs an estimate $\hat{t}$ satisfying the following $(1-\epsilon) t \leq \hat{t} \leq (1+\epsilon) t$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $t$ is the size of minimum cut in the graph. The expected number of local queries used by our algorithm is $\min\left\{m+n,\frac{m}{t}\right\}\mbox{poly}\left(\log n,\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Eden and Rosenbaum showed that $\Omega(m/t)$ many local queries are required for approximating the size of minimum cut in graphs. These two results together resolve the query complexity of the problem of estimating the size of minimum cut in graphs using local queries.

Building on the lower bound of Eden and Rosenbaum, we show that, for all $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to decide if the size of the minimum cut in the graph is $t$ or $t-2$. Also, we show that, for any $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to find all the minimum cut edges even if it is promised that the input graph has a minimum cut of size $t$. Both of our lower bound results are randomized, and hold even if we can make \textsc{Random Edge} query apart from local queries.</summary>

    <title>TR20-107 |  Testing linear inequalities of subgraph statistics | 

	Lior Gishboliner, 

	Asaf Shapira, 

	Henrique Stagni</title>
    <summary>Property testers are fast randomized algorithms whose task is to distinguish between inputs satisfying some predetermined property ${\cal P}$ and those that are far from satisfying it. Since these algorithms operate by inspecting a small randomly selected portion of the input, the most natural property one would like to be able to test is whether the input does not contain certain forbidden small substructures. In the setting of graphs, such a result was obtained by Alon et al., who proved that for any finite family of graphs ${\cal F}$, the property of being induced ${\cal F}$-free (i.e. not containing an induced copy of any $F \in {\cal F}$) is testable.

It is natural to ask if one can go one step further and prove that more elaborate properties involving induced subgraphs are also testable. One such generalization of the result of Alon et al. was formulated by Goldreich and Shinkar who conjectured that for any finite family of graphs ${\cal F}$, and any linear inequality involving the densities of the graphs $F \in {\cal F}$ in the input graph,
the property of satisfying this inequality can be tested in a certain restricted model of graph property testing. Our main result in this paper disproves this conjecture in the following strong form: some properties of this type are not testable even in the classical (i.e. unrestricted) model of graph property testing.

The proof deviates significantly from prior non-testability results in this area. The main idea is to use a linear inequality relating induced subgraph densities in order to encode the property of being a quasirandom graph.</summary>

<p>
Anurag Agarwal and Richard Zanibbi are tenured faculty in Mathematics and Computer Science, respectively, at RIT. They partner with Clyde Lee Giles of Penn State and Douglas Oard of U.Md. on the <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/mathseer/">MathSeer</a> project. If the name reminds you of <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/">CiteSeer<img alt="{{\,}^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5C%2C%7D%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\,}^x}"/></a>, no surprise: Giles co-originated that and still directs it.</p>
<p>
Today we note last month’s release of a major piece of MathSeer called <a href="https://mathdeck.cs.rit.edu/">MathDeck</a> and show how to have fun with it.</p>
<p>
Agarwal is a PhD graduate from Buffalo. He did his thesis in the Mathematics Department under Thomas Cusick on cryptography, but often visited Computer Science. He took part in seminars on lattice-based cryptography led by Jin-Yi Cai when he was in Buffalo and in one of mine on related topics. I also knew him socially as a housemate of Pavan Aduri, whose joint work we’ve mentioned <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/07/14/it-dont-come-easy/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
A long time ago, Dick wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/some-mathematical-gifts/">post</a> on <a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</a>, which does optical character recognition (OCR) for mathematical symbols and finds corresponding (La)TeX commands. <em>MathDeck</em> does OCR as well, but what it is really trying to recognize is the <em>formula</em> you are trying to write. If it is a famous formula—or one you have already saved in your “deck”—it will find and complete it for you. It also takes input from LaTeX. <em>MathDeck</em> was created by Gavin Nishizawa, Jennifer Liu, Yancarlos Diaz, Abishai Dmello, and Wei Zhong along with Zanibbi. They are credited on a brief <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/files/ECIR2020_MathDeck_Demo.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/mathseer/demos.html">video</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Trying MathDeck </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
On first visit, the site shows a very brief tutorial which can be dismissed via a sometimes-invisible X in the upper-right corner. The first formula I thought to write was Leonhard Euler’s “mystic equation” <img alt="{e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7Bi%5Cpi%7D+%2B+1+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0}"/>. Its OCR sprang into action as I drew and converted my attempt to draw a curly <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/> and then <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pi}"/> as <img alt="{7n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B7n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{7n}"/> with an extra crossbar.  (The website graphics are much sharper than our screenshots here.)</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/eulerformulamathdeck/" rel="attachment wp-att-17310"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17310" height="400" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/eulerformulamathdeck.jpg?w=540&amp;h=400" width="540"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Nevertheless, its default deck of “WikiCards” recognizes the attempt and includes “Euler’s Identity” as an option. Selecting the card changes the display to an immaculately typeset version. I then decided to change it to the form <img alt="{e^{i\pi} = -1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7Bi%5Cpi%7D+%3D+-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e^{i\pi} = -1}"/>. <em>MathDeck</em> does not have a pixel eraser like Microsoft Paint does but allows you to delete a region after selecting it:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/eulerformulatypeset/" rel="attachment wp-att-17312"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17312" height="190" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/eulerformulatypeset.jpg?w=360&amp;h=190" width="360"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Selecting “trash” did not close up the space to the equals sign. I drew a minus bar at far right, but my attempts to follow with <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> kept being interpreted as “<img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>” or something worse, and the alternate form of Euler’s identity did not come up below. Finally, I restored the LaTeX-input box on the right and edited the source to read, <font size="+1"><tt>e^{i\pi} = -1</tt></font>:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/eulerformulatypeset2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17314"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17314" height="175" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/eulerformulatypeset2.jpg?w=540&amp;h=175" width="540"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
The artifact of my hand-drawn minus sign was still at far right. I could not select and trash it even after refreshing the page. What fixed the issue was drawing something else over the squiggle and having the OCR interpret the tandem into something else, which I could then select and delete. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Superposing Forms and Associations </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I next wondered how the system would react to my trying to write Schrödinger’s equation. One challenge is that it has many forms. I chose the form given uppermost in Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger_equation#Equation">article</a>: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  i\hbar \frac{d |\Psi(t)\rangle}{d t} = \hat{H}|\Psi(t)\rangle " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++i%5Chbar+%5Cfrac%7Bd+%7C%5CPsi%28t%29%5Crangle%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Chat%7BH%7D%7C%5CPsi%28t%29%5Crangle+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  i\hbar \frac{d |\Psi(t)\rangle}{d t} = \hat{H}|\Psi(t)\rangle "/></p>
<p>To arrive at the challenge gradually, I first omitted the quantum <em>ket</em> notation, the hat on <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H}"/>, and the dependence on <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/>. I wrote partial derivatives and lowercase <img alt="{\psi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi}"/>. Thus what I first tried to handwrite was: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = H\psi " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++i%5Chbar+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cpsi%7D%7B%5Cpartial+t%7D+%3D+H%5Cpsi+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = H\psi "/></p>
<p>The system jumped on my handwriting right away and I won’t report the results except to say it looked like Dada art with math symbols. One can, however, do a drawing in Paint or similar app and upload it. So I drew</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodingerdrawing/" rel="attachment wp-att-17315"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17315" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodingerdrawing.png?w=600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
and obtained</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodingerrendered/" rel="attachment wp-att-17316"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17316" height="260" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodingerrendered.jpg?w=360&amp;h=260" width="360"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
The ten cards returned (one is below the snip) have some wild but inspired associations. Handwriting Wikipedia’s form as given did not produce better results. However, I realized I could snip what appears on Wikipedia and upload that:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodingersnip/" rel="attachment wp-att-17317"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17317" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodingersnip.jpg?w=600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
The result was a ghostly evocation of the equation, with LaTeX to boot:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodingerdada/" rel="attachment wp-att-17318"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17318" height="78" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodingerdada.jpg?w=540&amp;h=78" width="540"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
The LaTeX output reminded me that I could enter Schrödinger’s equation in LaTeX and remove all doubt. I did the short form first. Would the system recognize it?</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodinger1/" rel="attachment wp-att-17319"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17319" height="328" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodinger1.jpg?w=540&amp;h=328" width="540"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
The name <em>Schrödinger</em> popped up in the eighth card at bottom center, but not the form I had typed. It has an integral and no equals sign. Of greater note, the center card called up another giant of quantum mechanics and began with exactly the left-hand side I had typed. To its left came Wolfgang Pauli with another occurrence of <img alt="{i\hbar}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%5Chbar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i\hbar}"/>. None of the output had the time variable <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/>, however, so I put it in:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodinger2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17320"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17320" height="349" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodinger2.jpg?w=540&amp;h=349" width="540"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Bingo—the card labeled simply <em>Schrödinger Equation</em> appears at upper center. Unlike Wikipedia’s version, it includes <b>r</b> standing for other coordinates and—hence—properly uses partial derivatives. Otherwise it is exactly what my search intended to summon.</p>
<p>
I felt the real reward came in the other cards. I did not know that Hubble’s law had such a simple statement. I knew quantum mechanics takes glory in symmetries, of course, but did not know what equation would bear the definitive moniker, “Symmetry in Quantum Mechanics.” I remember as a child the fun of unstructured time in libraries where the physical card catalog was sorted by theme and one could browse adjacent ideas, as also on the shelves. </p>
<p>
Now I put in the ket notation, the hat to make <img alt="{\hat{H}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Chat%7BH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\hat{H}}"/>, and the uppercase <img alt="{\Psi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Psi}"/>. The latter two changes evidently moved the <em>Schrödinger Equation</em> card to the top of the deck, with <em>Pauli Equation</em> moving up behind it, but other cards completely changed:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodinger3/" rel="attachment wp-att-17321"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17321" height="349" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodinger3.jpg?w=540&amp;h=349" width="540"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
I had not known the term <em>Einselection</em>. Finally, I decided to wipe the canvas and simply enter <img alt="{H\Psi = E\Psi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%5CPsi+%3D+E%5CPsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H\Psi = E\Psi}"/> as the minimalist form of Schrödinger’s equation. I’ll leave you to see what the system comes up with on your own fresh canvas.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Search and Research </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The goal is to augment search that includes equations as well as text. For instance, right now I’d like to find sources that use a formula like </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\frac{r^2}{e^{ar}} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Br%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%5Cfrac%7Br%5E2%7D%7Be%5E%7Bar%7D%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\frac{r^2}{e^{ar}} "/></p>
<p>in the context of statistical tests for distinguishing between distributions. I’ve had success with Google on smaller pieces of TeX but this chunk yields nothing sensible. Changing the variable “<img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>” to “<img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>” changes some of the results but comes no closer; nor does changing to <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/> or editing the sum to begin with <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> not <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>. The search should somehow recognize that <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a}"/> is a constant but is also the main parameter.</p>
<p>
The fact that I’ve typed a particular LaTeX form might be an impediment. I could have written <img alt="{r^2 e^{-ar}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%5E2+e%5E%7B-ar%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r^2 e^{-ar}}"/> in the body of the sum without using a fraction. The <em>MathDeck</em> documentation focuses on enabling mathematical search for non-LaTeX users, but independence from syntax for all users is a commensurate goal. The idea is to make formulas “chunks” in their own right, chunks governed by semantics more than syntax, and promote saving and recombining them. For instance, I could save the body and replace the sum by an integral. </p>
<p>
The visual unit for this in <em>MathDeck</em> is the blue oval enclosing a formula. They can be created and edited at the top, imported to make a new <em>card</em>, and combined onto the canvas to build up larger formulas. The paper calls them “chips” but for me they evoke hieroglyphic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartouche">cartouches</a> enclosing royal names. Cards can be marked as favorites and the collection added to. </p>
<p>
Here is an example where I made a cartouche and card out of the abstract form of the main equation in my chess model, as I expounded in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/london-calling/">post</a> to mark the 2018 world chess championship match in London.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/chessequation/" rel="attachment wp-att-17324"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17324" height="368" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/chessequation.jpg?w=600&amp;h=368" width="600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Once again the system pitches in with interesting associations. Some were expected but others are surprises. Logit and logarithmic loss are naturally associated but I had not heard of “Perplexity,” and what is Benford’s Law doing here? (Dick and I have been trying to find natural <em>exceptions</em> to Benford’s Law in Covid-19 statistics—we’ve not had time yet to tell whether we’ll succeed.)</p>
<p>
The searches at top are still “vanilla” Google search, and the search below the canvas is only within a deck or decks. We look forward to when a truly smart integration of mathematics into major search engines will be engendered by this project.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
How do you see <em>MathDeck</em> and the larger <em>MathSeer</em> project growing in the near future? We hope <em>MathDeck</em> stokes some immediate enjoyment and curiosity.</p>

    <title>Polynomial Secret Sharing and the Lagrange Basis</title>
    <summary>In this post, we highlight an amazing result: Shamir’s secret sharing scheme. This is one of the most powerful uses of polynomials over a finite field in distributed computing. Intuitively, this scheme allows a $Dealer$ to commit to a secret $s$ by splitting it into shares distributed to $n$ parties....</summary>

<p><strong>Call for Papers:</strong> Registration deadline August 12, 2020</p>



<p>3rd SIAM <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/sosa21">Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms </a> (SOSA)<br/>January 11-12, 2021<br/>Alexandria, Virginia, U.S.<br/>(Held jointly with SODA 2021)<br/><br/>Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA) is a conference in theoretical computer science dedicated to advancing algorithms research by promoting simplicity and elegance in the design and analysis of algorithms. The benefits of simplicity are manifold: simpler algorithms manifest a better understanding of the problem at hand; they are more likely to be implemented and trusted by practitioners; they can serve as benchmarks, as an initialization step, or as the basis for a “state of the art” algorithm;  they are more easily taught and are more likely to be included in algorithms textbooks; and they attract a broader set of researchers to difficult algorithmic problems.<br/><br/>Papers in all areas of algorithms research are sought.  An ideal submission will advance our understanding of an algorithmic problem by, for example, introducing a simpler algorithm, presenting a simpler analysis of an existing algorithm, or offering insights that generally simplify our understanding of important algorithms or computational problems.<br/><br/>We are especially interested in papers that make material more accessible to a wider audience, such as undergraduates, or for more specialized topics, general algorithms researchers.<br/><br/>Submissions should contain novel ideas or attractive insights, but they are not expected to prove novel theorems. That is, the results themselves can be known, but their presentation must be new.

    <title>Trust models, and notions of privacy</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There exist various notions of differential privacy which, while sharing a common core, differ in some key specific aspects. Broadly speaking, vary among a few main axes, such as the type of guarantee they provide, the specific similarity between data they consider, and the trust model they aim to address. This last point will be the focus of this post: <em>which notion of privacy is best suited to the specific scenario at hand?</em></p>

<p>We will cover 4 of these notions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>(central) differential privacy (DP)</li>
  <li>local differential privacy (LDP)</li>
  <li>pan-privacy</li>
  <li>shuffle privacy</li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, the world can be divided in a few categories: (i) the users, who hold the data; (ii) the “server,” who runs the algorithm; and (iii) the rest of the world, which does what the rest of the world does. As the name indicates, the <em>trust model</em> boils down to the following simple question: as a user, <strong>who do you trust</strong> with your sensitive data?</p>

<p>In the <em>DP model</em> <strong>[DMNS06]</strong>, the answer is essentially “the server, and nobody else.” Users are happy to provide their data to the server, which runs the algorithm on the resulting dataset; however, the <em>output</em> of that algorithm, which is released to the (untrusted) world, needs to be private, and not reveal sensitive information about any single user.</p>

<p>In the <em>LDP model</em> <strong>[EGS03,KLNRS08]</strong>, the server itself is untrusted, and the answer is “nobody.” Any data communicated by the users must already be private, and even a prying server cannot learn much about any single user. Of course, this is a strictly more stringent privacy model than the central DP one, and this comes at a price: the utility one can obtain from the same amount of data is typically smaller than in the DP model.</p>

<p>The <em>pan-privacy model</em> <strong>[DNPRY10]</strong> introduces the notion of time. Each user contributes their data to the server sequentially, one after the other; once the server is done receiving and processing this data, the output is revealed to the world. The answer to the question then is that users trust the server <em>at the time they send it their data</em>, but maybe not in the future (and they <em>definitely</em> don’t trust the outside world). Put differently, this captures settings where a server can be compromised: at the time a  user sends their data, they trust the server; if the server is compromised at any point in the future, then the data already in the server <em>stays</em> private (but, of course, sending any more data after the server has already been attacked is a bad idea).</p>

<p>Finally, the recent <em>shuffle model</em> of privacy <strong>[CSUZZ19,EFMRTT19]</strong> is in some sense intermediate between the central and local models of DP: users do not trust the server (and, god forbid, they still don’t trust the outside world!); however, they do trust some small blackbox in the middle, whose role is to randomly, well, <em>shuffle</em> the data. That is, when all users send their data to the untrusted server, this box-in-the-middle randomly permutes all the data points, so that the server had no idea who sent which part of the data. This simple-yet-helpful trusted backbox, in turn, can be implemented using e.g., cryptographic primitives; and the goal is to try and provide stronger privacy than in the DP model, while suffering a smaller utility loss than in the stringent LDP model.</p>

<p>It is important to note that <em>there is no right or wrong model</em> of privacy here, and one cannot say that any of the above notion is “better” than the others with regard to both privacy and accuracy. They all aim at modeling different scenarios, and provide incomparable guarantees: depending on your situation, pick the one that fits best.</p>

    <title>Comparing multi-sport athletes using bounding-box area</title>
    <summary>Where you have a triangle center defined by the intersection point of three lines or curves, you often also have a Voronoi diagram or minimization diagram whose cells have those lines as boundaries. For the circumcenter, equidistant from the three vertices of a triangle, the diagram is the classical Voronoi diagram of those three points. For the incenter, equidistant from the three sides, the diagram is the medial axis of the triangle. The Fermat point (when it doesn’t degenerate to a vertex) comes from a diagram that tells you which of the three sides of the triangle spans the widest field of view.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Where you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_center">triangle center</a> defined by the intersection point of three lines or curves, you often also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> or minimization diagram whose cells have those lines as boundaries.

<p>So when I posted recently about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/04/28/cartesian-triangle-centers.html">Cartesian triangle centers</a> defined by an equality of areas of three bounding boxes, I had in mind a minimization diagram for bounding box area, or actually the signed area  of the bounding box of the moving point  and a fixed site . Here’s one of these diagrams for six points:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Minimization diagram for signed bounding box area" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/bounding-box-diagram.svg"/></p>

<p>If you subtract  from the signed areas, you don’t change the minimization diagram (because you’re subtracting the same thing from all the signed areas) but it makes the functions you’re minimizing become linear in  and , explaining the polygonal shape and linear boundaries of the cells in the minimization diagram. As the previous post already described, the bisector between any two cells is the diagonal line of the bounding box of two sites.</p>

<p>I use these diagrams in a paper to appear in the Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry, now online as a preprint: “Dynamic products of ranks” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08123">arXiv:2007.08123</a>). The goal of the paper is to combine two different and unrelated numerical scores of the same items such as the skiing speed and shooting accuracy of a group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon">biathletes</a>. Biathlons do this by using an arbitrary conversion factor to penalize skiing time based on shooting misses (essentially, adding the converted scores from the two parts of the sport) but instead some other sports multiply the ranks of the athletes within each discipline. So if you got, say, fifth in shooting but second in skiing, your overall score would be ten. My paper studies how quickly you can find the new winner after changing the score of a single competitor or by adding or removing a competitor in a sport using this system.</p>

<p>We can represent a set of items or group of athletes as points in the plane, whose coordinates are their ranks (not their raw scores). Then an update to the data that lies outside both the horizontal and vertical range of these points doesn’t change their relative positions: it might change their ranks, but all in the same way. So for these updates, the signed bounding box area minimization diagram stays unchanged. Because the bounding box area is just the product of ranks, we can use this diagram to quickly look up the winner among these shifted points. The overall strategy of the data structure in my paper is to divide the input data into smaller subsets and maintain their diagrams in such a way that most diagrams stay unchanged, and only a few need rebuilding, after each update. Dividing into more subsets reduces the rebuilding time, because fewer input items will belong to rebuilt diagrams, but increases the query time, because you have to query more diagrams. The  update time for the data structure in the paper comes from choosing the optimal tradeoff between these two terms of the total time.</p>

<p>There are other applications for this sort of rank aggregation beyond athletics; see the paper for details.</p>

<p>Because CCCG is online this year, I also have a video talk prepared, but it’s not yet online; I’ll post a link later. In the meantime, <a href="http://vga.usask.ca/cccg2020/">registration for CCCG is free this year, with a deadline of July 25</a>, and enables both early access to the videos and access to the Q&amp;A sessions with each speaker at the conference itself.</p>

    <summary>An $(n,r,s)$-design, or $(n,r,s)$-partial Steiner system, is an $r$-uniform hypergraph over $n$ vertices with pairwise hyperedge intersections of size $0$, we extract from $(N,K,n,k)$-adversarial sources of locality $0$, where $K\geq N^\delta$ and $k\geq\text{polylog }n$. The previous best result (Chattopadhyay et al., STOC 2020) required $K\geq N^{1/2+o(1)}$. As a result, we get extractors for small-space sources over $n$ bits with entropy requirement $k\geq n^{1/2+\delta}$, whereas the previous best result (Chattopadhyay et al., STOC 2020) required $k\geq n^{2/3+\delta}$.</summary>

	Zoë Bell</title>
    <summary>We show that is hard to find regular or even ordered (also known as Davis-Putnam) Resolution proofs, extending the breakthrough result for general Resolution from Atserias and Müller to these restricted forms. Namely, regular and ordered Resolution are automatable if and only if P = NP. Specifically, for a CNF formula $F$ the problem of distinguishing between the existence of a polynomial-size ordered Resolution refutation of $F$ and an at least exponential-size general Resolution proof being required to refute $F$ is NP-complete.</summary>

    <title>There are none</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2020/07/08/gain-margin/">last post</a>, we showed that continuous-time LQR has “natural robustness” insofar as the optimal solution is robust to a variety of model-mismatch conditions. LQR makes the assumption that the state of the system is fully, perfectly observed. In many situations, we don’t have access to such perfect state information. What changes?</p>

<p>The generalization of LQR to the case with imperfect state observation is called “Linear Quadratic Gaussian” control (LQG). This is the simplest, special case of a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We again assume linear dynamics:</p>



<p>where the state is now corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian noise, $w_t$. Instead of measuring the state $x_t$ directly, we instead  measure a signal $y_t$ of the form</p>



<p>Here, $v_t$ is also zero-mean Gaussian noise. Suppose we’d still like to minimize a quadratic cost function</p>



<p>This problem is very similar to our LQR problem except for the fact that we get an indirect measurement of the state and need to apply some sort of <em>filtering</em> of the $y_t$ signal to estimate $x_t$.</p>

<p>The optimal solution for LQG is strikingly elegant. Since the observation of $x_t$ is through a Gaussian process, the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm has a clean, closed form solution, even in continuous time. Our best estimate for $x_t$, denoted $\hat{x}_t$, given all of the data observed up to time $t$ obeys a differential equation</p>



<p>The matrix $L$ that can be found by solving an algebraic Riccati equation that depends on the variance of $v_t$ and $w_t$ and on the matrices $A$ and $C$. In particular, it’s the CARE with data $(A^\top,C^\top,\Sigma_w,\Sigma_v)$. This solution is called a <em>Kalman Filter</em> and is a continuous limit of the discrete time Kalman Filter one might see in a course on graphical models.</p>

<p>The optimal LQG solution takes the estimate of the Kalman Filter, $\hat{x}_t$, and sets the control signal to be</p>



<p>Here, $K$ is gain matrix that would be used to solve the LQR problem with data $(A,B,Q,R)$. That is, LQG performs optimal filtering to compute the best state estimate, and then computes a feedback policy as if this estimate was a noiseless measurement of the state. That this turns out to be optimal is one of the more amazing results in control theory. It decouples the process of designing an optimal filter from designing an optimal controller, enabling simplicity and modularity in control design. This decoupling where we treat the output of our state estimator as the true state is an example of <em>certainty equivalence</em>, the umbrella term for using point estimates of stochastic quantities as if they were the correct value. Though certainty equivalent control may be suboptimal in general, it remains ubiquitous for all of the benefits it brings as a design paradigm. Unfortunately, not only is this decoupled design of filters and controllers often suboptimal, it has many hidden fragilities. LQG highlights a particular scenario where certainty equivalent control leads to misplaced optimism about robustness.</p>

<p>We saw in the previous post that LQR had this amazing robustness property: even if you optimize with the wrong model, you’ll still probably be OK. Is the same true about LQG? What are the guaranteed stability margins for LQG regulators? The answer was succinctly summed up in the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1101812">abstract of a 1978 paper by John Doyle</a>: “There are none.”</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="There Are None" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/there_are_none.png" width="400px"/></p>

<p>What goes wrong? Doyle came up with a simple counterexample, that I’m going to simplify even further for the purpose of contextualizing in our modern discussion. Before presenting the example, let’s first dive into <em>why</em> LQG is likely less robust than LQR. Let’s assume that the true dynamics obeys the ODE:</p>



<p>though we computed the optimal controller with the matrix $B$. Define an error signal, $e_t = x_t - \hat{x}_t$, that measures the current deviation between the actual state and the estimate. Then, using the fact that $u_t = -K \hat{x}_t$, we get the closed loop dynamics</p>



<p>When $B=B_\star$, the bottom left block is equal to zero. The system is then stable provided $A-BK$ and $A-LC$ are both stable matrices (i.e., have eigenvalues in the left half plane). However, small perturbations in the off-diagonal block can make the matrix unstable. For intuition, consider the matrix</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of this matrix are $-1$ and $-2$, so the matrix is clearly stable. But the matrix</p>



<p>has an eigenvalue greater than zero if $t&gt;0.01$. So a tiny perturbation significantly shifts the eigenvalues and makes the matrix unstable.</p>

<p>Similar things happen in LQG. In Doyle’s example he uses the problem instance:</p>







<p>The open loop system here is unstable, having two eigenvalues at $1$. We can stabilize the system only by modifying the second state. The state disturbance is aligned along the $[1;1]$ direction, and the state cost only penalizes states aligned with this disturbance. So the goal is simply to remove as much signal as possible in the $[1;1]$ direction without using too much control authority. We only are able to measure the first component of the state, and this measurement is corrupted by Gaussian noise.</p>

<p>What does the optimal policy look like? Perhaps unsurprisingly, it focuses all of its energy on ensuring that there is little state signal along the disturbance direction. The optimal $K$ and $L$ matrices are</p>



<p>Now what happens when we have model mismatch? If we set $B_\star=tB$ and use the formula for the closed loop above, we see that closed loop state transition matrix is</p>



<p>It’s straight forward to check that when $t=1$ (i.e., no model mismatch), the eigenvalues of  $A-BK$ and $A-LC$ all have negative real parts. For the full closed loop matrix, analytically computing the eigenvalues themselves is a pain, but we can prove instability by looking at the characteristic polynomial. For a matrix to have all of its eigenvalues in the left half plane, its characteristic polynomial necessarily must have all positive coefficients. If we look at the linear term in the polynomial, we see that we must have</p>



<p>if we’d like any hope of having a stable system. Hence, we can guarantee that this closed loop system is unstable if $t\geq 1+\sigma$. This is a very conservative condition, and we could get a tighter bound if we’d like, but it’s good enough to reveal some paradoxical properties of LQG. The most striking is that if we build a sensor that gives us a better and better measurement, our system becomes more and more fragile to perturbation and model mismatch. For machine learning scientists, this seems to go against all of our training. How can a system become <em>less</em> robust if we improve our sensing and estimation?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the example in more detail to get some intuition for what’s happening. When the sensor noise gets small, the optimal Kalman Filter is more aggressive. If the model is true, then the disturbance has equal value in both states, so, when $\sigma$ is small, the filter can effectively just set the value of the second state to be equal to whatever is in the first state. The filter is effectively deciding that the first state should equal the observation $y_t$, and the second state should be equal to the first state. In other words, it rapidly damps any errors in the disturbance direction $[1;1]$ and, as $d$ increases, it damps the $[0;1]$ direction less. When $t \neq 1$, we are effectively introducing a disturbance that makes the two states unequal. That is, $B-B_\star$ is aligned in the $[0;1]$ and can be treated as a disturbance signal. This undamped component of the error is fed errors from the state estimate $\hat{x}$, and these errors compound each other. Since we spend so much time focusing on our control along the direction of the injected state noise, we become highly susceptible to errors in a different direction and these are the exact errors that occur when there is a gain mismatch between the model and reality.</p>

<p>The fragility of LQG has many takeaways. It highlights that noiseless state measurement can be a dangerous modeling assumption, because it is then optimal to trust our model too much. Though we apparently got a freebie with LQR, for LQG, model mismatch must be explicitly accounted for when designing the controller.</p>

<p>This should be a cautionary tale for modern AI systems. Most of the papers I read in reinforcement learning consider MDPs where we get perfect state measurement. Building an entire field around optimal actions with perfect state observation builds too much optimism. Any realistic scenario is going to have partial state observation, and such problems are much thornier.</p>

<p>A second lesson is that it is not enough to just improve the prediction components in feedback systems that are powered by machine learning. I have spoken with many applied machine learning engineers who have told me that they have seen performance degrade in production systems when they improve their prediction model. They might spend months building some state of the art LSTM mumbo jumbo that is orders of magnitude more accurate in prediction, but in production yields worse performance than the legacy system with a boring ARMA model. It is quite possible that these performance drops are due to the Doyle effect: the improved prediction system is increasing sensitivity to a modeling flaw in some other part of the engineering pipeline.</p>

<p>The story turns out to be even worse than what I have described thus far. The supposed robustness guarantees we derived for LQR assume not just full noiseless state measurement, but that the sensors and actuators have infinite bandwidth. That is, they assume you can build controllers $K$ with arbitrarily large entries and that react instantaneously, without delay, to changes in the state. In the next post, I’ll show how realistic sampled data controllers for LQR, even with noiseless state measurement, also have no guarantees.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we continue our investigation of gradient flows for wide two-layer “relu” neural networks. In the <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-neural-networks-global-convergence/">previous post</a>, Francis explained that under suitable assumptions these dynamics converge to global minimizers of the training objective. Today, we build on this to understand qualitative aspects of the predictor learnt by such neural networks.

<h2>1. Generalization with weight decay regularization</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start our journey with the comfortable case where the training objective includes an explicit <em>weight decay</em> regularization (i.e. \(\ell_2\)-regularization on the parameters). Using the notations of the previous post, this consists in the following objective function on the space of probability measures on \(\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\):  $$ \underbrace{R\Big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Phi(w)d\mu(w)\Big)}_{\text{Data fitting term}} + \underbrace{\frac{\lambda}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Vert w \Vert^2_2d\mu(w)}_{\text{Regularization}} \tag{1}$$ where \(R\) is the loss and \(\lambda&gt;0\) is the regularization strength. Remember that a  neural network of finite width with \(m\) neurons is recovered with an empirical measure \(\mu = \frac1m \sum_{j=1}^m\delta_{w_j}\), in which case this regularization is proportional to the sum of the squares of all the parameters \(\frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^m \Vert w_j\Vert^2_2\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Variation norm.</strong> In the previous post, we have seen that the Wasserstein gradient flow of this objective function — an idealization of the gradient descent training dynamics in the large width limit — converges to a global minimizer \(\mu^*\) when initialized properly. An example of an admissible initialization is the hidden weights \(b_j\) distributed according to the uniform distribution \(\tau\) on the unit sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\subset \mathbb{R}^d\) and the output weights \(a_j\) uniform in \(\{-1,1\}\). What does this minimizer look like in predictor space when the objective function is as in Eq. (1) ? </p>



<p class="justify-text">To answer this question, we define for a predictor \(h:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}\), the quantity $$ \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} := \min_{\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})} \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Vert w\Vert^2_2 d\mu(w) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad h = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Phi(w)d\mu(w).\tag{2} $$ As the notation suggests, \(\Vert \cdot \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1}\) is a norm in the space of predictors. It is known as the <em>variation norm</em> [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cas.cz/~vera/publications/journals/I3Edin.pdf">3</a>]. We call \(\mathcal{F}_1\) the space of functions with finite norm, which is a Banach space. By construction, the learnt predictor \(h^* = \int \Phi(w)d\mu^*(w)\) is a minimizer of the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-regularized regression: $$ \min_{h:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}} R(h) + \lambda \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \tag{3}.$$ This \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-norm regularization shares similarity with \(\ell_1\) regularization [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6614.pdf">4</a>]. To see this, observe that the “magnitude” \(\vert a\vert \Vert b\Vert_2\) of a relu function \(x\mapsto a(b^\top x)_+\) with parameter \(w=(a,b)\) equals \(\Vert w\Vert^2_2/2\) if \(\vert a\vert = \Vert b\Vert_2\) and is smaller otherwise. Thus parameterizing the relus by their direction \(\theta = b/\Vert b\Vert_2\) and optimizing over their signed magnitude \(r(\theta) = a\Vert b\Vert_2\)  we have $$ \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} = \inf_{r:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to \mathbb{R}} \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} \vert r(\theta)\vert d\tau(\theta) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad h(x) = \int _{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} r(\theta) (\theta^\top x)_+ d\tau(\theta).\tag{4}$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Conjugate RKHS norm.</strong> The regression in the space \(\mathcal{F}_1\) is best understood when compared with the regression obtained by only training the output weights. We consider the same training dynamics with weight decay except that we fix the hidden weights to their initial value, where they are distributed according to the uniform distribution \(\tau\) on the sphere. In that case, the Wasserstein gradient flow also converges to the solution of a regularized regression as in Eq. (3) — this is in fact a convex problem —  but the regularizing norm is different and now defined as $$ \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_2}^2 := \min_{r:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to \mathbb{R}} \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} \vert r(\theta)\vert^2 d\tau(\theta) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad h(x) = \int _{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} r(\theta) (\theta^\top x)_+ d\tau(\theta).$$ We call \(\mathcal{F}_2\) the set of functions with finite norm. It can be shown to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space">Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</a> (RKHS), with kernel  $$ K(x,x’) = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (\theta^\top x)_+ (\theta^\top x’)_+ d\tau(\theta),$$ which has a closed form expression [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3628-kernel-methods-for-deep-learning.pdf">5</a>]. In this context, taking a finite width neural network corresponds to a random feature approximation of the kernel [<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.446.9306&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">6</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines">7</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Let us informally compare the properties of these spaces \(\mathcal{F}_1\) and \(\mathcal{F}_2\) (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8690">2</a>] for details):</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Approximation power.</strong> In high dimension, only very smooth functions have small \(\mathcal{F}_2\)-norm (in rough terms, the \(\lceil (d+3)/2\rceil\) first derivatives should be small). In contrast, there exists non-smooth functions with small \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-norm, an example being the relu function \(x\mapsto (\theta^\top x)_+\). Remarkably, if we define \(f(x)=g(Ux)\) where \(U\) is an orthogonal projection then \(\Vert f\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \leq  \Vert g\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_2}\). This shows in particular that \(\mathcal{F}_1\) contains \(\mathcal{F}_2\) and that \(\mathcal{F}_1\) is <em>adaptive</em> to lower dimensional structures.</li><li><strong>Statistical complexity.</strong> It could be feared that the good approximation properties of \(\mathcal{F}_1\) come at the price of being “too large” as a hypothesis space, making it difficult to estimate a predictor in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) from few samples. But, as measured by their Rademacher complexities, the unit ball of \(\mathcal{F}_1\) is only \(O(\sqrt{d})\) larger than that of \(\mathcal{F}_2\). By going from \(\mathcal{F}_2\) to \(\mathcal{F}_1\), we thus add some nicely structured predictors to our hypothesis space, but not too much garbage that could fit unstructured noise.</li><li><strong>Generalization guarantees.</strong> By combining the two previous points, it is possible to prove that supervised learning in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) breaks the curse of dimensionality when the output depends on a lower dimensional projection of the input: the required number of training samples only depends mildly on the dimension \(d\).</li><li><strong>Optimization guarantees.</strong> However \(\mathcal{F}_1\) has a strong drawback : there is no known algorithm that solves the problem of Eq. (3) in polynomial time. On practical problems, gradient descent seems to behave well, but in general only qualitative results such as presented in the previous post are known. In contrast, various provably efficient algorithms can solve regression in \(\mathcal{F}_2\), which is a classical kernel ridge regression problem [Chap. 14.4.3, <a href="https://doc.lagout.org/science/Artificial%20Intelligence/Machine%20learning/Machine%20Learning_%20A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective%20%5BMurphy%202012-08-24%5D.pdf">8</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In the plot below, we compare the predictor learnt by gradient descent for a 2-D regression with the square loss and weight decay, after training (a) both layers — which is regression in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) — or (b) just the output layer — which is regression in \(\mathcal{F}_2\). This already illustrates some distinctive features of both spaces, although the differences become more stringent in higher dimensions. In particular, observe that in (a) the predictor is the combination of few relu functions, which illustrates  the sparsifying effect of the \(L^1\)-norm in Eq. (4). To simplify notations, we do not include a bias/intercept in the formulas but our numerical experiments include it, so in this plot the input is of the form \(x=(x_1,x_2,1)\) and \(d=3\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4231" height="293" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/regularized-2.png" width="564"/>Predictor learnt by the gradient flow on the square loss with weight decay, when training (a) both layers (b) only the output layer.

<p class="justify-text">The qualitative picture is quite clear so far, but something is a bit unsettling: weight decay is often not needed to obtain a good performance in practice. Our line of reasoning however completely falls apart without such a regularization: if the objective function depends on the predictor only via its values on the training set, being a minimizer does not guarantee anything about generalization outside of the training set (remember that wide relu neural networks are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem">universal approximators</a>). Why does it still work in the unregularized case? There must be something in the algorithm…</p>



<h2>2. Implicit bias: linear classification</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This something is called the <em>implicit bias</em> : when there are several minimizers, the optimization algorithm makes a specific choice. In the unregularized case, the “quality” of this choice is a crucial property of an algorithm; much more crucial than, say, its convergence speed on the training objective. To gradually build our intuition of the implicit bias of gradient flows, let us put neural networks aside for a moment and consider, following Soudry, Hoffer, Nacson, Gunasekar and Srebro [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume19/18-188/18-188.pdf">9</a>], a linear classification task.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Gradient flow of the smooth-margin.</strong> Let \((x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n\) be a training set of \(n\) pairs of inputs \(x_i\in \mathbb{R}^d\) and outputs \(y_i\in \{-1,1\}\) and let us choose the exponential loss. The analysis that follows also apply to the logistic loss (which is the same as the cross-entropy loss after a sigmoid non-linearity) because only the “tail” of the loss matters, but it is more straightforward with the exponential loss. In order to give a natural “scale” to the problem, we  renormalize the empirical risk by taking minus its logarithm and consider the concave objective $$ F_\beta(a) = -\frac{1}{\beta}\log\Big( \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n \exp(-\beta y_i \ x_i^\top a) \Big).\tag{5}$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Here \(\beta&gt;0\) is a parameter that will be useful in a moment. For now, we take \(\beta=1\) and we note \(F(a)=F_1(a)\).  In this context, the <em>margin</em> of a vector \(a\in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the quantity \(\min_{i} y_i\ x_i^\top a\) which quantifies how far this linear predictor is from making a wrong prediction on the training set.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4274" height="386" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/max_margin-4.png" width="453"/>The margin of the linear predictor \(x \mapsto a^\top x\) with parameters \(a \in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}\) is the smallest distance of a training point to the decision boundary. We show here the max-margin predictor.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Obtained via simple manipulations, the inequalities  $$ \min_i y_i\ x_i^\top a \leq F_\beta(a) \leq \min_i y_i\ x_i^\top a +\frac{\log(n)}{\beta}, \tag{6}$$ suggest to call \(F_\beta\) the <em>smooth-margin</em> because, well, it is smooth and converges to the margin \(F_\infty(a) := \min_i y_i x_i^\top a\) as \(\beta\to \infty\). Let us look at the gradient flow in the ascent direction that maximizes the smooth-margin: $$ a'(t) = \nabla F(a(t))$$ initialized with \(a(0)=0\) (here the initialization does not matter so much). The path followed by this gradient flow is exactly the same as the gradient flow on the empirical risk: taking the logarithm only changes the time parameterization or, in practice, the step-size.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence to the max-margin.</strong> Assume that the data set is linearly separable, which means that the \(\ell_2\)-max-margin $$ \gamma := \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2 \leq 1} \min_i y_i x_i^\top a$$ is positive. In this case \(F\) is unbounded (indeed \(\lim_{\alpha \to \infty} F(\alpha a) =\infty\) whenever \(a\)  has a positive margin) and thus \(a(t)\) diverges. This is not an issue as such, since for classification, only the sign of the prediction matters.  This just means that the relevant question is not “where does \(a(t)\) converge?” but rather “towards which direction does it diverge?”. In other words, we are interested in the limit of \(\bar a(t):= a(t)/\Vert a(t)\Vert_2\) (in convex analysis, this is called the <em>cosmic limit</em> of \(a(t)\) [Chap. 3, <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540627722">10</a>], isn’t it beautiful ?).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The argument that follows is adapted from [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08246.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07300.pdf">12</a>] and can be traced back to [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/telgarsky13-supp.pdf">13</a>] for coordinate ascent. It can be shown by looking at the structure of the gradient (see the end of the blog post) that \(\Vert \nabla F(a)\Vert_2\geq \gamma\) for all \(a\in \mathbb{R}^d\). By the inequality of Eq. (6) and the gradient flow property \(\frac{d}{dt}F(a(t))=\Vert \nabla F(a(t))\Vert_2^2\), it follows $$\begin{aligned}\min_i y_i x_i^\top a(t) \geq F(a(t)) \  – \log(n) \geq \gamma \int_0^t \Vert \nabla F(a(s))\Vert_2ds -\log (n).\end{aligned}$$  For \(t&gt; \log(n)/\gamma^2\), this lower bound is positive. We can then divide the left-hand side by \(\Vert a(t)\Vert_2\) and the right-hand side by the larger quantity \(\int_0^t \Vert\nabla F(a(s))\Vert_2ds\), and we get $$\min_i y_i x_i^\top \bar a(t) \geq \gamma -\frac{\log(n)}{\int_0^t \Vert\nabla F(a(s))\Vert_2ds} \geq \gamma -\frac{\log(n)}{\gamma t}.$$ This shows that the margin of \(\bar a(t) := a(t)/\Vert a(t)\Vert_2\) converges to the \(\ell_2\)-max-margin at a rate \(\log(n)/\gamma t\). That’s it, the implicit bias of this gradient flow is exposed!</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stability to step-size choice.</strong> To translate this argument to discrete time, we need decreasing step-sizes of order \(1/\sqrt{t}\) which deteriorates the convergence rate to \(\tilde O(1/\sqrt{t})\), see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08246.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07300.pdf">12</a>]. In [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>], we proposed a different proof strategy (based on an online optimization interpretation of \(\bar a(t)\), as below) which recovers the same convergence rate \(O(1/\sqrt{t})\) with <em>exponentially larger</em> step-sizes. This suggests that these diverging trajectories are extremely robust to the choice of step-size.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration. </strong>In the figure below, we plot on the left the evolution of the parameter \(a(t)\) and on the right the predictor \(x\mapsto (x,1)^\top a(t)\) with \(x\in \mathbb{R}^2\). In parameter space, we apply the hyperbolic tangent to the radial component which allows to easily visualize diverging trajectories. This way, the unit sphere represents the <em>horizon</em> of \(\mathbb{R}^d\), i.e., the set of directions at infinity [Chap. 3 in <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540627722">9</a>]. We will use the same convention in the other plots below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4106" height="288" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/linear.gif" width="586"/>Implicit bias of gradient descent for a linear classification task with the exponential loss: (left) parameter space, (right) predictor space.</figure></div>



<h2>3. Implicit bias:  training only the output layer</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Despite its apparently restrictive setting, the previous result already tells us something about wide neural networks. Consider the situation touched upon earlier where we only train the output weights \(a_j\) and the hidden weights \(b_j\) are picked uniformly at random on the sphere. This corresponds to learning a linear classifier on top of the random feature \([(b_j^\top x)_+]_{j=1}^m\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">As we have just shown, if the training set is separable, the normalized gradient flow of the unregularized exponential loss (or logistic loss) converges to a solution to  $$ \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2 \leq 1}\min_i y_i \sum_{j=1}^m  a_j (b_j^\top x_i)_+.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">This is a random feature approximation for the unregularized kernel support vector machine problem in the RKHS \(\mathcal{F}_2\), which is recovered in the large width limit \(m\to \infty\):  $$\max_{\Vert h\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_2}\leq 1} \min_i y_i h(x_i).$$ Notice that if \(m\) is large enough, the linear separability assumption is not even needed anymore, because any training set is separable in \(\mathcal{F}_2\) (at least if all \(x_i\)s are distinct and if we do not forget to include the bias/intercept).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration.</strong> In the animation below, we plot on the left the evolution of the parameters and on the right the predictor for a 2-D classification task. In parameter space, each particle represents a neuron: their direction is fixed, their distance to \(0\) is their absolute weight and the color is red (+) or blue (-) depending on the sign of the weight. As above, the unit sphere is at infinity and the particles diverge. In predictor space, the markers represent the training samples of both classes, the color shows the predictor and the black line is the decision boundary. The fact that the predictor has a smooth decision boundary is in accordance with the properties of \(\mathcal{F}_2\) given above. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4275" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/film_output_comp-1.gif"/>Gradient descent on the output layer of a two-layer relu neural network with the exponential loss: (left) parameter space, (right) predictor space. <a href="https://github.com/lchizat/2020_implicitbias_blog/blob/master/exp_output.jl">[code]</a></figure></div>



<h2>4. Implicit bias: 2-homogeneous linear classifiers</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Although the analyses where neural networks behave like kernel methods are pleasant for us theoreticians because we are in conquered territory, they miss essential aspects of neural networks such as their adaptivity and their ability to learn a representation. Let us see if we can characterize the implicit bias of the gradient flow of the unregularized exponential loss when training <em>both</em> layers of the neural network.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>A 2-homogeneous linear model.</strong> From an optimization point of view, an important property of two layer relu neural networks is that \(\Phi(\alpha w)= \alpha^2 \Phi(w)\) for all \(\alpha&gt;0\), i.e., they are positively 2-homogeneous in the training parameters. In contrast, a linear model is 1-homogeneous in the parameters. This seemingly little difference leads to drastic changes in the gradient flow dynamics. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Let us again build our intuition with a simplified model that captures key aspects of the dynamics, namely the linear classification setting of above. This time, we take any initialization \(r(0)\in \mathbb{R}^d\) with positive entries and the gradient flow in the ascent direction of the function \( F(r\odot r)\) where \(\odot\) is the pointwise product between two vectors and \(F\) is defined in Eq. (5). This is just a trick to obtain a 2-homogeneous parameterization of a linear model. This gradient flow satisfies $$ r'(t) = 2 r(t)\odot \nabla F(r(t)\odot r(t)).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Normalized dynamics.</strong> Let us define \(\bar a(t):=(r(t)\odot r(t))/\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2\) the normalized predictor associated to our dynamics which, by definition, belongs to the simplex \(\Delta_d\), i.e., the set of nonnegative vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) that sum to one. Using the fact that \(\nabla F(\beta a) = \nabla F_\beta (a)\) for all \(\beta&gt;0\), we obtain $$\begin{aligned} \bar a'(t) &amp;= 2\frac{r(t)\odot r'(t)}{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2} -2 (r(t)^\top r'(t))\frac{r(t)\odot r(t)}{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^4}\\ &amp;=4\bar a(t) \odot \nabla F_{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2}(\bar a(t))\ – \alpha(t) \bar a(t)\end{aligned}$$ where \(\alpha(t)\) is the scalar such that \(\sum_{i=1}^d a’_i(t) =0\). Online optimization experts might have recognized that this is (continuous time) <em>online mirror ascent in the simplex</em> for the sequence of smooth-margin functions \(F_{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2}\). Notice in particular the multiplicative updates: they correspond to the entropy mirror function, and they are particularly well suited for optimization in the high dimensional simplex [Chap.4, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4980.pdf">14</a>].</p>



<p>What do we learn from this reformulation? </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>We can prove (by similar means) that if the data set is linearly separable then \(\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2\) diverges. So the sequence of functions \(F_{\Vert r\Vert_2^2}\) converges to the margin \(F_\infty\) which means that \(\bar a(t)\) just ends up optimizing the function \(F_\infty\). As a consequence, we have $$\lim_{t\to \infty} y_i x_i^\top \bar a(t) = \max_{a\in \Delta_d} \min_{i} y_i x_i^\top a.$$ This exposes another implicit bias of gradient flow. Notice the key difference with the implicit bias obtained with a linear parameterization: we obtain here the \(\ell_1\)-max-margin (over classifiers with non-negative entries) instead of the \(\ell_2\)-max-margin.  </li><li>Beyond exposing the implicit bias, this reformulation shows that \(\bar a(t)\) implicitly optimizes a sequence of smooth objectives which converge to the margin \(F_\infty\). Unknowingly, we have recovered the well-principled optimization method that consists in approximating a non-smooth objective with smooth functions [<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A_Files/Nesterov-2005.pdf">15</a>].</li><li>While the conclusion above was only formal, this point of view leads to rigorous proofs of convergence and convergence rates in discrete time in \(\tilde O(1/\sqrt{t})\) with a step-size in \(O(1/\sqrt{t})\), by  exploiting tools from online optimization, see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>].</li></ul>



<h2>5. Implicit bias: fully trained 2-layer neural networks</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Once again this argument about linear predictors applies to neural networks: if we train both layers but only the magnitude of the hidden weights and not their direction, then this is equivalent to learning a 2-homogeneous linear model on top of the random feature \([  a_j(0) (x_i^\top b_j(0))_+]_{j=1}^m\). If each feature appears twice with opposite signs — which is essentially the case in the large width limit — then the simplex constraint can be equivalently replaced by an \(\ell_1\)-norm constraint on the weights. Recalling the definition of the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-norm from Eq. (4), we thus obtain that, in the infinite-width limit, the normalized predictor converges to a solution to $$ \max_{\Vert h\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \leq 1} \min_i y_i h(x_i).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This result is correct, but it is not relevant. In contrast to functions in \(\mathcal{F}_2\), functions in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) <em>can not</em> in general be approximated with few <em>random</em> features in high dimension. In fact, lower bounds that are exponential in the dimension exist in certain settings [Sec. X, <a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/publications_files/UniversalApproximationBoundsForSuperpositionsOfASigmoidalFunction.pdf">16</a>]. They can be approximated with a small number of features but those need to be data-dependent: in that sense, it is necessary to learn a representation – here,  a distribution over the hidden weights — in order to learn in \(\mathcal{F}_1\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This raises the following question: do we obtain the same implicit bias when training both layers of the neural network, without fixing the direction of the input weights? In the following result, which is the main theorem of our paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04486">1</a>], we answer by the affirmative.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Theorem</strong> (C. and Bach [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04486">1</a>], informal). Assume that for some \(\sigma&gt;0\), the hidden weights \(b_j\) are initialized uniformly on the sphere of radius \(\sigma\) and the output weights \(a_j\) are uniform in \(\{-\sigma,\sigma\}\). Let \(\mu_t\) be the Wasserstein gradient flow for the unregularized exponential loss and \(h_t = \int \Phi(w)d\mu_t(w)\) be the corresponding dynamics in predictor space. Under some technical assumptions, the normalized predictor \(h_t/\Vert h_t\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1}\) converges to a solution to the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin problem: $$\max_{\Vert h\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \leq 1} \min_i y_i h(x_i).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Giving an idea of proof would be a bit too technical for this blog post, but let us make some remarks:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>The strength of this result is that although this dynamics could get trapped towards limit directions which are not optimal, this choice of initialization allows to avoid them all and to only converge to <em>global</em> minimizers of this max-margin problem. The principle behind this is similar to the global convergence result in the previous blog post. </li><li>The fact that optimizing on the direction of the hidden weights is compatible with the global optimality conditions of the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin problem is very specific to the structure of positively 2-homogeneous problems, and should not be taken for granted for other architectures of neural networks.</li><li>Although at a formal level this result works for any initialization that is diverse enough (such as the standard Gaussian initialization), the initialization proposed here yields dynamics with a better behavior for relu networks: by initializing the hidden and output weights with equal norms – a property preserved by the dynamics – we avoid some instabilities in the gradient. Also notice that this result applies to any scale \(\sigma&gt;0\) of the initialization (we’ll see an intriguing consequence of this in the next section).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration.</strong> In the figure below, we plot the training dynamics when both layers are trained. In parameter space (left), each particle represents a neuron: its position is \(\vert a_j\vert b_j\) and its color depends on the sign of \(a_j\).  Here again the unit sphere is at infinity. The inactive neurons at the bottom correspond to those with a bias that is “too negative” at initialization. We observe that all the other neurons gather into few clusters: this is the sparsifying effect of the \(L^1\)-norm in Eq. (4). In predictor space, we obtain a polygonal classifier, as expected for a \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin classifier. See the paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>] for experiments that illustrate the strengths of this classifier in terms of generalization.</p>

<h2>6. Lazy regime and the neural tangent kernel</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This blog post would not be complete without mentioning the <em>lazy regime</em>. This is yet another kind of implicit bias which, in our context, takes place when at initialization the weights have a large magnitude and the step-size is small. It was first exhibited in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8076-neural-tangent-kernel-convergence-and-generalization-in-neural-networks.pdf">17</a>] for deep neural networks.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lazy training via scaling.</strong> This phenomenon is in fact very general so let us present it with a generic parametric predictor \(h(W)\) with differential \(Dh(W)\). We introduce a scaling factor \(\alpha&gt;0\) and look at the gradient flow of \(F(W) := R(\alpha h(W))\) with a step-size \(1/\alpha^2\), that is $$ W'(t) = \ – \frac{1}{\alpha}Dh(W(t))^\top \nabla R(\alpha h(W(t))),$$ with initialization \(W(0)\). In terms of the predictor \(\alpha h(W)\), this yields the dynamics $$\frac{d}{dt} \alpha h(W(t)) = \ – Dh(W(t))Dh(W(t))^\top \nabla R(\alpha h(W(t)).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Lazy training [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07956.pdf">18</a>] happens when we take \(\alpha\) large while making sure that \(\alpha h(W(0))\) stays bounded. In this case, we see that the parameters change at a rate \(O(1/\alpha)\), while the predictor changes at a rate independent of \(\alpha\). On any bounded time interval, in the limit of  a large \(\alpha\), the parameters only move infinitesimally, while the predictor still makes significant progress, hence the name <em>lazy training</em>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Equivalent linear model.</strong> Since the parameters hardly move, if we assume that \(Dh(W(0))\neq 0\) then we can replace the map \(h\) by its linearization \(W \mapsto h(W(0))+Dh(W(0))(W-W(0))\). This means that the training dynamics essentially follows the gradient flow of the  objective $$ R\big ( \alpha h(W(0)) + \alpha Dh(W(0))(W-W(0)) \big)$$ which is a convex function of \(W\) as soon as \(R\) is convex.</p>



<p class="justify-text">If this objective admits a minimizer that is not too far away from \(W(0)\), then \(W(t)\) converges to this minimizer. If in contrast all  the minimizers are too far away (think of the exponential loss where they are at infinity), then the parameters will eventually move significantly and the lazy regime is just a transient regime in the early phase of training.  Of course, all these behaviors can be quantified and made more precise, because this phenomenon brings us back to the realm of linear models. </p>



<p class="justify-text">What all of this has to do with two-layer neural networks? As it happens, this scale factor appears implicit in various situations for these models; let us detail two of them. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Neural networks with \(1/\sqrt{m}\) scaling.</strong> For two-layer neural networks, lazy training occurs if we define \(h = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \sum_{j=1}^m \Phi(w_j)\) instead of \(h=\frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \Phi(w_j)\) before taking the infinite width limit. Indeed:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>This induces a scaling factor \(\alpha = \sqrt{m} \to \infty\) compared to \(1/m\) which, as we have already seen, is the “correct” scaling that leads to a non-degenerate dynamics in parameter space as \(m\) increases. </li><li>Moreover, by the central limit theorem,  \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \sum_{j=1}^m \Phi(w_j(0)) = O(1)\) for typical random initializations of the parameters. So the initial predictor stays bounded.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">To take the Wasserstein gradient flow limit, the step-size has to be of order \(m\) (see previous blog post). So here we should take a step-size of order \(m/\alpha^2 = 1\). With such a step-size, all the conditions for lazy training are gathered when \(m\) is large. Intuitively, each neuron only moves infinitesimally, but they collectively produce a significant movement in predictor space.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Neural networks with large initialization.</strong> Coming back to our scaling in \(1/m\) and our Wasserstein gradient flow that is obtained in the large width limit, there is another way to enter the lazy regime: by increasing the variance of the initialization. </p>



<p class="justify-text">To see this, assume that \(h\) is a positively \(p\)-homogeneous parametric predictor, which means that \(h(\sigma W)=\sigma^p h(W)\) for all \(\sigma&gt;0\) and some \(p&gt;1\) (remember that this is true with \(p=2\) for our two-layer relu neural network). Take an initialization of the form \(W(0) = \sigma \bar W_0\) where \(\sigma&gt;0\) and \(h(\bar W_0)=0\) (which is also satisfied for our infinite width neural networks with the initialization considered previously). Consider the gradient flow of \(R(h(W))\) with step-size \(\sigma^{2-2p}\).   By defining \(\bar W(t) = W(t)/\sigma\) and using the fact that the differential of a p-homogeneous function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function#Positive_homogeneity">is (p-1)-homogeneous</a>, we have, on the one hand $$ \bar W'(t) = -\sigma^{-p} Dh(\bar W(t))^\top \nabla R(\sigma^p h(\bar W(t))), $$ and on the other hand $$\frac{d}{dt} \sigma^p h(\bar W(t)) =\  – Dh(\bar W(t))Dh(\bar W(t))^\top \nabla R(\sigma^p h(\bar W(t))).$$ So in terms of the dynamics \(\bar W(t)\), the situation is exactly equivalent to having a scaling factor \(\alpha=\sigma^p\). This implies that as the magnitude \(\sigma\) of the initialization increases, we enter the lazy regime, provided the step-size is of order \(\sigma^{2-2p}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Neural tangent kernel. </strong>What does the lazy regime tell us about the learnt predictor for two-layer neural networks? Assuming for simplicity that the predictor at initialization is \(0\), this regime amounts to learning a linear model on top of the feature \([(b_j^\top x)_+]_{j=1}^m\) — the derivative with respect to the output weights — concatenated with the feature \([x a_j 1_{b_j^\top x &gt; 0} ]_{j=1}^m\)  — the derivative with respect to the input weights. Compared to training only the output layer, this thus simply adds some features. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Assume for concreteness, that at initialization the hidden weights \(b_j\) are uniform on a sphere of large radius \(\sigma&gt;0\) and the output weights are uniform on \(\{-\kappa\sigma, \kappa\sigma\}\) where \(\kappa\geq 0\). For a large width and a large \(\sigma\), we enter the lazy regime which amounts to learning in a RKHS — let us call it \(\mathcal{F}_{2,\kappa}\) — that is slightly different from \(\mathcal{F}_2 = \mathcal{F}_{2,0}\), since its kernel \(K_\kappa\) contains another term: $$ K_\kappa(x,x’) = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (\theta^\top x)_+ (\theta^\top x’)_+d\tau(\theta) + \kappa^2 \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (x^\top x’) 1_{\theta^\top x &gt; 0}1_{\theta^\top x’ &gt; 0}d\tau(\theta). $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This kernel is called the Neural Tangent Kernel [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8076-neural-tangent-kernel-convergence-and-generalization-in-neural-networks.pdf">17</a>] and the properties of the associated RKHS have been studied in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12191.pdf">19</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9449-on-the-inductive-bias-of-neural-tangent-kernels.pdf">20</a>], where it is shown to include functions that are slightly less smooth than those of \(\mathcal{F}_2\) when \(\kappa\) increases. This is illustrated in the plot below, obtained by training a wide neural network with \(\sigma\) large (to reach the lazy regime) on the square loss, and various values of \(\kappa\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4213" height="287" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/interp-4.png" width="574"/>1-D regression with a wide two-layer relu neural network (gradient descent on square loss, in the lazy regime) with 4 training samples (black dots). At initialization, output weights have \(\kappa\) times the (large) magnitude of the hidden weights. This implicitly solves kernel ridgeless regression for a kernel that depends on \(\kappa\). <a href="https://github.com/lchizat/2020_implicitbias_blog/blob/master/exp_NTK.jl">[code]</a></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Two implicit biases in one shot.</strong> The attentive reader might have noticed that for large initialization scale \(\sigma\gg 1\), when training both layers on the unregularized exponential loss, two of our analyses apply:  lazy training — that leads to a max-margin predictor in \(\mathcal{F}_{2,\kappa}\) — and the asymptotic implicit bias — that leads to a max-margin predictor in \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\).  So, where is the catch? </p>



<p class="justify-text">There is none! Since the minimizers of this loss are at infinity, the lazy regime is just a transient phase and we will observe both implicit biases along the training dynamics! Take a look at the video below: we observe that in early phases of training, the neurons do not move while learning a smooth classifier — this is the lazy regime and the classifier approaches the \(\mathcal{F}_{2,\kappa}\)-max-margin classifier. In later stages of training, the neurons start moving and the predictor converges to a \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin classifier as stated by the main theorem. The predictor jitters a little bit during training because I have chosen rather aggressive step-sizes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4219" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/film_lazy2sparse_ns_comp-1.gif"/>Training both layers with gradient descent for the unregularized exponential loss. The only difference with the previous video is that at initialization the variance \(\sigma^2\) is larger and the step-size smaller \(\approx \sigma^{-2}\). First the network learns a classifier in the lazy regime (a kernel max-margin classifier) and eventually converges to the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin classifier.</figure></div>



<h2>Discussion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I described how analyses of the training dynamics can help us understand the properties of the predictor learnt by neural networks even in the absence of an explicit regularization. Already for the simplest algorithm one can think of — gradient descent — we have found a variety of behaviors depending on the loss, the initialization or the step-size. </p>



<p class="justify-text">To achieve this description, the infinite width limit is of great help. It allows to obtain synthetic and precise characterizations of the learnt predictor, that can be used to derive generalization bounds. Yet, there are many interesting non-asymptotic effects caused by having a finite width.  In that sense, we were only concerned with the end of the curve of double descent [<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15849.full.pdf">21</a>].</p>

<h3>Lower bound on the gradient norm for linear classification with the exponential loss</h3>



<p class="justify-text">In the context of Section 2, we want to prove that \(\Vert \nabla F(a)\Vert_2\geq \gamma\).
