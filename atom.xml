	Md Lutfar Rahman, 

	Thomas Watson</title>
    <summary>In a STOC 1976 paper, Schaefer proved that it is PSPACE-complete to determine the winner of the so-called Maker-Breaker game on a given set system, even when every set has size at most 11. Since then, there has been no improvement on this result. We prove that the game remains PSPACE-complete even when every set has size 6.</summary>

<p>2020 sucks.</p>



<p>Yesterday I learned that <a href="https://www.cifar.ca/cifarnews/2020/06/18/a-quantum-festschrift-for-david-poulin">David Poulin</a>, a creative and widely-beloved quantum computing and information theorist, has died at age 43, of an aggressive brain cancer.  After studying under many of the field’s legends—Gilles Brassard, Wojciech Zurek, Ray Laflamme, Gerard Milburn, John Preskill—David became a professor at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec.  There he played a leading role in CIFAR (the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research), eventually co-directing its quantum information science program with Aephraim Steinberg.  Just this fall (!), David moved to Microsoft Research to start a new phase of his career.  He’s survived by a large family.</p>



<p>While I can’t claim any deep knowledge of David’s work—he and I pursued very different problems—it seems appropriate to mention some of his best-known contributions.  With David Kribs, Ray Laflamme, and Maia Lesosky, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0504189">introduced</a> the formalism of operator quantum error correction, and made many other contributions to the theory of quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance (including the estimation of thresholds).  He and coauthors <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1147">showed</a> in a <em>Nature</em> paper how to do quantum state tomography on 1D matrix product states efficiently.  With Pavithran Iyer, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3235">proved</a> that optimal decoding of stabilizer codes is #P-hard.</p>



<p>And if none of that makes a sufficient impression on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers: well, back in 2013, when D-Wave was claiming to have achieved huge quantum speedups, David Poulin was one of the few experts willing to take a clear skeptical stance in public (including right in my comment section—see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1400#comment-79596">here</a> for example).</p>



<p>I vividly remember being officemates with David back in 2003, at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo—before Perimeter had its sleek black building, when it still operated out of a converted tavern.  (My and David’s office was in the basement, reached via a narrow staircase.)  David liked to tease me: for example, if I found him in conversation with someone else and asked what it was about, he’d say, “oh, nothing to do with computational efficiency, no reason for you to care.”  (And yet, much of David’s work ultimately <em>would</em> have to do with computational efficiency.)</p>



<p>David was taken way too soon and will be missed by everyone who knew him.  Feel free to share David stories in the comments.</p></div>

    <title>Statistical-Query Lower Bounds via Functional Gradients</title>

any non-polynomial activation with respect to Gaussian marginals (e.g., ReLU,
sigmoid, sign). For the specific problem of ReLU regression (equivalently,
agnostically learning a ReLU), we show that any statistical-query algorithm
with tolerance $n^{-\Theta(\epsilon^{-1/2})}$ must use at least $2^{n^c}
\epsilon$ queries for some constant $c &gt; 0$, where $n$ is the dimension and
$\epsilon$ is the accuracy parameter. Our results rule out general (as opposed
to correlational) SQ learning algorithms, which is unusual for real-valued
learning problems. Our techniques involve a gradient boosting procedure for
"amplifying" recent lower bounds due to Diakonikolas et al. (COLT 2020) and
Goel et al. (ICML 2020) on the SQ dimension of functions computed by two-layer
neural networks. The crucial new ingredient is the use of a nonstandard convex
functional during the boosting procedure. This also yields a best-possible
reduction between two commonly studied models of learning: agnostic learning
and probabilistic concepts.

    <title>The Hylland-Zeckhauser Rule Under Bi-Valued Utilities</title>

assignment of items. The complexity of the rule has received renewed interest
recently with Vazirani and Yannakakis (2020) proposing a strongly
polynomial-time algorithm for the rule under bi-valued utilities, and making
several general insights. We study the rule under the case of agents having
bi-valued utilities. We point out several characterizations of the HZ rule,
drawing clearer relations with several well-known rules in the literature. As a
consequence, we point out alternative strongly polynomial-time algorithms for
the HZ solution. We also give reductions from computing the HZ solution to
computing well-known solutions based on leximin or Nash social welfare. An
interesting contrast is that the HZ rule is group-strategyproof whereas the
unconstrained competitive equilibrium with equal incomes rule is not even
strategyproof. We also clarify which results change when moving from 1-0 binary
utilities to the more general bi-valued utilities.

    <title>Fast and Private Submodular and $k$-Submodular Functions Maximization with Matroid Constraints</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1593475200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rafiey:Akbar.html">Akbar Rafiey</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/y/Yoshida:Yuichi.html">Yuichi Yoshida</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15744">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The problem of maximizing nonnegative monotone submodular functions under a
certain constraint has been intensively studied in the last decade, and a wide
range of efficient approximation algorithms have been developed for this
problem. Many machine learning problems, including data summarization and
influence maximization, can be naturally modeled as the problem of maximizing
monotone submodular functions. However, when such applications involve
sensitive data about individuals, their privacy concerns should be addressed.
In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing monotone submodular functions
subject to matroid constraints in the framework of differential privacy. We
provide $(1-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}})$-approximation algorithm which improves upon
the previous results in terms of approximation guarantee. This is done with an
almost cubic number of function evaluations in our algorithm.
</p>
<p>Moreover, we study $k$-submodularity, a natural generalization of
submodularity. We give the first $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm that
preserves differential privacy for maximizing monotone $k$-submodular functions
subject to matroid constraints. The approximation ratio is asymptotically tight
and is obtained with an almost linear number of function evaluations.

form a given pattern, regardless of translation, rotation, uniform-scaling,
and/or reflection. In other words, a valid final configuration of the system is
a formation that is \textit{similar} to the desired pattern. While there has
been no shortage of research in the pattern formation problem under a variety
of assumptions, models, and contexts, we consider the additional constraint
that the maximum distance traveled among all robots in the system is minimum.
Existing work in pattern formation and closely related problems are typically
application-specific or not concerned with optimality (but rather feasibility).
We show the necessary conditions any optimal solution must satisfy and present
a solution for systems of three robots. Our work also led to an interesting
result that has applications beyond pattern formation. Namely, a metric for
comparing two triangles where a distance of $0$ indicates the triangles are
similar, and $1$ indicates they are \emph{fully dissimilar}.

given a training set P of labeled points, classifies any unlabeled query point
with the label of its closest point in P. The nearest-neighbor condensation
problem aims to reduce the training set without harming the accuracy of the
nearest-neighbor rule.
</p>
<p>FCNN is the most popular algorithm for condensation. It is heuristic in
nature, and theoretical results for it are scarce. In this paper, we settle the
question of whether reasonable upper-bounds can be proven for the size of the
subset selected by FCNN. First, we show that the algorithm can behave poorly
when points are too close to each other, forcing it to select many more points
than necessary. We then successfully modify the algorithm to avoid such cases,
thus imposing that selected points should "keep some distance". This
modification is sufficient to prove useful upper-bounds, along with
approximation guarantees for the algorithm.

    <title>A Polynomial Kernel for Line Graph Deletion</title>

edge set of $G$ and there is an edge between $e,f\in E(G)$ if $e$ and $f$ share
an endpoint in $G$. A graph is called line graph if it is a line graph of some
graph. We study the Line-Graph-Edge Deletion problem, which asks whether we can
delete at most $k$ edges from the input graph $G$ such that the resulting graph
is a line graph. More precisely, we give a polynomial kernel for
Line-Graph-Edge Deletion with $\mathcal{O}(k^{5})$ vertices. This answers an
open question posed by Falk H\"{u}ffner at Workshop on Kernels (WorKer) in
2013.

support random access queries. The collection of strings is given by a rooted
tree where edges are labeled by an edit operation (inserting, deleting, or
replacing a character) and a node represents the string obtained by applying
the sequence of edit operations on the path from the root to the node. The goal
is to compactly represent the entire collection while supporting fast random
access to any part of a string in the collection. This problem captures natural
scenarios such as representing the past history of a edited document or
representing highly-repetitive collections. Given a tree with $n$ nodes, we
show how to represent the corresponding collection in $O(n)$ space and optimal
$O(\log n/ \log \log n)$ query time. This improves the previous time-space
trade-offs for the problem. To obtain our results, we introduce new techniques
and ideas, including a reduction to a new geometric line segment selection
together with an efficient solution.

tensor networks, following a reduction from weighted model counting to
tensor-network contraction. Prior work has focused on analyzing the single-core
performance of this approach, and demonstrated that it is an effective addition
to the current portfolio of weighted-model-counting algorithms.

<p>In this work, we explore the impact of multi-core and GPU use on
tensor-network contraction for weighted model counting. To leverage multiple
cores, we implement a parallel portfolio of tree-decomposition solvers to find
an order to contract tensors. To leverage a GPU, we use TensorFlow to perform
the contractions. We compare the resulting weighted model counter on 1914
standard weighted model counting benchmarks and show that it significantly
improves the virtual best solver.

the performance of scheduling algorithms with minimal advice, namely a single
bit. Besides demonstrating the power of very limited advice, such schemes are
quite natural. In the prediction setting, one bit of advice can be used to
model a simple prediction as to whether a job is "large" or "small"; that is,
whether a job is above or below a given threshold. Further, one-bit advice
schemes can correspond to mechanisms that tell whether to put a job at the
front or the back for the queue, a limitation which may be useful in many
implementation settings. Finally, queues with a single bit of advice have a
simple enough state that they can be analyzed in the limiting mean-field
analysis framework for the power of two choices. Our work follows in the path
of recent work by showing that even small amounts of even possibly inaccurate
information can greatly improve scheduling performance.

found numerous uses in machine learning. It is well known that there is a
strong connection between these entropic quantities and submodularity since
entropy over a set of random variables is submodular. In this paper, we study
combinatorial information measures that generalize independence, (conditional)
entropy, (conditional) mutual information, and total correlation defined over
sets of (not necessarily random) variables. These measures strictly generalize
the corresponding entropic measures since they are all parameterized via
submodular functions that themselves strictly generalize entropy. Critically,
we show that, unlike entropic mutual information in general, the submodular
mutual information is actually submodular in one argument, holding the other
fixed, for a large class of submodular functions whose third-order partial
derivatives satisfy a non-negativity property. This turns out to include a
number of practically useful cases such as the facility location and set-cover
functions. We study specific instantiations of the submodular information
measures on these, as well as the probabilistic coverage, graph-cut, and
saturated coverage functions, and see that they all have mathematically
intuitive and practically useful expressions. Regarding applications, we
connect the maximization of submodular (conditional) mutual information to
problems such as mutual-information-based, query-based, and privacy-preserving
summarization -- and we connect optimizing the multi-set submodular mutual
information to clustering and robust partitioning.

intra-prediction. In particular, usage of fully-connected networks has enabled
better cross-component prediction with respect to traditional linear models.
Nonetheless, state-of-the-art architectures tend to disregard the location of
individual reference samples in the prediction process. This paper proposes a
new neural network architecture for cross-component intra-prediction. The
network uses a novel attention module to model spatial relations between
reference and predicted samples. The proposed approach is integrated into the
Versatile Video Coding (VVC) prediction pipeline. Experimental results
demonstrate compression gains over the latest VVC anchor compared with
state-of-the-art chroma intra-prediction methods based on neural networks.

biological and digital phylogenetic trees from simple queries involving their
nodes. This is motivated from computational biology, data protection, and
computer security settings, which can be abstracted in terms of two parties, a
\emph{responder}, Alice, who must correctly answer queries of a given type
regarding a degree-$d$ tree, $T$, and a \emph{querier}, Bob, who issues batches
of queries, with each query in a batch being independent of the others, so as
to eventually infer the structure of $T$. We show that a querier can
efficiently reconstruct an $n$-node degree-$d$ tree, $T$, with a logarithmic
number of rounds and quasilinear number of queries, with high probability, for
various types of queries, including \emph{relative-distance queries} and
\emph{path queries}. Our results are all asymptotically optimal and improve the
asymptotic (sequential) query complexity for one of the problems we study.
Moreover, through an experimental analysis using both real-world and synthetic
data, we provide empirical evidence that our algorithms provide significant
parallel speedups while also improving the total query complexities for the
problems we study.

testing, optimized for distributed data stores operating in high workloads. In
large databases, querying becomes inefficient using traditional search methods.
To achieve optimal performance it is necessary to use probabilistic data
structures to test the membership of a given key, at the cost of getting false
positives while querying data. The widely used bloom filters can be used for
this, but they have limitations like no support for deletes. To improve upon
this we use a modified version of the cuckoo filter that gives better amortized
times for search, with less false positives.

uniformly valued demand side agents (a.k.a. agents) continuously compete for
getting matched with supply side agents (a.k.a. arms) with unknown and
heterogeneous valuations. Such markets abstract online matching platforms (for
e.g. UpWork, TaskRabbit) and falls within the purview of matching bandit models
introduced in Liu et al. \cite{matching_bandits}. The uniform valuation in the
demand side admits a unique stable matching equilibrium in the system. We
design the first decentralized algorithm - \fullname\; (\name), for matching
bandits under uniform valuation that does not require any knowledge of reward
gaps or time horizon, and thus partially resolves an open question in
\cite{matching_bandits}. \name\; works in phases of exponentially increasing
length. In each phase $i$, an agent first deletes dominated arms -- the arms
preferred by agents ranked higher than itself. Deletion follows dynamic
explore-exploit using UCB algorithm on the remaining arms for $2^i$ rounds.
{Finally, the preferred arm is broadcast in a decentralized fashion to other
agents through {\em pure exploitation} in $(N-1)K$ rounds with $N$ agents and
$K$ arms.} Comparing the obtained reward with respect to the unique stable

provide a (orderwise) matching regret lower-bound.

Joshua Greene and Andrew Lobb <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09193.pdf">proved</a> last month that every <em>smooth</em> Jordan curve in the plane and real <img alt="{r \leq 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cleq+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r \leq 1}"/>, there are four points on the curve that form a rectangle with sides of ratio <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>.</p>
<p>
Today we explain how this result relates to Otto Toeplitz’s famous “square peg conjecture,” which is the case <img alt="{r = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r = 1}"/> when the curve need not be smooth.</p>
<p>
We noticed this via an <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> last Thursday by Kevin Hartnett for <em>Quanta</em>. Hartnett describes this research advance as a product of the pandemic inducing them to take time for deeper reflection on fundamental problems. We wonder how much is bubbling on hard problems in our own field—this is one reason for our last post’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/some-real-and-some-virtual-news">interest</a> in (good kinds of) “gossip.”  He also gives great diagrams for the geometrical intuition.</p>
<p>
We will portray this advance instead along lines of things we’ve said recently about how to attack hard problems by seeking and solving simpler ones or special cases as stepping stones. Dick wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/21/the-inscribed-square-problem/">post</a> two years ago on the original Toeplitz problem, which this work still leaves open. That post focused on ways general Jordan curves can be nasty. This one needs an extra niceness condition but proves a stronger result for all <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>. How much can progress on “nice” inform problems with “nasty”? That kind of question comes up in complexity theory all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Pegging Rectangles </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A <em>Jordan curve</em> is the image of a continuous 1-1 map <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> from the circle to the plane. The condition of being 1-1 prevents the image from intersecting itself, so it is a single closed loop. By the Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem">theorem</a>, the loop always partitions the rest of the plane into two connected regions, exactly one of which is bounded. Amazingly, a Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood_curve">can</a> have positive Lebesgue measure, yet cannot fill all of <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{R}^2}"/>. Such curves can, however, approach the kind of space-filling curves defined by Giuseppe Peano, and thus have any Lebesgue density less than <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, as was noted also by William Osgood in his 1903 <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1986455.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
<p>
The Toeplitz conjecture is that every Jordan curve has four points that form a square. As noted in Dick’s post, the positive-area case is actually an easy yes-case. Nasty cases are where the curve is nowhere-differentiable with zero area. Thus far, the problem has been answered <em>yes</em> only in the presence of some uniformity condition that limits the local nastiness of the curve. The simplest one is for the curve to be <em>smooth</em> in that <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> has a continuous first derivative. Here is a smooth curve that is not convex, so that the square need not be “inside” the curve:</p>

<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/29/taking-a-problem-down-a-peg/matschkefig2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17247"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17247" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/matschkefig2.jpg?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
This diagram is from Benjamin Matchske’s wonderful recent <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/201404/rnoti-p346.pdf">survey</a> of the peg problem in the <em>AMS Notices</em>. Four months ago we’d have said it looks like a thin heart or fat boomerang. <i>Now</i> it looks to us like a face mask.</p>
<p>
As the survey notes, it is easy to show that every Jordan curve has <em>some</em> rectangle. The rectangle problem is to show that rectangles of <i>every</i> aspect ratio <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> can be pegged to the curve. There are two main reasons the square and rectangle problems are hard and harder:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Although any Jordan curve can be written as a limit of nice ones, the squares in the nice ones can degenerate to a single point in the limit. <p/>
</li><li>
Even for nice curves, a parity property that holds for squares can fail for rectangles.
</li></ol>
<p>
The property in the second point enables arguments of the kind: <em>for generic curves the number of squares is odd, therefore it is nonzero</em>. This then carries over to sufficiently nice curves in the generic closure. The failure of this property for rectangles is a main reason the results by Greene and Lobb are new.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Paper </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The new paper is written tersely at a high level, and we must confess not being able to catch all details in compressed time. But we can highlight some aspects of the argument. First, as we have said, it exemplifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Solve a Simpler Problem</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is however coupled with a second aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Bring Up the Reserves</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
It may be that the rectangle conjecture is not only true but “equally true” in the sense that the fundamental reason applies equally well to the case of rectangles. The parity argument that works for cases involving squares may be a crutch that misses the deepest explanations. Promoting arguments that avoid this crutch may marshal resources needed to make a breakthrough on the main problem for completely general Jordan curves.</p>
<p>
This runs somewhat counter to what we have said about <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> versus <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> proof attempts recently. The reason for <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/> believed by most is that problems like SAT require <em>exponential</em> time, not just super-polynomial time. Yet no one knows even a <em>super-linear</em> lower bound, apart from barely-superlinear bounds that exploit grainy aspects of the multitape Turing machine model and apply only to it. Nor is any super-linear lower bound known on Boolean circuit size. Maybe it is a viable strategy also to “bring up reserves” by finding restricted cases where (conditional) exponential lower bounds can be proven, as well as to explore contingencies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">SETH</a>, as we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">here</a>. But both of use have always felt that the super-linear frontier holds the buried keys to further progress.</p>
<p>
The Greene-Lobb proof has two aspects that may also resonate in complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Blow Up the Objects</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> in <em>Quanta</em> has great diagrams illustrating how the set of pairs of points on the curve corresponds to a Möbius strip in a related space. Cole Hugelmeyer, a graduate student at Princeton, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07336.pdf">proved</a> last year how to get rectangles covering at least one-third of possible values <img alt="{r \in (0,1]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cin+%280%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r \in (0,1]}"/> by embedding the Möbius strips in a four-dimensional space. Intersections between a strip and a rotated copy yield rectangles on the original Jordan curve. </p>
<p>
That led Greene and Lobb to consider larger objects with properties like pairs of Möbius strips in the larger space. The Klein bottle is the natural next thing to consider and led to a feature of their proof that made the desired conclusion pop out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Identify and Rule Out Obstructions</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The clever point pivots on the fact that a Klein bottle cannot be smoothly embedded into the complex plane <img alt="{\mathbb{C}^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{C}^2}"/> as a Lagrangian submanifold. The proof shows that for any prescribed aspect ratio <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> one can construct a mapping that almost succeeds in embedding such a Klein bottle. The fact that it must fail means that the image must yield a point of intersection witnessing the failure. The presence of this point then yields the construction of four other points on the Jordan curve that form the vertices of the needed rectangle.</p>
<p>
We have briefly <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">mentioned</a> how the concept of <em>obstructions</em> is integral to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_complexity_theory">Geometric</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1944345.1944346">Complexity</a> <a href="http://gct.cs.uchicago.edu/">Theory</a> attack on <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/>. Closer to home, however, is how László Babai's graph isomorphism algorithm and proof works by identifying a subclass of graphs called Johnson graphs as obstructions to a simpler algorithm, as we highlighted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/snow-and-theory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Can you find more lessons from the new advance on the Toeplitz problem?  Dick and I have considered ideas of blowing up from languages to pairs of languages (and making <i>reductions</i> between problems the fundamental units of analysis) but this has not gone beyond dreamwork.</p>

    <title>Can you name a famous living Chemist? Can anyone?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
I was re-watching the  Greatest-of-all-time Jeopardy championship and the following happen (I paraphrase)<br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
Alex Trebek: The category is Chemistry and we have a special guest reading the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Darling: I wonder who that will be.<br/>
<br/>
Bill: Hmm. I assume some famous chemist.<br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
So who was it? Bryan Cranston, the actor who PLAYED chemist Walter White on <i>Breaking Bad.</i><br/>
<br/>
Why couldn't they get a famous living chemist to read the clues?<br/>
<br/>
My guess: there are no famous living chemists.<br/>
<br/>
The number of famous living scientists is fairly short and they are often known for things that are not quite their science. Some are famous because the popularize science (deGrasse Tyson, Dawkins) or because of something unusual about their life (Hawkings when he was alive) or for something else entirely that they did (Ted Kaczynski).  Are any famous for the actual work that they do in the science?<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Wiles was famous for a brief time, and even made People Magazine's <i>25 most intriguing people of the year</i> list in the early 1990's (after he solved Fermat's Last Theorem). So he was famous but it was short lived.<br/>
<br/>
Terry Tao was on the Colbert Report (see <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/6wtwlg/the-colbert-report-terence-tao">here</a>) after he won the Fields Medal, the MacAuthor Genius award, and the Breakthrough prize. And even that fame was short lived.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the web page of Nobel Prize winners, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The only Chemistry Nobel's I recognized were Marie Curie,  Irene Joilet-Curie (Marie's Daughter), and Erst Rutherford.<br/>
<br/>
The only Physics Nobel's I recognized were<br/>
<br/>
Richard Feynman,<br/>
<br/>
 Eugene Wigner (for writing about <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences</a>),<br/>
<br/>
Richard Hofstadter (since he was the father of Douglas H and an uncle of Leonard H)<br/>
<br/>
 Andrew Geim (since he won  both an Ig-Noble prize and a Nobel prize, see  <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/10/noble-and-ig-noble-prizes.html">here</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Wolfgang Pauli (I've heard the term `Pauli Principle" though I did not know what it was until I looked it up while preparing this blog. I prob still don't really know what it means.)<br/>
<br/>
Enrico Fermi<br/>
<br/>
Erwin Schrodinger<br/>
<br/>
Paul Dirac<br/>
<br/>
Robert Millikan<br/>
<br/>
Albert Einstein<br/>
<br/>
Max Karl Ernest Ludwig Planck (I thought his last name was `Institute')<br/>
<br/>
Johannes Diderik van der Waals<br/>
<br/>
Pierre Curie<br/>
<br/>
Marie Curie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, some questions:<br/>
<br/>
a) Am I wrong? Are there famous living chemists I never heard of? Are there any famous living scientists who are famous for their work in science?<br/>
<br/>
b) If I am right then was there ever a time when there were famous scientists?<br/>
<br/>
c) If there was such a time, what changed?<br/>
<br/>
(I ask all of this non-rhetorically and with no agenda to push.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m giving a keynote address at the <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/">virtual IFAC congress this July</a>, and I submitted an abstract that forces me to reflect on the current state of research at the intersection of machine learning and control. 2020 is particularly appropriate for reflection: For personal reasons, I’ve been working in this space for about half a decade now and <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/">wrote a blog series on the topic two years ago</a> and it seemed like ideal timing. For the broader community, 2020 happens to be the year we were promised fleets of self-driving cars. Of course, for a myriad of reasons, we’re nowhere close to achieving this goal. Full self-driving has been a key motivator of work in learning-enabled autonomous systems, and it’s important to note this example as a marker of how difficult problems this space really are.</p>

<p>The research community has come to terms with this difficulty, and has committed itself to address the many pressing challenges. Over the last year I attended several great meetings on this topic, including an <a href="https://ajwagen.github.io/adsi_learning_and_control/">NSF funded workshop at UW</a>, a plenary session at <a href="https://ita.ucsd.edu/ws/">ITA</a>, a workshop on intersections of <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">learning, control, and optimization at IPAM</a>, and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/l4dc/home">second annual conference on Learning for Dynamics and Control</a>. There is clearly a ton of enthusiasm from researchers in a many different disciplines, and we’re seeing fascinating results mixing techniques from machine learning, computer science, and control. Obviously, I’m going to be leaving out many incredible papers, but, focusing on the theoretical end of the spectrum, perhaps I could highlight <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11899">new work on policy optimization</a> that demonstrates how simple optimization techniques can efficiently solve classic, nonconvex control-design problems or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">work connecting regret minimization and adaptive control</a> that provides nonasymptotic bounds.</p>

<p>This work has been very useful for establishing language to bridge communication between the diverse research camps interested in the space of learning, dynamics and automation. But, as I’ll discuss shortly, I’d argue that it hasn’t provided many promising approaches to improving large-scale autonomy. That’s ok! These problems are incredibly difficult and aren’t going to be solved by wishing for them to be solved. But I also think it might be worth taking a moment to reflect on which problems we are working on. It’s always a bit too easy for theorists to focus  on improving technical results and lose sight of why someone proved those results in the first place.</p>

<p>As an illustrative example, my research group spent a lot of time studying the <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/08/lqr/">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a> (LQR). The point of this work was initially to establish baselines: LQR has a closed form solution when the model is known, so we wanted to understand how different algorithms might perform when the underlying model was unknown. It turns out that if you are willing to collect enough data, the best thing you can do for LQR is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07826">estimate the dynamical model, and then exploit this model as if it were true</a>. This so-called “certainty equivalent control” is what practitioners have been doing since the mid-60s to fly satellites and solve other optimal control problems. Proving this result required a bunch of new mathematical insights that established connections between high dimensional statistics and automatic control theory. But it did not bring us closer to solving new challenges in robotics or autonomous systems. Our work here merely showed that what the controls community had been doing for 50 years was already about as well as we could do for this important baseline problem.</p>

<p>So what are the ways forward? Are there things that theory-minded folks can work on short term that might help us understand paths towards improving learning systems in complex feedback loops? Let me suggest a few challenges that I see as both very pressing, but also ones where we might be able to make near-term progress.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-is-still-not-reliable-technology">Machine Learning is still not reliable technology</h2>

<p>At the aforementioned <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">IPAM meeting</a>, Richard Murray gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi8Y---ce28">fantastic survey of the sorts of standards of reliability imposed in aerospace engineering</a>. Go watch it! I don’t want to spoil it for you, but his discussion of Ram Air Turbines is gripping. Richard covers what is needed to get to the sorts of reliability we’d like in autonomous systems. Unfortunately, having <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08237">88.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet</a>—while a stunning achievement—doesn’t tell us how to get to systems with failure rates on the order of 1 in a billion. As Boeing has tragically shown, cutting corners on autonomous system safety standards has horrible, tragic consequences.</p>

<p>How can we make machine learning more robust? How can we approach the failure rates needed for safe, reliable autonomy? And how can we establish testing protocols to assure we have such low failure rates?</p>

<h2 id="prediction-systems-in-feedback-loops">Prediction systems in feedback loops</h2>

<p>One particular aspect that I think is worth considering is how supervised learning systems can function as “sensors” in feedback loops. Even if you know everything about a dynamical system, when you observe the state via an estimator generated by a learned component, it’s not clear how to best take action on this observation. Most classic control and planning assumes that your errors in state-estimation are Gaussian or nicely uniformly bounded. Of course, the errors from machine learning systems are neither of these (I recommend checking out the <a href="https://youtu.be/A0cb7wZVFf4">crazy videos</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1130956365063761920">confusion</a> that comes out of Tesla Autopilot’s vision systems). How to properly characterize the errors of machine learning systems for control applications seems like a useful, understudied problem. Using off-the-shelf machine learing analysis, it’s unavoidable to have to densely sample all of the possible scenarios in advance in order to guarantee the sort of uniform error bounds desired by control algorithms. This isn’t practical, and, indeed, it’s clear that this sort of sensor characterization is not needed to make reasonable demos work. Though it’s a bit mundane, I think a huge contribution lies in understanding how much data we need to quantify the uncertainty in learned perception components. It’s still not clear to me if this is a machine learning question or a closed-loop design question, and I suspect both views of the problem will be needed to make progress.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-we-all-sleeping-on-model-predictive-control">Why are we all sleeping on model predictive control?</h2>

<p>I still remain baffled by how <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/05/02/adp/">model predictive control</a> (MPC) is consistently under appreciated. We’ll commonly see the same tasks in the same meeting, one task done on a robot using some sort of deep reinforcement learning and the other done using model predictive control, and the disparity in performance is stark. It’s like the difference between watching an Olympic level sprinter and me jogging in my neighborhood with a set of orthotics.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from the IPAM workshop. Martin Riedmiller presented work at DeepMind to catch a ball in a cup:</p>



<p>This system uses two cameras, has a rather large “cup,” (it’s a wastepaper basket) and yet still takes 3 days to train on the robot. Francesco Borrelli presented a different approach. Using only a single camera and basic, simple Newtonian physics, and MPC they were able to achieve this performance on the standard-sized “ball-in-a-cup” toy:</p>



<p>If you only saw these two videos, I can’t fathom why would you invest all of your assets into deep RL. I understand there are still a lot of diehards out there, and I know this will offend them. But I want to make a constructive point: so many theorists are spending a lot of time studying RL algorithms, but few in the ML community are analyzing MPC and why it’s so successful. We should rebalance our allocation of mental resources!</p>

<p>Now, while the basic idea of MPC is very simple, the theory gets very hairy very quickly. It definitely takes some time and effort to learn about how to prove convergence of MPC protocols. I’d urge the MPC crowd to connect more with the learning theory crowd to see if a common ground can be found to better understand how MPC works and how we might push its performance even farther.</p>

<h2 id="perhaps-we-should-stop-taking-cues-from-alphago">Perhaps we should stop taking cues from AlphaGo?</h2>

<p>One of the grand goals in RL is to use function approximation algorithms to estimate value functions. The conventional wisdom asserts that the world is a giant Markov Decision Process and once you have its value function, you can just greedily maximize it and you’ll win at life. Now, this sort of approach clearly doesn’t work for robots, and I’m perplexed by why people still think it will work at all. Part of the motivation is that this approach was used to solve Go. But at some point I think we all have to come to terms with the fact that games are not the real world.</p>

<p>Now, I’d actually argue that RL <em>does</em> work in the real world, but it’s in systems that most people don’t actively think of as RL systems. Greedy value function estimation and exploitation is <em>literally</em> how all internet revenue is made. Systems simply use past data to estimate value functions and then choose the action that maximizes the value at the next step. Though seldom described as such, these are instances of the “greedy contextual bandit” algorithm, and this algorithm makes tech companies tons of money. But many researchers have also pointed out that this algorithm leads to misinformation, polarization, and radicalization.</p>

<p>Everyone tries to motivate RL by the success of AlphaGo, but they should be using the success of Facebook and Google instead. And if they did this, I think it would be a lot more clear why RL is terrifying and dangerous, and one whose limitations we desperately need to understand so that we can build safer tools.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-the-70s-about-optimal-control">Lessons from the 70s about optimal control</h2>

<p>I have one set of ideas along these lines that, while I think is important, I still am having a hard time articulating. Indeed, I might just take a few blog posts to work through my thoughts on this, but let me close this blog with a teaser of discussions to come. As I mentioned above, optimal control was a guiding paradigm for a variety of control applications in the 60s and 70s. During this time, it seemed like there might even be hidden benefits to a full-on optimization paradigm: though you’d optimize a single, simple objective, you would often get additional robustness guarantees for free. However, it turned out that this was very misleading and that <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1101812">there were no guarantees of robustness even for simple optimal control problems</a>. This shouldn’t be too surprising, as if you devote a lot of resources towards one objective, you are likely neglecting some other objective. But showing how and why these fragilities arise is quite delicate. It’s not always obvious how you <em>should</em> be devoting your resources.</p>

<p>Trying to determine how to allocate engineering resources to balance safety and performance is the heart of “robust control.” One thing I’m fascinated by moving forward is if any of the early developments in robust control might transfer over for a new kind of “robust ML.” Unfortunately for all of us, robust control is a rather encrypted literature. There is a lot of mathematics, but often not clear statements about <em>why</em> we study particular problems or what are the fundamental limits of feedback. While diligent young learning theorists have been scouring classic control theory text books for insights, these books don’t always articulate what we can and cannot do and what are the problems that control theory might help solve. We still have a lot of work to do in communicating what we know and what problems remain challenging. I think it would be useful for control theorists to think of how to best communicate the fundamental concepts of robust control. I hope to take up this challenge in the next few months on this blog.</p>

<p><em>I’d like to thank Sarah Dean, Horia Mania, Nik Matni, and Ludwig Schmidt for their helpful feedback on this post. I’d also like to thank John Doyle for several inspiring conversations about robustness in optimal control and on the encrypted state of the control theory literature.</em></p></div>

    <title>Sorting with integer offsets</title>
    <summary>Here’s a cute exercise for the next time you’re teaching radix sorting in an algorithms class:</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Here’s a cute exercise for the next time you’re teaching radix sorting in an algorithms class:</p>

<p>Suppose you’re given as input a set of real numbers , and an integer parameter . Describe an algorithm for sorting the  numbers  in time . You can assume that standard arithmetic operations on real numbers (including comparisons and rounding down to an integer) take constant time per operation.</p>

<p>Models of computation that mix constant-time real arithmetic and rounding operations can be problematic, as by building up and then rounding numbers with unlimited precision you can access a level of computational power beyond what actual computers can do, but I don’t think that’s a concern here. If someone wants to use bit-packing tricks to implement a crazy but fast sorting algorithm in this model, they’re beyond the level of this exercise.</p>

<p>The same method (which I’m not going to describe, to preserve its value as an exercise) more generally allows you to take as input pairs  and sort the numbers  in time  where . But it relies heavily on the fact that you’re adding integers to the ’s. For a problem that can’t be handled in this way, consider instead sorting the numbers  where we multiply instead of adding. Or, if you prefer to view this as a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_%2B_Y_sorting"> sorting</a> problem, take logs in your favorite base and sort the numbers . It’s not at all obvious to me whether this can be done in the same  time bound.</p>

<p>The motivation for looking at all this is <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/47120/95">a question about how to implement the greedy set cover quickly</a>. You can find the unweighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem#Greedy_algorithm">greedy set cover</a> in linear time (linear in the sum of the sizes of the input sets; this is an exercise in CLRS), and you can approximate the weighted greedy set cover very accurately in linear time using similar ideas. If you could sort  quickly you could use the sorted order to compute the weighted greedy set cover exactly in the same time as the sorting algorithm. Which is totally useless because the greedy cover is already an approximation, so a fast and accurate approximation to the greedy cover is good enough. But I think the question of sorting  is interesting despite its uselessness in this application.</p></div>

<p>Here is an interesting 2006 <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/ester.ppt">power point presentation entitled <strong><em>How to detect lies with statistics</em></strong> by Maya Bar-Hillel.</a>  This was a talk given by Maya at the <a href="http://www.esterconference.huji.ac.il/">conference</a> honoring Prof. Ester Samuel- Cahn , Jerusalem, December 18-20, 2006, and it described a planned research project of Maya Bar-Hillel with Yossi Rinott, David Budescu and myself. At the end we did not pursue it, mainly because each of us was involved in various other projects (but also because we were skeptical about some aspects of it.)  Ester Samuel-Cahn (1933-2015) was a famous Israeli statistician. (Here is a <a href="http://www.sci-princess.info/archives/291">post by Yosi Levy in Hebrew</a> about the conference and about Ester.)</p>
<p>The lecture starts with “Last year, <em>Statistical Science</em> celebrated 50 years for `How to Lie with Statistics’ the book [by Durell Huff] whose title inspired this talk.”</p>
<p>And here are a few other quotes from Maya’s presentation</p>
<p>“We are not sure a general toolkit for detecting lies with statistics can be developed. Perhaps that explains why none yet exists.  We have shown just a collection of anecdotes. But they can be classified and categorized. Some do seem generalizeable, at least to some extent.”</p>
<p>and the conclusion</p>
<blockquote><p>A famous quip by Fred Mosteller: “It is easy to lie with statistics, but easier to lie without them.”</p>
<p>Likewise, we should say:  “It is possible to detect (some) lies with statistics, but easier to detect them with other means”.</p></blockquote>
<h2>New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems</h2>
<p>Peter Keevash, Alexey Pokrovskiy, Benny Sudakov, and Liana Yepremyan’s paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00526">New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems,</a> describes remarkable progress very old questions regarding transversals in Latin square.</p>
<h2>Topological Tverberg news</h2>
<p>I came across a very interesting paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05251">The topological Tverberg problem beyond <span class="search-hit mathjax">prime</span> powers</a> by Florian Frick and Pablo Soberón with new bounds and a new method for topological Tverberg theorem in the non prime-power case.</p>
<h2>Jeager’s conjecture refuted</h2>
<p>A year ago I came across <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2114324995342352&amp;set=a.507523926022475&amp;type=3&amp;theater">this cool facebook post</a> by Rupei Xu</p>
<blockquote><p>OMG! Just learned that Jaeger’s conjecture is false for every t&gt;=3. An interesting consequence of it is that a specific version of Goddyn’s conjecture on thin spanning trees is false, which shows some negative evidence that the thin spanning tree approaches may fail to lead to a constant factor approximation algorithm for ATSP!</p></blockquote>
<h2>A cool rainbow post <a href="http://matroidunion.org/?p=2541">Short rainbow cycles in graphs and matroids</a> by Tony Huynh</h2>
<h2>More on the game of life</h2>
<p>Let me mention two problems I posted 6-7 years ago about Conway’s game of life. <a class="question-hyperlink" href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/132402/conways-game-of-life-for-random-initial-position">Conway’s game of life for random initial position</a> and <a class="question-hyperlink" href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/17914/does-a-noisy-version-of-conways-game-of-life-support-universal-computation">Does a noisy version of Conway’s game of life support universal computation?</a></p>

    <title>Writing Code for a Paper :  A Note to Students</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This post both relates to some of the stuff I'll be presenting at Friday's STOC workshop on Algorithms with Predictions, but is also for future students in my classes, who sometimes wonder why I have them write code on theory material.  (Somehow this might be a theme for a lecture in my grad class next semester, so maybe these are a first attempt at notes for the lecture.  Comments  and  suggestions welcome.)<br/><br/>Some of the work I'm doing is looking at how queueing systems perform with various sorts of predictions on the times the jobs take.  This particular work I'm doing on my own.  (While most of my research has been and is with collaborators, and it's one of the things I enjoy about computer science -- we're a very collaborative field!, which seems to surprise many people -- I still sometimes like to do research projects on my own.  I've looked at queueing systems since my PhD thesis, and it's a bit outside the research interest of most of my collaborator pool, and it's "fun" sometimes to do my own thing.  The reason why "fun" is in quotes is described below.)  <br/><br/>Often in my work in queueing I'm looking at mean-field limits (meant to model infinite systems of queues, which provides a good approximation for large finite systems under reasonable assumptions), where I can derive families of differential equations describing the system behavior.  I can also simulate the large finite system directly, and make sure the results match.  I generally do this for all of these types of papers.<br/><br/>Now the numbers I get from simulating the system directly and from simulating the differential equations should match (say within 1% or so).  If they don't, something is wrong.  In an effort to avoid wrongness, I won't consider the paper ready for outside consumption until I get a match.  Unfortunately, there are three ways things can go wrong.<br/><br/>1.  My simulation code for the queueing system might have bugs.<br/>2.  My code to evaluate the differential equations might have bugs.<br/>3.  My equations themselves might have bugs.<br/><br/>And I find there are two main categories of bugs.  Sometimes the bugs are simple/standard coding mistakes -- I'm off by 1 on an index, or I cut and paste and forget to change an i++ to a j++ in one my double loops, or I type x instead of a y.  Usually it's pretty easy to find these things, although I've had times where a hidden typo took hours to find.  But sometimes the bug is a thinking mistake -- I've forgotten a subcase and so my equations aren't complete (and so my code evaluating the equations won't give the right answer), or I've not handled a subcase correctly in my simulation.  That type usually takes longer. <br/><br/>Usually, the first time through, most all of these types of bugs happen -- my math is off, I've typed some stuff wrong, it can all happen.  And then, like coders everywhere, I go through and fix it.  And it's painful.  Sometimes everything goes right, a quick check or two and everything works.  For more complicated stuff, it's more time figuring out what went wrong than setting up the code to begin with.  And being the personality type to not let things sit, that can mean late nights figuring out what went wrong.<br/><br/>For my talk this week, there was one last problem I wanted to include, which meant finally taking the model and writing the equations and code.  I didn't even need it for the talk, but it's also the last bit before I put a paper draft on arxiv, so taking advantage of a deadline, I figured now was the time.  Which means the last 2 days, I've spent many hours (and a late night) trying to remove the disagreements.<br/><br/>On the plus side, when everything finally works, it's a wonderful feeling.  And it always makes me feel better when I have worked to verify my math this way;  this time, what kept me up well past midnight and took several hours to track down was actually a boundary case I had left out of the equations.  (I had looked at the equations over and over again without noticing I had left out the subcase;  I had to step through numbers from the differential equations one time step at a time to track down what was missing, and then the numbers told me what I had done wrong.)<br/><br/>On the down side, it's work, and debugging is never particularly fun.<br/><br/>For students out there, maybe I'm just explaining that I understand the pain that I am putting you through.  You may wonder why I have you do simulations that take a few hours if you do them well, but days if you don't think through the best approach.  But using programming and theory together can be powerful;  it's helped me countless times in my research.<br/><br/>(Related: on theory and experiments that <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191184-theory-without-experiments/fulltext">I've written on before</a>, along with <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191183-experiments-as-research-validation/fulltext">a viewpoint by Jeffrey Ullman</a>.)<br/><br/><br/></div>

    <title>TR20-096 |  On the asymptotic complexity of sorting | 

	Igor Sergeev</title>
    <summary>We investigate the number of pairwise comparisons sufficient to sort $n$ elements chosen from a linearly ordered set. This number is shown to be $\log_2(n!) + o(n)$ thus improving over the previously known upper bounds of the form $\log_2(n!) + \Theta(n)$. The new bound is achieved by the proposed group insertion sorting algorithm.</summary>

    <title>TR20-095 |  On Basing Auxiliary-Input Cryptography on NP-hardness via Nonadaptive Black-Box Reductions | 

	Mikito Nanashima</title>
    <summary>A black-box (BB) reduction is a central proof technique in theoretical computer science. However, the limitations on BB reductions have been revealed for several decades, and the series of previous work gives strong evidence that we should avoid a nonadaptive BB reduction to base cryptography on NP-hardness (e.g., Akavia et al., 2006). Then should we also give up such a familiar proof technique even for an intermediate step towards cryptography?

In this paper, we continue to explore the capability of nonadaptive BB reductions and extend our knowledge on such a central technique out of the current (worst-to-average) framework. In particular, we investigate the attempt to base weaker cryptographic notions allowed to take auxiliary-input via nonadaptive BB reductions. As a result, we prove the following theorems: (1) if we base an auxiliary-input pseudorandom generator (AIPRG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses; (2) if we base an auxiliary-input one-way function (AIOWF) or auxiliary-input hitting set generator (AIHSG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then an (i.o.-)one-way function also exists based on NP-hardness (via an adaptive BB reduction).

The first result gives new evidence that nonadaptive BB reductions are insufficient to base AIPRG. The second result also yields a weaker but still surprising consequence of nonadaptive BB reductions, that is, a one-way function based on NP-hardness. In fact, the second result is interpreted as the following two opposite ways. Pessimistically, it shows that basing AIOWF or AIHSG via nonadaptive BB reductions is harder than constructing a one-way function based on NP-hardness, which can be regarded as a negative result. Note that AIHSG is a weak primitive implied even by the hardness of learning; thus, this pessimistic view gives conceptually stronger limitations than the currently known limitations on nonadaptive BB reductions. Optimistically, our result gives a new hope: a breakthrough construction of auxiliary-input primitives might also be useful to construct standard cryptographic primitives. This optimistic view enhances the significance of further investigation on constructing auxiliary-input or other intermediate cryptographic primitives instead of standard cryptographic primitives.</summary>

    <title>An equilibrium in nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>While there has been incredible progress in convex and nonconvex minimization, a multitude of problems in ML today are in need of efficient algorithms to solve min-max optimization problems. 
 Unlike minimization, where algorithms can always be shown to converge to some local minimum, there is no notion of a local equilibrium in min-max optimization that exists for general nonconvex-nonconcave functions.
    In two recent papers, we give  two notions of local equilibria that are guaranteed to exist and efficient algorithms to compute them.
In this post we present the key ideas behind a second-order notion of local min-max equilibrium from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> and in the next we will talk about a different notion along with the algorithm and show its implications to GANs from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12376">this paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="min-max-optimization">Min-max optimization</h2>

<p>Min-max optimization of an objective function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$</p>



<p>is a powerful framework in optimization, economics, and ML as it allows one to model learning in the presence of multiple agents with competing objectives.
In ML applications, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">GANs</a> and <a href="https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org">adversarial robustness</a>, the min-max objective function may be nonconvex-nonconcave.
We know that min-max optimization is at least as hard as minimization, hence, we cannot hope to find a globally optimal solution to min-max problems for general functions.</p>

<h2 id="approximate-local-minima-for-minimization">Approximate local minima for minimization</h2>

<p>Let us first revisit the special case of minimization, where there is a natural notion of an approximate second-order local minimum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$x$ is a second-order $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ if
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now suppose we just wanted to minimize a function $\mathcal{L}$, and we start from any point which is <em>not</em> at an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}$.
Then we can always find a direction to travel in along which either $\mathcal{L}$ decreases rapidly, or the second derivative of $\mathcal{L}$ is large.
 By searching in such a direction we can easily find a new point which has a smaller value of $\mathcal{L}$ using only local information about the gradient and Hessian of $\mathcal{L}$.
 This means that we can keep decreasing $\mathcal{L}$ until we reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum (see <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Boris_Polyak2/publication/220589612_Cubic_regularization_of_Newton_method_and_its_global_performance/links/09e4150dd2f0320879000000/Cubic-regularization-of-Newton-method-and-its-global-performance.pdf">Nesterov and Polyak</a>,  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3055399.3055464">here</a>,  <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Ge15.pdf">here</a>,  and also an earlier <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2016/03/22/saddlepoints">blog post</a> for how to do this with only access to gradients of $\mathcal{L}$).
 If $\mathcal{L}$ is Lipschitz smooth and bounded, we will reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum in polynomial time from any starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an analogous definition with similar properties for min-max optimization?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="problems-with-current-local-optimality-notions">Problems with current local optimality notions</h2>
<p>There has been much recent work on extending theoretical results in nonconvex minimization to min-max optimization (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00331">here</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9430-efficient-algorithms-for-smooth-minimax-optimization">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02629.pdf">here</a>,  <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9631-solving-a-class-of-non-convex-min-max-games-using-iterative-first-order-methods.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07512">here</a>.
One way to extend the notion of local minimum to the min-max setting is to seek a solution point called a “local saddle”–a point $(x,y)$ where 1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x, \cdot)$ and 2) $x$ is a local minimum for $f(\cdot, y).$</p>

<p>For instance,
 this is used  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00838.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10461.pdf">here</a>, and <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/adolphs19a.html">here</a>.
But, there are very simple examples of two-dimensional bounded functions where a local saddle does not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, consider $f(x,y) = sin(x+y)$ from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">here</a>. Check that none of the points on this function are simultaneously a local minimum for $x$ and local maximum for $y$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that no local saddle exists may be surprising, since an $\varepsilon$-global solution to a min-max optimization problem <em>is</em> guaranteed to exist as long as the objective function is uniformly bounded.
Roughly, this is because, in a global min-max setting, the max-player is empowered to globally maximize the function $f(x,\cdot)$, and the min-player is empowered to minimize the “global max” function $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$.</p>

<p>The ability to compute the global max  allows the min-player to  predict the max-player’s response.
If $x$ is a global minimum of $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$, the min-player is aware of this fact and will have no incentive to update $x$.
On the other hand, if the min-player can only simulate the max-player’s updates locally (as in local saddle),
then the min-player may try to update her strategy even when it leads to a net increase in $f$.
This can happen because the min-player is not powerful enough to accurately simulate the max-player’s response. (See  a  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">related notion</a> of local optimality with similar issues due to vanishingly small updates.)</p>

<p>The fact that players who can only make local predictions are
unable to predict their opponents’ responses can lead to convergence problems in many popular algorithms such as<br/>
gradient descent ascent (GDA). This non-convergence behavior can occur if the function has no local saddle point (e.g. the function $sin(x+y)$  mentioned above), and can even happen on some functions, like $f(x,y) = xy$ which do have a local saddle point.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/GDA_spiral_fast.gif"/>
<br/>
<b>Figure 1.</b> GDA spirals off to infinity from almost every starting point on the objective function $f(x,y) = xy$.

<h2 id="greedy-max-a-computationally-tractable-alternative-to-global-max">Greedy max: a computationally tractable alternative to global max</h2>

<p>To allow for a more stable min-player, and a more stable notion of local optimality, we would like to empower the min-player to more effectively simulate the max-player’s response. 
While the notion of global min-max does exactly this by having the min-player compute the global max function $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, computing the global maximum may be intractable.</p>

<p>Instead, we replace the global max function $\max_y (f(\cdot ,y))$ with a computationally tractable alternative. 
Towards this end, we restrict the max-player’s response, and the min-player’s simulation of this response, to updates which can be computed using any algorithm from a class of second-order optimization algorithms.
More specifically, we restrict the max-player to updating $y$ by traveling along continuous paths which start at the current value of $y$ and along which either $f$ is increasing or the second derivative of $f$ is positive.  We refer to such paths as greedy paths since they model a class of second-order “greedy” optimization algorithms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy path:</strong> A unit-speed path $\varphi:[0,\tau] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is greedy if $f$ is non-decreasing over this path, and for every $t\in[0,\tau]$
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roughly speaking, when restricted to updates obtained from greedy paths, the max-player will always be able to reach a point which is an approximate local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$, although there may not be a greedy path which leads the max-player to a global maximum.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/greedy_region_omega_t.png" style="width: 400px;"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/global_max_path_no_axes_t.png" style="width: 400px;"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 2.</b> <i>Left:</i> The light-colored region $\Omega$ is reachable from the initial point $A$ by a greedy path; the dark region is not reachable. <i>Right:</i> There is always a greedy path from any point $A$ to a local maximum ($B$), but a global maximum ($C$) may not be reachable by any greedy path.
</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To define an alternative to $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, we consider the local maximum point with the largest value of $f(x,\cdot)$ attainable from a given starting point $y$ by any greedy path.
We refer to the value of $f$ at this point as the <em>greedy max function</em>, and denote this value by $g(x,y)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy max function:</strong> 
    $g(x,y) = \max_{z \in \Omega} f(x,z),$
where $\Omega$ is points reachable from $y$ by greedy path.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="our-greedy-min-max-equilibrium">Our greedy min-max equilibrium</h2>
<p>We use the greedy max function to define a new second-order notion of local optimality for min-max optimization, which we refer to as a greedy min-max equilibrium.
Roughly speaking, we say that $(x,y)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if 
1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$ (and hence the endpoint of a greedy path), and 
2) if $x$ is a local minimum of the greedy max function $g(\cdot,y)$.</p>

<p>In other words, $x$ is a local minimum of $\max_y f(\cdot, y)$ under the constraint that the maximum is computed only over the set of greedy paths starting at $y$.
Unfortunately, even if $f$ is smooth, the greedy max function may not be differentiable with respect to $x$ and may even be discontinuous.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2_grid_t.png" width="400"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2g_grid_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 3.</b> <i>Left:</i> If we change $x$ from one value $x$ to a very close value $\hat{x}$, the largest value of $f$ reachable by greedy path undergoes a discontinuous change.  <i>Right:</i>  This means the greedy max function $g(x,y)$ is discontinuous in $x$.</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>This creates a problem, since the definition of $\varepsilon$-local minimum only applies to smooth functions.</p>

<p>To solve this problem we would ideally like to smooth $g$ by convolution with a Gaussian.
Unfortunately, convolution can cause the local minima of a function to “shift”– a point which is a local minimum for $g$ may no longer be a local minimum for the convolved version of $g$ (to see why, try convolving the function $f(x) = x - 3x I(x\leq 0) + I(x \leq 0)$ with a Gaussian $N(0,\sigma^2)$ for any $\sigma&gt;0$).
To avoid this, we instead consider a “truncated” version of $g$, and then convolve this function in the $x$ variable with a Gaussian to obtain our smoothed version of $g$.</p>

<p>This allows us to define a notion of greedy min-max equilibrium.  We say that a point $(x^\star, y^\star)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if $y^\star$ is an approximate local maximum of $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, and $x^\star$ is an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of this smoothed version of $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Greedy min-max equilibrium:</b>
$(x^{\star}, y^{\star})$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if

 
where $S(x,y):= \mathrm{smooth}_x(\mathrm{truncate}(g(x, y))$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any point which is a local saddle point (talked about earlier) also satisifeis our equilibrium conditions. The converse, however, cannot be true as a local saddle point may not always exist. Further, for compactly supported convex-concave functions a point is a greedy min-max equilibrium (in an appropriate sense) if and only if it is a global min-max point. (See Section 7 and Appendix A respectively in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">our paper</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="greedy-min-max-equilibria-always-exist-and-can-be-found-efficiently">Greedy min-max equilibria always exist! (And can be found efficiently)</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> we show: A greedy min-max equilibrium is always guaranteed to exist provided that $f$ is uniformly bounded with Lipschitz Hessian. We do so by providing an algorithm which converges to a greedy min-max equilibrium, and, moreover, we show that it is able to do this in polynomial time from any initial point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Main theorem:</b> Suppose that we are given access to a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and to its gradient and Hessian.  And suppose that $f$ is unformly bounded by $b&gt;0$ and has $L$-Lipschitz Hessian.
Then given any initial point, our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-greedy min-max equilibrium $(x^\star,y^\star)$ of $f$ in $\mathrm{poly}(b, L, d, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of difficulties that our algorithm and proof must overcome:
One difficulty in designing an algorithm is that the greedy max function may be discontinuous. 
To find an approximate local minimum of a discontinuous function, our algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo hill climbing algorithm with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0408007">zeroth-order optimization version</a> of stochastic gradient descent.
Another difficulty is that, while one can easily compute a greedy path from any starting point, there may be many different greedy paths which end up at different local maxima.
Searching for the greedy path which leads to the local maximum point with the largest value of $f$ may be infeasible.
In other words the greedy max function $g$ may be intractable to compute.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/greedy_paths_no_axes_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 4.</b>There are many different greedy paths that start at the same point $A$.  They can end up at different local maxima ($B$, $D$), with different values of $f$.  In many cases it may be intractable to search over all these paths to compute the greedy max function.
 </div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To get around this problem, rather than computing the exact value of $g(x,y)$, we instead compute a lower bound $h(x,y)$ for the greedy max function. Since we are able to obtain this lower bound by computing only a <em>single</em> greedy path, it is much easier to compute than greedy max function.</p>

<p>In our paper, we prove that if 1) $x^\star$ is an approximate local minimum for the this lower bound $h(\cdot, y^\star)$, and  2) $y^\star$ is a an approximate local maximum for $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, then $x^\star$ is also an approximate local minimum for the greedy max $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.
This allows us to design an algorithm which obtains a greedy min-max point by minimizing the computationally tractable lower bound $h$, instead of the greedy max function which may be intractable to compute.</p>

<h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude</h2>

<p>In this post we have shown how to extend a notion of second-order equilibrium for minimization to min-max optimization which is guaranteed to exist for any function which is bounded and Lipschitz, with Lipschitz gradient and Hessian.
We have also shown that our algorithm is able to find this equilibrium in  polynomial time from any initial point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our results do not require any additional assumptions such as convexity, monotonicity, or sufficient bilinearity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an upcoming blog post we will show how one can use some of the ideas from here to obtain a new min-max optimization algorithm with applications to stably training GANs.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-094 |  Is it possible to improve Yao’s XOR lemma using reductions that exploit the efficiency of their oracle? | 

	Ronen Shaltiel</title>
    <summary>Yao's XOR lemma states that for every function $f:\set{0,1}^k \ar \set{0,1}$, if $f$ has hardness $2/3$ for $P/poly$ (meaning that for every circuit $C$ in $P/poly$, $\Pr[C(X)=f(X)] \le 2/3$ on a uniform input $X$), then the task of computing $f(X_1) \oplus \ldots \oplus f(X_t)$ for sufficiently large $t$ has hardness $\half +\epsilon$ for $P/poly$.

Known proofs of this lemma cannot achieve $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k^{\omega(1)}}$, and even for $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k}$, we do not know how to replace
$P/poly$ by AC$^0[\textsc{parity}]$ (the class of constant depth circuits with the gates $\set{\textsc{and,or,not,parity}}$ of unbounded fan-in).

Recently, Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola (FOCS 2018) (building on a sequence of earlier works) showed that these limitations cannot be circumvented by \emph{black-box reductions}. Namely, by reductions $\Red^{(\cdot)}$ that given oracle access to a function $D$ that violates the conclusion of Yao's XOR lemma, implement a circuit that violates the assumption of Yao's XOR lemma.

There are a few known reductions in the related literature on worst-case to average case reductions that are \emph{non-black box}. Specifically, the reductions of Gutfreund, Shaltiel and Ta Shma (Computational Complexity 2007) and  Hirahara (FOCS 2018)) are ``class reductions'' that are only guaranteed to succeed when given oracle access to an oracle $D$ from some efficient class of algorithms. These works seem to circumvent some black-box impossibility results.

In this paper we extend the previous limitations of Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola to class reductions, giving evidence that class reductions cannot yield the desired improvements in Yao's XOR lemma.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first limitation on reductions for hardness amplification that applies to class reductions.

Our technique imitates the previous lower bounds for black-box reductions, replacing the inefficient oracle used in that proof, with an efficient one that is based on limited independence, and developing tools to deal with the technical difficulties that arise following this replacement.</summary>

<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>This morning, like many others, I woke up to the terrible news that Scott Alexander—the man I call “the greatest Scott A. of the Internet”—has <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">deleted SlateStarCodex in its entirety</a>.  The reason, Scott explains, is that the <em>New York Times</em> was planning to run an article about SSC.  Even though the article was going to be <em>positive</em>, NYT decided that by policy, it would need to include Scott’s real surname (Alexander is his middle name).  Scott felt that revealing his name to the world would endanger himself and his psychiatry patients.  Taking down his entire blog was the only recourse that he saw.</p>



<p>The NYT writer, Cade Metz, was someone who I’d previously known and trusted from his reporting on Google’s quantum supremacy experiment.  So in recent weeks, I’d spent a couple hours on the phone with Cade, answering his questions about the rationality community, the history of my interactions with it, and why I thought SlateStarCodex spoke to so many readers.  Alas, when word got around the rationality community that Cade was writing a story, a huge panic arose that he was planning on some sort of <em>Gawker</em>-style hit piece or takedown.  Trying to tamp down the fire, I told Scott Alexander and others that I knew Cade, his intentions were good, he was only trying to understand the community, and everyone should help him by talking to him openly.</p>



<p>In a year of historic ironies, here’s another one: that it was the decent, reasonable, and well-meaning Cade Metz, rather than any of the SneerClubbers or Twitter-gangsters who despised Scott Alexander for sharing his honest thoughts on hot-button issues, who finally achieved the latter’s dark dream of exiling Scott from the public sphere.</p>



<p>The recent news had already been bad enough: Trump’s “temporary suspension” of J1 and H1B visas (which will deal a body blow to American universities this year, and to all the foreign scientists who planned to work at them), on top of the civil unrest, on top of the economic collapse, on top of the now-resurgent coronavirus.  But with no more SlateStarCodex, now I <em>really</em> feel like my world is coming to an end.</p>



<p>I’ve considered SSC to be the best blog on the Internet since not long after discovering it five years ago.  Of course my judgment is colored by one of the most notorious posts in SSC’s history (“Untitled”) being a ferocious defense of me, when thousands were attacking me and it felt like my life was finished.  But that’s merely what brought me there in the first place.  I stayed because of Scott’s insights about everything else, and because of the humor and humanity and craftsmanship of his prose.  Since then I had the privilege to become friends with Scott, not only virtually but in real life, and to meet dozens of others in the SSC community, in its Bay Area epicenter and elsewhere.</p>



<p>In my view, for SSC to be <em>permanently</em> deleted would be an intellectual loss on the scale of, let’s say, John Stuart Mill or Mark Twain burning their collected works.  That might sound like hyperbole, but not (I don’t think) to the tens of thousands who read Scott’s essays and fiction, particularly during their 2013-2016 heyday, and who went from casual enjoyment to growing admiration to the gradual recognition that they were experiencing, “live,” the works that future generations of teachers will assign their students when they cover the early twenty-first century.  The one thing that mitigates this tragedy is the hope that it will yet be reversed (and, of course, the fact that backups still exist in the bowels of the Internet).</p>



<p>When I discovered Scott Alexander in early 2015, the one issue that gave me pause was his strange insistence on maintaining pseudonymity, even as he was already then becoming more and more of a public figure.  In effect, Scott was trying to erect a firewall between his Internet persona and his personal and professional identities, and was <em>relying on the entire world’s goodwill</em> not to breach that firewall.  I thought to myself, “this can’t <em>possibly</em> last!  Scott simply writes too well to evade mainstream notice forever—and once he’s on the world’s radar, he’ll need to make a choice, about who he is and whether he’s ready to own his gifts to posterity under his real name.”  In retrospect, what astonishes me is that Scott has been able to maintain the “double life” for as long as he has!</p>



<p>In his takedown notice, Scott writes that it’s considered vitally important in psychiatry for patients to know almost nothing about their doctors, beyond their names and their areas of expertise.  That caused me to wonder: OK, but doesn’t the world already have enough psychiatrists who are ciphers to their patients?  Would it be so terrible to have one psychiatrist with a clear public persona—possibly even one who patients sought out <em>because</em> of his public persona, because his writings gave evidence that he’d have sympathy or insight about their conditions?  To become a psychiatrist, does one really need to take a lifelong vow of boringness—a vow never to do or say anything notable enough that one would be “outed” to one’s patients?  What would Freud, or Jung, or any of the other famous therapist-intellectuals of times past have thought about such a vow?</p>



<p>Scott also mentions that he’s gotten death threats, and harassing calls to his workplace, from people who hate him because of his blog (and who found his real name by sleuthing).  I wish I knew a solution to that.  For what it’s worth, my blogging has <em>also</em> earned me a death threat, and threats to sue me, and accusatory letters to the president of my university—although in my case, the worst threats came neither from Jew-hating neo-Nazis nor from nerd-bashing SJWs, but from crackpots enraged that I wouldn’t use my blog to credit their proof of P≠NP or their refutation of quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>When I started <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> back in 2005, I remember thinking: this is it.  From now on, the only secrets I’ll have in life will be ephemeral and inconsequential ones.  From this day on, every student in my class, every prospective employer, every woman who I ask on a date (I wasn’t married yet), can know whatever they want to know about my political sympathies, my deepest fears and insecurities, any of it, with a five-second Google search.  Am I ready for that?  I decided that I was—partly just because I‘ve never had the mental space to maintain multiple partitioned identities <em>anyway</em>, to remember what each one is or isn’t allowed to know and say!  I won’t pretend that this is the right decision for everyone, but it was my decision, and I stuck with it, and it wasn’t always easy but I’m still here and so evidently are you.</p>



<p>I’d be <em>overjoyed</em> if Scott Alexander were someday to reach a place in his life where he felt comfortable deciding similarly.  That way, not only could he enjoy the full acclaim that he’s earned for what he’s given to the world, but (much more importantly) his tens of thousands of fans would be able to continue benefitting from his insights.</p>



<p>For now, though, the brute fact is that Scott is obviously <em>not</em> comfortable making that choice.  That being so, it seems to me that, if the NYT was able to respect the pseudonymity of Banksy and many others who it’s reported on in the past, when revealing their real names would serve no public interest, then it should also be able to respect Scott Alexander’s pseudonymity.  Especially now that Scott has sent the most credible signal imaginable of how much he values that pseudonymity, a signal that astonished even me.  The world does not exist only to serve its rare geniuses, but surely it can make such trivial concessions to them.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-093 |  Reduction From Non-Unique Games To Boolean Unique Games | 

	Dana Moshkovitz, 

	Ronen Eldan</title>
    <summary>We reduce the problem of proving a "Boolean Unique Games Conjecture" (with gap $1-\delta$ vs. $1-C\delta$, for any $C&gt; 1$, and sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$) to the problem of proving a PCP Theorem for a certain non-unique game.
In a previous work, Khot and Moshkovitz suggested an inefficient candidate reduction (i.e., without a proof of soundness). 
The current work is the first to provide an efficient reduction along with a proof of soundness. 
The non-unique game we reduce from is similar to non-unique games for which PCP theorems are known.
Our proof relies on a new concentration theorem for functions in Gaussian space that are restricted to a random hyperplane. We bound the typical Euclidean distance between the low degree part of the restriction of the function to the hyperplane and the restriction to the hyperplane of the low degree part of the function.</summary>
