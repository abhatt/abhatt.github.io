    <title>The Complexity of Unavoidable Word Patterns</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Paul Sauer <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07431">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The avoidability, or unavoidability of patterns in words over finite
alphabets has been studied extensively. A word (pattern) over a finite set is
said to be unavoidable if, for all but finitely many words, there exists a
morphism mapping the pattern into every word. We present various
complexity-related properties of unavoidable words. For words that are
unavoidable, we provide an upper bound to the lengths of words that avoid them.
A natural subsequent question is how many unavoidable words there are. We show
that the fraction of words that are unavoidable drops exponentially fast in the
length of the word. This allows us to calculate an upper bound on the number of
unavoidable patterns for any given finite alphabet. Subsequently, we
investigate computational aspects of unavoidable words. In particular, we
exhibit concrete algorithms for determining whether a word is unavoidable. We
also prove results on the computational complexity of the problem of
determining whether a given word is unavoidable.

    <title>Lower bounds for testing graphical models: colorings and antiferromagnetic Ising models</title>

undirected graphical models, where it takes the following form: given the
parameter specification of the model $M$ and a sampling oracle for the
distribution $\mu_{\hat{M}}$ of an unknown model $\hat{M}$, can we efficiently
determine if the two models $M$ and $\hat{M}$ are the same? We consider
identity testing for both soft-constraint and hard-constraint systems. In
particular, we prove hardness results in two prototypical cases, the Ising
model and proper colorings, and explore whether identity testing is any easier
than structure learning.
</p>
<p>For the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model, Daskalasis et al. (2018)
presented a polynomial time algorithm for identity testing. We prove hardness
results in the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) setting in the same regime of
parameters where structure learning is known to require a super-polynomial
number of samples. In particular, for $n$-vertex graphs of maximum degree $d$,
we prove that if $|\beta| d = \omega(\log{n})$ (where $\beta$ is the inverse
temperature parameter), then there is no polynomial running time identity
testing algorithm unless $RP=NP$. We also establish computational lower bounds
for a broader set of parameters under the (randomized) exponential time
hypothesis. Our proofs utilize insights into the design of gadgets using random
graphs in recent works concerning the hardness of approximate counting by Sly
(2010). In the hard-constraint setting, we present hardness results for
identity testing for proper colorings. Our results are based on the presumed
hardness of #BIS, the problem of (approximately) counting independent sets in
bipartite graphs. In particular, we prove that identity testing is hard in the
same range of parameters where structure learning is known to be hard.

    <title>A Space-efficient Parameterized Algorithm for the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem by Dynamic Algebraziation</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1548201600</feedworld_mtime>

be efficiently solvable using dynamic programming for graphs with bounded width
(or depth or some other structural parameter). Dynamic programming is a
well-known approach used for finding exact solutions for NP-hard graph problems
based on tree decompositions. It has been shown that there exist algorithms
using linear time in the number of vertices and single exponential time in the
width (depth or other parameters) of a given tree decomposition for many
connectivity problems. Employing dynamic programming on a tree decomposition
usually uses exponential space. In 2010, Lokshtanov and Nederlof introduced an
elegant framework to avoid exponential space by algebraization. Later, F\"urer
and Yu modified the framework in a way that even works when the underlying set
is dynamic, thus applying it to tree decompositions. In this work, we design
space-efficient algorithms to solve the Hamiltonian Cycle and the Traveling
Salesman problems, using polynomial space while the time complexity is only
slightly increased. This might be inevitable since we are reducing the space
usage from an exponential amount (in dynamic programming solution) to
polynomial. We give an algorithm to solve Hamiltonian cycle in time
$\mathcal{O}((4w)^d\, nM(n\log{n}))$ using $\mathcal{O}(dn\log{n})$ space,
where $M(r)$ is the time complexity to multiply two integers, each of which
being represented by at most $r$ bits. Then, we solve the more general
Traveling Salesman problem in time $\mathcal{O}((4w)^d poly(n))$ using space
$\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}dn\log{n})$, where $w$ and $d$ are the width and the
depth of the given tree decomposition and $\mathcal{W}$ is the sum of weights.
Furthermore, this algorithm counts the number of Hamiltonian Cycles.

Boolean surjective general-valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs),
i.e., VCSPs on two-element domains in which both labels have to be used in a
solution. This result, in addition to identifying the complexity frontier,
features the discovery of a new non-trivial tractable case (called EDS) that
does not appear in the non-surjective setting.
</p>
<p>In this work, we go beyond Boolean domains. As our main result, we introduce
a generalisation of EDS to arbitrary finite domains called SEDS (similar to
EDS) and establish a conditional complexity classification of SEDS VCSPs based
on a reduction to smaller domains. This gives a complete classification of SEDS
VCSPs on three-element domains. The basis of our tractability result is a
natural generalisation of the Min-Cut problem, in which only solutions of
certain size (given by a lower and upper bound) are permitted. We show that all
near-optimal solutions to this problem can be enumerated in polynomial time,
which might be of independent interest.

tours that collectively cover clients in a graph, such that each tour starts
and ends at a specified depot and is subject to a capacity bound on the number
of clients it can serve. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time
approximation scheme (PTAS) for instances in which the input graph is planar
and the capacity is bounded. Previously, only a quasipolynomial-time
approximation scheme was known for these instances. To obtain this result, we
show how to embed planar graphs into bounded-treewidth graphs while preserving,
in expectation, the client-to-client distances up to a small additive error
proportional to client distances to the depot.

on the Powell-Sabin 12-split of a triangle, the so-called S-bases were recently
introduced. These are simplex spline bases with B-spline-like properties on the
12-split of a single triangle, which are tied together across triangles in a
B\'ezier-like manner.
</p>
<p>In this paper we give a formal definition of an S-basis in terms of certain
basic properties. We proceed to investigate the existence of S-bases for the
aforementioned spaces and additionally the cubic case, resulting in an
exhaustive list. From their nature as simplex splines, we derive simple
differentiation and recurrence formulas to other S-bases. We establish a
Marsden identity that gives rise to various quasi-interpolants and domain
points forming an intuitive control net, in terms of which conditions for
$C^0$-, $C^1$-, and $C^2$-smoothness are derived.

problems propose dedicated algorithmic approaches, we propose in this work
mixed integer formulations. We consider a single machine scheduling problem
that aims at minimizing the weighted sum of earliness tardiness penalties
around a common due-date. Using natural variables, we provide one compact
formulation for the unrestrictive case and, for the general case, a non-compact
formulation based on non-overlapping inequalities. We show that the separation
problem related to the latter formulation is solved polynomially. In this
formulation, solutions are only encoded by extreme points. We establish a
theoretical framework to show the validity of such a formulation using
non-overlapping inequalities, which could be used for other scheduling
problems. A Branch-and-Cut algorithm together with an experimental analysis are
proposed to assess the practical relevance of this mixed integer programming

\|x\|_{p}$ such that $A x=b,$ for all $p \in (1,2) \cup (2,\infty).$ Our
algorithms obtain a high accuracy solution in $\tilde{O}_{p}(m^{\frac{|p-2|}{2p
+ |p-2|}}) \le \tilde{O}_{p}(m^{\frac{1}{3}})$ iterations, where each iteration
requires solving an $m \times m$ linear system, $m$ being the dimension of the
ambient space.
</p>
<p>By maintaining an approximate inverse of the linear systems that we solve in
each iteration, we give algorithms for solving $\ell_{p}$-regression to $1 /
\text{poly}(n)$ accuracy that run in time $\tilde{O}_p(m^{\max\{\omega,
7/3\}}),$ where $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication constant. For the current
best value of $\omega &gt; 2.37$, we can thus solve $\ell_{p}$ regression as fast
as $\ell_{2}$ regression, for all constant $p$ bounded away from $1.$
</p>
<p>Our algorithms can be combined with fast graph Laplacian linear equation
solvers to give minimum $\ell_{p}$-norm flow / voltage solutions to $1 /

$\tilde{O}_{p}(m^{1 + \frac{|p-2|}{2p + |p-2|}}) \le

</p>
<p>For sparse graphs and for matrices with similar dimensions, our iteration
counts and running times improve on the $p$-norm regression algorithm by
[Bubeck-Cohen-Lee-Li STOC`18] and general-purpose convex optimization
algorithms. At the core of our algorithms is an iterative refinement scheme for
$\ell_{p}$-norms, using the smoothed $\ell_{p}$-norms introduced in the work of
Bubeck et al. Given an initial solution, we construct a problem that seeks to
minimize a quadratically-smoothed $\ell_{p}$ norm over a subspace, such that a
crude solution to this problem allows us to improve the initial solution by a
constant factor, leading to algorithms with fast convergence.

expansion to obtain a zero-free region for a so-called polymer partition

circumvent the zero-free analysis and the generalisation to complex fugacities,

rational \&amp; $p$-adic. However, modulo prime powers it gets hard as there is
non-unique factorization and a combinatorial blowup ensues. For example, $x^2+p
\bmod p^2$ is irreducible, but $x^2+px \bmod p^2$ has exponentially many
factors! We present the first randomized poly(deg $f, \log p$) time algorithm
to factor a given univariate integral $f(x)$ modulo $p^k$, for a prime $p$ and
$k \leq 4$. Thus, we solve the open question of factoring modulo $p^3$ posed in
(Sircana, ISSAC'17).
</p>
<p>Our method reduces the general problem of factoring $f(x) \bmod p^k$ to that
of {\em root finding} in a related polynomial $E(y) \bmod\langle p^k,
\varphi(x)^\ell \rangle$ for some irreducible $\varphi \bmod p$. We could
efficiently solve the latter for $k\le4$, by incrementally transforming $E(y)$.
Moreover, we discover an efficient and strong generalization of Hensel lifting
to lift factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ to those $\bmod\ p^4$ (if possible). This was
previously unknown, as the case of repeated factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ forbids
classical Hensel lifting.

applications in data science, computer vision, graphics and many other fields.
Generating realistic data is especially challenging since human perception is
highly sensitive to non realistic appearance. In recent times, new levels of
realism have been achieved by advances in GAN training procedures and
architectures. These successful models, however, are tuned mostly for use with
regularly sampled data such as images, audio and video. Despite the successful
application of the architecture on these types of media, applying the same
tools to geometric data poses a far greater challenge. The study of geometric
deep learning is still a debated issue within the academic community as the
lack of intrinsic parametrization inherent to geometric objects prohibits the
direct use of convolutional filters, a main building block of today's machine
learning systems. In this paper we propose a new method for generating
realistic human facial geometries coupled with overlayed textures. We
circumvent the parametrization issue by imposing a global mapping from our data
to the unit rectangle. We further discuss how to design such a mapping to
control the mapping distortion and conserve area within the mapped image. By
representing geometric textures and geometries as images, we are able to use
advanced GAN methodologies to generate new geometries. We address the often
neglected topic of relation between texture and geometry and propose to use
this correlation to match between generated textures and their corresponding
geometries. We offer a new method for training GAN models on partially
corrupted data. Finally, we provide empirical evidence demonstrating our
generative model's ability to produce examples of new identities independent
from the training data while maintaining a high level of realism, two traits
that are often at odds.

the situation where the size of the set to be stored compactly is not known in
advance or can change during the course of the application. We propose a novel
competitor to DBF with the following important property that DBF is not able to
achieve: our structure is able to maintain a bound on the false positive rate
for the set membership query across all possible sizes of sets that are stored
in it. The new data structure we propose is a dynamic structure that we call
Dynamic Partition Bloom filter (DPBF). DPBF is based on our novel concept of a
Bloom partition tree which is a tree structure with standard Bloom filters at
the leaves. DPBF is superior to standard Bloom filters because it can
efficiently handle a large number of unions and intersections of sets of
different sizes while controlling the false positive rate. This makes DPBF the
first structure to do so to the best of our knowledge. We provide theoretical
bounds comparing the false positive probability of DPBF to DBF.

    <title>On Efficient Optimal Transport: An Analysis of Greedy and Accelerated Mirror Descent Algorithms</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1548201600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Lin:Tianyi.html">Tianyi Lin</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Ho:Nhat.html">Nhat Ho</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jordan:Michael_I=.html">Michael I.

optimal transport (OT) problem between two discrete probability measures with
at most $n$ atoms. We show that a greedy variant of the classical Sinkhorn
algorithm, known as the Greenkhorn algorithm, can be improved to
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{n^2}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$, improving on
the best known complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{n^2}{\varepsilon^3}\right)$. Notably, this
matches the best known complexity bound for the Sinkhorn algorithm and helps
explain why the Greenkhorn algorithm can outperform the Sinkhorn algorithm in
practice. Our proof technique, which is based on a primal-dual formulation and
a novel upper bound for the dual solution, also leads to a new class of
algorithms that we refer to as adaptive primal-dual accelerated mirror descent
(APDAMD) algorithms. We prove that the complexity of these algorithms is
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{n^2\gamma^{1/2}}{\varepsilon}\right)$,
where $\gamma&gt;0$ refers to the inverse of the strong convexity module of
Bregman divergence with respect to $\left\|\cdot\right\|_\infty$. This implies
that the APDAMD algorithm is faster than the Sinkhorn and Greenkhorn algorithms
in terms of $\varepsilon$. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate the favorable performance of the Greenkhorn and APDAMD algorithms
in practice.

<p>A few years ago, while attending a Dagstuhl program on Equilibrium Computation, I embarked on one of the traditional long hikes through the beautiful woods surrounding Schloss Dagstuhl and happened to be walking next to a senior member of the Operations Research community. In no time we got immersed in a lively discussion on the style of research going on in Algorithmic Game Theory. We both agreed that the progress made in a matter of a few years was nothing short of phenomenal. At this point, my colleague remarked that AGT was no exception and that when TCS researchers enter a new area, they go in with such energies and enthusiasm that in no time not only is all low hanging fruit gone but in fact the entire area is devoid of any reasonable open problems! “They attack the area like swarms of locusts devouring foliage in biblical lands, consuming not only fruit and leaves but even shrubs and twigs,” he added. “Yes, and only sh*t is left behind!” I chimed in.</p>
<p>As AGT is reaching that stage, with researchers yearning for new issues/problems for their students and their own research and grant proposals, there is a reprieve emerging on the horizon: a program at Simons on “<a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/market2019">Online and Matching-Based Market Design</a>” in Fall 2019.</p>
<p>This is by no means a new area. In fact, the first such market, for matching medical residents to hospitals, dates back to 1920s, well before the classic — and by now Nobel Prize winning — work of Gale and Shapley on the stable matching problem, which provided the canonical algorithm for this market. In recent years, the advent of the Internet and the relocation of our most important activities to online platforms have led to an explosion of such marketplaces (for examples, see the Simons web page) and they have been occupying an ever-increasing fraction of our economy.</p>
<p>AGT, CS and Economics have already had a massive impact via these markets. My own experience comes from Google’s multi-billion dollar Adwords market in which sophisticated algorithmic ideas have also played a central role, e.g., see the Simons talk “<a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/vijay-vazirani-4-30-18">Google’s AdWords Market: How Theory Influenced Practice</a>“.</p>
<p>Clearly, the stakes are high. There is a real opportunity of extending the already existing highly inter-disciplinary theory in substantial ways and making an even bigger impact. Considering this and the enthusiasm of the researchers who have agreed to be participants in this program, Federico Echenique, Nicole Immorlica and I have launched the project of publishing a comprehensive volume of contributed chapters on this topic. More information on this will be coming soon.</p></div>

<p>
Joseph Wedderburn and Leonard Dickson proved Wedderburn’s “Little” Theorem: that every finite ring with the zero-product property is a field. Which of them proved it first is hard to tell.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss the issue of finding simple proofs for simple facts—not just Wedderburn’s theorem but the zero-product property on which it leans.</p>
<p>
Dickson was a professor at the University of Chicago when Wedderburn visited on a Carnegie Fellowship in 1904–05. To <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedderburn's_little_theorem#History">judge</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0CApaWJwry8C&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=In+pursuit+of+the+finite+division+algebra+theorem+and+beyond&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=esoyfvVJAl&amp;sig=ACfU3U0N05-c467jVhDz1ElYLcsE4e_9Og&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRvPv41_3fAhVOnuAKHdy3DgcQ6AEwBXoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=In pursuit of the finite division algebra theorem and beyond&amp;f=false">from</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=O7R-DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=wedderburn+dickson+proofs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VdkQrceyrN&amp;sig=ACfU3U3u7Qn3ibDSszBPg0AitsrXUNUZpA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixkqzl0f3fAhWMTt8KHVo9DVgQ6AEwBnoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wedderburn dickson proofs&amp;f=false">several</a> <a href="https://api.research-repository.uwa.edu.au/portalfiles/portal/9699048/BambergPenttilaRevised.pdf">sources</a>, what happened is that Wedderburn first claimed a proof. Dickson did not believe the <em>result</em> and tried to build a counterexample. Instead he found a lemma that convinced him it was true and used it to give a simpler proof. They gave back-to-back presentations on 20 January, 1905, Wedderburn wrote up his paper with his proof and two more based on the lemma, which Wedderburn ascribed to an earlier paper by George Birkhoff and Harry Vandiver. Dickson wrote a paper with his approach, saying in a footnote:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> First proved by Wedderburn … Following my simpler proof above, and using the same lemma, Wedderburn constructed two further simpler proofs. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
However, Wedderburn’s first proof was found to have a gap. As <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/lag/man/099.pdf">detailed</a> by Michael Adam and Birte Specht, the gap was a statement that was not false <em>per se</em> but whose vague argument used only properties from a class of weaker structures in which it can fail. So:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Who first proved the theorem? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Other Proofs, Other Properties </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our sources linked above differ on whether the gap was noticed at the time or anytime before Emil Artin remarked on it in 1927. Artin didn’t discuss the gap but gave his own proof instead. There <a>seems</a> <a href="https://www.theoremoftheday.org/Docs/WedderburnShamil.pdf">to</a> <a href="https://ysharifi.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/wedderburns-little-theorem-1/">be</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedderburn's_little_theorem#Proof">consensus</a> that the “proof from the Book” was <a href="http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~hfinkeln/seminarium/eindige_delingsring_is_lichaam.pdf">given</a> by Ernst Witt four years later in 1931. But two other proofs, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2311457?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">by</a> Israel Herstein and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/glasgow-mathematical-journal/article/grouptheoretic-proof-of-a-theorem-of-maclaganwedderburn/7BBA5D9EA9EDEE000BAE4859EDE64DA6">by</a> Hans Zassenhaus, receive prominent mention. </p>
<p>
As our sources attest, interest in finding other proofs continues. The surprise in the theorem, which is that finiteness and the zero-product property force the multiplication to be commutative, informs what happens in other mathematical structures. Proofs that draw on results about these structures create connections among many areas. The shortest proof drawing on deeper results was a two-page <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2312328">paper</a> in the summer 1964 <em>Monthly</em> by Theodore Kaczynski (of <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/unabomber">ill</a> <a href="https://www.biography.com/news/unabomber-ted-kaczynski-today">note</a>). We won’t try to compare all these proofs, but will try to flip the question by focusing on the other property involved—the zero-product property:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If <img alt="{a \cdot b = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Ccdot+b+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a \cdot b = 0}"/> then <img alt="{a = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a = 0}"/> or <img alt="{b = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b = 0}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>

Given a ring <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> with this property, how easy is it to prove? If <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> has inverses then it is immediate, else multiplying both sides of <img alt="{a\cdot b = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5Ccdot+b+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a\cdot b = 0}"/> by <img alt="{a^{-1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a^{-1}}"/> in front and <img alt="{b^{-1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b^{-1}}"/> in back would yield the contradiction <img alt="{1 = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1 = 0}"/>. And we know if <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> is finite then this property makes it a field. So our quest for a different angle leads us to thinking about infinite rings. </p>
<p>
Incidentally, a ring with the zero-product property is called a <em>domain</em>. If the multiplication is commutative then it is an <em>integral domain</em>, though Serge Lang preferred the term <em>entire ring</em>. Our example goes beyond the integers though.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> No Zero-Divisors I </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A natural example that arises is the ring of integer polynomials over multiple variables. Thus for two variables <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y}"/> the elements of this ring are 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}x^{i}y^{j}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+c_%7Bij%7Dx%5E%7Bi%7Dy%5E%7Bj%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}x^{i}y^{j}. "/></p>
<p>It is easy to see that they form a ring with the usual high school rules for adding and multiplying polynomials. The ring is an integral domain in general.</p>
<p>
To show this, we claim that it has no zero-divisors. Suppose that it does: let <img alt="{f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29+%5Ccdot+g%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y) = 0}"/>. Then let 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = \sum_{k} f_{k}(x) y^{k}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+f_%7Bk%7D%28x%29+y%5E%7Bk%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = \sum_{k} f_{k}(x) y^{k}, "/></p>
<p>and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  g(x,y) = \sum_{k} g_{k}(x) y^{k}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+g_%7Bk%7D%28x%29+y%5E%7Bk%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  g(x,y) = \sum_{k} g_{k}(x) y^{k}. "/></p>
<p>Assume that the maximum degree in <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> for <img alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x,y)}"/> is <img alt="{df}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bdf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{df}"/> and is <img alt="{dg}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bdg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{dg}"/> for <img alt="{g(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g(x,y)}"/>. Then <img alt="{f_{df}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bdf%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{df}(x)}"/> and <img alt="{g_{df}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg_%7Bdf%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g_{df}(x)}"/> are both non-zero polynomials in one variable. It is clear by induction that <img alt="{f_{df}(x) \cdot g_{dg}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bdf%7D%28x%29+%5Ccdot+g_%7Bdg%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{df}(x) \cdot g_{dg}(x)}"/> is not zero. This proves the claim.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> No Zero-Divisors II </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The trouble with the above property of polynomials is that it is only about formal objects. In many applications to computer science we want to view polynomials as objects that can be evaluated. So a natural issue is a slightly different property: Suppose that <img alt="{F(x,y,\dots)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%2Cy%2C%5Cdots%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(x,y,\dots)}"/> and <img alt="{G(x,y,\dots)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%28x%2Cy%2C%5Cdots%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G(x,y,\dots)}"/> are two integral polynomials. Suppose further that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(a,b,\dots) \cdot G(a,b,\dots) = 0, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28a%2Cb%2C%5Cdots%29+%5Ccdot+G%28a%2Cb%2C%5Cdots%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(a,b,\dots) \cdot G(a,b,\dots) = 0, "/></p>
<p>for all integers <img alt="{a,b,\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a,b,\dots}"/>. Then it clearly must be the case that either <img alt="{F=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F=0}"/> identically or <img alt="{G=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G=0}"/> identically. Right?</p>
<p>
The trouble is that this seems to be obvious but how do we prove that it is true? Note, it must be the case that some use of the fact that <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> and <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> are polynomials. The fact is not true for more complex functions. For example, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \cos(\pi x) \cdot \sin(\pi x) = 0, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Ccos%28%5Cpi+x%29+%5Ccdot+%5Csin%28%5Cpi+x%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \cos(\pi x) \cdot \sin(\pi x) = 0, "/></p>
<p>for all integers <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. But neither the function <img alt="{\cos(\pi x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccos%28%5Cpi+x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cos(\pi x)}"/> nor <img alt="{\sin(\pi x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csin%28%5Cpi+x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sin(\pi x)}"/> is identically zero for all integers.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Proof </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is a relatively simple proof of the fact. It uses the famous Schwarz-Zippel (SZ) Theorem. See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">here</a> for our discussion of the theorem. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Let <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> be in <img alt="{\mathbb{F}[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5Bx_1%2Cx_2%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_n%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{F}[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]}"/> be a non-zero polynomial of total degree <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> over a field <img alt="{\mathbb{F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{F}}"/>. Let <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> be a finite subset of <img alt="{\mathbb{F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{F}}"/> and let <img alt="{r_{1},\dots,r_{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_%7B1%7D%2C%5Cdots%2Cr_%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_{1},\dots,r_{n}}"/> be selected at random independently and uniformly from <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/>. Then 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \Pr[P(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)=0] \leq \frac{d}{|S|}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CPr%5BP%28r_1%2Cr_2%2C%5Cldots%2Cr_n%29%3D0%5D+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7B%7CS%7C%7D.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \Pr[P(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n)=0] \leq \frac{d}{|S|}. "/></p>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The S-Z lemma of course has manifest applications throughout complexity theory. Often it is used in design of randomized algorithms. What we found interesting is that here we use it for a different purpose: to prove a structural property of polynomials.</p>
<p>
Back to our fact. Assume that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(a,b) \cdot G(a,b) = 0, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28a%2Cb%29+%5Ccdot+G%28a%2Cb%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(a,b) \cdot G(a,b) = 0, "/></p>
<p>for all integers <img alt="{a \in S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Cin+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a \in S}"/> and <img alt="{b \in S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%5Cin+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b \in S}"/> for some finite set. Now either <img alt="{F(a, b)=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28a%2C+b%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(a, b)=0}"/> or <img alt="{G(a, b)=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%28a%2C+b%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G(a, b)=0}"/> must be true for at least one half of the values in <img alt="{S \times S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS+%5Ctimes+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S \times S}"/>. Assume that it is <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/>. Then by the S-Z theorem it must be that <img alt="{F=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F=0}"/> always if the set <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> is large enough. Therefore, the fact is proved.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is there a simpler proof of this key fact? Is it possible to find an easier reference in the literature of this basic fact of polynomials? We have yet to discover one—any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>ACM prize and some thoughts on the Godel Prize</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
<br/>
As Lance Tweeted, and I will re-iterate, nominations for the following prizes<br/>
are due soon and you can nominate people <a href="https://sigact.org/articles/prizes.html">here</a><br/>
<br/>
Godel Prize for outstanding paper in TCS. (Godel mentioned P vs NP in a letter to Von Neuman. I've heard it said that its too bad they didn't work on it-- either it would be solved or we'd know its hard. Frankly, I think enough smart people have worked on it that we already know its hard.)<br/>
<br/>
Knuth Prize for outstanding contributions to foundations of Computer Science. (its a greater honor to have a prize  named after you in your lifetime then to win a prize!)<br/>
<br/>
Dijkstra Prize (I wonder if having `ijk' in his name inspired him to work in algorithms)<br/>
<br/>
Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award.<br/>
<br/>
Lawler Award for Humanitarian Contributions within CS and Informatics.<br/>
<br/>
ACM Distinguished Service Award<br/>
<br/>
Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award (best student paper at STOC)<br/>
<br/>
The Best Paper award (Best paper at STOC, Best paper at FOCS)<br/>
<br/>
(The last two I doubt you can nominate someone for.)<br/>
<br/>
A few thoughts on the Godel Prize:<br/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
1) You can win the Godel Prize twice and some people have: Goldwasser, Hastad, Arora, Szegedy, Spielman, Teng. Spielman-Teng have won it as a team twice.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
2) GLAD there is no limit to how many can win. If a paper has a lot of people on it (and this has happened) then FINE, they're all winners! According to The Big Bang THeory (the TV show, not the theory) in Physics at most 3 can win it in a given year.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
3) I either knew and forgot or never knew that DPDA Equiv is decidable! Glad to now it just in time for teaching Automata theory this spring.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
4) Looking over the list reminded me that there are some papers in the intersection of those I want to read and those I am able to read! Though not many. Most I want to read but they seem hard.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
5) The Kanellakis award is for theory that is PRACTICAL. Could someone win a Godel AND a Kannellakis award for the same paper (or set of papers). I found one sort-of case ( (a) below) and one definite case ( (b) below).</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
a) Moshe and Wolpert won the 2000 Godel Prize for Temporal Logic and Finite Automata (I should also read that before my class starts)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Holtzmann, Kurshan, Vardi, and Wolpert won the 2005 Kanellakis prize for Formal Verification Tools.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I assume the two works are related.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
b) Freund and Schapire won the 2003 Godel Prize and the 2004 Kanellakis Award, both for their work on boosting in Machine Learning.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
6) Why is it the  Godel <i>Prize </i>and the Kanellakis <i>Award? </i>What is the diff between a prize and an award? A quick Google Search says that an Award is a token of effort and merit, while a Prize is something you win in a competition. I doubt that applies. I suspect they are called Prize and Award from historical accident. Does anyone know?</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
</div></div>

    <title>TR19-008 |  Efficiently factoring polynomials modulo $p^4$ | 

	Ashish Dwivedi, 

	Rajat Mittal, 

	Nitin Saxena</title>
    <summary>Polynomial factoring has famous practical algorithms over fields-- finite, rational \&amp; $p$-adic. However, modulo prime powers it gets hard as there is non-unique factorization and a combinatorial blowup ensues. For example, $x^2+p \bmod p^2$ is irreducible, but $x^2+px \bmod p^2$ has exponentially many factors! We present the first randomized poly($\deg f, \log p$) time algorithm to factor a given univariate integral $f(x)$ modulo $p^k$, for a prime $p$ and $k \leq 4$. Thus, we solve the open question of factoring modulo $p^3$ posed in (Sircana, ISSAC'17). 

Our method reduces the general problem of factoring $f(x) \bmod p^k$ to that of {\em root finding} in a related polynomial $E(y) \bmod\langle p^k, \varphi(x)^\ell \rangle$ for some irreducible $\varphi \bmod p$. We could efficiently solve the latter for $k\le4$, by incrementally transforming $E(y)$. Moreover, we discover an efficient and strong generalization of Hensel lifting to lift factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ to those  $\bmod\ p^4$ (if possible). This was previously unknown, as the case of repeated factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ forbids classical Hensel lifting.</summary>

<p><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/noahmiller/files/firewall.pdf">Black Holes, Hawking Radiation, and the Firewall</a></p>



<p>There are many different types of “theoretical physicists.” There are theoretical astrophysicists, theoretical condensed matter physicists, and even theoretical biophysicists. However, the general public seems to be most interested in the exploits of what you might call “theoretical high energy theorists.” (Think Stephen Hawking.)</p>



<p>The holy grail for theoretical high energy physicists (who represent only a small fraction of all physicists) would be to find a theory of quantum gravity. As it stands now, physicists have two theories of nature: quantum field theory (or, more specifically, the “Standard Model”) and Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Quantum field theory describes elementary particles, like electrons, photons, quarks, gluons, etc. General relativity describes the force of gravity, which is really just a consequence of the curvature of spacetimes. </p>



<p>Sometimes people like to say that quantum field theory describes “small stuff” like particles, while general relativity describes “big stuff” like planets and stars. This is maybe not the best way to think about it, though, because planets and stars are ultimately just made out of a bunch of quantum particles.</p>



<p>Theoretical physicists are unhappy with having two theories of nature. In order to describe phenomena that depend on both quantum field theory and general relativity, the two theories must be combined in an “ad hoc” way. A so-called “theory of everything,” another name for the currently unknown theory of “quantum gravity,” would hypothetically be able to describe all the phenomena we know about. Just so we’re all on the same page, they don’t even have a fuly worked out hypothesis. (“String theory,” a popular candidate, is still not even a complete “theory” in the normal sense of the word, although it could become one eventually.)</p>



<p>So what should these high energy theoretical physicists do if they want to discover what this theory of quantum gravity is? For the time being, nobody can think up an experiment that would be sensitive to quantum gravitation effects which is feasible with current technology. We are limited to so-called “thought experiments.”</p>



<p>This brings us to Hawking radiation. In the 1970’s, Stephen Hawking considered what would happen to a black hole once quantum field theory was properly taken into account. (Of course, this involved a bit of “ad hoc” reasoning, as mentioned previously.) Hawking found that, much to everybody’s surprise, the black hole evaporated, realeasing energy in the form of “Hawking radiation” (mostly low energy photons). More strangely, this radiation comes out exactly in the spectrum you would expect from something “hot.” For example, imagine heating a piece of metal. At low temperatures, it emits low energy photons invisible to the human eye. Once it gets hotter, it glows red, then yellow, then perhaps eventually blue. The spectrum of light emitted follows a very specific pattern. Amazingly, Hawking found that the radiation which black holes emit follow the exact same pattern. By analogy, they have a temperature too!</p>



<p>This is more profound than you might realize. This is because things which have an temperature should also have an “entropy.” You see, there are two notions of “states” in physics: “microstates” and “macrostates.” A microstate gives you the complete physical information of what comprises a physical system. For example, imagine you have a box of gas, which contains many particles moving in a seemingly random manner. A “microstate” of this box would be a list of all the positions and momenta of every last particle in that box. This would be impossible to measure in pratice. A “macrostate,” on the other hand, is a set of microstates. You may not know what the exact microstate your box of gas is in, but you can measure macroscopic quantities (like the total internal energy, volume, particle number) and consider the set of all possible microstates with those measured quantities.</p>



<p>The “entropy” of a macrostate is the logarithm of the number of possible microstates. If black holes truly are thermodynamic systems with some entropy, that means there should be some “hidden variables” or microstates to the black hole that we currently don’t understand. Perhaps if we understood the microstates of the black hole, we would be much closer to understanding quantum gravity!</p>



<p>However, Hawking also discovered something else. Because the black hole is radiating out energy, its mass will actually decrease as time goes on. Eventually, it should disappear entirely. This means that the information of what went into the black hole will be lost forever.</p>



<p>Physicists did not like this, however, because it seemed to them that the information of what went into the black hole should never be lost. Many physicists believe that the information of what went into the black hole should somehow be contained in the outgoing Hawking radiation, although they do not currently understand how. According to Hawking’s original calculation, the Hawking radiation only depends on a parameters of the black hole (like its mass) and have nothing to do with the many finer details on what went in, the exact “microstate” of what went in.</p>



<p>However, physicists eventually realized a problem with the idea that the black hole releases its information in the form of outgoing Hawking radiation. The problem has to do with quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, it is impossible to clone a qubit. That means that if you threw a qubit in a black hole and then waited for it to eventually come out in the form of Hawking radiation, then the qubit could no longer be “inside” the black hole. However, if Einstein is to be believed, you should also be able to jump into the black hole and see the qubit on the inside. This seems to imply that the qubit is cloned, as it is present on both the inside and outside of the black hole.</p>



<p>Physicists eventually came up with a strange fix called “Black Hole Complementarity” (BHC). According to BHC, according to people outside the black hole, the interior does not exist. Also, according to people who have entered the black hole, the outside ceases to exist. Both descriptions of the world are “correct” because once someone has entered the black hole, they will be unable to escape and compare notes with the person on the outside.</p>



<p>Of course, it must be emphasized that BHC remains highly hypothetical. People have been trying to poke holes in it for a long time. The largest hole is the so called “Firewall Paradox,” first proposed in 2012. Essentially, the Firewall paradox tries to show that the paradigm of BHC is self-contradictory.  In fact, it was able to use basic quantum mechanics to show that, under some reasonable assumptions, the interior of the black hole <em>truly</em> doesn’t exist, and that anyone who tries to enter would be fried at an extremely hot “firewall!” Now, I don’t think most physicists actually believe that black holes really have a firewall (although this might depend on what day of the week you ask them). The interesting thing about the Firewall paradox is that it derives a seemingly crazy result from seemingly harmless starting suppositions. So these suppositions would have to be tweaked in the theory of quantum gravity order to get rid of the firewall.</p>



<p>This is all to say that all this thinking about black holes really might help physicists figure out something about quantum gravity. (Then again, who can really say for sure.)</p>



<p>If you would like to know more about the Firewall paradox, I suggest you read my notes, pasted at the top of this post!</p>



<p>The goal of the notes was to write an introduction to the Black Hole Information Paradox and Firewall Paradox that could be read by computer scientists with no physics background.</p>



<p>The structure of the notes goes as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Special relativity</li><li>General relativity</li><li>Quantum Field Theory (in which I ambitiously tell you what QFT actually is!)</li><li>Statistical Mechanics (this is the best part)</li><li>Hawking radiation</li><li>The information paradox</li></ol>



<p>Because the information paradox touches on all areas of physics, I thought it was necessary to take “zero background, infinite intelligence” approach, introducing the all the necessary branches of physics (GR, QFT, Stat Mech) in order to understand what the deal with Hawking radiation really is, and why physicists think it is so important. I think it is safe to say that if you read these notes, you’ll learn a non-trivial amount of physics.</p></div>

    <title>Orientations of infinite graphs</title>
    <summary>An orientation of an undirected graph is the directed graph that you get by assigning a direction to each edge. Several kinds of orientations have been studied. For instance, in a graph with even vertex degrees, an Eulerian orientation makes the numbers of incoming and outgoing degrees equal at each vertex. In a bridgeless graph, a strong orientation makes the resulting directed graph strongly connected. In finite connected graphs, every Eulerian orientation is strong, but that is untrue in infinite graphs. Consider, for instance, the graph of unit distances on the integers, which is Eulerian (every vertex has degree two) but has no strong orientation (every edge is a bridge). Even when a strong orientation exists, an Eulerian orientation might not be strong: the graph of distance-1 and distance-2 integers, with the orientation from smaller to larger numbers, is Eulerian but not strong. So when does an Eulerian strong orientation exist? The answer turns out to be: whenever the obvious obstacles are not present. Every bridgeless connected even-degree infinite graph has an Eulerian strong orientation.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(graph_theory)">orientation</a> of an undirected graph is the directed graph that you get by assigning a direction to each edge. Several kinds of orientations have been studied. For instance, in a graph with even vertex degrees, an Eulerian orientation makes the numbers of incoming and outgoing degrees equal at each vertex.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="For infinite graphs, Eulerian orientations might not be strong" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/euler-not-strong.svg"/></p>

<p>To prove this, we can use a convenient tool for dealing with infinite orientations by looking only at finite graphs, a result of Rado from 1949 that is simultaneously a predecessor and generalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s_theorem_(graph_theory)">De Bruijn–Erdős theorem on graph colorings</a>. Suppose each element in some infinite set  has a finite set of labels, and we choose an assignment of labels for each finite subset of . These choices may be inconsistent with each other, so there may be no way of labeling all of  consistently with all of the choices. But Rado proved (assuming the axiom of choice) that there exists a global labeling that, on every finite subset, is consistent with the assignment to one of its finite supersets. Another way of thinking about this is that if certain finite patterns must be avoided, and every finite subset has a labeling that avoids them, then some global labeling will also avoid them.<sup id="fnref:rado"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/orientations-infinite-graphs.html#fn:rado">1</a></sup> The De Bruijn–Erdős theorem is the case where the elements are vertices, the labels are colors, and the patterns to be avoided are pairs of equal color on adjacent vertices. In our case the set elements will be edges, the labels will be which way to orient each edge, and the choice of assignment will be some way of defining a “good” orientation for finite subgraphs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Graph vertices can be labeled by color; edges, by orientation" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/graph-labels.svg"/></p>

<p>So suppose we’re given a finite subgraph  of an infinite 2-edge-connected even-degree graph. What kind of orientation on  should we look for? A complication is that  might have bridges or odd-degree vertices. So we’ll try to come as close as we can to what we want, an Eulerian strong orientation, while taking those deficiencies into account. Let’s define a good orientation of  to be an orientation that is almost Eulerian, in that at each vertex the in-degree and out-degree differ by at most one, and almost strong, in that each edge of  that belongs to an undirected cycle also belongs to a directed cycle. Another way of stating the almost strong condition is that the strongly connected components of the oriented graph should coincide with the 2-edge-connected components, or blocks, of the undirected graph.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A good orientation of a graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/good-orientation.svg"/></p>

<p>The existence of a good orientation of an arbitrary finite undirected graph (also having some other stronger properties) was proven in the 1960s by Nash-Williams.<sup id="fnref:nw"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/orientations-infinite-graphs.html#fn:nw">2</a></sup> But now Rado’s method proves that every infinite graph also has a good orientation. If we find a global orientation that’s nearly-Eulerian on a supergraph of the star of neighbors of every vertex, then it must be nearly-Eulerian. And if it’s almost strong on a supergraph of every cycle, then it must be almost strong. This proves the theorem that a bridgeless connected even-degree infinite graph has an Eulerian strong orientation, because every good orientation in these graphs must be Eulerian and strong. Nash-Williams already considered the infinite case of his orientation theorem, but wrote that the details were too heavy to include. Perhaps he didn’t know about Rado’s theorem (despite it being published in the same journal), which makes the extension from finite to infinite easy.</p>

<p>The same method of extending finite to infinite orientations can also be used to study notions of graph sparseness including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboricity">arboricity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)">degeneracy</a>, and pseudoarboricity. Historically the pseudoarboricity of infinite graphs was first. A graph has pseudoarboricity at most  if it can be oriented so that each vertex has out-degree  (or equivalently if it can be partitioned into subgraphs each with out-degree one). In the 1950 paper in which he first announced the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem, Erdős used it to prove that, when such an orientation is given, the resulting graph can be -colored.<sup id="fnref:e"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/orientations-infinite-graphs.html#fn:e">3</a></sup> But he didn’t write about the conditions under which such an orientation exists. Rado’s theorem shows that they are the same as in the finite case: an outdegree- orientation exists if and only if every finite -vertex subgraph has at most  edges.</p>

<p>A graph has degeneracy at most  if it has an acyclic orientation so that each vertex has out-degree . Unlike in the finite case, infinite graphs with low degeneracy might have high minimum degree; for instance, there exist graphs with degeneracy one in which all vertices have infinite degree. A finite -degenerate graph can be -colored greedily, and the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem shows that even in the infinite case such a coloring exists. Rado’s theorem shows that infinite graphs with pseudoarboricity  are -degenerate, and that a graph is -degenerate if and only if every finite subgraph has a vertex with degree at most . As in the case of Eulerian strong orientations, this involves checking the orientation only on two kinds of finite subgraphs, stars and cycles.</p>

<p>Arboricity is based on forests and there are multiple incompatible definitions of infinite forests. But the one we want to use is that a forest is a 1-degenerate graph. A graph has arboricity  if its edges can be partitioned into  forests. This is clearly at least as large as the degeneracy (no Rado needed). Rado’s theorem shows that infinite graphs with arboricity  are -degenerate, and that a graph has arboricity at most  if and only if every finite -vertex subset has at most  edges.</p>

<br/>Computer scientists tend to obsess about privacy and we've had a privacy/security debate for decades now. But now machine learning has really given us a whole new spin on what privacy protects and takes away.<br/>
<div>
<br/>
I take an open approach and basically allow Google to know everything about my life. Google knows where I've been--sometimes my Pixel asks me which store in a shopping center I visited and I give up that info. Google knows who I communicate with, what websites I visit, what music and movies I listen to and watch, all my photos, what temperature makes me comfortable and so on.<br/>
<br/>
What do I get? A Google ecosystem that knows me sometimes better than I know myself. Google works best when it learns and integrates. I get asked to download maps for trips Google knows I'm about to take. I have Google assistant throughout my house, in my phone, in my car and it tailor answers and sometimes even the questions that I need answers to. If anything I wish there was further integration, like Google Voice should ring my office phone only when I'm in the office.<br/>
<br/>
Georgia Tech now forces us to use Microsoft Exchange for email. Outlook is not a bad email program but its capabilities, especially for search, does not work as well and think of all that unused knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I trust Google to keep my information safe, with a random password and 2-factor encryption and even if someone would manage to break in they would find I'm a pretty boring person with an unhealthy obsession of opera (the musical form not the browser).<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't work for everyone and companies should make it easy to keep your info secure. But I say go use your machine learning on me and find ways to make my life easier and more fun, and sure send me some targeted ads as payment. The Internets will find a way to discover you anyway, might as well take advantage. </div></div>

    <title>TR19-007 |  Lower Bounds for Linear Decision Lists | 

	Arkadev Chattopadhyay, 

	Meena Mahajan, 

	Nikhil Mande, 

	Nitin Saurabh</title>
    <summary>We demonstrate a lower bound technique for linear decision lists, which are decision lists where the queries are arbitrary linear threshold functions.
We use this technique to prove an explicit lower bound by showing that any linear decision list computing the function $MAJ \circ XOR$ requires size $2^{0.18 n}$.  This completely answers an open question of Tur{\'a}n and Vatan [FoCM'97]. We also show that the spectral classes $PL_1, PL_\infty$, and the polynomial threshold function classes $\widehat{PT}_1, PT_1$,  are incomparable to linear decision lists.</summary>

    <summary>We show that any Boolean function with approximate rank $r$ can be computed by bounded error quantum protocols without prior entanglement of complexity $O( \sqrt{r} \log r)$. In addition, we show that any Boolean function with approximate rank $r$ and discrepancy $\delta$ can be computed by deterministic protocols of complexity $O(r)$, and private coin bounded error randomized protocols of complexity $O((\frac{1}{\delta})^2 + \log r)$. Our results yield lower bounds on approximate rank. We also obtain a strengthening of Newman's theorem with respect to approximate rank.</summary>

    <title>TR19-005 |  An Exponential Lower Bound on the Sub-Packetization of MSR Codes | 

	Omar Alrabiah, 

	Venkatesan Guruswami</title>
    <summary>An $(n,k,\ell)$-vector MDS code is a $\mathbb{F}$-linear subspace of $(\mathbb{F}^\ell)^n$ (for some field $\mathbb{F}$) of dimension $k\ell$, such that any $k$ (vector) symbols of the codeword suffice to determine the remaining $r=n-k$ (vector) symbols. The length $\ell$ of each codeword symbol is called the sub-packetization of the code. Such a code is called minimum storage regenerating (MSR), if any single symbol of a codeword can be recovered by downloading $\ell/r$ field elements (which is known to be the least possible) from each of the other symbols.

MSR codes are attractive for use in distributed storage systems, and by now a variety of ingenious constructions of MSR codes are available. However, they all suffer from exponentially large sub-packetization of at least $r^{k/r}$. Our main result is an almost tight lower bound showing that for an MSR code, one must have $\ell \ge \exp(\Omega(k/r))$. Previously, a lower bound of $\approx \exp(\sqrt{k/r})$, and a tight lower bound for a restricted class of optimal access MSR codes, were known. Our work settles a key question concerning MSR codes that has received much attention, with a short proof hinging on one key definition that is somewhat inspired by Galois theory.</summary>
