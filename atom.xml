</p><p><b> Ken is a Mathematician </b></p>
<p/><p>
Ken is of course a co-author of this blog. We try to cover computer science and mathematics, but we are open to other areas. Ken started his career in Mathematics; he obtained a PhD in math from Oxford University in 1986. It was under Dominic Welsh and was tilted: <i>On the separation of complexity classes</i>. Welsh’s family tree is <a href="https://users.monash.edu.au/~davidwo/files/Welsh-FamilyTree.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is a Programmer </b></p>
<p/><p>
Ken is of course famous for being one of the world’s top chess cheating detectors. Recall to cheat at chess is to use a computer program to make your moves in a game against a human opponent. This is strictly illegal. </p>
<p>
Ken was featured on the cover in <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/personal/JuneCLarticleKWR.pdf">chess review</a>. His work gets critic review <a href="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/44719/">here</a> by David Barnes and Julio Hernandez-Castro in the 2015 article <i>On the limits of engine analysis for cheating detection in chess</i> in the journal Computers and Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is Unique </b></p>
<p/><p>
Ken is special in many ways. He is smart, he is a wonderful partner, and he is a great friend. I would claim that he is one of the few people that have the following three properties:</p>
<ol>
<li> He is an international master in chess of rating <img alt="{2372}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2372%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>;
</li><li> He is a strong researcher in complexity theory;
</li><li> He is a terrific programmer.
</li></ol>
<p>
The last I would claim is pretty remarkable. There are many strong chess players, there are many of us working in complexity theory. But few have written as much production quality code as Ken has. For his work on chess cheating he has had to write thousands of lines of code. This code must run fast, and be correct. The latter, correctness, is really important. This since his work on detecting cheating has led players to be suspended from chess for years. It also has helped protect players who did not cheat, even though many thought they had. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Again I wish him a wonderful unbirthday day.</p>

<h2>Breakthroughs — Locally Testable Codes with Constant Rate, Distance, and Locality</h2>



<p>Oct 6, 2021 10:00 am – 11:00 am </p>



<h3/>



<p>Speaker: </p>



<p><a href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dinuri/">Irit Dinur</a> (Weizmann Institute of Science) </p>



<p>A locally testable code (LTC) is an error-correcting code together with a property tester. The tester reads a few random bits in the received word and decides if the word is in the code. </p>



<p>LTCs were initially studied as essential components of PCPs, and since then the topic has evolved on its own. High rate LTCs could be useful in practice: before attempting to decode a received word, one can save time by first quickly testing if it is close to the code. </p>



<p>An outstanding open question has been whether there exist LTCs  that are “good” in the coding theory sense of having both constant relative distance and rate, and at the same time testable with a <em><strong>constant</strong></em> number of queries.</p>



<p>In this talk, Irit Dinur will describe a construction of such codes based on a new object which she and her collaborators call Square Cayley Complex. </p>



<p>Joint work with Shai Evra, Ron Livne, Alex Lubotzky, and Shahar Mozes.</p>

    <title>Vertex Fault-Tolerant Emulators</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bodwin:Greg.html">Greg Bodwin</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Dinitz:Michael.html">Michael Dinitz</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nazari:Yasamin.html">Yasamin Nazari</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08042">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A $k$-spanner of a graph $G$ is a sparse subgraph that preserves its shortest
path distances up to a multiplicative stretch factor of $k$, and a $k$-emulator
is similar but not required to be a subgraph of $G$. A classic theorem by
Thorup and Zwick [JACM '05] shows that, despite the extra flexibility available
to emulators, the size/stretch tradeoffs for spanners and emulators are
equivalent. Our main result is that this equivalence in tradeoffs no longer
holds in the commonly-studied setting of graphs with vertex failures. That is:
we introduce a natural definition of vertex fault-tolerant emulators, and then
we show a three-way tradeoff between size, stretch, and fault-tolerance for
these emulators that polynomially surpasses the tradeoff known to be optimal
for spanners.
</p>
<p>We complement our emulator upper bound with a lower bound construction that
is essentially tight (within $\log n$ factors of the upper bound) when the
stretch is $2k-1$ and $k$ is either a fixed odd integer or $2$. We also show
constructions of fault-tolerant emulators with additive error, demonstrating
that these also enjoy significantly improved tradeoffs over those available for
fault-tolerant additive spanners.

Satisfaction Problem PCSP(A,B) asks whether a given input structure maps
homomorphically to A or does not even map to B. We are promised that the input
satisfies exactly one of these two cases.
</p>
<p>If there exists a structure C with homomorphisms $A\to C\to B$, then
PCSP(A,B) reduces naturally to CSP(C). To the best of our knowledge all known
tractable PCSPs reduce to tractable CSPs in this way. However Barto showed that
some PCSPs over finite structures A, B require solving CSPs over infinite C. We
show that even when such a reduction to finite C is possible, this structure
may become arbitrarily large.
</p>
<p>For every integer $n&gt;1$ and every prime p we give A, B of size n with a
single relation of arity $n^p$ such that PCSP(A, B) reduces via a chain of
homomorphisms $ A\to C\to B$ to a tractable CSP over some C of size p but not
over any smaller structure. In a second family of examples, for every prime
$p\geq 7$ we construct A, B of size $p-1$ with a single ternary relation such
that PCSP(A, B) reduces via $A\to C\to B$ to a tractable CSP over some C of
size p but not over any smaller structure. In contrast we show that if A, B are
graphs and PCSP(A,B) reduces to tractable CSP(C) for some finite C, then
already A or B has tractable CSP. This extends results and answers a question
of Deng et al.

    <title>A Quadratic Time Locally Optimal Algorithm for NP-hard Equal Cardinality Partition Optimization</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1631836800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Kaan Gokcesu, Hakan Gokcesu <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07882">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the optimization version of the equal cardinality set partition
problem (where the absolute difference between the equal sized partitions' sums
are minimized). While this problem is NP-hard and requires exponential
complexity to solve in general, we have formulated a weaker version of this
NP-hard problem, where the goal is to find a locally optimal solution. The
local optimality considered in our work is under any swap between the opposing
partitions' element pairs. To this end, we designed an algorithm which can
produce such a locally optimal solution in $O(N^2)$ time and $O(N)$ space. Our
approach does not require positive or integer inputs and works equally well
under arbitrary input precisions. Thus, it is widely applicable in different
problem scenarios.

convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations require the
evaluation of the signs of determinants, which are sums of products. The same
signs are needed for the exact solution of linear programming problems and
systems of linear inequalities. Computing these signs exactly with inexact
floating point arithmetic is challenging, and we present yet another algorithm
for this task. Our algorithm is efficient and uses only of floating point
arithmetic, which is much faster than exact arithmetic. We prove that the
algorithm is correct and provide efficient and tested C++ code for it.

secure search. Compared to other secure search systems, no costly setup
procedure is necessary; it is sufficient for the client merely to upload the
encrypted database to the server. Confidentiality is provided because the
server works only on the encrypted query and records. While the search
functionality is enabled by the full homomorphism of the encryption scheme.
</p>
<p>For this reason, researchers have been paying increasing attention to this
problem. Since Akavia et al. (CCS 2018) presented a framework for secure search
on FHE encrypted data and gave a working implementation called SPiRiT, several
more efficient realizations have been proposed.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we identify the main bottlenecks of this framework and show
how to significantly improve the performance of FHE-base secure search. In
particular,
</p>
<p>1. To retrieve $\ell$ matching items, the existing framework needs to repeat
the protocol $\ell$ times sequentially. In our new framework, all matching
items are retrieved in parallel in a single protocol execution.
</p>
<p>2. The most recent work by Wren et al. (CCS 2020) requires $O(n)$
multiplications to compute the first matching index. Our solution requires no
homomorphic multiplication, instead using only additions and scalar
multiplications to encode all matching indices.
</p>
<p>3. Our implementation and experiments show that to fetch 16 matching records,
our system gives an 1800X speed-up over the state of the art in fetching the
query results resulting in a 26X speed-up for the full search functionality.

concentration bound on the full eigenspectrum of a random principal submatrix.
It significantly extends existing work which shows concentration of just the
spectral norm [Tro08]. It also extends work on sublinear time algorithms for
testing the presence of large negative eigenvalues in the spectrum [BCJ20]. To
complement our theoretical results, we provide numerical simulations, which
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in approximating the eigenvalues
of a wide range of matrices.

    <title>Graph skeletonization of high-dimensional point cloud data via topological method</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Magee:Lucas.html">Lucas Magee</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wang:Yusu.html">Yusu Wang</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07606">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Geometric graphs form an important family of hidden structures behind data.
In this paper, we develop an efficient and robust algorithm to infer a graph
skeleton behind a point cloud data (PCD)embedded in high dimensional space.
Previously, there has been much work to recover a hidden graph from a
low-dimensional density field, or from a relatively clean high-dimensional PCD
(in the sense that the input points are within a small bounded distance to a
true hidden graph). Our proposed approach builds upon the recent line of work
on using a persistence-guided discrete Morse (DM) theory based approach to
reconstruct a geometric graph from a density field defined over a triangulation
of low-dimensional Euclidean domain. In particular, we first give a very simple
generalization of this DM-based algorithm from a density-function perspective
to a general filtration perspective. On the theoretical front, we show that the
output of the generalized algorithm contains a so-called lexicographic-optimal
persistent cycle basis w.r.t the input filtration, justifying that the output
is indeed meaningful. On the algorithmic front, this generalization allows us
to use the idea of sparsified weighted Rips filtration (developed by Buchet
etal) to develop a new graph reconstruction algorithm for noisy point cloud
data (PCD) (which do not need to be embedded). The new algorithm is robust to
background noise and non-uniform distribution of input points. We provide
various experimental results to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our
new graph reconstruction algorithm for PCDs.

several \textsc{3Sum}-hard geometric problems, all of which can be reduced to
the following question: Given two sets $A$, $B$, each consisting of $n$
pairwise disjoint segments in the plane, and a set $C$ of $n$ triangles in the
plane, we want to count, for each triangle $\Delta\in C$, the number of
intersection points between the segments of $A$ and those of $B$ that lie in
$\Delta$. The problems considered in this paper have been studied by
Chan~(2020), who gave algorithms that solve them, in the standard real-RAM
model, in $O((n^2/\log^2n)\log^{O(1)}\log n)$ time. We present solutions in the
algebraic decision-tree model whose cost is $O(n^{60/31+\varepsilon})$, for any
$\varepsilon&gt;0$.
</p>
<p>Our approach is based on a primal-dual range searching mechanism, which
exploits the multi-level polynomial partitioning machinery recently developed
by Agarwal, Aronov, Ezra, and Zahl~(2020).
</p>
<p>A key step in the procedure is a variant of point location in arrangements,
say of lines in the plane, which is based solely on the \emph{order type} of
the lines, a "handicap" that turns out to be beneficial for speeding up our
algorithm.

{many-to-many} matching between $S$ and $T$ is a set of pairs $(p,q)$ such that
$p\in S$, $q\in T$ and for each $r\in S\cup T$, $r$ appears in at least one
such pair. The {cost of a pair} $(p,q)$ is the (Euclidean) distance between $p$
and $q$. In the {minimum-cost many-to-many matching} problem, the goal is to
compute a many-to-many matching such that the sum of the costs of the pairs is
minimized. This problem is a restricted version of minimum-weight edge cover in
a bipartite graph, and hence can be solved in $O(n^3)$ time. In a more
restricted setting where all the points are on a line, the problem can be
solved in $O(n\log n)$ time [Colannino, Damian, Hurtado, Langerman, Meijer,
Ramaswami, Souvaine, Toussaint; Graphs Comb., 2007]. However, no progress has
been made in the general planar case in improving the cubic time bound. In this
paper, we obtain an $O(n^2\cdot poly(\log n))$ time exact algorithm and an $O(
n^{3/2}\cdot poly(\log n))$ time $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in the planar
case. Our results affirmatively address an open problem posed in [Colannino et
al., Graphs Comb., 2007].

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This Erev Yom Kippur, I wish to repent for not putting enough quantum computing content on this blog.  Of course, repentance is meaningless unless accompanied by genuine reform.  That being the case, please enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLmGfNKCLU">YouTube video of my ACM TechTalk from last week about quantum supremacy</a>—although, as you’ll see if you watch the thing, I oscillate between quantum supremacy and other terms like “quantum advantage” and even “quantum supremadvantage.”  This represents the first time ever that I got pushback about a talk before I’d delivered it for political reasons—the social-justice people, it turns out, are <em>actually serious</em> about wanting to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">ban the term “quantum supremacy”</a>—but my desire to point out all the difficulties with their proposal competed with my desire not to let that issue overshadow my talk.</p>



<p>And there’s plenty to talk about!  While regular <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers will have already heard (or read) most of what I say, I make some new comments, including about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03494">new paper from last week</a>, the night before my talk (!), by the USTC group in China, where they report a quantum supremacy experiment based on random circuit sampling with a superconducting chip, this time with a record-setting 60 qubits and 24 layers of gates.  On the other hand, I also stress how increasing the circuit fidelity has become a <em>much</em> more urgent issue than further increasing the number of qubits (or in the case of BosonSampling, the number of photons), if our goal is for these experiments to remain a couple steps ahead of classical spoofing algorithms.</p>



<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy my lovingly handcrafted visuals.  Over the course of this pandemic, I’ve become a full convert to writing out my talks with a stylus pen rather than PowerPointing them—not only is it faster for me, not only does it allow for continuous scrolling rather than arbitrary divisions into slides, but it enforces simplicity and concision in ways they <em>should</em> be enforced.</p>



<p>While there was only time for me to field a few questions at the end of the talk, I later supplied <a href="https://on.acm.org/t/quantum-computational-supremacy/2106/2?u=acm-learning">written answers to 52 questions (!!) that I hadn’t gotten to</a>.  If <em>you</em> have a question, please check to see if it’s already there, and otherwise ask away in the comments!</p>



<p>Thanks so much to Yan Timanovsky for inviting and organizing this talk, and to whurley for hosting it.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Way back in 2005, I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/qchallenge.html">Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory</a>, on at least half of which I’d say there’s been dramatic progress in the 16 years since (most of the challenges were open-ended, so that it’s unclear when to count them as “solved”).  I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=471">more open quantum complexity problems</a> in 2010, and some <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=663">classical complexity problems</a> in 2011.  In the latter cases, I’d say there’s been dramatic progress on about a third of the problems.  I won’t go through the problems one by one, but feel free to ask in the comments about any that interest you.</p>



<p>Shall I push my luck as a problem-poser?  Shall or shall not, I have.</p>



<p>My impetus, this time around, was a kind invitation by Travis Humble, the editor-in-chief of the new <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tqc">ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing</a></em>, to contribute a perspective piece to that journal on the occasion of my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5448">ACM Prize</a>.  I agreed—but only on the condition that, rather than ponderously pontificate about the direction of the field, I could simply discuss a bunch of open problems that I wanted to see solved.  The result is below.  It’s coming soon to an arXiv near you, but <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers get it first.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/open.pdf">Open Problems Related to Quantum Query Complexity</a></strong>  (11 pages, PDF)</p><p>by Scott Aaronson</p><p><em>Abstract:</em> I offer a case that quantum query complexity still has loads of enticing and fundamental open problems—from relativized QMA versus QCMA and BQP versus IP, to time/space tradeoffs for collision and element distinctness, to polynomial degree versus quantum query complexity for partial functions, to the Unitary Synthesis Problem and more.</p></blockquote>



<p>Some of the problems on my new hit-list are ones that I and others have flogged for years or even decades, but others, as far as I know, appear here for the first time.  If your favorite quantum query complexity open problem, or a problem I’ve discussed in the past, is missing, that doesn’t mean that it’s been solved or is no longer interesting—it might mean I simply ran out of time or energy before I got to it.</p>



<p>Enjoy!  And tell me what I missed or got wrong or has a trivial solution that I overlooked.</p></div>

    <summary>We study a simple and general template for constructing affine extractors by composing a linear transformation with resilient functions. Using this we show that good affine extractors can be computed by non-explicit circuits of various types, including AC0-Xor circuits: AC0 circuits with a layer of parity gates at the input. We also show that one-sided extractor can be computed by small DNF-Xor circuits, and separate these circuits from other well-studied classes. As a further motivation for studying DNF-Xor circuits we show that if they can approximate inner product then small AC0-Xor circuits can compute it exactly – a long-standing open problem.</summary>

<p>
Scott Aaronson is one of the top researchers in complexity theory and especially in quantum computing. He is famous for more than his research, he is famous also for his blog <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?m=202109">Shtetl-Optimized</a>. Its scope includes just about everything that touches on complexity theory, but includes many topics that span just about anything that is interesting these days.</p>
<p>
For a whole week, he has had the topic: <i>Exciting opportunities at Kabul University!</i> </p>
<p>
Scott is kidding about Kabul of course. Rather, his topic is the recent Texas law against abortion. Here are his initial comments: </p>
<blockquote><p>
Now, of course, Texas has effectively outlawed abortion—well, after the 6th week, which is before many women even realize they’re pregnant, and when the fetus is still the size of a grain of rice…</p>
<p>
There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and—this is the “novel” part—there’s a bounty system, with $10,000 fines for anyone who helps in any way with an abortion, payable to anyone who snitches on them. Texas has openly defied Roe v. Wade and, for the first time in half a century, has gotten five Supreme Court justices (three appointed by Donald Trump) to go along with it. Roe v. Wade is de facto no longer the law of the United States.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We will not talk about abortion, but rather the novel aspect of the Texas law. This will not lead to quantum computing, not even along lines of a famous SMBC <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3">cartoon</a> that Scott created with Zach Weinersmith, from which we give the second panel:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/the-talk/" rel="attachment wp-att-19098"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19098" height="270" src="https://i2.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/the-talk.jpg?resize=480%2C270&amp;ssl=1" width="480"/></a></p>
<p>
We promise it will lead to some math, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What can we do to stop the Texas law? Many are worried that the fact that the US Supreme Court has refused to even temporarily block the Texas law is unheard of. Does this mean that the new Texas law somehow is valid? Does this mean that abortions will be made illegal? Not clear.</p>
<p>
One part of the Texas law is clever—we can disagree with it and still note that the new law is clever. The law does not give the usual suspects to the local law enforcement, who are usually the ones responsible to enforce the law. Rather the law insists that anyone can raise the issue that X has violated the law against an abortion. Say S raises that X helped make an abortion happen. Then S gets $10,000 payment provided the case is upheld in court. Scott calls S the <i>snitches</i>. </p>
<p>
As recognized by the Emergency Medical Network (Emnet), this step in moving the enforcement from the usual police to the general public is one of the reasons the Texas law is so hard to fight. The usual way to challenge a new law is to immediately file some counter suit stopping those charged with enforcement. This seems to be impossible with this trick. Who can be S?—by construction that could be just about anyone. There is no single body to force to defend the law in court. Clever.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law—The Trick </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are experts in theory of computation. Can we use that ability to find a way to attack the new <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961">law</a>? Can we see any weakness that is inherent in the law? Some trick? Or is the Texas idea somehow a breakthrough in ways to state a law against abortion?</p>
<p>
Ken and I have an insight. A standard trick in theory is given a new idea can we generalize it. If we can use the new idea to solve other problems then we should shed some light on the new idea. If the idea is too powerful, then we essentially prove that it cannot work in general. If it does work elsewhere, then we can use it to solve previous unsolved problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law for Speeding </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Cars speeding is a serious problem just about everywhere. I live in a rural area and it is 35 mph here. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/attachment/35/" rel="attachment wp-att-19100"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19100" height="114" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/35.png?resize=196%2C114&amp;ssl=1" width="196"/></a></p>
<p>
Yet when I am driving I am often passed by cars that cross a yellow line going 50 or faster. The issue is that the laws insist that some officer witness a violation. But since that rarely happens, the speeders almost always get no ticket.</p>
<p>
Let’s use the same trick that is used in the new Texas law. If a car races by me then I will send a digital message to the police that says: “Today I was driving my car number <b>1236335356</b> at time <b>11:19.42am</b> and witnessed a car with plate number <b>ERRW5365</b> speeding at <b>55.11mph</b> while passing me. I was at location …</p>
<p>
This would be sent to the police and they would then have the task of checking it out. Provided it checks out, I would be awarded a bounty of $500, say. And the speeder would get a fine and …</p>
<p>
How could I prove the speed? I wouldn’t have time to take a video in the moment. But Ken’s smartphone—and those of many of his colleagues—have an app that is solving problems of this type 24/7. His is a University at Buffalo product but there are many similar ones. Quoting the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/pocketcares.html">website</a> makes everything quickly clear:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> PocketCare S is a bluetooth low energy (BLE) solution which enables smartphones to send and receive anonymous beacon signals. It checks the distance between a smartphone and another beacon (or smartphone running PocketCare S) … [and] … records the duration a close encounter with another beacon. PocketCare S is designed to report social distance information without collecting or revealing any personally identifiable information about any specific individual. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The car would only need to have a detectable beacon, not the same app—and the info giving proof of speed over said duration might already be in the authorities’ data banks even before the complaint is filed.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Bipartite Epidemiology? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Of course, what we are trying to say is that this kind of lawsuit would become a new kind of virus. It might extend to many other transgressions besides speeding. What strikes us further is that this would assume a binary structure that we do not know to exist in medical pandemics.</p>
<p>
The first point is that the people who voted for the Texas law believe they are not the ones who would be violating it. Call them Team A. The remaining people—Team 2—would want to get back at them. Maybe speeding is an equal vice for those two teams, so that wouldn’t work. We’ve seen suggestions like Team B suing for open-carry of firearms. Let us just suppose Team B finds something.</p>
<p>
The second point is that a “snitch” lawsuit is like one person infecting another. But unlike our present pandemic, it’s one where people in A can only infect those in B, and vice versa. We have a bipartite graph <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. How does this change the math?</p>
<p>
One issue noted by Scott in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5807#comment-1908708">comment</a> is whether the law allows someone to be sued multiple times. If not, then being sued once would be like acquiring immunity. The US recognizes principles of “no double jeopardy” but the Texas law appears to avoid them. </p>
<p>
We’ve tried to look for related analysis of the popular college “Humans Versus Zombies” (<a href="https://humansvszombies.org/">HvZ</a>) game. But in that game, the zombies only increase. <em>Scientific American</em> once published an <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/modelling-a-werewolf-epidemic-2/">analysis</a> titled, “Modelling a werewolf epidemic” that also mentioned zombies. But it did not say the werewolves could only infect zombies and vice-versa. </p>
<p>
Binary infection situations do of course exist when two groups of people suddenly mix, each having already acquired resistance to a disease that infects the other. There have been great tragedies when the mixing was a relatively small number of A colonizing into B. But we still do not know of models that would apply when the kinds of “infections” involve spontaneously arise <em>en masse</em> in the manner of a pandemic with high <img alt="{R_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> factor—as might happen if the courts really legitimize this kind of “snitch suit” law.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is this type of snitching a viable adjunct to law enforcement for speeding? Could it save lives? What about the associated dimension of propagating personal information into massive repositories?</p>

    <title>TR21-136 |  LCC and LDC: Tailor-made distance amplification and a refined separation | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Tal Yankovitz</title>
    <summary>The Alon-Edmonds-Luby distance amplification procedure (FOCS 1995) is an algorithm that transforms a code with vanishing distance to a code with constant distance. AEL was invoked by Kopparty, Meir, Ron-Zewi, and Saraf (J. ACM 2017) for obtaining their state-of-the-art LDC, LCC and LTC. Cohen and Yankovitz (CCC 2021) devised a  procedure that can amplify inverse-polynomial distances, exponentially extending the regime of distances that can be amplified by AEL. However, the improved procedure only works for LDC and assuming rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log n}$.

In this work we devise a distance amplification procedure for LCC with inverse-polynomial distances even for vanishing rate $\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. For LDC, we obtain a more modest improvement and require rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. Thus, the tables have turned and it is now LCC that can be better amplified. Our key idea for accomplishing this, deviating from prior work, is to tailor the distance amplification procedure to the code at hand.

Our second result concerns the relation between linear LDC and LCC. We prove the existence of linear LDC that are not LCC, qualitatively extending a separation by Kaufman and Viderman (RANDOM 2010).</summary>

    <title>TR21-135 |  Strong (D)QBF Dependency Schemes via Implication-free Resolution Paths | 

	Tomáš Peitl, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff, 

	Joshua Blinkhorn</title>
    <summary>We suggest a general framework to study dependency schemes for dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBF). As our main contribution, we exhibit a new infinite collection of implication-free DQBF dependency schemes that generalise the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme. We establish soundness of all these schemes, implying that they can be used in any DQBF proof system. We further explore the power of QBF and DQBF resolution systems parameterised by implication-free dependency schemes and show that the hierarchical structure naturally present among the dependency schemes translates isomorphically to a hierarchical structure of parameterised proof systems with respect to p-simulation. As a special case, we demonstrate that our new schemes are exponentially stronger than the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in Q-resolution, thus resulting in the strongest QBF dependency schemes known to date.</summary>

    <link href="http://benjamin-recht.github.io/2021/09/13/effect-size/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Effect size is significantly more important than statistical significance.</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Mask_RCT____Symptomatic_Seropositivity_083121.pdf">A massive cluster-randomized controlled trial run in Bangladesh to test the efficacy of mask wearing on reducing coronavirus transmission</a> released its initial results and the covid pundits have been buzzing with excitement. There have already been too many hot takes on the report, but, after wrangling with the 94 pages, I came to a different conclusion than most who have used this study as evidence for their mask predilections. I worry that because of statistical ambiguity, there’s not much that can be deduced at all.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh mask study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Rather than randomizing patients, this study randomized villages. Though the sample size looked enormous (340,000 individuals), the effective number of samples was only 600 because the treatment was applied to individual villages. Villages were paired using demographic attributes and one of each pair was randomly assigned to an intervention and the other to no intervention. The 300 intervention villages received free masks, information on the importance of masking, role modeling by community leaders, and in-person reminders for 8 weeks. The 300 villages in the control group did not receive any interventions.</p>

<p>The goal was to determine how much these interventions contributed to patients who both reported symptoms, subsequently consented to antibody testing, and tested positive. The study reports the precise number of people who report symptoms down to the single person (13,273 in treatment, 13,893 in control). The study reports the precise number of symptomatic people who consented to blood draws (5,414 in treatment, 5,538 in control). And the study reports the precise number of blood draws that were tested for covid antibodies (5,006  in treatment, 4,971 in control). But here’s where the picture gets murky: The number of actual positive tests appears nowhere in the preprint.</p>

<p>The study reports that 0.76% of the people in the control villages were symptomatic and seropositive whereas 0.69% of the people in the treatment villages were symptomatic and seropositive. This corresponds to about a 1.1 fold reduction in risk, and this result was deemed by the authors to be statistically significant.</p>

<p>Where do these seropositivity percentages come from? The paper does not make clear what is being counted. Do the authors compute the number of cases in treatment divided by the number of individuals treated? Or do they compute the prevalence in each cluster and average these up? These two different estimates of prevalence can give different answers. For instance, we can imagine a simplified scenario with two clusters. Let’s say one treatment-control pair consists of two villages with 10,000 people each and pair two consists of villages with 6,000 people. In the larger treatment village, there is an outbreak with 136 cases, but in the smaller treatment village there are no cases. In the control villages, the larger village observes 75 cases and the smaller 46 cases. If we count over the number of individuals, then the prevalence ratio is 1.1 in favor of the control arm. However, if we first compute prevalence at the village level and then average these estimates, we find a prevalence ratio of 1.1 in favor of the treatment arm. But which is better? Reducing prevalence at the village level or the population level? This question is especially difficult when the actual magnitude of the outcome is so small. In either case we are talking about a difference of 15 cases between the treatment and control villages in a population of 32,000 individuals.</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="illustration of how different summary statistics can yield different effect sizes." src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/mask_cluster.png" width="75%"/></p>

<p>When effect sizes are small and sensitive to measurement, convention compels us to find refuge in an argument over statistical significance. So let’s then examine how significance is derived in the working paper. The authors say that they model the count of symptomatic seropositive individuals as a “a generalized linear model (GLM) with a normal family and identity link.” This is a fancy way of saying that they modeled the count as if it were sampled from a normal distribution and ran ordinary least-squares regression. Based on the captions on the tables, it appears that they modeled the rate of symptomatic seroprevalence in each village as a normal distribution whose mean is a function of the village cluster and some other covariates. They then apparently computed estimates of village level seroprevalence under the model and averaged these estimates to yield a final estimate of seroprevalence in treatment and control.</p>

<p>While the Gaussian model made the authors’ coding simple and allowed them to report results in standard econometric formatting, the model is also certainly wrong. Counts cannot be normally distributed as normal random variables as they cannot take negative values. Indeed, 36 out of the 300 villages had zero infections, and such an event is exceedingly unlikely when the distribution is well-approximated by a Gaussian. Rather than adjust their modeling assumptions, the authors just removed these villages from the regression, leading to an overestimate of the average seroprevalence.</p>

<p>The report computes p-values and confidence intervals from these regressions. What exactly do these quantities mean? P-values and confidence intervals associated with a regression are valid <em>only if the model is true</em>. What if the model is not true? If the model is wrong, the error bars are meaningless. And if the confidence intervals and p-values are meaningless, then I’m not sure what we can conclude.</p>

<p>The authors provided several robustness checks to fend off claims like mine. They also estimated the effect using a non-preregistered model which modeled the count as being Poisson distributed and found the effects were similar. Again, however, modeling infectious diseases with Poisson distributions is not realistic. A Poisson distribution models independent events that occur with some fixed rate. Such models are reasonable for modeling noninfectious diseases such as heart attacks, but we know that infections do not occur as random independent events: interactions with other sick individuals creates complex dynamic spread and the epidemic curves we see far too often thrown around online. Mathematically, it is not surprising that two models yield the same estimated effect sizes: they are both generalized linear models and their estimates are computed with similar algorithms.  But since both models are wrong, it’s not clear why including both provides much in the way of reassurance.</p>

<p>Rather than providing all of this statistical analysis, why not report the unadjusted counts of positive individuals for the reader to interpret? Especially considering that symptoms were reported precisely down to the person.</p>

<p>It’s useful to compare this mask study to the RCTs for vaccines. Vaccine studies are fortunate to be the purest of randomized controlled trials. If RCTs are a “gold standard” for causal inference, then vaccine studies are the “gold standard” of RCTs. Vaccines trials are easy to blind, almost always have clinical equipoise, only measure direct effects on individuals that can be nearly uniformly sampled from the world’s population, and are trivial to verify statistically. Looking at the example of the Pfizer vaccine, the effect size was enormous (20x risk reduction) and the confidence intervals were just based on exact calculations for independent, binary random variables. And the CIs didn’t matter much because the effect size was so large. You could just stare at the Kaplan-Meier curve and bask in the amazing effectiveness of MRNA vaccines.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, of course, most effect sizes are not factor of 20. Indeed, they are usually less than a factor of 2. As we saw in the mask study, the effect size was less than a factor of 1.1. I’m picking on the mask study only because it has been so attention grabbing.  It’s a convenient example to illustrate how statistical modeling can muddy the waters in randomized control trials. But it is only one of many examples I’ve come across in the past few months. If you pick a random paper out of the New England Journal of Medicine or the American Economic Review, you will likely find similar statistical muddiness.</p>

<p>We lose sight of the forest for the trees when we fight over p-values rather than considering effect sizes. Ernest Rutherford is famously quoted proclaiming “If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.” Rutherford, who discovered the structure of the atom, and is famous for pioneering innovations in experiment design and measurement for amplifying small effects. He was not opposed to probing the minuscule, but was interested in how to best produce empirical evidence.</p>

<p>I think a milder version of Rutherford’s aphorism should guide scientific investigation: If the effect size is so small that we need sophisticated statistics, maybe that means the effect isn’t real. Using sophisticated statistical scaffolding clouds our judgement. We end up using statistical methods as a crutch, not to dig signals out of noise, but to convince ourselves of signals when there are none. And this matters for recommendations on policy. If the effects of an intervention are modest at best, and only manifest themselves after statistical correction, how can we use such a study to guide policy?</p>

<p>Misapplication of statistics can lead to bad policy decisions. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121867148093738861">Medical devices can be approved even when the statistics are done in error</a>.  And statistical errors can even <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/23/astrazeneca-may-have-used-outdated-information-in-announcing-covid19-vaccine-results/">dampen confidence in effective vaccines</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, there is an existential problem arguing for large effect sizes. If most effect sizes are small or zero, then most interventions are useless. And this forces us scientists to confront our cosmic impotence, which remains a humbling and frustrating experience.</p>

<p>I’ve probably been thinking too much about statistics and models. I’m not the first mid-career professor to realize that statistical modeling is widely misapplied (For example <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/308/6924/283">Doug Altman</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/statistical-models-and-causal-inference/7CE8D4957FF6E9615AAAC4128FA8246E">David Freedman</a>, or <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~amshaikh/webfiles/multiplereview.pdf">Joseph Romano</a>, among many others). But I’m hoping to write more about this with a bit of an algorithmic lens, discussing some of the earlier worries about modeling in the process. Can we revisit suggestions for improving our evidentiary framework with contemporary computational statistics tools? Where might this lead us in both the experimental sciences and in machine learning?</p></div>

    <title>TR21-134 |  A refinement of the Meyer-McCreight Union Theorem | 

	Siddharth Bhaskar</title>
    <summary>For a function $t : 2^\star \to 1^\star$, let $C_t$ be the set of problems decidable on input $x$ in time at most $t(x)$ almost everywhere.  The Union Theorem of Meyer and McCreight asserts that any union $\bigcup_{i &lt; \omega} C_{t_i}$ for a uniformly recursive sequence of bounds $t_i$ is equal to $C_L$ for some single recursive function $L$. In particular the class PTIME of polynomial-time relations can be expressed as $C_L$ for some total recursive function $L : 2^\star \to 1^\star$.

    <title>TR21-133 |  Testing Distributions of Huge Objects | 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Dana Ron</title>
    <summary>We initiate a study of a new model of property testing that is a hybrid of testing properties of distributions and testing properties of strings. 
Specifically, the new model refers to testing properties of distributions, but these are distributions over huge objects (i.e., very long strings). 
Accordingly, the model accounts for the total number of local probes into these objects (resp., queries to the strings)as well as for the distance between objects (resp., strings).
Specifically, the distance between distributions is defined as the earth mover's distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance between strings.

We study the query complexity of testing in this new model, focusing on three directions.
First, we try to relate the query complexity of testing properties in the new model to the sample complexity of testing these properties in the standard distribution testing model.
Second, we consider the complexity of testing properties that arise naturally in the new model (e.g., distributions that capture random variations of fixed strings).
Third, we consider the complexity of testing properties that were extensively studied in the standard distribution testing model: Two such cases are uniform distributions
and pairs of identical distributions, where we obtain the following results.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Testing whether a distribution over $n$-bit long strings is uniform on some set of size $m$ can be tested with query complexity ${\widetilde O}(m/\epsilon^3)$, where $\epsilon&gt;(\log_2m)/n$ is the proximity parameter.
\item
Testing whether two distribution over $n$-bit long strings that have support size at most $m$ are identical can be tested  with query complexity ${\widetilde O}(m^{2/3}/\epsilon^3)$.
\end{itemize}
Both upper bounds are pretty tight; that is, for $\epsilon=\Omega(1)$, the first task requires $\Omega(m^c)$ queries for any $c&lt;1$ and $n=\omega(\log m)$, whereas the second task requires $\Omega(m^{2/3})$ queries.
Note that the query complexity of the first task is higher than the sample complexity of the corresponding task in the standard distribution testing model, whereas in the case of the second task the bounds almost match.</summary>

    <title>TR21-132 |  Pseudo-random functions and uniform learnability | 

	Eric Binnendyk</title>
    <summary>Boolean circuits are a model of computation. A class of Boolean circuits is called a polynomial class if the number of nodes is bounded by a polynomial function of the number of input variables. A class $C_n[s(n)]$ of Boolean functions is called learnable if there are algorithms that can approximate functions in $C_n[s(n)]$ when given oracle access to the function. A distribution $D$ of functions is called pseudorandom against a circuit class $C[t(n)]$ if any oracle circuit $C^f$ from $C[t(n)]$ outputs 1 with the same probability if the oracle $f$ is chosen from $D$ as it would if the oracle were random. It is known that a polynomial class of circuits is learnable if and only if it contains no pseudorandom distributions of functions. However, there is no known algorithm to produce the learner given the number of inputs the circuits have (the learner is non-uniform). I investigate a uniform version of the min-max theorem as a possible tool to find an algorithm for such learners.</summary>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: How do molecules, cells and synapses effect reasoning, intelligence, planning, language? Despite dazzling progress in experimental neuroscience, as well as in cognitive science at the other extreme of scale, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarching question: the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to be required. As Richard Axel recently put it: “We don’t have a logic for the transformation of neural activity into thought […].”</p>



<p>What kind of formal system would qualify as this “logic”?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I will introduce the Assembly Calculus (AC), a computational system which appears to be a promising bridge between neurons and cognition. Through this programming framework, a Parser was recently implemented which (a) can handle reasonably complex sentences of English and other languages, and (b) works exclusively through the spiking of neurons.</p>

    <title>TR21-131 |  QCDCL with Cube Learning or Pure Literal Elimination - What is best? | 

	Benjamin Böhm, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff</title>
    <summary>Quantified conflict-driven clause learning (QCDCL) is one of the main approaches for solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). We formalise and investigate several versions of QCDCL that include cube learning and/or pure-literal elimination, and formally compare the resulting solving models via proof complexity techniques. Our results show that almost all of the QCDCL models are exponentially incomparable with respect to proof size (and hence solver running time), pointing towards different orthogonal ways how to practically implement QCDCL.</summary>

    <title>TR21-130 |  Matrix hypercontractivity, streaming algorithms and LDCs: the large alphabet case | 

	Srinivasan Arunachalam, 

	João F. Doriguello</title>
    <summary>Hypercontractive inequalities for real-valued functions over the Boolean cube play an important role in theoretical computer science. In this work, we prove a hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions defined over large alphabets, generalizing the result of Ben-Aroya, Regev, de Wolf (FOCS'08) for the Boolean alphabet. To obtain our result we prove a generalization of the powerful $2$-uniform convexity inequality for trace norms of Ball, Carlen, Lieb (Inventiones Mathematicae'94). We give two applications of this hypercontractive inequality.
    
Locally decodable codes: we present a lower bound for locally decodable codes (LDC) over large alphabets. An LDC $C:\mathbb{Z}_r^n\to \mathbb{Z}_r^N$ is an encoding of $x\in \mathbb{Z}_r^n$ into a codeword $C(x)$ in such a way that one can recover an arbitrary $x_i\in \mathbb{Z}_r$ (with probability at least $1/r+\varepsilon$) by making only a few queries to a corrupted codeword. The main question in LDCs is the trade-off between $N$ and $n$. By using hypercontractivity, we give an exponential lower bound $N= 2^{\Omega(\varepsilon^4 n/r^4)}$ for $2$-query (possibly non-linear) LDCs over $\mathbb{Z}_r$. Previously exponential lower bounds were known for $r=2$ (Kerenidis and de Wolf (JCSS'04)) and for \emph{linear} codes (Dvir and Shpilka (SICOMP'07)).
    
Streaming algorithms: we present upper and lower bounds for the communication complexity of the Hidden Hypermatching problem when defined over large alphabets, which generalizes the well-known Boolean Hidden Matching problem. We then consider streaming algorithms for approximating the value of Unique Games on a $t$-hyperedge hypergraph: in this direction a simple edge-counting argument gives an $r$-approximation with $O(\log n)$ space. On the other hand, we use our communication lower bound to show that every streaming algorithm in the adversarial model achieving a $(r-\varepsilon)$-approximation of this value requires $\Omega(n^{1-1/t})$ classical space or $\Omega(n^{1-2/t})$ quantum space. In this setting, these results simplify and generalize the seminal work of Kapralov, Khanna and Sudan (SODA'15) and Kapravol and Krachun (STOC'19) for the case $r=2$.</summary>

    <title>The Death of Expertise</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Four years ago I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/01/learning-about-learning.html">tried to catch up with deep learning</a> and this summer I aimed to try to catch up again. Who would've thought 2017 is ancient history.</p><p>I watched the lectures in the <a href="http://introtodeeplearning.com/">latest MIT course</a>, played with GPT-3 and Codex, read the new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258">Stanford manifesto</a> on what they call foundation models, models trained that can preform on a wide range of tasks instead of a single goal. We've seen machine learning solve protein folding, detect cancer from x-rays better than radiologists, not to mention effectively solving many of the traditional AI problems (language translation, voice and face recognition, game playing, etc.) Watching Codex generate computer code from plain English is a game changer. Far from perfect but this technology is in its infancy.</p><p>From what I can tell, the main technological advances focus on learning when we don't have labelled data such as new techniques to transfer knowledge to new domains and using generative models to provide more data to train ML algorithms.</p><p>The trend to worry us all is that deep learning algorithms in the long run seem to do better if we limit or eliminate previous human knowledge from the equation. The game playing algorithms now train from just the rules alone (or even just the outcomes). We do use some knowledge: words come in some linear order, faces have hierarchical features, but not much more than that. Human expertise can help as we start solving a problem, even just to know that good solutions look like, but then it often gets in the way.</p><p>When we longer use a skill we tend to lose it, like my ability to navigate from a good map. If we eliminate expertise we may find it very difficult to get it back.</p><p>There's a more personal issue--people spend their entire careers creating their expertise in some area, and that expertise is often a source of pride and a source of income. If someone comes along and tells you that expertise is no longer needed, or even worse irrelevant or that it gets in the way, you might feel protective, and under guise of our expertise tear down the learning algorithm. That attitude will just make us more irrelevant--better to use our expertise to guide the machine learning models to overcome their limitations. </p><p>You can't stop progress, but you can shape it.</p></div>

<p>First, the macabre.  Not that there is any shortage in the news, but the book also contains macabreness of a kind I did not expect.</p>



<p>Second, the drive for scientific research.  It always makes for a compelling read when the reader is a scientist.  And here it is also tinted with adventure.</p>



<p>Third, (recent) history.  As I hinted in some previous posts, I started reading history in my late 20’s, as an unbelievably blank slate, and I haven’t stopped.  It is not clear it is very consequential for the present, but sometimes it’s good to know how things “evolve.”</p></div>

    <title>A Couple of Announcements</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second week of July, 2022, there will be a summer school on algorithmic fairness at IPAM, on the UCLA campus, with Cynthia Dwork and Guy Rothblum among the lecturers.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the second week of July, 2022, there will be a <a href="http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/summer-schools/graduate-summer-school-on-algorithmic-fairness-workshop-on-sex-and-gender-bias-in-data/">summer school on algorithmic fairness</a> at IPAM, on the UCLA campus, with Cynthia Dwork and Guy Rothblum among the lecturers. Applications (see the above link) are due by March 11, 2022.</p>
<p>We will soon put up a call for nominations for the test of time award to be given at FOCS 2021 (which will take place in Boulder, Colorado, in early 2022). There are three award categories, recognizing, respectively, papers from FOCS 2011, FOCS 2001, and FOCS 1991. In each category, it is also possible to nominate older papers, up to four years before the target conference. For example, for the thirty-year category, it is possible to nominate papers from FOCS 1987, FOCS 1988, FOCS 1989, FOCS 1990, in addition to the target conference FOCS 1991.</p>
<p>Nominations should be sent by October 31, 2021 to focs.tot.2021@gmail.com with a subject line of “FOCS Test of Time Award”. Nominations should contain an explanation of the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. Self-nominations are discouraged.</p>
<p>In the second week of November, 2021, the Simons Institute will host a workshop on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/si2021-3">using cryptographic assumptions to prove average-case hardness of problems in high-dimensional statistics</a>. This is such a new topic that the goal of the workshop will be more to explore new directions than to review known results, and we (think that we have) already invited all the authors of recent published work of this type. If you have proved results of this type, and you have not been invited (perhaps because your results are still unpublished?) and you would like to participate in the workshop, there is still space in the schedule so feel free to contact me or one of the other organizers. For both speakers and attendees, physical participation is preferred, but remote participation will be possible.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This month saw four papers. One on group testing, another on distribution testing, yet another which makes progress on testing problems on decision trees and the last one on graph property testing. Without further ado, let’s dive in.  </p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Group Testing with Non-identical Infection Probabilities</strong> by Mustafa Doger, Sennur Ulukus (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12418">arXiv</a>) Consider the classic group testing problem. Here the setup is the following. You are given a bunch of individuals from a population \(\mathcal{P}\). You have an infection vector which records the infection status of each individual in the population where the \(i\)-th individual is infected with probability \(p_i\). You want to recover all the infected individuals. You are allowed to group individuals together and you can test the entire group in a single shot. If the group tests negative, you are happy all the tested individuals are off the hook. Otherwise, if the group tests positive, you need more tests for further classification. This paper proposes a greedy way to build pools of individuals you would test. The pools are built adaptively: as in future pools are built using the knowledge of how the preceding tests fared. The key result in the paper upperbounds the number of tests performed in terms of the entropy of the infection vector.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Uniformity Testing in the Shuffle Model: Simpler, Better, Faster</strong> by Clément L. Canonne, Hongyi Lyu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08987">arXiv</a>) Differentially private distribution testing as a research area has been gathering momentum steadily over the last few years. If you read our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/08/new-for-july-2021/">last month’s post</a>, you might recall there are a wide variety of models of DP each corresponding to a different “threat model”. The most stringent among the most explored models is the “local model”, the least stringent being the “central model” and there is an intermediate threat model, the so called “<a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2020/05/news-for-april-2020/">shuffle model</a>“. This paper simplifies the analysis of uniformity testing algorithm under the shuffle model and presents an algorithm with sample complexity \(O(k^{3/4})\) for testing uniformity over a support of size \([k]\). </p>



<p/>



<p><strong>On Learning and Testing Decision Tree</strong> by Nader H. Bshouty, Catherine A. Haddad-Zaknoon (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04587">arXiv</a>) In our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/01/news-for-december-2020/">December 2020</a> post, we covered a result of Blanc et al., which proves the following: Suppose you are given a boolean function \(f\) and the property \(\mathcal{P}\) of size-\(s\) decision trees. The result of Blanc et al gives you a function \(g \in \mathcal{P}\) with \(dist(f,g) = O(dist (f, \mathcal{P}))\) where \(g \in \) is guaranteed to have decision tree complexity \(s^{O(\log^2 s)}\). This result implies a bi-criteria tester for the following property: is \(f \in \mathcal{P}\) or is \(f\) \(\varepsilon\)-far from having decision tree complexity \(\phi(s) = s^{O(\log^3 s)}\). The current paper improves this result by presenting a property tester with \(\phi(s) = s^{O(\log^2 s)}\).   </p>



<p> </p>



<p><strong>The complexity of testing all properties of planar graphs, and the role of isomorphism</strong> by Sabyasachi Basu, Akash Kumar, C. Seshadhri (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10547">arXiv</a>) <em>(Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of this paper)</em>. This paper presents a result that I, in my biased opinion, find interesting. So, here is the setup. You are given a bounded degree planar graph. And I cook up some God-forsaken property and ask you to test it. Turns out, no matter how devilishly I cooked up the property, you can test in with \(\exp(O(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) queries. The nice happenstance is that you also have a matching lower bound of \(\exp(\Omega(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) queries! And interestingly, this lower bound is witnessed by the very natural property of testing isomorphism to a fixed graph which means that isomorphism is the hardest property of  planar graphs.</p></div>

We prove that, for any constant $c&lt;1$, testing whether a distribution over $[\Theta(m)]$ is $m$-grained requires $\Omega(m^c)$ samples.</summary>

    <title>Guest Post on Solving (or trying to) Poly Diophantine Equations by Bogdan Grechuk</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Guest post by Bogdan Grechuk)

<p>
  
<br/>Motivated by Mathoverflow question
<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/316708/what-is-the-smallest-unsolved-diophantine-equation">here</a>
I have recently became interested in solving Polynomial Diophantine equations, that is, equations of the form

</p><center>P(x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>)=0</center>

<br/>for some polynomial P with integer coefficients. Because there are many such equations, I have decided to ask a computer to help me. 
 Our conversation is presented 
 <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/bogdio.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
  
<br/> Highlights of the conversation: the <i>height </i>of a polynomial over Z in many variables is what you get when you make all of the coefficients positive and plug in x=2. For example, the height of
  
  </p><center> x<sup>3</sup> - y<sup>4</sup> + 5</center> 
  
  <br/> is
  
  <center>2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 5 = 8 + 16 + 5 = 29.</center>
  
  <p>
  
 Note that, for all h, there are only a finite number of polynomials in many vars over Z with height h. With the help of my friend the computer we have looked at the equations with h=0,1,2,... and so on, and tried to  determine which ones have any integer solutions. As expected, the first equations were trivial, but at about h=22 we have started to meet quite interesting equations for which we needed help from  Mathoverflow to solve. The project is currently at h=29, with only one remaining open equation of this height.  Read the conversation with the computer, or my mathoverflow question
    
</p><center><a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/400714/can-you-solve-the-listed-smallest-open-diophantine-equations">here</a></center>
    
    or my paper: 
  

    <p/><center><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08705">here</a></center>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Sept. 6):</span></strong> Alright, as promised in this post, I’ve now matched a reader’s generosity by donating $2,000 to <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/avow?refcode=20210827NARAL">NARAL’s Avow fund</a>, which is fighting for abortion rights for women in Texas.  Woke people on Twitter, I invite you/youse/y’all to figure out some creative ways to condemn me for that.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Normally, early fall is the time when I’d use this blog to advertise positions in quantum information and theoretical computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, for prospective PhD students, postdocs, and faculty.  This year, you might say, anyone trying to recruit academics to Texas has a … <em>teensy bit</em> of a PR problem.  We already had PR problems, first over the “failure by design” of our electrical grid in the winter, second over Governor Abbott’s battle against local mask mandates, which has made Texas the second-most notoriously covid-friendly state after Florida.</p>



<p>Now, of course, Texas has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/texas-republicans-abortion-ban-backfire/619956/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;fbclid=IwAR2nCtXtpXUQQ5SBTHJLtd8Fkc8DFwuNCA1gdi3weUBlRqMrU8oKR5YUhjE">effectively outlawed abortion</a>—well, after the 6<sup>th</sup> week, which is before many women even realize they’re pregnant, and when the fetus is still the size of a grain of rice and looks like this.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/6week.jpg"/></figure></div>



<p>There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and—this is the “novel” part—there’s a bounty system, with $10,000+ fines for anyone who helps in any way with an abortion, payable to anyone who snitches on them.  Texas has openly defied <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and, for the first time in half a century, has gotten five Supreme Court justices (three appointed by Donald Trump) to go along with it.  <em>Roe v. Wade</em> is <em>de facto</em> no longer the law of the United States.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/when.jpg"/><em>With a 15-week cutoff, a right to abortion would still functionally exist.  At 6 weeks, it no longer functionally exists.</em></figure></div>



<p>And as for our recruiting at UT Austin … I fear we might as well now be trying to recruit colleagues to <a href="https://ku.edu.af/">Kabul University</a>.  It’s like, imagine some department chair at Kabul U., this week, trying to woo a star female physicist from abroad: “Oh, don’t worry … you’ll get used to wearing a burqa in no time!  And the ban on being alone with unrelated males is actually a <em>plus</em> for you; it just means you’ll be freed from onerous teaching and committee assignments.  Best yet, I’ve received personal assurances from our local Taliban commander that you almost certainly won’t be stoned for your licentiousness and whoredom.  Err … no offense, those were his words, not mine.”</p>



<p>For five years, my recruiting pitches for UT Austin have often involved stressing how Austin is a famously hip, tolerant, high-tech, educated city—a “blueberry in the tomato soup,” as Rick Perry put it—and how Texas itself might indeed turn blue any election cycle, given the explosive growth of its metropolitan population, and how the crazy state politics is unlikely to affect an Austinite’s personal life—at least, by noticeably more than the crazy <em>national</em> politics would affect their personal life.  I can no longer make this pitch with a straight face, or certainly not to women.</p>



<p>Like, I’m lucky that none of the women in my close family have ever needed an abortion, and that if they did, it would be easy for them to travel out of Texas to get one.  But having carried to term two healthy but <a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/pregnancy-complications/hyperemesis-gravidarum/">difficult</a> pregnancies, my wife Dana has often stressed to me how insane she finds the very idea of being <em>forced</em> by the government to go through with such an ordeal.  If women considering moving to Texas feel likewise, I can’t argue with them.  More than that: if Texas continues on what half the country sees as a journey back to the Middle Ages, with no opt-outs allowed for the residents of its left-leaning urban centers, Dana and I will not be able to remain here, and many of our friends won’t either.</p>



<p>So why aren’t we packing our bags already?  Partly because the current situation is inherently, obviously unstable.  <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961">SB8</a> can’t long remain the law of Texas while <em>Roe v. Wade</em> remains the law of the United States: one of them has to give.  I confess to being confused about why some abortion provider in Texas, with funding from national pro-choice groups, hasn’t <em>already</em> broken the law, welcomed a lawsuit, and forced the courts to rule explicitly on whether <em>Roe v. Wade</em> still stands and why or why not, rather than gutting a core part of American jurisprudence literally under cover of night.  I’m also confused about why some solid blue state, like Massachusetts or Hawaii, isn’t right now passing a law that would let any citizen sue any other for carrying a firearm—thereby forcing the five Supreme Hypocrites, in striking down that law, to admit that they <em>don’t</em> believe after all that state laws get to trample what the Supreme Court has held to be constitutional rights, merely by outsourcing the enforcement to random vigilantes.</p>



<p>My best guess is that Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett are already plotting to replace <em>Roe</em> by something much more restrictive, albeit probably not <em>quite</em> as shockingly draconian as Texas’s current ban on all abortions after six weeks, nor <em>quite</em> as breathtakingly insane as its bounty system for anyone who snitches about abortions.  My best guess is that they saw last week’s ruling as a way to test the waters and soften the country up: if you’re going to rescind what multiple generations of Americans have grown up seeing as a fundamental right, best not to do it too suddenly.  My best guess is that Democrats will respond by making abortion a central campaign issue in 2022 and 2024, and that given the public’s <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx">58%-32% support</a> for <em>Roe</em>, the Democrats will do pretty well with that—to the point where, like the proverbial dog that finally catches the car, Republicans might come to regret actually sinking their jaws into <em>Roe</em>, rather than just conspicuously chasing it down the street for half a century.</p>



<p>I have friends who are sincere, thoughtful pro-lifers.  I admire, if nothing else, their principled dedication to a moral stance that regularly gets condemned in academia.  But I’d also say to them: even if <em>you</em> think of abortion as murder, a solid majority of Americans don’t, and it’s hard to see a stable way of getting what you want that skips the step where you change those Americans’ minds.  Indeed, there’s long been a pro-choice critique of <em>Roe</em>, which says that, by short-circuiting the political loosening of abortion restrictions that was already underway in the 70s, <em>Roe</em> fueled the growth of the radical right that’s now all but destroyed America.  For <em>Roe</em> falsely convinced pro-lifers that all they needed to do was seize control of the Supreme Court, by any means fair or foul, when what they <em>really</em> needed to do was convince the public.</p>



<p>And, let’s be honest, convincing the public means convincing them to adopt a religious as opposed to secular framework for morality.  (And not just <em>any</em> religious framework: Orthodox Jews, for example, while not exactly fans of abortion, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_abortion">fine</a> with it under many circumstances.  In the Jewish view, so the old classic goes, the fetus attains full personhood only after graduating medical school.)  Of the Americans who want abortion to be illegal in all or most cases, <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/views-about-abortion/">94%</a> are at least “fairly certain” that God exists, and 79% are “absolutely certain”—consistent with my experience of having met highly intelligent and articulate pro-lifers, but never <em>secular</em> ones.  Modulo <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/">Lizardman’s Constant</a>, virtually <em>all</em> pro-lifers have metaphysical commitments about God and the soul that presumably do some of the heavy lifting for them.  If the case for a blanket abortion ban can be made in terms that are compelling to a secular, rationalist, tradeoffs-based morality, no one seems to have done it yet.</p>



<p>From the standpoint of secular moral philosophy, my own opinion is that no one has ever improved on the <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/society/on-abortion-carl-sagan-ann-druyan/">searching analysis</a> of the abortion question that Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan published in 1990.  After painstakingly laying out scientific facts, moral hypotheticals, and commonsense principles, Sagan and Druyan ultimately conclude that the right question to ask is when the fetus develops something that’s<em> recognizably a human brain, processing thoughts and emotions</em>.  In practice, that probably means drawing a hard line at the end of the second trimester.  Coincidentally, that’s almost exactly where <em>Roe v. Wade</em> drew the line, but Sagan and Druyan’s reasoning is completely different: they reject <em>Roe</em>‘s criterion of viability outside the womb, as both morally irrelevant and contingent on medical technology.</p>



<p>Reasonable people could disagree with the details of Sagan and Druyan’s analysis.  But <em>if</em> we agree that</p>



<p>(1) a sperm and unfertizilied egg have a “personhood” of 0,</p>



<p>(2) a newborn baby has a “personhood” of 1, and</p>



<p>(3) whatever “personhood” is, it’s somehow tied to the gradual growth of neurons and dendrites in the physical universe, rather than to a mystical and discontinuous moment of ensoulment,</p>



<p>… then by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem">intermediate value theorem</a>, for all p∈(0,1), there’s going to be <em>some</em> stage of fetal development where the fetus has a personhood of p.  Which means that we’re going to be drawing a debatable line, making a compromise, just like the majority did in <em>Roe</em>.  To me, one of the strangest aspects of the abortion debate is how both sides came to view <em>Roe v. Wade</em> as the “pro-choice maximalist position,” forgetting how it itself was an attempted compromise between conflicting moral intuitions.</p>



<p>Another strange aspect of the debate is how the most visible representatives of both sides seem to have given up, decades ago, on actually<em> arguing</em> for their positions.  Maybe it’s because people simply threw up their hands in futility; or because all the ground had been covered with nothing left to say; or because the debate was so obviously entangled with religion, and we have a polite norm of not arguing about religion; or because both positions hardened into tribal identity markers, to be displayed rather than defended.  Whatever the reason, though, by the mid-90s everything became about border skirmishes one or two steps removed from the actual question: e.g., if the woman is under 18, should her parents be notified?  should she be shown pictures of her fetus and given a 24-hour waiting period in hopes she’ll reconsider?  is this judicial nominee hiding his or her anti-abortion views?</p>



<p>Now that Texas and five Supreme Court justices have launched a frontal assault on <em>Roe</em>—it’s impossible to see it any other way—it seems to me that the long armistice is over.  The pro-life side will have to make the case for its moral framework to a populace that will suddenly be paying more attention—and that includes tens of millions of Americans who hadn’t even been born the last time mainstream figures debated abortion head-on.  The pro-choice side can then counterargue for <em>its</em> moral framework.  If any pro-lifers are raring for this fight, I’ll point out that one of the most dramatic demographic changes, since the last time abortion was a “hot war,” has been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_religion_in_the_United_States#Demographics">doubling</a> in the percentage of Americans who are atheist, agnostic, or religiously unaffiliated.</p>



<p>Let me close this post with two things.</p>



<p>Firstly, if anyone is still unclear where I stand: over the next week, I will match <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers’ donations to <a href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/">NARAL</a> up to $2,000.  If you’d like to participate, just leave a comment with the amount you donated.  If I’ve argued with certain strains of feminism on this blog, that gives me all the <em>more</em> obligation to support the strains that I regard as fundamentally correct.</p>



<p>Secondly, come join us at the University of Kab … I mean Texas at Austin!  For grad students, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate/prospective-students/apply">see here</a>; for faculty, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/faculty/recruiting">see here</a>; for postdocs, email me a CV and recent publications and have two reference letters sent to me by December 31st.  In the US, the east coast is now being ravaged beyond recognition by hurricanes and the west coast by wildfires.  Here in Texas, all <em>we</em> have to deal with is extreme heat, a failing electrical grid, runaway covid, and now the ban on abortion.  Hook ’em Hadamards!</p></div>
