quantiles, with greater accuracy near the minimum and maximum of the
distribution. We develop a $t$-digest variant with accuracy asymmetric about
the median, thereby making possible alternative tradeoffs between computational
resources and accuracy which may be of particular interest for distributions
with significant skew. After establishing some theoretical properties of scale
functions for $t$-digests, we show that a tangent line construction on the
familiar scale functions preserves the crucial properties that allow
$t$-digests to operate online and be mergeable. We conclude with an empirical
study demonstrating the asymmetric variant preserves accuracy on one side of
the distribution with a much smaller memory footprint.

lattice problems to CLWE, showing that CLWE enjoys similar hardness guarantees
to those of LWE. Alternatively, our result can also be seen as opening new
avenues of (quantum) attacks on lattice problems. Our work resolves an open
problem regarding the computational complexity of learning mixtures of
Gaussians without separability assumptions (Diakonikolas 2016, Moitra 2018). As
an additional motivation, (a slight variant of) CLWE was considered in the
context of robust machine learning (Diakonikolas et al.~FOCS 2017), where
hardness in the statistical query (SQ) model was shown; our work addresses the
open question regarding its computational hardness (Bubeck et al.~ICML 2019).

    <title>Faster Deterministic All Pairs Shortest Paths in Congest Model</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1589932800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Agarwal:Udit.html">Udit Agarwal</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Ramachandran:Vijaya.html">Vijaya Ramachandran</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09588">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present a new deterministic algorithm for distributed weighted all pairs
shortest paths (APSP) in both undirected and directed graphs. Our algorithm
runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$ rounds in the Congest models on graphs with
arbitrary edge weights, and it improves on the previous $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$
bound of Agarwal et al. [ARKP18]. The main components of our new algorithm are
a new faster technique for constructing blocker set deterministically and a new
pipelined method for deterministically propagating distance values from source
nodes to the blocker set nodes in the network. Both of these techniques have
potential applications to other distributed algorithms.
</p>
<p>Our new deterministic algorithm for computing blocker set adapts the NC
approximate hypergraph set cover algorithm in [BRS94] to the distributed
construction of a blocker set. It follows the two-step process of first
designing a randomized algorithm that uses only pairwise independence, and then
derandomizes this algorithm using a sample space of linear size. This algorithm
runs in almost the same number of rounds as the initial step in our APSP
algorithm that computes $h$-hops shortest paths, and significantly improves on
the deterministic blocker set algorithms in [ARKP18, AR19] by removing an
additional $n\cdot |Q|$ term in the round bound, where Q is the blocker set.
</p>
<p>The other new component in our APSP algorithm is a deterministic pipelined
approach to propagate distance values from source nodes to blocker nodes. We
use a simple natural round-robin method for this step, and we show using a
suitable progress measure that it achieve the $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$ bound on the
number of rounds. It appears that the standard deterministic methods for
efficiently broadcasting multiple values, and for sending or receiving messages
using the routing schedule in [HPDG+19,LSP19] do not apply to this setting.

Tomescu</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09342">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We introduce a compact pangenome representation based on an optimal
segmentation concept that aims to reconstruct founder sequences from a multiple
sequence alignment (MSA). Such founder sequences have the feature that each row
of the MSA is a recombination of the founders. Several linear time dynamic
programming algorithms have been previously devised to optimize segmentations
that induce founder blocks that then can be concatenated into a set of founder
sequences. All possible concatenation orders can be expressed as a founder
block graph. We observe a key property of such graphs: if the node labels
(founder segments) do not repeat in the paths of the graph, such graphs can be
indexed for efficient string matching. We call such graphs segment repeat-free
founder block graphs.
</p>
<p>We give a linear time algorithm to construct a segment repeat-free founder
block graph given an MSA. The algorithm combines techniques from the founder
segmentation algorithms (Cazaux et al. SPIRE 2019) and fully-functional
bidirectional Burrows-Wheeler index (Belazzougui and Cunial, CPM 2019). We
derive a succinct index structure to support queries of arbitrary length in the
paths of the graph.
</p>
<p>Experiments on an MSA of SAR-CoV-2 strains are reported. An MSA of size
$410\times 29811$ is compacted in one minute into a segment repeat-free founder
block graph of 3900 nodes and 4440 edges. The maximum length and total length
of node labels is 12 and 34968, respectively. The index on the graph takes only
$3\%$ of the size of the MSA.

    <title>Multiple Source Replacement Path Problem</title>

Replacement Path Problem: given a graph $G$, $s$ and $t$, find shortest paths
from $s$ to $t$ avoiding each edge $e$ on the shortest path from $s$ to $t$.
These paths are called replacement paths in literature. For an undirected and
unweighted graph, (Malik, Mittal, and Gupta, Operation Research Letters, 1989)
and (Hershberger and Suri, FOCS 2001) designed an algorithm that solves the
replacement path problem in $\tilde O(m+n)$ time. It is natural to ask whether
we can generalize the replacement path problem: {\em can we find all
replacement paths from a source $s$ to all vertices in $G$?} This problem is
called the Single Source Replacement Path Problem.
</p>
<p>Recently (Chechik and Cohen, SODA 2019) designed a randomized combinatorial
algorithm that solves the Single Source Replacement Path Problem in $\tilde
O(m\sqrt n\ + n^2)$ time. One of the questions left unanswered by their work is
the case when there are many sources, not one. When there are $n$ sources, the
combinatorial algorithm of (Bernstein and Karger, STOC 2009) can be used to
find all pair replacement path in $\tilde O(mn + n^3)$ time. However, there is
no result known for any general $\sigma$. Thus, the problem we study is defined
as follows: given a set of $\sigma$ sources, we want to find the replacement
path from these sources to all vertices in $G$. We give a randomized
combinatorial algorithm for this problem that takes $\tilde O(m\sqrt{n \sigma}
+\ \sigma n^2)$ time. This result generalizes both results known for this
problem. Our algorithm is much different and arguably simpler than (Chechik and
Cohen, SODA 2019). Like them, we show a matching conditional lower bound using
the Boolean Matrix Multiplication conjecture.

values in time order, is often estimated by the dynamic time warping (DTW)
distance, instead of any in the well-studied family of measurements including
the longest common subsequence (LCS) length and the edit distance. Although it
may seem as if the DTW and LCS(-like) measurements are essentially different,
we reveal that the DTW distance can be represented by the longest increasing
subsequence (LIS) length of a sequence of integers, which is the LCS length
between the integer sequence and itself sorted. To demonstrate that techniques
developed under LCS(-like) measurements are directly applicable to analysis of
time series via our reduction of DTW to LIS, we present time-efficient
algorithms for DTW-related problems utilizing the semi-local sequence
comparison technique developed for LCS-related problems.

each voter a score that is determined only by the position of the candidate in
the voter's total ordering of the candidates. A winner (respectively, unique
winner) is a candidate who receives a score not smaller than (respectively,
strictly greater than) the remaining candidates. When voter preferences are
known in an incomplete manner as partial orders, a candidate can be a
possible/necessary (unique) winner based on the possibilities of completing the
partial votes. The computational problems of determining the possible and
necessary winners and unique winners have been studied in depth, culminating in
a full classification of the class of ``pure'' positional scoring rules into
tractable and intractable ones for each problem.
</p>
<p>Tha above problems are all special cases of reasoning about the range of
possible positions of a candidate under different tie breakers. Determining
this range, and particularly the extremal positions, arises in every situation
where the ranking plays an important role in the outcome of an election, such
as in committee selection, primaries of political parties, and staff
recruiting. Our main result establishes that the minimal and maximal positions
are hard to compute (DP-complete) for every positional scoring rule, pure or
not. Hence, none of the tractable variants of necessary/possible winner
determination remain tractable for extremal position determination. We do show,
however, that tractability can be retained when reasoning about the top-$k$ and
the bottom-$k$ positions for a fixed $k$.

or natural systems whose primary goal is the transportation of information or
goods. We say that a graph $\mathcal{G}$ is navigable when an agent is able to
efficiently reach any target node in $\mathcal{G}$ by means of local routing
decisions. In a social network navigability translates to the ability of
reaching an individual through personal contacts. Graph navigability is
well-studied, but a fundamental question is still open: why are some
individuals more likely than others to be reached via short,
friend-of-a-friend, communication chains? In this article we answer the
question above by proposing a novel centrality metric called the potential
gain, which, in an informal sense, quantifies the easiness at which a target
node can be reached. We define two variants of the potential gain, called the
geometric and the exponential potential gain, and present fast algorithms to
compute them. The geometric and the potential gain are the first instances of a
novel class of composite centrality metrics, i.e., centrality metrics which
combine the popularity of a node in $\mathcal{G}$ with its similarity to all
other nodes. As shown in previous studies, popularity and similarity are two
main criteria which regulate the way humans seek for information in large
networks such as Wikipedia. We give a formal proof that the potential gain of a
node is always equivalent to the product of its degree centrality (which
captures popularity) and its Katz centrality (which captures similarity).

grid and forming an initial connected shape $S_I$. Each device is equipped with
a linear-strength mechanism which enables it to move a whole line of
consecutive devices in a single time-step. We study the problem of transforming
$S_I$ into a given connected target shape $S_F$ of the same number of devices,
via a finite sequence of \emph{line moves}. Our focus is on designing
\emph{centralised} transformations aiming at \emph{minimising the total number
of moves} subject to the constraint of \emph{preserving connectivity} of the
shape throughout the course of the transformation. We first give very fast
connectivity-preserving transformations for the case in which the
\emph{associated graphs} of $ S_I $ and $ S_F $ are isomorphic to a Hamiltonian
line. In particular, our transformations make $ O(n \log n $) moves, which is
asymptotically equal to the best known running time of connectivity-breaking
transformations. Our most general result is then a connectivity-preserving
\emph{universal transformation} that can transform any initial connected shape
$ S_I $ into any target connected shape $ S_F $, through a sequence of
$O(n\sqrt{n})$ moves. Finally, we establish $\Omega(n \log n)$ lower bounds for
two restricted sets of transformations. These are the first lower bounds for
this model and are matching the best known $ O(n \log n) $ upper bounds.

efficiently compare two time series that can vary in speed. Given two strings
$A$ and $B$ of respective lengths $m$ and $n$, there is a fundamental dynamic
programming algorithm that computes the DTW distance for $A$ and $B$ together
with an optimal alignment in $\Theta(mn)$ time and space. In this paper, we
tackle the problem of interactive computation of the DTW distance for dynamic
strings, denoted $\mathrm{D^2TW}$, where character-wise edit operation
(insertion, deletion, substitution) can be performed at an arbitrary position
of the strings. Let $M$ and $N$ be the sizes of the run-length encoding (RLE)
of $A$ and $B$, respectively. We present an algorithm for $\mathrm{D^2TW}$ that
occupies $\Theta(mN+nM)$ space and uses $O(m+n+\#_{\mathrm{chg}}) \subseteq
O(mN + nM)$ time to update a compact differential representation $\mathit{DS}$
of the DP table per edit operation, where $\#_{\mathrm{chg}}$ denotes the
number of cells in $\mathit{DS}$ whose values change after the edit operation.
Our method is at least as efficient as the algorithm recently proposed by
Froese et al. running in $\Theta(mN + nM)$ time, and is faster when
$\#_{\mathrm{chg}}$ is smaller than $O(mN + nM)$ which, as our preliminary
experiments suggest, is likely to be the case in the majority of instances. In
addition, our result leads to interactive LCS/weighted edit distance
computation running in $O(m+n+\#_{\mathrm{chg}}) \subseteq O(mN + nM)$ time per
update using $\Theta(mN + nM)$ space. This improves on Hyyr\"o et al.'s
interactive algorithm that occupies $\Theta(mn)$ space and uses $O(mn)$ time
per update in the worst case.

Look-Compute-Move cycles, is confined within a circular track. All robots agree
on the clockwise direction (chirality), they are activated by an adversarial
semi-synchronous scheduler (SSYNCH), and an active robot always reaches the
destination point it computes (rigidity). Robots have limited visibility: each
robot can see only the points on the circle that have an angular distance
strictly smaller than a constant $\vartheta$ from the robot's current location,
where $0&lt;\vartheta\leq\pi$ (angles are expressed in radians).
</p>
<p>We study the Gathering problem for such a swarm of robots: that is, all
robots are initially in distinct locations on the circle, and their task is to
reach the same point on the circle in a finite number of turns, regardless of
the way they are activated by the scheduler. Note that, due to the anonymity of
the robots, this task is impossible if the initial configuration is
rotationally symmetric; hence, we have to make the assumption that the initial
configuration be rotationally asymmetric.
</p>
<p>We prove that, if $\vartheta=\pi$ (i.e., each robot can see the entire circle
except its antipodal point), there is a distributed algorithm that solves the
Gathering problem for swarms of any size. By contrast, we also prove that, if
$\vartheta\leq \pi/2$, no distributed algorithm solves the Gathering problem,
regardless of the size of the swarm, even under the assumption that the initial
configuration is rotationally asymmetric and the visibility graph of the robots
is connected.
</p>
<p>The latter impossibility result relies on a probabilistic technique based on
random perturbations, which is novel in the context of anonymous mobile robots.
Such a technique is of independent interest, and immediately applies to other
Pattern-Formation problems.

quadrature schemes for integrating functions over planar regions bounded by
rational parametric curves. Our algorithm proceeds in two steps: (1) We first
find intermediate quadrature rules for line integrals along the region's
boundary curves corresponding to Green's theorem. (2) We then use a high-order
quadrature rule to compute the numerical antiderivative of the integrand along
a coordinate axis, which is used to evaluate the Green's theorem line integral.
We present two methods to compute the intermediate quadrature rule. The first
is spectrally accurate (it converges faster than any algebraic order with
respect to number of quadrature points) and is relatively easy to implement,
but has no guarantee of polynomial exactness. The second guarantees exactness
for polynomial integrands up to a pre-specified degree k with an a priori-known
number of quadrature points and retains the convergence properties of the
first, but is slightly more complicated. The quadrature schemes have
applications to computation of geometric moments, immersogeometric analysis,
conservative field transfer between high-order meshes, and initialization of
simulations with rational geometry. We compare the quadrature schemes produced
using our method to other methods in the literature and show that they are much
more efficient both in terms of number of quadrature points and computational
time.

    <title>Incentive Compatible Sensitive Surveys</title>
    <summary>Crucial decisions are increasingly being made by automated machine learning algorithms. These algorithms rely on data, and without high quality data, the resulting decisions may be inaccurate and/or unfair. In some cases, data is readily available: for example, location data passively collected by smartphones. In other cases, data may be difficult to obtain by automated means, and it is necessary to directly survey the population. However, individuals are not always motivated to take surveys if they receive no benefit.

For concreteness, imagine that you are a health administrator trying to estimate the average weight in a population. This is a sensitive attribute that individuals may be reluctant to disclose, especially if their weight is not considered healthy. A generic survey may yield disproportionately more respondents with “healthy” weights, and thus may result an an inaccurate estimate (see, e.g, Shields et al., 2011).

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1708" height="184" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/correlation.png?w=459" width="457"/></figure></div>

<p>For concreteness, imagine that you are a health administrator trying to estimate the average weight in a population. This is a sensitive attribute that individuals may be reluctant to disclose, especially if their weight is not considered healthy. A generic survey may yield disproportionately more respondents with “healthy” weights, and thus may result an an inaccurate estimate (see, e.g, Shields et al., 2011).</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1707" height="234" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/scale.jpeg?w=1024" width="408"/></figure></div>

<p>In this post, we discuss three papers which propose solutions to this problem through the lens of <em>mechanism design</em>. The idea is to carefully design payments so that we received an unbiased sample, leading to a hopefully accurate estimate.</p>

<h2><strong>Model</strong></h2>

<p>We use <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> to denote agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>‘s data (e.g., her weight). We assume that each agent also has a personal cost <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>, representing her level of reluctance to reveal her data. Agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> is willing to reveal <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> if and only if she receives a payment of at least <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>. Our goal is to allocate higher payments to agents with higher <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>‘s, in order to get an unbiased sample. However, we also must obey an budget constraint: we cannot spend more than <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B"/> total. The solution is to transact non-deterministically: with some probability, offer to purchase an agent’s data. Agents with higher costs will receive higher payments, but lower transaction probabilities.</p>

<p>We assume that agents are drawn at random independently from some distribution. Our crucial assumption is that we known the marginal distribution of agent costs, which we denote <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}"/> (we will explore later what happens when this assumption is removed). However, we do not know the distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>, and that distribution can be arbitrarily correlated with <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}"/>. As mentioned above, one might expect agents with less “desirable” <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s may have higher costs, but one can imagine more complex correlations as well.</p>

<p>Our mechanisms consist of two parts: an <em>allocation rule</em> <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/>, and a <em>payment rule</em> <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>. Given <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>, the mechanism works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Ask each agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> to report <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>. Let <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/> denote the actual reported cost.</li><li>With probability <img alt="A(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A(c)"/>, we purchase the agent’s data and pay her <img alt="P(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c)"/>. With probability <img alt="1 - A(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+-+A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="1 - A(c)"/>, we do not buy the data, and no payment is made.</li><li>At the end, use the data we learned to form an estimate of the population average of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>. Let <img alt="\bar{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{z}"/> denote our estimate.</li></ol>

<p>In this model, agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>‘s expected utility for reporting <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/> is <img alt="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_i%28c%29+%3D+A%28c%29+%28P%28c%29+-+c_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)"/>.</p>

<p>We have four main requirements:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Truthfulness. </strong>It should be in each agent’s best interest to truthfully report <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>.</li><li><strong>Individual rationality. </strong>Agents should not receive negative utility if they are honest, i.e., we should have <img alt="P(c_i) \ge c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c_i%29+%5Cge+c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c_i) \ge c_i"/> for all <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>.</li><li><strong>Budget constrained. </strong>Our total expected payment should not exceed <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B"/>, i.e., <img alt="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Csum_i+A%28c_i%29+P%28c_i%29%5D+%5Cle+B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B"/>.</li><li><strong>Unbiased. </strong>Our estimate isn’t consistently too high or too low. Specifically, the expected value of our estimate should be equal to the true average, i.e., <img alt="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Cbar%7Bz%7D%5D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Bz_i%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]"/>.</li></ol>

<p>Lack of bias doesn’t mean that our estimate is accurate, however. To this end, our primary goal is to <strong>minimize the variance</strong>, subject to the mechanism obeying the four above criteria. We evaluate variance via a worst-case framework: given a mechanism, we wish minimize the variance with respect to the worst-case distribution of agents for that mechanism. The idea is that the distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s is not known to the mechanism, so we require it to perform well for all distributions.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1729" height="203" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/goal.jpg?w=970" width="438"/>Goal.</figure></div>

<p>When we refer to the “optimal” mechanism, we mean minimum variance, subject to being truthful, individually rational, budget constrained, and unbiased (henceforth TIBU).</p>

<p><strong>The Horvitz Thomspon Estimator</strong></p>

<p>Once we have learned the <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s, how do we actual form an estimate of the mean? Luckily for us, this question has a simple answer. If we restrict ourselves to linear unbiased estimators, there is a unique way to do this, known as the <em>Horvitz-Thompson estimator</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum%5Climits_i+%5Ccfrac%7Bz_i%7D%7BA%28c_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}"/></p>

<p>Thus our task is simply to choose <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>.</p>

<h2>Approach #1</h2>

<p>This model was first considered by Roth and Schoenebeck (2012). They are able to characterize a mechanism which is TIBU and has variance at most <img alt="1/n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="1/n"/> more than the optimal variance, where <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n"/> is the number of agents. However, they do make the strong assumption that <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> is either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Their approach relies on <em>Take-It-Or-Leave-It</em> mechanisms. Such a mechanism is defined by a distribution $G$ over the positive real numbers, and works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Each agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> reports a cost <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/>.</li><li>Sample a payment <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> from <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/>.</li><li>If <img alt="p \ge c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%5Cge+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p \ge c"/>, buy the agent’s data with payment <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/>. If <img alt="p &lt; c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3C+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p &lt; c"/>, do not buy the agent’s data.</li></ol>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" height="212" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDzLmHAWwAAEPkl.jpg" width="293"/></figure></div>

<p>This amounts to an allocation rule <img alt="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29+%3D+1+-+%5Ctext%7BPr%7D%5Bp%5Cge+c%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]"/>, and a payment rule <img alt="P(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c)"/> equal to the distribution <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/> conditioned on being at least <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/>. The authors show that these mechanisms are fully general, i.e., any allocation and payment rule can be implemented by a Take-It-Or-Leave-It mechanism.</p>

<p>The proof of their main result is primarily based on using the calculus of variations to optimize over the space of distributions <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/>. The paper contains some additional results, for example regarding an alternate model where we wish to minimize the budget, but that is outside the scope of this blog post.</p>

<h2>Approach #2</h2>

<p>Although the above result is a great step, it leaves room for improvement. First of all, the assumption that <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> is binary is quite strong, and does not apply to our running example of body weight. Secondly, their mechanism does not quite achieve the optimal variance. Chen et al. (2018) remedy both of these concerns. That is, they allow <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> to be any real number, and they characterize the TIBU mechanism with optimal variance. Their result also generalizes to more complex statistical estimates, not just the average <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>, and it holds for both continuous and discrete agent distributions.</p>

<p>The approach of Chen et al. (2018) is based on two primary ideas. First, they show that any monotone allocation rule (i.e., we are always less likely to purchase data from an agent with higher cost) can be implemented in a TIBU fashion by a unique payment rule. Thus we only need to identify the optimal allocation rule. (This is similar to the standard result from auction theory about implementable monotone allocation rules (Myerson 1981).)</p>

<p>The second idea is to view the problem as a zero-sum game between ourselves (the mechanism designer) and an adversary who chooses the distribution of agents. Given a distribution, we choose an allocation rule to minimize the variance, and given an allocation rule, the adversary chooses a distribution to maximize the variance.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" height="297" src="https://i2.wp.com/marketbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Zero-Sum-Game.jpg?fit=511%2C521&amp;ssl=1&amp;resize=1200%2C1223.4833659491" width="292"/></figure></div>

<p>The authors are able to solve for the equilibrium of this game and thus identify the TIBU mechanism with minimum possible variance.</p>

<h2>Approach #3</h2>

<p>Approach #2 gave us our desired result: a minimum variance mechanism subject to our four desired properties (TIBU), for any distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s. But we are still making a very strong assumption: that we know the distribution of agent costs.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1766" height="230" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/prior.png?w=500" width="427"/></figure></div>

<p>Chen and Zheng (2019) do away with this assumption in a follow-up paper. They consider a model where the mechanism has no prior information on the distribution of costs (or on the distribution of data), and $n$ agents arrive one-by-one in a uniformly random order. Each agent reports a cost, and we decide whether to buy her data, and what to pay her. In order to price well, we need to learn the cost distribution, but we must do this while simultaneously making irrevocable purchasing decisions. The main result is a TIBU mechanism with variance at most a constant factor worse than optimal.</p>

<p>The authors note that after each step <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>, the reported costs up to that point induce an empirical cost distribution <img alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}_i"/>. Using the results of Chen et al. (2018), we can determine the optimal mechanism for <img alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}_i"/>. The basic idea is to use that mechanism for the current step, learn a new agent cost <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/> (note that the agent reports <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/> regardless of whether we purchase her data) and then update our empirical distribution accordingly. (The authors actually end up using an approximately optimal allocation rule, but the idea is the same.) The mechanism also uses more budget in the earlier rounds, to make up for the pricing being less accurate.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>In this post, we considered the problem of surveying a sensitive attribute where an agent’s data may be correlated with their willingness to participate. We discussed three different approaches, all of which rely of giving higher payments to agents with higher costs, in order to incentivize them to participate and to obtain an unbiased estimate. The final approach was able to give a truthful, individually rational, budget feasible, and unbiased mechanism with approximately optimal variance, without making any prior assumptions on the distribution of agents.</p>

<p>However, all three of the approaches assume that agents cannot lie about the data. This is reasonable for some attributes, such as a body weight, where an agent can be asked to step onto a physical scale. However, requiring participants come in person to a particular location will certainly lead to less engagement. Furthermore, for other sensitive attributes, there may not be a verifiable way to obtain the data. Future work could investigate alternative models where this assumption is not necessary. For example, perhaps agents do not maliciously lie, but rather are simply inaccurate at reporting their own attributes. For example, research has demonstrated that people consistently over-report height and under-report weight (e.g., Gorber et al., 2007). Could a mechanism learn the pattern of inaccuracy and compensate for that to still obtain an unbiased estimate?</p>

    <title>Obit for Richard Dudley</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div>
Richard M. (Dick) Dudley died on Jan. 19, 2020 (NOT from Coronavirus).You can find obituaries for him  <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/richard-dudley-mit-mathematics-professor-emeritus-dies-0218">here</a>, <a href="https://math.mit.edu/about/history/obituaries/dudley.php">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/in-memory/in-memory">here</a> and an interview with him from 2019  <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056041">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Professor Dudley worked in Probability and Statistics. His work is now</div>
<div>
being used in Machine Learning. Here is a guest-post-obit by</div>
<div>
David Marcus who had Prof. Dudley as his PhD Thesis Advisor.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
-----------------------------------</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Guest Blog Obit by David Marcus:</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Dick was my thesis advisor at M.I.T. After I got my Ph.D. in 1983, I went</div>
<div>
to work in industry, so did not work closely with him, as some of his other</div>
<div>
students did. But, I enjoyed working with him very much in graduate school.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Dick was very precise. His lecture notes and articles (and later his books)</div>
<div>
said exactly what needed to be said and didn't waste words. In his classes,</div>
<div>
he always handed out complete lecture notes, thus letting you concentrate</div>
<div>
on the material rather than having to take a lot of notes.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Dick was very organized, but his office had piles of papers and journal</div>
<div>
articles everywhere. There is a picture <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/richard-dudley-mit-mathematics-professor-emeritus-dies-0218">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Before Dick was my advisor, I took his probability course. My orals were</div>
<div>
going to be towards the end of the term, and I was going to use probability</div>
<div>
as one of my two minor areas. So, I spent a lot of time studying the</div>
<div>
material. Dick gave a final exam in the course. The final exam was unlike</div>
<div>
any other final exam I ever took: The exam listed twelve areas that had</div>
<div>
been covered in the course. The instructions said to pick ten and for each</div>
<div>
area give the main definitions and theorems and, if you had time, prove the</div>
<div>
theorems. Since I had been studying the material for my orals, I didn't</div>
<div>
have much trouble, but if I hadn't been studying it for my orals, it would</div>
<div>
have been quite a shock!(COMMENT FROM BILL: Sounds like a lazy way to make up an exam, though on this</div>
<div>
level of may it works. I know of a prof whose final was</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Make up 4 good questions for the final. Now Solve them.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Once Dick became my advisor, Dick and I had a regular weekly meeting. I'd</div>
<div>
tell him what I'd figured out or what I'd found in a book or journal</div>
<div>
article over the last week and we'd discuss it and he'd make suggestions.</div>
<div>
At some point, I'd say I needed to think about it, and I'd leave. I never</div>
<div>
did find out how long these meetings were supposed to last because I was</div>
<div>
always the one to end them.(COMMENT FROM BILL: It's good someone ended them! Or else you might never</div>
<div>
had graduated :-) )</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
When I began working with Dick, he said he already had a full</div>
<div>
load of students, but he would see if he had something I could work on. The</div>
<div>
problem Dick came up with for me to work on was to construct a</div>
<div>
counterexample to a theorem that Dick had published. Dick knew his</div>
<div>
published proof was wrong, and had an idea of what a counterexample might</div>
<div>
look like, so suggested I might be able to prove it was a counterexample.</div>
<div>
In retrospect, this was perhaps a risky thesis problem for me since if the</div>
<div>
student gets stuck, the professor can spend time figuring out how to do it.</div>
<div>
But, in this case, presumably Dick had already put some effort into it</div>
<div>
without success. Regardless, with Dick's guidance, I was able to prove it,</div>
<div>
and soon after got my Ph.D.(COMMENT FROM BILL: Sounds risky since if Dick could not do it, maybe it's too hard.)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
In 2003 there was a conference in honor of Dick's 65th birthday. All of his</div>
<div>
ex-students were invited, and many of them attended. There was a day of</div>
<div>
talks, and we all went out to dinner (Chinese food, if I recall correctly)</div>
<div>
in the evening. At dinner, I asked Dick if any of his other students had</div>
<div>
written a thesis that disproved one of his published theorems. He said I</div>
<div>
was the only one.(COMMENT FROM BILL: Really good that not only was he okay with you disproving</div>
<div>
his theorem, he encouraged you to!)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
<br/></div></div>

    <title>TR20-077 |  Factorization of Polynomials Given by Arithmetic Branching Programs | 

	Amit Sinhababu, 

	Thomas Thierauf</title>
    <summary>Given a multivariate polynomial computed by an arithmetic branching program (ABP) of size $s$, we show that all its factors can be computed by arithmetic branching programs of size $\text{poly}(s)$. Kaltofen gave a similar result for polynomials computed by arithmetic circuits. The previously known best upper bound for ABP-factors was $\text{poly}(s^{\log s}) $.</summary>

    <title>Identifying Statistical Bias in Dataset Replication</title>

<p><i> We discuss our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">paper</a>
on diagnosing bias in dataset replication 
studies. Zooming in on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">ImageNet-v2</a>
reproduction effort, we explain the majority of the accuracy drop between
ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 (from 11.7% to 3.6%) after accounting
for bias in the data collection process. </i></p>

<h2 id="measuring-progress-in-supervised-learning">Measuring Progress in Supervised Learning</h2>
<p>In the last few years, researchers have made extraordinary progress on
increasing accuracy on vision tasks like those in the <a href="http://image-net.org">ImageNet</a>,
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a>, and <a href="http://cocodataset.org/#home">COCO</a> datasets. Progress on these tasks is promising, but
comes with an important caveat: the test sets used to measure performance are
finite, fixed, and have been used and re-used by countless researchers over
several years.</p>

<p>There are (at least) two possible ways in which evaluating solely with test-set
accuracy could hinder our progress on the tasks researchers design benchmarks to
proxy (e.g. general image classification for ImageNet). The first of these
issues is adaptive overfitting: since each dataset has only one test
set to measure performance on, algorithmic progress on that (finite and fixed)
test set could be mistaken for algorithmic progress on the distribution from
which the test set was chosen from.</p>

<p>The second issue that could arise is
oversensitivity to irrelevant properties of the test distribution
arising from the dataset collection process; for example, the image encoding
algorithm used to save images.</p>

<p><em>How can we assess whether models are truly making progress on the tasks that
our benchmarks proxy</em>?</p>

<h3 id="dataset-replication">Dataset replication</h3>
<p>A promising approach to diagnosing the two above issues is <em>dataset
replication</em>, in which one mimics the original test set creation process as
closely as possible to make a new dataset. Then, existing models’ performance on
this newly created test set should identify any models that have adaptively
overfit to the original test set. Moreover, since every intricacy of a dataset
collection process cannot be mimicked exactly, natural variability in the
replication should help us unearth cases of algorithms’ oversensitivity to the
original dataset creation process.</p>

<p>The problem of replicating the original test set creation process is harder than it may initially appear. Particularly challenging is controlling for relevant covariates In experimental design, a <a href="https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/confusing-statistical-terms-5-covariate/">covariate</a>is a variable that is not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables#Statistics">independent variable</a> (in our case the choice of dataset), but affects measurements of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables#Statistics">dependent variable</a> (in our case the accuracy).&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; For example, suppose we wanted to replicate a study about the effect of a certain drug on an age-linked disease. After gathering subjects, we have to reweight or filter them so that the age distribution matches that of the original study, as otherwise the results of the studies are incomparable. This filtering/reweighting step is analogous to dataset replication, with participant age being the relevant covariate., or variables that we expect to have an impact on the outcome (i.e., model accuracy) we measure.</p>

<p>To match covariate distributions between the new reproduction and the original
dataset, we frame dataset replication as a two-step process. In step one, the
replicator collects candidate data using a data pipeline as similar as possible
to that used by the original dataset creators. Then, after approximating the
original pipeline, the dataset replicator should identify the relevant covariate
statistic(s), and choose candidates (via filtering or reweighting the collected
candidate data) so that the distributions of the statistic under the replicated
and original datasets are equal. We call this process statistic
matchingIn causal inference literature, statistic matching is often
referred to as enforcing covariate balance..</p>

<h3 id="imagenet-v2">ImageNet-v2</h3>
<p>In their recent work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Recht et al.</a> use
dataset replication to take a closer look at model performance on ImageNet, one
of the most widely used computer vision datasets. They first use an apparatus
similar to that of the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575">ImageNet
paper</a> to collect a large set of candidate
images and labels from the photo-sharing site <a href="https://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Then, in the second step, they identify and control for a covariate called the
“selection frequency.” Selection frequency is a measure of how frequently a
(time-limited) human decides that an image (with its candidate label) is
“correctly labeled.” We can get estimate selection frequencies by asking crowd
workers questions like:</p>

<p><br/>
<!-- PIPELINE DIAGRAM --></p>

  <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/idbias/selfreq.png"/>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Selection frequency is a very reasonable (and in some sense, the
“right”) covariate to control for, since the original ImageNet dataset 
was filtered using a similar measureTo construct ImageNet, the
authors scraped many candidate image-label pairs, and just as above, asked
crowd workers whether the image corresponded to the label---filtering was done
via a convincing-majority vote procedure, making the selection frequency a
relevant metric.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Recht et al.</a> obtain empirical selection
frequency estimates for the ImageNet validation set and their collected
candidate pool by presentingThe figure above is simplified for
clarity—in reality, datapoints are presented to the crowd workers as
groups of 48 images, all corresponding to the same candidate label, and
annotators are asked to select the images in that group that truly correspond to
the
label. each (image, label) pair to 10 crowd workers.</p>

<p>By filtering on the selection frequency in various ways, the authors come up
with three new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImageNet-v2</code> datasets. One of these, called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MatchedFrequency</code>, is a “true” dataset replication in the sense that it tries
to control for the selecion frequency by filtering the candidate images and
labels so that the resulting selection frequency distribution matches that of
the original ImageNet validation set. 
Since our focus is on dataset
replication, from now on we’ll ignore the other datasets, and use
“MatchedFrequency” and “ImageNet-v2” interchangeably. For convenience, we’ll
also use “ImageNet” and “ImageNet-v1” interchangeably to refer to the original
ImageNet validation setSince the test set is not released, the
ImageNet validation set usually acts as a de facto test set, and the two terms
(validation and test) are used interchangeably to refer to the validation
set..</p>

<p>The key observation made by the ImageNet-v2 authors—and the one that we’ll
focus on in this post—is a <em>consistent</em> drop in accuracy that models suffer
when evaluated on ImageNet-v2 instead of ImageNet:</p>

<p><br/></p>
<canvas height="200" id="v1v2_orig" width="400"/>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Each dot in the scatter plot above represents a model—the $x$ coordinate is
the model’s ImageNet accuracy, and the $y$ coordinate is the model’s accuracy
when evaluated on ImageNet-v2. (You can mouse over the dots to see
model names!) Ideally, since the generating pipelines for the two datasets are
similar, and the relevant covariates were matched, one would expect all of the
models to fall on the dotted line $y = x$. Yet, across the examined models,
their accuracies dropped by an average of 11.7% between ImageNet and
ImageNet-v2.</p>

<h2 id="our-findings">Our Findings</h2>
<p>The significant accuracy drop above presents an empirical mystery given the
similarity in data pipeline between the two datasets. Why do classifiers perform
so poorly on ImageNet-v2?</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">work</a>, we identify an aspect of the dataset reproduction process
that might lead to a significant accuracy drop. The general phenomenon we
identify is that in dataset replication, even mean-zero noise in measurements of
the relevant covariate/control variable can result in significant bias in the
resulting matched dataset if not accounted for.</p>

<p>In the case of ImageNet-v2, we show how noisy readings of the selection
frequency statistic can result in bias in the ImageNet-v2 dataset towards lower
selection frequency and consequently, lower accuracyRecht et al. observed previously that changes in selection frequency affect model performance..</p>

<p>After accounting for this bias and thus controlling for selection
frequency, we estimate that the adjusted ImageNet to ImageNet-v2
accuracy gap is less than or equal to 3.6% (instead of the initially observed
11.7%).</p>

<p>In the next few sections, we’ll focus on ImageNet-v2, first trying to get a
clearer picture of the source of statistical bias in this dataset replication
effort, and then discussing ways to correct for it.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-the-bias">Identifying the bias</h3>

<p>Earlier, we decomposed the data replication process into two steps: (1)
replicating the pipeline, and (2) controlling for covariates via statistic
matching. 
To perform the latter of these two steps, one
first needs to find the distribution of the relevant statistic (e.g., selection
frequency, in the case of ImageNet) for both the original test set as well as
the newly collected data. 
Just as with any empirical statistic, however, we can’t 
read the true selection frequency $s(x)$ for any given image $x$. We can only sample from a binomial random variable,</p>

<p>\[
    \widehat{s}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\text{Binomial}(n, s(x)),
\]</p>

<p>to obtain a selection frequency estimate, i.e., where $n$
is the number of crowd workers used.</p>

<p>Now, even though the expected value of the measurement we get is indeed $s(x)$
(i.e., $\widehat{s}(x)$ is an unbiased estimator of $s(x)$), 
the reading itselfThis is not the same as the underlying selection frequency for an image; for example, a
image-label pair $x$ might have a true selection frequency of $s(x) = 0.645$,
meaning that on average a crowd annotator is 64.5% likely to say that the image
corresponds to the label. If we ask 10 crowd annotators to label the pair,
however, we never observe this 64.5% number. will be $k/n$ for some integer $k$ (with $n=10$, in the
case of the ImageNet-v2 replication process).</p>

<p>To see why this seemingly innocuous fact impacts the dataset replication
process, suppose we knew exactly what the distribution of true selection
frequency looked like for both the original ImageNet test set and the candidate
images collected through the ImageNet-v2 replication pipeline:</p>

<p><br/></p>
<canvas id="priorCtx"/>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Suppose now that we estimate a selection frequency of $\widehat{s}(x) = 0.7$ for
a given image $x$ (i.e., seven of the ten workers who were shown the image and
its candidate label, marked it as correctly labeled). The key observation here
is that given this empirical selection frequency, the most likely value for
$s(x)$ is not $\widehat{s}(x)$ (even though $\widehat{s}(x)$ is an unbiased
estimator of $s(x)$). Instead, the maximum likelihood estimate actually depends
on which dataset $x$ is from!</p>

<p>If $x$ was sourced from ImageNet, it’s more likely that $s(x) &gt; 0.7$ and
therefore that $\widehat{s}(x)$ is an underestimate, since most of the mass of
the ImageNet selection frequency distribution—see our (hypothetical) plot
above—is on $s(x) &gt; 0.7$. Conversely, if $x$ was a newly collected candidate
image, then most likely $s(x) &lt; 0.7$.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<strong>Remark:</strong> Mathematically, the phenomenon is that
$E[\widehat{s}(x)|s(x)] = s(x)$, but $E[s(x)|\widehat{s}(x)]$ is not equal to $s(x)$, and
instead depends on the distribution of $s(x)$ via Bayes'
ruleSpecifically, we have that for a given dataset,
$$p(s|\widehat{s}) = \frac{p_{data}(s) \cdot p_{binom}(\widehat{s}|s)} {\int
p(s') p_{binom}(\widehat{s}|s')\ ds'},$$ where $p_{data}$ is the density function
for selection frequencies under this dataset, and $p_{binom}$ is the binomial
probability mass function..
</div>

<p>The interactive graph below visualizes this intuition: by moving the
slider, you can adjust the “observed” selection frequency $\widehat{s}(x)$. The 
shaded curves then show what our belief about the corresponding true
selection frequency $s(x)$ looks like, depending on which pool the image
came from.</p>

<p>Thus, if the selection frequency distribution of ImageNet is skewed upwards
compared to that of the collected candidate images (which is likely, since
ImageNet was already filtered for qualityImageNet was
originally constructed by collecting candidate images in a way similar to the
ones described here, and then subsequently filtering for quality using a
"majority vote" based on selection frequency. when it was
constructed), matching the two data sources via observed selection frequency
will result in ImageNet images having systematically higher selection
frequencies than their new ImageNet-v2 counterparts. Also, the noiser our
reading of observed selection frequency are (i.e. the less annotators we use),
the more important the source distribution becomes, and so the greater the
effect of the bias. Indeed, if we were able to use infinite annotators for each
image, the bias would disappear, as we would have perfect readings of the
corresponding selection frequency. The only possible value for $s(x)$ would then
be $s(x) = \widehat{s}(x)$, making the shaded distributions above collapse
into a point mass at the green line.</p>

<p>The bias we are describing is summarized visually in the interactive graph below: by adjusting the
sliders, you can manipulate the distributions of “true” selection frequency for
ImageNet (red) and for the candidate data (black), as well as the number of
annotators used to estimate selection frequencies. The distribution of
ImageNet-v2 selection frequencies resulting from performing statistic matching
is shown in blue. Notice that as long as the candidate selection frequencies do
not come from the same distribution as the ImageNet selection frequencies,
the resulting ImageNet-v2 test set never matches the original test set
statistics. For the reasons we discussed earlier, having less annotators, or having a bigger gap between ImageNet and the candidate
distribution, also exacerbate the effect.</p>

<h2 id="quantifying-the-effects-of-bias">Quantifying the Effects of Bias</h2>

<p>The model above, paired with the fact that ImageNet (having already been
filtered for quality before) is likely much higher-quality than candidate images sourced from
Flickr, predicts that ImageNet-v2 images’ selection frequencies are
consistently lower than those of ImageNet images. To test this
theory, we set up another crowdsourced task that is extremely similar (but
not quite identicalWe implemented a few changes for quality control but kept
the task instructions and interface constant: the exact differences are outlined in Appendix
B.2 of our paper.) to the one used by the ImageNet-v2
creators, this time using 40 annotators per image (instead of 10) to estimate
its selection frequency. A histogram of the selection frequencies we 
observed in our experiment is shown below:</p>

<p><br/></p>

  <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/idbias/selfreq_histogram.png"/>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Even though the ImageNet-v2 creators report average selection
frequencies for ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 of 0.71 and 0.73 respectively, our
new experiments yield average selection frequencies of 0.85 and 0.81; note the change
in relative ordering (why are the selection frequencies
higher?We discuss this in depth in Appendix B.2 of our
paper. The task and instructions are the same, so we hypothesize that the
discrepancy boils down to either (a) data quality: we used <a href="https://blog.mturk.com/tutorial-managing-worker-cohorts-with-qualifications-e928cd30b173">worker
qualifications</a> to ensure annotator quality while the original experiment did
not—qualifications have been shown to reduce the share of low-quality or
inattentive crowd workers from 34% to 2% in other studies (e.g., the
study we reference found that 16%/0.4% of workers without/with qualifications reported
having had a <em>fatal</em> heart attack while watching television); or (b) data makeup:
workers are presented with grids of 48 images at a time in both experiments,
with grids containing a mix of ImageNet, ImageNet-v2, and candidate
images—but the exact proportions of this mix differ between the two
experiments.).</p>

<div class="footnote"><strong>Aside</strong>: Why did we need to run a new
crowdsourced study to observe this gap, instead of using the data already
collected for the ImageNet-v2 study? The answer is finite-sample reuse:
the selection frequencies collected in the original study are
precisely the ones used to filter the ImageNet-v2 dataset. So, by
construction, these selection frequency will match the selection
frequencies of the ones of ImageNet test set, regardless of whether
there is bias in the selection processTo draw a crude analogy here,
suppose that instead of matching image datasets we are matching piles of coins: 
Pile A is rigged $P(\text{heads})=1$, but Pile B is fair $P(\text{heads}) =
0.5$. We flip all the coins in both piles 10 times each---inevitably (if
there are enough total coins in Pile B), some of the Pile B coins will land
"heads" all 10 times, and will thus appear identical to the rigged Pile A
coins. Are they in fact identical? (After all, these coins match the Pile A
coins according to the "number of heads" statistic!) The answer is obviously
"no," but the key is that even though all the coins in Pile B are
fair (and flipping them another 10 times would reveal this), it's impossible to
conclude anything other than $P(\text{heads}) = 1$ solely from the
already-collected data on the selected coins.. If we're
careful about avoiding this finite-sample reuse (for example, by
re-performing the filtering process using half of the annotators and then
measuring selection frequencies with the other half) we can actually identify
bias in the original data—the process for doing so
is shown in Appendix C of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">our paper</a>.</div>

<h3 id="how-does-this-bias-affect-measured-accuracy">How does this bias affect measured accuracy?</h3>

<p>Our model and experiments suggest that matching empirical statistics from
different sources introduces bias into the dataset replication pipeline, and
that in the case of ImageNet-v2 this means that selection frequencies are
actually lower for the new ImageNet-v2 test set compared to the old one. Since
selection frequency is meant to roughly reflect data quality, and is known (as
found already by the ImageNet-v2 authors) to affect model accuracy, we expect the
downwards selection frequency bias in ImageNet-v2 to directly translate into a downwards
bias in model accuracy.</p>

<p>To test if this is really the case, we use a progressively increasing number of
annotators $n$ out of the 40 that we collected. For each $n$, we matchWe perform this matching via reweighting, rather than
filtering---more details are given in the next section. the
ImageNet-v2 observed selection frequencies (calculated using $n$ annotators) to
the ImageNet onesFor context, the ImageNet-v2 creators
matched their candidate pool to ImageNet with $n = 10$, and measure the
resulting model accuracies.
Our statistical model predicts that more annotators means less noise in the
observed selection frequencies, which in turn means less bias and higher model accuracies
in the original selection frequency used to create ImageNet-v2, and so we
should see the resulting model accuracies
increase. The data confirms this prediction: below we plot model accuracies on
ImageNet versus their adjusted accuracies on ImageNet-v2—using the slider
below the graph, you can vary the number of annotators used to make the
adjustment from zero (i.e. no matching, just raw ImageNet-v2 accuracies) to 40
(accuracies after statistic matching using all 40 annotations).</p>

<p>After using 40 workers to control for selection frequency
between ImageNet and ImageNet-v2, we reduce the 11.7% gap that was originally observed
to a gap of 5.7%. This is already a significant reduction, but the trend of the
graph suggests that 5.7% is still an overestimate—the gap continues to
consistently shrink with each increase in number annotators. In the final part
of this post, we’ll use a technique from classical statistics to get
an even better estimate of the real, bias-adjusted gap between ImageNet and
ImageNet-v2 model accuracies.</p>

<h2 id="adjusting-for-bias-with-the-statistical-jackknife">Adjusting for Bias with the Statistical Jackknife</h2>

<p>The statistic matching that led to the previous graph was based on what we’ll call a
<em>selection frequency-adjusted accuracy</em> estimator, defined for a given
classifier $f$ as:</p>

<p>\[
    \text{Acc}(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n 
    E_{x\sim \text{ImageNet-v2}}\left(1[\text{$f$ is correct on }x] | \widehat{s}(x) = \frac{k}{n}\right)\cdot 
    P_{x\sim \text{ImageNet}}\left(\widehat{s}(x) = \frac{k}{n}\right)
\]</p>

<p>This estimator has a simple interpretation: it is equivalent to
(a) sampling an ImageNet-v1 image and observing its (empirical) selection frequency;
then (b) finding a random ImageNet-v2 image with the same (empirical) selection
frequency, and recording the classifier’s correctness on that input. So what we are
estimating here is what a model’s accuracy on ImageNet-v2 would be, if the
selection frequencies of ImageNet-v2 were distributed as in the ImageNet test
set. (Notice that if the ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 selection frequency
distributions already matched, then this estimator would be independent from $n$
and would evaluate to exactly model accuracy on ImageNet-v2.)</p>

<p>Now, the $\text{Acc}(n)$ estimator is subject to the same bias as dataset
replication itself, as it too ignores the discrepancy between the empirical
selection frequency $\widehat{s}(x)$ and the true selection frequency $s(x)$.
Since we’ve been talking about bias pretty abstractly in this post, it’s worth
noting that the $\text{Acc}(n)$ estimator ties everything back to the formal,
statistical definition of bias. Specifically, our main finding can be restated
(though maybe less intuitively) as “$\text{Acc}(n)$ is a downwards-biased
estimator of the true reweighted accuracy,” that is</p>

<p>\[
    E[\text{Acc}(n)] &lt; \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \text{Acc}(n). 
\]</p>

<p>So, from this perspective, our graph in the previous section can be viewed as just a plot of the value of $\text{Acc}(n)$ for every
classifier for various values of $n$. Also, the estimator behaves exactly how as predicted by
our model of the bias—as $n$ increases, $\widehat{s}(x)$ becomes a less
noisy estimator of $s(x)$, so the bias in the matching process decreases and
so $\text{Acc}(n)$ increases.</p>

<p>Now, what we really want to know is what $\text{Acc}(n)$ looks like as $n
\rightarrow \infty$, especially given that even when we use 40 annotators for
statistic matching the adjusted accuracy still improves.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">our paper</a> we present further techniques for tackling this problem.
These include making use of tools from empirical Bayes estimation techniques,
beta-binomial regression, and kernel density estimation. To keep things short
here, we’ll only discuss the simplest estimation method we use: one based on a
technique known as the statistical jackknife.</p>

<p>The jackknife dates back to the work of <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1015.9344&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Maurice Quenouille</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177706647">John

bias that is analytic in $1/n$, are needed. statistical estimator. In
short, the jackknife estimate of an $n$-sample estimator
$\Theta_n(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ is given by</p>

<p>\[

    \widehat{\theta}_{n-1}^{(i)} - \widehat{\theta}_n 
    \right),

<article class="small">
A brief summary: consider our $n$-sample estimator $\Theta_n$, and define
$\Theta$ to be the true value of the estimator, i.e. $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
\Theta_n$. In our case, $\Theta$ would be the adjusted accuracy of ImageNet-v2
if we had infinite workers. Now, suppose that the bias in $\Theta_n$ is on
the order of $1/n$, i.e.

\[
    E[\Theta_n] = \Theta + \frac{b(\Theta)}{n}
\]

Now, for a given n-sample estimate $\widehat{\Theta}_n$, we define a
<em>leave-one-our</em> estimator $\widehat{\Theta}_n^{(-i)}$ to be $\widehat{\Theta}_n$ 
computed with all but the $i$th datapoint. There are $n$ possible such leave-one-out 
estimators for a given $\widehat{\Theta}_n$. The main idea behind the jackknife
is to make the following two approximations:

\[
    \widehat{\Theta}_n \approx E[\Theta_n] = \Theta + \frac{b(\Theta)}{n}
\]
\[
    \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1} \widehat{\Theta}_n^{(-i)} \approx E[\Theta_{n-1}] = \Theta + \frac{b(\Theta)}{n-1}
\]

Using these two assumptions, one can solve for $b(\Theta)$ and end up with the
bias estimate given in the post.

</section>

<p>Averaging across all of the classifiers studied, the jackknife estimates the
bias in our estimator as about 1.0%, meaning that the bias-corrected gap
between ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 shrinks from 11.7% (without any correction) to
5.7% (using the 40 annotators we have to correct), to 4.7% (using this additional
jackknife bias correction). Moreover, as our paper discusses, this is almost
certainly still an overestimate—using more refined methods for bias estimation
reduces the gap to somewhere between 3.4% and 3.8% (with variation being across
different methods).</p>

<h2 id="summary-and-conclusions">Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<p>We find that noise—even if it is mean-zero—can result in bias in dataset reproductions if not
accounted for. Zooming in on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImageNet-v2</code> replication effort, we use
statistical modeling to find that majority of the observed accuracy drop can be
explained by differences in selection frequency distribution between the
original dataset and its replication. Our results suggest that statistic modeling
of the data collection process can be an important tool in data replication efforts.

deletion breaks a given (multi)graph into $k$ connected components. Algorithms
of Karger &amp; Stein and Thorup showed how to find such a minimum $k$-cut in time
approximately $O(n^{2k})$. The best lower bounds come from conjectures about
the solvability of the $k$-clique problem and a reduction from $k$-clique to
$k$-cut, and show that solving $k$-cut is likely to require time $\Omega(n^k)$.
Recent results of Gupta, Lee &amp; Li have given special-purpose algorithms that
solve the problem in time $n^{1.98k + O(1)}$, and ones that have better
performance for special classes of graphs (e.g., for small integer weights). In
this work, we resolve the problem for general graphs, by showing that for any
fixed $k \geq 2$, the Karger-Stein algorithm outputs any fixed $k$-cut of
weight $\alpha \lambda_k$ with probability at least $O_k(n^{-\alpha k})$, where
$\lambda_k$ denotes the minimum $k$-cut size. This also gives an extremal bound
of $O_k(n^k)$ on the number of minimum $k$-cuts in an $n$-vertex graph and an
algorithm to compute a minimum $k$-cut in similar runtime. Both are tight up to
lower-order factors, with the algorithmic lower bound assuming hardness of
max-weight $k$-clique. The first main ingredient in our result is a
fine-grained analysis of how the graph shrinks---and how the average degree
evolves---under the Karger-Stein process. The second ingredient is an extremal
result bounding the number of cuts of size less than $2 \lambda_k/k$, using the
Sunflower lemma.

evolving graphs. We formally define the arrival-departure model with stochastic
departures. There, a graph is sampled from a specific probability distribution
and it is revealed as a series of snapshots. Our goal is to study algorithms
that create a large matching in the sampled graphs. We define the price of
stochasticity for this problem which intuitively captures the loss of any
algorithm in the worst case in the size of the matching due to the uncertainty
of the model. Furthermore, we prove the existence of a deterministic optimal
algorithm for the problem. In our second set of results we show that we can
efficiently approximate the expected size of a maximum cardinality matching by
deriving a fully randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for it. The FPRAS is
the backbone of a probabilistic algorithm that is optimal when the model is
defined over two timesteps. Our last result is an upper bound of $\frac{2}{3}$
on the price of stochasticity. This means that there is no algorithm that can
match more than $\frac{2}{3}$ of the edges of an optimal matching in hindsight.

more efficient in practice. A new variant of Huffman encoding has been proposed
recently, that provably always performs better than static Huffman coding by at
least $m-1$ bits, where $m$ denotes the size of the alphabet, and has a better
worst case than the standard dynamic Huffman coding. This paper introduces a
new generic coding method, extending the known static and dynamic variants and
including them as special cases. In fact, the generalization is applicable to
all statistical methods, including arithmetic coding. This leads then to the
formalization of a new adaptive coding method, which is provably always at
least as good as the best dynamic variant known to date. Moreover, we present
empirical results that show improvements over static and dynamic Huffman and
arithmetic coding achieved by the proposed method, even when the encoded file
includes the model description.

agents of the smaller side can be matched. However, this need not be true when
preference lists are incomplete. In most real-life situations, where agents
participate in the matching market voluntarily and submit their preferences, it
is natural to assume that each agent wants to be matched to someone in his/her
preference list as opposed to being unmatched. In light of the Rural Hospital
Theorem, we have to relax the "no blocking pair" condition for stable matchings
in order to match more agents. In this paper, we study the question of matching
more agents with fewest possible blocking edges. In particular, we find a
matching whose size exceeds that of stable matching in the graph by at least t
and has at most k blocking edges. We study this question in the realm of
parameterized complexity with respect to several natural parameters, k,t,d,
where d is the maximum length of a preference list. Unfortunately, the problem
remains intractable even for the combined parameter k+t+d. Thus, we extend our
study to the local search variant of this problem, in which we search for a
matching that not only fulfills each of the above conditions but is "closest",
in terms of its symmetric difference to the given stable matching, and obtain
an FPT algorithm.

the algorithm takes as input a range of values and outputs a single solution
that performs well for the entire range. Specifically, a robust algorithm aims
to minimize regret, defined as the maximum difference between the solution's
cost and that of an optimal solution in hindsight once the input has been
realized. For graph problems in P, such as shortest path and minimum spanning
tree, robust polynomial-time algorithms that obtain a constant approximation on
regret are known. In this paper, we study robust algorithms for minimizing
regret in NP-hard graph optimization problems, and give constant approximations
on regret for the classical traveling salesman and Steiner tree problems.

    <title>Reducibility and Statistical-Computational Gaps from Secret Leakage</title>

ubiquitous throughout modern statistics, computer science and statistical
physics. While there has been success evidencing these gaps from the failure of
restricted classes of algorithms, progress towards a more traditional
reduction-based approach to computational complexity in statistical inference
has been limited. Existing reductions have largely been limited to inference
problems with similar structure -- primarily mapping among problems
representable as a sparse submatrix signal plus a noise matrix, which are
similar to the common hardness assumption of planted clique.
</p>
<p>The insight in this work is that a slight generalization of the planted
clique conjecture -- secret leakage planted clique -- gives rise to a variety
of new average-case reduction techniques, yielding a web of reductions among
problems with very different structure. Using variants of the planted clique
conjecture for specific forms of secret leakage planted clique, we deduce tight
statistical-computational tradeoffs for a diverse range of problems including
robust sparse mean estimation, mixtures of sparse linear regressions, robust
sparse linear regression, tensor PCA, variants of dense $k$-block stochastic
block models, negatively correlated sparse PCA, semirandom planted dense
subgraph, detection in hidden partition models and a universality principle for
learning sparse mixtures. In particular, a $k$-partite hypergraph variant of
the planted clique conjecture is sufficient to establish all of our
computational lower bounds. Our techniques also reveal novel connections to
combinatorial designs and to random matrix theory. This work gives the first
evidence that an expanded set of hardness assumptions, such as for secret
leakage planted clique, may be a key first step towards a more complete theory
of reductions among statistical problems.

presents a linear time recursive algorithm for computing the eternal vertex
cover number of cactus graphs. Unlike other graph classes for which polynomial
time algorithms for eternal vertex cover number are based on efficient
computability of a known lower bound directly derived from minimum vertex
cover, we show that it is a certain substructure property that helps the

the so-called rumor, in a network. Starting with a single informed node, each
node is associated with an exponential time clock with rate $1$ and calls a
random neighbor in order to possibly exchange the rumor. Spread time is the
first time when all nodes of a network are informed with high probability. We
consider spread time of the algorithm in any dynamic evolving network,
$\mathcal{G}=\{G^{(t)}\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$, which is a sequence of graphs exposed
at discrete time step $t=0,1\ldots$. We observe that besides the expansion
profile of a dynamic network, the degree distribution of nodes over time effect
the spread time. We establish upper bounds for the spread time in terms of
graph conductance and diligence. For a given connected simple graph $G=(V,E)$,
the diligence of cut set $E(S, \overline{S})$ is defined as
$\rho(S)=\min_{\{u,v\}\in E(S,\overline{S})}\max\{\bar{d}/d_u, \bar{d}/d_v\}$
where $d_u$ is the degree of $u$ and $\bar{d}$ is the average degree of nodes
in the one side of the cut with smaller volume (i.e.,
${\mathtt{vol}}{(S)}=\sum_{u\in S}d_u$). The diligence of $G$ is also defined
as $\rho(G)=\min_{ \emptyset\neq S\subset V}\rho(S)$. We show that the spread
time of the algorithm in $\mathcal{G}$ is bounded by $T$, where $T$ is the
first time that $\sum_{t=0}^T\Phi(G^{(t)})\cdot\rho(G^{(t)})$ exceeds $C\log
n$, where $\Phi(G^{(t)})$ denotes the conductance of $G^{(t)}$ and $C$ is a
specified constant. We also define the absolute diligence as
$\overline{\rho}(G)=\min_{\{u,v\}\in E}\max\{1/d_u,1/d_v\}$ and establish upper
bound $T$ for the spread time in terms of absolute diligence, which is the
first time when $\sum_{t=0}^T\lceil\Phi(G^{(t)})\rceil\cdot
\overline{\rho}(G^{(t)})\ge 2n$. We present dynamic networks where the given
upper bounds are almost tight.

    <title>TR20-076 |  The Round Complexity of Perfect MPC with Active Security and Optimal Resiliency | 

	Benny Applebaum, 

	Eliran Kachlon, 

	Arpita Patra</title>
    <summary>In STOC 1988, Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson (BGW) established an important milestone in the fields of cryptography and distributed computing by showing that every functionality can be computed with perfect (information-theoretic and error-free) security at the presence of an active (aka Byzantine) rushing adversary that controls up to $n/3$ of the parties.

We study the round complexity of general secure multiparty computation in the BGW model. Our main result shows that every functionality can be realized in only four rounds of interaction, and that some functionalities cannot be computed in three rounds. This completely settles the round-complexity of perfect actively-secure optimally-resilient MPC, resolving a long line of research.

Our lower-bound is based on a novel round-reduction technique that allows us to lift existing three-round  lower-bounds for verifiable secret sharing to four-round lower-bounds for general MPC. To prove the upper-bound, we develop new round-efficient protocols for computing degree-2 functionalities over large fields, and establish the completeness of such functionalities. The latter result extends the recent completeness theorem of Applebaum, Brakerski and Tsabary (TCC 2018, Eurocrypt 2019) that was limited to the binary field.</summary>

X, who shall go nameless here, recently won a prize for research. </p>
<p>
Today we congratulate X and wish to talk a bit about their work while safeguarding X’s identity.</p>
<p>
X also won another prize Z—but we will not mention which one. In both cases the honor is about the creation of a new field rather than the solution of a long-standing open problem. Her—OK, X is a she—brilliant work has allowed many others to write papers in these areas. And it has led to countless conferences, meetings, and talks. </p>
<p>
Oops, we used the word “brilliant.” That has already leaked her identity, given where you are reading this. Just type it into our search box.</p>
<p>
We assume you get the point. One can leak information about people without mentioning them directly. </p>

Cynthia Dwork is the <a href="http://www.sigact.org/prizes/knuth/citation2020.pdf">winner</a> of the 2020 Donald E. Knuth Prize. The prize is awarded jointly by ACM SIGACT and the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee. The ceremony will include a lecture by Cynthia at <a href="https://focs2020.cs.duke.edu/">FOCS 2020</a>, which is still projected to meet in-person at Duke next November 16–19.</p>
<p>
Today we congratulate Cynthia and talk a little about her work.</p>
<p>
I, Dick, have known her for many years. I am excited to see that she has won the Knuth prize. </p>
<p>
She has always been a top researcher and a terrific speaker. I fondly recall some of her earlier talks at Princeton and elsewhere. There is something about her ability to explain complex ideas in a lucid manner. I have often thought that this ability must be one of the reasons she has been so successful in her research. </p>
<p>
We will talk a little about <em>differential privacy</em> (DP) and then her other joint work which led to another prize. We should be quick to <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/02/06/cynthia-dwork-and-a-brilliant-idea/">mention</a> that <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/02/07/still-a-brilliant-idea/">others</a> have been instrumental in both developments.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Quantifying an Idea </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
DP might have been appreciated long before there were large databases and computer systems. The genius is not just the simplicity of the idea but the development of mathematical tools to govern its application.</p>
<p>
For a simple example, suppose a professor has a general policy of posting exam average scores in her class of 100. Suppose she posts that the average is 73.3 after 98 students have taken the exam but two need to make it up a week later. Then suppose she re-posts the average after they take it and it is 72.5. The difference may not seem like much. But the class learns two things: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Both students had their makeup scores included in the average. (If the 73.3 is exact then it is not even possible to get a rounded 72.5 with just one score of zero, pending the other.) <p/>
</li><li>
The two students collectively bombed the exam. (Just possibly one got a zero while the other did OK, but even then the other’s score was below average.)
</li></ul>
<p>
Your first thought might be that the fault is in the excessive precision in the grade reporting. If she had rounded to the nearest integer then both averages would have been reported as “73” and there would be no problem. But rounding is accidental. The new average could have been 72.49, which would be rounded down to “72,” when the set of possible interpretations is worse than before. </p>
<p>
In wide-scale situations where queries for multiple averages at different times are allowed, effects of rounding may cancel so that a large statistical analysis can subtract them out. Thus passively reducing precision is not enough. The key is to affect the precision actively by adding a random <img alt="{\pm \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm \epsilon}"/> to the reported results, where <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/> is judiciously chosen. The point is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Adding <img alt="{\pm \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm \epsilon}"/>, better than rounding, makes inference much harder. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the exam-score example, randomly adding or subtracting a number between 0 and 2 changes the calculus so that seeing “73.3” and then “72.5” does not allow a high-confidence inference about the makeup students’ scores. One could reason that the first number could easily have been 72.3 and the second 73.5, in line with interpretations where the makeup students upped the average. Actually, a jump from 72.3 to 73.5 in the <em>true</em> averages is impossible from just two new scores, so the class could deduce that the reported averages are fudged. But that is OK. Two basic purposes of reporting the averages are met despite the fudging: </p>
<ul>
<li>
to show the exam was consistent with past years—especially good to know this year; <p/>
</li><li>
to give you some idea (knowing your own score exactly) where you stand relative to the class.
</li></ul>
<p>
In related situations, one could argue that a mean of <img alt="{\pm 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 1}"/> for <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/> is not enough. If the exam has 100 one-point questions each with a 73.3% expectation of getting it right for everyone, then the standard deviation about the mean is almost <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/>. Using a mean change of <img alt="{\pm 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 2}"/> seems also fine in this case, whereas rounding to the nearest 05 (i.e., reporting “70” or “75” as the average) might be too coarse.</p>
<p>
We do not intend our example to be definitive, only that it conveys relevant issues. The example is enough to convey that DP leads into deep matters in statistics and <em>what can be inferred by statistical methods</em>. The latter melds the complexity-theoretic notion of knowledge gain from interactive protocols with statistical (machine) learning. And as with quantum computing, theorems and methods from the subfield have come back to inform fundamental questions about complexity (of course, this is true of crypto in general).</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Privacy and Online Chess </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I, Ken, am the lead on this post, and have had data-privacy affect me personally. The pandemic has forced the cancellation of all over-the-board (OTB) tournaments, some as far ahead as August. Chess has all moved online, as heralded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/sports/coronavirus-chess-online-tournament.html">two</a> recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/sports/chess-cheating-south-dakota-races.html">articles</a> in the New York Times and one in the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/forget-sourdough-everyone-is-playing-chess-now-11588845643">proclaiming</a>, “Sports: Chess Is the New King of the Pandemic.” </p>
<p>
As these articles also note, cheating has long been a major concern for online chess. I have been a recourse for second-opinions in online cheating cases but have not tried to be <em>primary</em> in this domain. A great conversation in November 2006 with Daniel Sleator (who—besides being famous for splay trees and amortized analysis—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Chess_Club#History">co-founded</a> the Internet Chess Club) told me how online cheating detection avails much information about the manner of play that is not applicable or reliably available in OTB chess. Also for academic reasons, I chose a minimal approach of using no information besides the moves of the games and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo ratings</a> of the players. An unexpected advantage of that choice is exemplified by an e-mail I received—fifteen minutes before a conference call on Wednesday with representatives of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) and other online platforms—from a different chess organizer requesting a statement that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …you will only use the data of the games, and not any personal data that might be obtained from the [tournaments] for your research, such as player name etc. … in writing as a standard precaution … to make sure that there isn’t third party usage of the data or usage outside of its intent. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Some recent legal decisions have confirmed that the moves of the games are public data and cannot be copyrighted. The e-mail did not mention the players’ ratings. As used by FIDE and the US and most online platforms (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-calculate-nba-elo-ratings/">and</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings">much</a> <a href="https://dotesports.com/general/news/elo-ratings-explained-20565">more</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-nfl-predictions-work/">widely</a>), those are 4-digit numbers, and they are public. Knowing all four digits might be enough to pinpoint the identity of a player. </p>
<p>
Thus I suggested rounding the rating to the nearest 10 or even 20. This makes little difference to my statistical cheating tests, which already give 25 Elo points benefit-of-doubt for uncertainty about the rating. Tournament officials I’ve served have done this in a couple of individual cases but now the need is <em>en masse</em>. </p>
<p>
The question based on the previous section above is whether I should instead (or also) suggest that they implement full DP by adding <img alt="{\pm \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm \epsilon}"/> with a mean of <img alt="{\pm 10}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 10}"/> or <img alt="{\pm 20}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+20%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 20}"/> or so, with-or-without rounding. A caveat is that it is easy for someone with a tournament spreadsheet to round a column of figures before exporting text to me, but applying a random function is less familiar and prone to major mess-ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Other Prize </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The Knuth Prize is not Cynthia’s only win for 2020. In December she was awarded the 2020 IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal. A <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/honors-2020-cynthia-dwork-wins-the-ieee-richard-w-hamming-medal">video</a> gives a one-minute summary of differential privacy and her work on <em>non-malleable</em> cryptosystems via lattice bases. The latter stems from her 2000 <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dolev/pubs/nmc.pdf">paper</a> with Danny Dolev and Moni Naor (DDN).</p>
<p>
We have not covered this crypto topic before. It involves chosen-ciphertext attacks where Eve, the evesdropper, first gets hold of a transmitted ciphertext <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>. The cryptosystem is <em>malleable</em> if Eve can know enough about the structure of <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> to make a legal ciphertext <img alt="{y'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y'}"/>, one that may decode to a plaintext <img alt="{x'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x'}"/> that advances her interests compared to the intended <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability_(cryptography)">article</a> gives an example where <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> embeds a numerical field <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> that Eve can recognize and alter en-route. The paper gives a similar example where Eve cannot disrupt the transmission of <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> but can separately send her own <img alt="{y'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y'}"/> with a value <img alt="{r'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r'}"/> that gives her advantage. This may be so even without being able to decode or gain any information about the plain value of <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>, except that <img alt="{r'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r'}"/> is different in a meaningful way. For instance, <img alt="{r'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r'}"/> could be a lower bid on a contract or higher bid in a secure auction.</p>
<p>
One would think that <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> should just be encoded via an error-correcting code whose range is secure so that an attacker would be overwhelmingly unlikely to find another value <img alt="{r'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r'}"/> in the legal range of the code. However, this clashes with the goal of <em>homomorphic encryption</em> which allows numerical operations on encoded values. Or the technology used may be too simple, as in the paper’s mention of submitting bids to a fax number. </p>
<p>
Note: both fax machines and the paper date to the previous millennium. But the paper next gives an example that is staying with us in this millennium, where <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> is a proof of <img alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}"/>. Suppose Alice arranges to transmit <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> to a referee Ralph using a zero-knowledge protocol, but Eve is able to intercept their messages. Eve can impersonate Ralph to Alice and impersonate Alice to Ralph as Ralph asks questions in the protocol. It may seem impossible to forestall such a “man-in-the-middle” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">attack</a> without extrinsic considerations of hardware and timing, but DDN design an ingenious scheme for <em>non-malleable zero-knowledge proofs</em>. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Video </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
<em>En-passant</em> of this, we want to note a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wl-3kadvgw">video</a> that was made for next month’s Women in Theory <a href="https://womenintheory.wordpress.com/">workshop</a>. It has an all-female cast and lyrics by Avi Wigderson parodying the song “I Will Survive.” Cynthia is not in the video, but she likewise has been a great spokesperson for the experiences of women in our professional life.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our congratulations again to Cynthia—by name—on the Knuth and Hamming prizes.</p>

But even if you discount Quasi-abelian categories, Quasi-Hopf algebras, and Quasi-Newton methods (named after Quasi-Abel, Quasi-Hopf, and Quasi-Newton) there’s also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qvist%27s_theorem">Qvist’s theorem</a> in finite geometry, from Bertil Qvist.</p>

What he wants to know is, for which pairs  can we algorithmically find integer solutions to degree- -variable polynomial equations, and for which pairs is it undecidable? The answer seems to be: we can solve them when , we can’t solve them for some pairs of larger numbers, and there’s a big gap of unknown pairs.</p>

    <p><a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/46746/95">On the complexity of a “list” datastructure in the RAM model</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104142162759402806"/>). Linked lists can insert and delete at arbitrary positions. Arrays can find the value at position . Binary trees can do both, but with log time per operation. Combining methods for maintaining order in a list and integer ranking/unranking instead gives . This showed up just in time for me to add some of the ideas to the syllabus for my ongoing online graduate data structures class.</p>

    <p>Some reading on “git pull –rebase”: <a href="https://medium.com/@DGabeau/git-pull-rebase-vs-git-pull-c2b352fe53aa">Gabeau/medium</a>, <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/7aymfa/please-oh-please-use-git-pull-rebase">Hasiński/coderwall</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2472254/when-should-i-use-git-pull-rebase">Shved &amp; Mortensen/stackoverflow</a> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104145964667479373"/>).</span> I have been using this in situations with multiple authors simultaneously working on a paper, to keep my contributions to the edit history linear (avoiding edit conflicts and merge bubbles in the history). It’s been working well for me but I realize it might be controversial…</p>

    <p>My campus computing support people have decided that the middle of a very work-intensive term is the time to make me choose between stopping making illustrations or giving up access to the scientific literature (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104174466523993151"/>). The connection is the VPN I use to access campus journal and database subscriptions. They want to upgrade to a version incompatible with OS X 10.12. Upgrading OS X would be incompatible with my purchased Adobe software and make me pay money I don’t have for a subscription instead.</p>
