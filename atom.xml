logspace Turing machines, which provide a unifying framework for efficient
query evaluation in areas like information extraction and graph databases,
among others. We investigate the complexity of three fundamental algorithmic
problems for these classes: enumeration, counting and uniform generation of
solutions, and show that they have several desirable properties in this
respect.
</p>
<p>Both complexity classes are defined in terms of non-deterministic logspace
transducers (NL transducers). For the first class, we consider the case of
unambiguous NL transducers, and we prove constant delay enumeration, and both
counting and uniform generation of solutions in polynomial time. For the second
class, we consider unrestricted NL transducers, and we obtain polynomial delay
enumeration, approximate counting in polynomial time, and polynomial-time
randomized algorithms for uniform generation. More specifically, we show that
each problem in this second class admits a fully polynomial-time randomized
approximation scheme (FPRAS) and a polynomial-time Las Vegas algorithm for
uniform generation. Interestingly, the key idea to prove these results is to
show that the fundamental problem $\text{#NFA}$ admits an FPRAS, where
$\text{#NFA}$ is the problem of counting the number of strings of length $n$
(given in unary) accepted by a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA). While
this problem is known to be $\text{#P}$-complete and, more precisely,
$\text{SpanL}$-complete, it was open whether this problem admits an FPRAS. In
this work, we solve this open problem, and obtain as a welcome corollary that
every function in $\text{SpanL}$ admits an FPRAS.

incomparable if $u$ doesn't reach $v$ and vice versa. We denote by \emph{width}
of a DAG $G$, $w_G$, the maximum size of a set of incomparable vertices of $G$.
In this paper we present an algorithm that computes a dominance drawing of a
DAG G in $k$ dimensions, where $w_G \le k \le \frac{n}{2}$. The time required
by the algorithm is $O(kn)$, with a precomputation time of $O(km)$, needed to
compute a \emph{compressed transitive closure} of $G$, and extra $O(n^2w_G)$ or
$O(n^3)$ time, if we want $k=w_G$. Our algorithm gives a tighter bound to the
dominance dimension of a DAG. As corollaries, a new family of graphs having a
2-dimensional dominance drawing and a new upper bound to the dimension of a
partial order are obtained. We also introduce the concept of transitive module
and dimensional neck, $w_N$, of a DAG $G$ and we show how to improve the
results given previously using these concepts.

    <title>Faster FPT Algorithm for 5-Path Vertex Cover</title>

$F$ of vertices of a given graph $G=(V,E)$ such that $G \setminus F$ does not

When parameterized by the size of the solution $k$, 5-PVC has direct trivial
algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(5^kn^{\mathcal{O}(1)})$ running time and, since
$d$-PVC is a special case of $d$-Hitting Set, an algorithm running in

present an iterative compression algorithm that solves the 5-PVC problem in
$\mathcal{O}(4^kn^{\mathcal{O}(1)})$ time.

    <title>Domination above r-independence: does sparseness help?</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561334400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Carl Einarson, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Reidl:Felix.html">Felix Reidl</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09180">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Inspired by the potential of improving tractability via gap- or
above-guarantee parametrisations, we investigate the complexity of Dominating
Set when given a suitable lower-bound witness. Concretely, we consider being
provided with a maximal r-independent set X (a set in which all vertices have
pairwise distance at least r + 1) along the input graph G which, for r &gt;= 2,
lower-bounds the minimum size of any dominating set of G. In the spirit of
gap-parameters, we consider a parametrisation by the size of the 'residual' set
R := V (G) \ N [X]. Our work aims to answer two questions: How does the
constant r affect the tractability of the problem and does the restriction to
sparse graph classes help here? For the base case r = 2, we find that the
problem is paraNP -complete even in apex- and bounded-degree graphs. For r = 3,
the problem is W[2]-hard for general graphs but in FPT for nowhere dense
classes and it admits a linear kernel for bounded expansion classes. For r &gt;=
4, the parametrisation becomes essentially equivalent to the natural parameter,
the size of the dominating set.

Iyengar <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09158">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>To date, location privacy protection is a critical issue in Location-Based
Services (LBS). In this work, we propose a novel geometric framework based on
the classical discrete geometric structure, the Voronoi-Delaunay duality (VDD).
We utilize the fact that the user location cannot be recovered if only given an
irregular $n$-sided Voronoi cell around it, and the anonymity zone is the
intersection of all the parallel strips perpendicular to and bounded by $n$
Voronoi edges. The irregular Voronoi cell and its variations can be used as the
concealing space to hide the user location or the region of interest and
submitted to the LBS server. Within this framework, we propose multiple typical
anonymizing models by introducing irregularity to the convex regular VDD
structure by shifting the interior Voronoi cell, exterior Delaunay polygon,
sector rays, or their combinations. The proposed methods are efficient by
taking advantage of the VDD principle where main computations are linear
line-line intersections. Experiments with various parameters demonstrate the
efficiency and efficacy of the proposed $n$-VDD framework.

    <title>Fairness and Utilization in Allocating Resources with Uncertain Demand</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561334400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Kate Donahue, Jon Kleinberg <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09050">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Resource allocation problems are a fundamental domain in which to evaluate
the fairness properties of algorithms, and the trade-offs between fairness and
utilization have a long history in this domain. A recent line of work has
considered fairness questions for resource allocation when the demands for the
resource are distributed across multiple groups and drawn from a probability
distribution. In such cases, a natural fairness requirement is that individuals
from different groups should have (approximately) equal probabilities of
receiving the resource. A largely open question in this area has been to bound
the gap between the maximum possible utilization of the resource and the
maximum subject to this fairness condition. Here we obtain some of the first
provable upper bounds on this gap. We show lower bounds but also some general
upper bounds for arbitrary distributions, as well as much stronger upper bounds
for specific families of distributions that are typically used to model levels
of demand. In particular, we find --- somewhat surprisingly --- that there are
natural classes of distributions for which it is possible to simultaneously
achieve maximum utilization and the given notion of fairness; and we show that
for power-law distributions, there is a non-trivial gap between the solutions,
but this gap can be bounded by a constant independent of the parameters of the
distribution.

    <title>Sharp Bounds on the Runtime of the (1+1) EA via Drift Analysis and Analytic Combinatorial Tools</title>

function has recently been determined by Hwang et al. (2018) up to additive
errors of $O((\log n)/n)$. The same approach proposed there also leads to a
full asymptotic expansion with errors of the form $O(n^{-K}\log n)$ for any
$K&gt;0$. This precise result is obtained by matched asymptotics with rigorous
error analysis (or by solving asymptotically the underlying recurrences via
inductive approximation arguments), ideas radically different from
well-established techniques for the running time analysis of evolutionary
computation such as drift analysis. This paper revisits drift analysis for the
(1+1) EA on OneMax and obtains that the expected running time $E(T)$, starting
from $\lceil n/2\rceil$ one-bits, is determined by the sum of inverse drifts up
to logarithmic error terms, more precisely $$\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor
n/2\rfloor}\frac{1}{\Delta(k)} - c_1\log n \le E(T) \le \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor
n/2\rfloor}\frac{1}{\Delta(k)} - c_2\log n,$$ where $\Delta(k)$ is the drift
(expected increase of the number of one-bits from the state of $n-k$ ones) and
$c_1,c_2 &gt;0$ are explicitly computed constants. This improves the previous
asymptotic error known for the sum of inverse drifts from $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$
to a logarithmic error and gives for the first time a non-asymptotic error
bound. Using standard asymptotic techniques, the difference between $E(T)$ and
the sum of inverse drifts is found to be $(e/2)\log n+O(1)$.

of an autoencoder's latent space via a novel type of loss, operating on
information from persistent homology. Under mild conditions, this loss is
differentiable and we present a theoretical analysis of the properties induced
by the loss. We choose one-class learning as our upstream task and demonstrate
that the imposed structure enables informed parameter selection for modeling
the in-class distribution via kernel density estimators. Evaluated on computer
vision data, these one-class models exhibit competitive performance and, in a
low sample size regime, outperform other methods by a large margin. Notably,
our results indicate that a single autoencoder, trained on auxiliary

supervised learning model that analyze data for both classification and
regression, whose usual complexity scales polynomially with the dimension and
number of data points. Inspired by the quantum SVM, we present a
quantum-inspired classical algorithm for SVM using fast sampling techniques. In
our approach, we develop a general method to approximately calculate the kernel
function and make classification via carefully sampling the data matrix, thus
our approach can be applied to various types of SVM, such as linear SVM,
poly-kernel SVM and soft SVM. Theoretical analysis shows one can find the
supported hyperplanes on a data set which we have sampling access, and thus
make classification with arbitrary success probability in logarithmic runtime,
matching the runtime of the quantum SVM.

    <title>Exponential separation between shallow quantum circuits and unbounded fan-in shallow classical circuits</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Watts:Adam_Bene.html">Adam Bene Watts</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kothari:Robin.html">Robin Kothari</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Schaeffer:Luke.html">Luke Schaeffer</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Tal:Avishay.html">Avishay Tal</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08890">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Recently, Bravyi, Gosset, and K\"{o}nig (Science, 2018) exhibited a search
problem called the 2D Hidden Linear Function (2D HLF) problem that can be
solved exactly by a constant-depth quantum circuit using bounded fan-in gates
(or QNC^0 circuits), but cannot be solved by any constant-depth classical
circuit using bounded fan-in AND, OR, and NOT gates (or NC^0 circuits). In
other words, they exhibited a search problem in QNC^0 that is not in NC^0.
</p>
<p>We strengthen their result by proving that the 2D HLF problem is not
contained in AC^0, the class of classical, polynomial-size, constant-depth
circuits over the gate set of unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates, and NOT gates.
We also supplement this worst-case lower bound with an average-case result:
There exists a simple distribution under which any AC^0 circuit (even of nearly
exponential size) has exponentially small correlation with the 2D HLF problem.
Our results are shown by constructing a new problem in QNC^0, which we call the
Relaxed Parity Halving Problem, which is easier to work with. We prove our AC^0
lower bounds for this problem, and then show that it reduces to the 2D HLF
problem.
</p>
<p>As a step towards even stronger lower bounds, we present a search problem
that we call the Parity Bending Problem, which is in QNC^0/qpoly (QNC^0
circuits that are allowed to start with a quantum state of their choice that is
independent of the input), but is not even in AC^0[2] (the class AC^0 with
unbounded fan-in XOR gates).
</p>
<p>All the quantum circuits in our paper are simple, and the main difficulty
lies in proving the classical lower bounds. For this we employ a host of
techniques, including a refinement of H{\aa}stad's switching lemmas for
multi-output circuits that may be of independent interest, the
Razborov-Smolensky AC^0[2] lower bound, Vazirani's XOR lemma, and lower bounds
for non-local games.

    <title>Horizon Visibility Graphs and Time Series Merge Trees are Dual</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561334400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Stephen:Colin.html">Colin Stephen</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08825">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we introduce the horizon visibility graph, a simple extension
to the popular horizontal visibility graph representation of a time series, and
show that it possesses a rigorous mathematical foundation in computational
algebraic topology. This fills a longstanding gap in the literature on the
horizontal visibility approach to nonlinear time series analysis which, despite
a suite of successful applications across multiple domains, lacks a formal
setting in which to prove general properties and develop natural extensions.
The main finding is that horizon visibility graphs are dual to merge trees
arising naturally over a filtered complex associated to a time series, while
horizontal visibility graphs are weak duals of these trees. Immediate
consequences include availability of tree-based reconstruction theorems,
connections to results on the statistics of self-similar trees, and relations
between visibility graphs and the emerging field of applied persistent
homology.

<p>
Lucy Lu Wang is the lead author of a paper released this Friday on gender parity in computer science. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07883.pdf">paper</a> is from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The authors are Wang, Gabriel Stanovsky, Luca Weihs, and Oren Etzioni.  We will call them WSWE for short. </p>
<p>
Today we will discuss some of the issues this study raises.</p>
<p>
The paper was highlighted by the New York Times in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/technology/gender-gap-tech-computer-science.html">article</a> titled, “The Gender Gap in Computer Science Research Won’t Close for 100 Years.”  The news article begins with an equally sobering statement of this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em>Women will not reach parity with men in writing published computer science research in this century if current trends hold, according to a study released on Friday. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We are for gender-neutral opportunities and have always promoted this—see our earlier discussions <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/its-ada-lovelace-day/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/absolute-firsts/">here</a>. We are for doing a better job in supporting women in computer science. The study by WSWE is an important paper that helps frame the problem. Quoting them:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The field has made more of an effort to reach a more balanced gender status. But the data seems to show that even with all the progress, we are still not making the change fast enough. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I suggest that you might wish to read the paper. Unfortunately there are many papers with similar conclusions—see <a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1301">this</a> by Natalie Schluter, for example. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Main Points </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are some points of the paper by WSWE:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>There is a measurable gap</i>. No one would, I believe, doubt this. But it is important to see that it is measurable. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>The gap is shrinking, but slowly</i>. Again this seems correct, but whether it is shrinking in all relevant measures of publication weight is still an issue.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>The predictions</i>. Perhaps it will not be closed for over a century. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Modern technology allows such a study</i>. This is one aspect that we can all applaud. WSWE used automated tools that allowed this study to search millions of papers.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Issues </h2><p/>
<p>
WSWE filtered a corpus of <b>2.87 million</b> papers tagged as in computer science.  The volume constrained their approaches to handling several basic issues.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> How to tell the gender of an author?  They use first names and try to detect gender from that alone. This is not easy.  Not only can differently-gendered names in different nations or language groups have the same Romanized form, many names apply to both genders within those groups.  The names Taylor and Kelley are perfect examples pf the latter. </p>
<p>
WSWE used a statistical weighing method. So “Taylor,” for example, would be weighted as 55 percent female, 45 percent male.  The weightings come from a large database called <i>Gender API</i> compiled from government and social agencies not directly related to computer science. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> Another issue concerns the prediction part of their paper. They attempt to extrapolate and guess when there will be parity between female and male authorship. </p>
<p>
As all predictions this is not easy. It is my main complaint with this and other papers on the gender-gap issue. They predict that parity will not be reached until 2167, in 168 years. An earlier <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/640548/gender-parity-computer-science-could-take-280-years/">study</a> puts the parity point at 280 years away.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I believe that a major issue is hiring by computer science departments and other institutions. A major CS department just hired <img alt="{N&gt;1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N&gt;1}"/> assistant professors, of which <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> were male. This is a problem. </p>
<p>
Should studies on the gender gap count all papers? Perhaps they should weight the papers by some citation indices. Are women writing more impactful papers? What percent of papers by gender have citations rate above X?—you get the idea. </p>
<p>
Finally I wonder if parity is the right goal? <b>How about aiming for more women papers than men</b>? Why not?</p>

To celebrate summer, I’ve compiled lecture notes from the graduate course COS 598D, a.k.a. “<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/optimization4machinelearning/home">optimization for machine learning</a>“.</p>
<p>The course is an aftermath of a few lectures and summer school tutorials given in various locations, in which  lectures goal of the course was to present the most useful methods and ideas in a rigorous-but-not-tedious way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for a mathematically-prepared undergraduate student, and/or researcher beginning their endeavor into machine learning.</li>
<li>Focus on the important: we start with stochastic gradient descent for training deep neural networks.</li>
<li>Bring out the main ideas: i.e. projection-free methods, second-order optimization, the three main acceleration techniques, qualitatively discuss the advantages and applicability of each.</li>
<li>*short* proofs, that everyone can follow and extend in their future research. I prefer being off by a constant/log factor from the best known bound with a more insightful proof.</li>
<li>Not loose track of the goal: generalization/regret, rather than final accuracy. This means we talked about online learning, generalization and precision issues in ML.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most recent version can be downloaded here:<br/>

<p>This is still work in progress, please feel free to send me typos/corrections, as well as other topics you’d like to see (on my todos already: lower bounds, quasi-convexity, and the homotopy method).</p>
<p>Note: zero-order/bandit optimization is an obvious topic that’s not address. The reason is purely subjective – it appears as a chapter in <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">this textbook</a> (that also started as lecture notes!).</p>

    <title>TR19-089 |  Exponential separation between shallow quantum circuits and unbounded fan-in shallow classical circuits |

    <summary>Recently, Bravyi, Gosset, and König (Science, 2018) exhibited a search problem called the 2D Hidden Linear Function (2D HLF) problem that can be solved exactly by a constant-depth quantum circuit using bounded fan-in gates (or QNC^0 circuits), but cannot be solved by any constant-depth classical circuit using bounded fan-in AND, OR, and NOT gates (or NC^0 circuits). In other words, they exhibited a search problem in QNC^0 that is not in NC^0.

We strengthen their result by proving that the 2D HLF problem is not contained in AC^0, the class of classical, polynomial-size, constant-depth circuits over the gate set of unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates, and NOT gates. We also supplement this worst-case lower bound with an average-case result: There exists a simple distribution under which any AC^0 circuit (even of nearly exponential size) has exponentially small correlation with the 2D HLF problem. Our results are shown by constructing a new problem in QNC^0, which we call the Relaxed Parity Halving Problem, which is easier to work with. We prove our AC^0 lower bounds for this problem, and then show that it reduces to the 2D HLF problem.

As a step towards even stronger lower bounds, we present a search problem that we call the Parity Bending Problem, which is in QNC^0/qpoly (QNC^0 circuits that are allowed to start with a quantum state of their choice that is independent of the input), but is not even in AC^0[2] (the class AC^0 with unbounded fan-in XOR gates).

All the quantum circuits in our paper are simple, and the main difficulty lies in proving the classical lower bounds. For this we employ a host of techniques, including a refinement of H{\aa}stad's switching lemmas for multi-output circuits that may be of independent interest, the Razborov-Smolensky AC^0[2] lower bound, Vazirani's XOR lemma, and lower bounds for non-local games.</summary>

information bandit problem, where we have $K$ arms $[K] = \{1, 2, \ldots, K\}$,
and playing arm $i$ would gain reward from an unknown distribution for arm $i$
while obtaining reward feedback for all arms $j \ge i$. One-sided full
information bandit can model the online repeated second-price auctions, where
the auctioneer could select the reserved price in each round and the bidders
only reveal their bids when their bids are higher than the reserved price. In
this paper, we present an elimination-based algorithm to solve the problem. Our
elimination based algorithm achieves distribution independent regret upper
bound $O(\sqrt{T\cdot\log (TK)})$, and distribution dependent bound $O((\log T
+ \log K)f(\Delta))$, where $T$ is the time horizon, $\Delta$ is a vector of
gaps between the mean reward of arms and the mean reward of the best arm, and
$f(\Delta)$ is a formula depending on the gap vector that we will specify in
detail. Our algorithm has the best theoretical regret upper bound so far. We
also validate our algorithm empirically against other possible alternatives.

    <title>Coresets for Clustering with Fairness Constraints</title>

Vishnoi</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08484">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In a recent work, Chierichetti et al. studied the following "fair" variants
of classical clustering problems such as $k$-means and $k$-median: given a set
of $n$ data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a binary type associated to each data
point, the goal is to cluster the points while ensuring that the proportion of
each type in each cluster is roughly the same as its underlying proportion.
Subsequent work has focused on either extending this setting to when each data
point has multiple, non-disjoint sensitive types such as race and gender, or to
address the problem that the clustering algorithms in the above work do not
scale well. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to clustering
with fairness constraints that involve multiple, non-disjoint types, that is
{\em also scalable}. Our approach is based on novel constructions of coresets:
for the $k$-median objective, we construct an $\varepsilon$-coreset of size
$O(\Gamma k^2 \varepsilon^{-d})$ where $\Gamma$ is the number of distinct
collections of groups that a point may belong to, and for the $k$-means
objective, we show how to construct an $\varepsilon$-coreset of size $O(\Gamma
k^3\varepsilon^{-d-1})$. The former result is the first known coreset
construction for the fair clustering problem with the $k$-median objective, and
the latter result removes the dependence on the size of the full dataset as in
Schmidt et al. and generalizes it to multiple, non-disjoint types. Plugging our
coresets into existing algorithms for fair clustering such as Backurs et al.
results in the fastest algorithms for several cases. Empirically, we assess our
approach over the Adult and Bank dataset, and show that the coreset sizes are
much smaller than the full dataset; applying coresets indeed accelerates the
running time of computing the fair clustering objective while ensuring that the
resulting objective difference is small.

    <title>Push-pull direct CAD modeling with movable neighboring faces for preserving G^1 connections</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561248000</feedworld_mtime>

recent direct modeling CAD paradigm, which features intuitive push-pull
manipulation of the model geometry. Boundary faces in a B-rep model could be
connected in a smooth manner, typically G1 continuous, for functional,
manufacturing or aesthetic reasons. Quite often, it is desirable to preserve
such smooth connections during push-pull moves. This is, however, no trivial
matter and introduces additional challenges. To preserve the G1 connections,
neighboring faces of push-pulled faces need to be made movable, but their
motions are not known explicitly. Consequently, it becomes challenging to track
the geometry-topology inconsistency caused by these movable faces and to attain
a robust update for push-pulled solid models. No effective ways exist in the
literature to deal with the challenges; the industrial state of the art has
implemented this function, but the challenges are not addressed satisfactorily
and robustness issues are observed. This paper proposes a novel reverse
tracking method to solve the above challenges, and then, based on it, presents
a systematic method for push-pull direct modeling while preserving G1
connections. The developed method has been validated with a series of case
studies.

modeling flexibility. It, however, lacks the parametric capability, which is
indispensable to modern CAD systems. For direct modeling to have this
capability, an additional associativity information layer in the form of
geometric constraint systems needs to be incorporated into direct modeling.
This is no trivial matter due to the possible inconsistencies between the
associativity information and geometry information in a model after direct
edits. The major issue of resolving such inconsistencies is that there often
exist many resolution options. The challenge lies in avoiding invalid
resolution options and prioritizing valid ones. This paper presents an
effective method to support the user in making decisions among the resolution
options. In particular, the method can provide automatic information
inconsistency reasoning, avoid invalid resolution options completely, and guide
the choice among valid resolution options. Case studies and comparisons have
been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

    <title>Fine-grained complexity of graph homomorphism problem for bounded-treewidth graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561248000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/o/Okrasa:Karolina.html">Karolina Okrasa</a>, Paweł Rzążewski <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08371">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>For graphs $G$ and $H$, a \emph{homomorphism} from $G$ to $H$ is an
edge-preserving mapping from the vertex set of $G$ to the vertex set of $H$.
For a fixed graph $H$, by \textsc{Hom($H$)} we denote the computational problem
which asks whether a given graph $G$ admits a homomorphism to $H$. If $H$ is a
complete graph with $k$ vertices, then \textsc{Hom($H$)} is equivalent to the
$k$-\textsc{Coloring} problem, so graph homomorphisms can be seen as
generalizations of colorings. It is known that \textsc{Hom($H$)} is
polynomial-time solvable if $H$ is bipartite or has a vertex with a loop, and
NP-complete otherwise [Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, JCTB 1990].
</p>
<p>In this paper we are interested in the complexity of the problem,
parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph $G$. If $G$ has $n$ vertices
and is given along with its tree decomposition of width $\mathrm{tw}(G)$, then
the problem can be solved in time $|V(H)|^{\mathrm{tw}(G)} \cdot
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, using a straightforward dynamic programming. We explore
whether this bound can be improved. We show that if $H$ is a \emph{projective
core}, then the existence of such a faster algorithm is unlikely: assuming the
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), the \homo{H} problem cannot be
solved in time $(|V(H)|-\epsilon)^{\mathrm{tw}(G)} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$,
for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. This result provides a full complexity characterization
for a large class of graphs $H$, as almost all graphs are projective cores.
</p>
<p>We also notice that the naive algorithm can be improved for some graphs $H$,
and show a complexity classification for all graphs $H$, assuming two
conjectures from algebraic graph theory. In particular, there are no known
graphs $H$ which are not covered by our result.
</p>
<p>In order to prove our results, we bring together some tools and techniques
from algebra and from fine-grained complexity.

private datasets by implementing gradient descent using secure aggregation
methods. The idea is to compute a global weight update without revealing the
contributions of individual users.
</p>
<p>Current practical protocols for secure aggregation work in an "honest but
curious" setting where a curious adversary observing all communication to and
from the server cannot learn any private information assuming the server is
honest and follows the protocol.
</p>
<p>A more scalable and robust primitive for privacy-preserving protocols is
shuffling of user data, so as to hide the origin of each data item. Highly
scalable and secure protocols for shuffling, so-called mixnets, have been
proposed as a primitive for privacy-preserving analytics in the
Encode-Shuffle-Analyze framework by Bittau et al. Recent papers by Cheu et al.
and Balle et al. have formalized the "shuffled model" and suggested protocols
for secure aggregation that achieve differential privacy guarantees. Their
protocols come at a cost, though: Either the expected aggregation error or the
amount of communication per user scales as a polynomial $n^{\Omega(1)}$ in the
number of users $n$.
</p>
<p>In this paper we propose simple and more efficient protocol for aggregation
in the shuffled model, where communication as well as error increases only
polylogarithmically in $n$. Our new technique is a conceptual "invisibility
cloak" that makes users' data almost indistinguishable from random noise while
introducing zero distortion on the sum.

    <title>The Complexity of Online Bribery in Sequential Elections</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561248000</feedworld_mtime>

simultaneously, and that the briber has full knowledge of all voters' votes.
But neither of those assumptions always holds. In many real-world settings,
votes come in sequentially, and the briber may have a use-it-or-lose-it moment
to decide whether to bribe/alter a given vote, and at the time of making that
decision, the briber may not know what votes remaining voters are planning on
casting.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce a model for, and initiate the study of, bribery
in such an online, sequential setting. We show that even for election systems
whose winner-determination problem is polynomial-time computable, an online,
sequential setting may vastly increase the complexity of bribery, in fact
jumping the problem up to completeness for high levels of the polynomial
hierarchy or even PSPACE. On the other hand, we show that for some natural,
important election systems, such a dramatic complexity increase does not occur,
and we pinpoint the complexity of their bribery problems in the online,
sequential setting.

    <title>Jaccard Filtration and Stable Paths in the Mapper</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561248000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Dustin L. Arendt, Matthew Broussard, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Krishnamoorthy:Bala.html">Bala Krishnamoorthy</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Saul:Nathaniel.html">Nathaniel Saul</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08256">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The contributions of this paper are two-fold. We define a new filtration
called the cover filtration built from a single cover based on a generalized
Jaccard distance. We provide stability results for the cover filtration and
show how the construction is equivalent to the Cech filtration under certain
settings. We then develop a language and theory for stable paths within this
filtration, inspired by ideas of persistent homology. We demonstrate how the
filtration and paths can be applied to a variety of applications in which
defining a metric is not obvious but a cover is readily available.
</p>
<p>We demonstrate the usefulness of this construction by employing it in the
context of recommendation systems and explainable machine learning. We
demonstrate a new perspective for modeling recommendation system data sets that
does not require manufacturing a bespoke metric. This extends work on
graph-based recommendation systems, allowing a topological perspective. For an
explicit example, we look at a movies data set and we find the stable paths
identified in our framework represent a sequence of movies constituting a
gentle transition and ordering from one genre to another.
</p>
<p>For explainable machine learning, we apply the Mapper for model induction,
providing explanations in the form of paths between subpopulations or
observations. Our framework provides an alternative way of building a
filtration from a single mapper that is then used to explore stable paths. As a
direct illustration, we build a mapper from a supervised machine learning model
trained on the FashionMNIST data set. We show that the stable paths in the
cover filtration provide improved explanations of relationships between
subpopulations of images.

    <title>Report from SoCG</title>
    <summary>As I mentioned in my previous post, I just finished attending the Symposium on Computational Geometry in Portland. The conference proceedings are open access through LIPIcs.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/06/20/portland-street-art.html">my previous post</a>, I just finished attending the Symposium on Computational Geometry in Portland. The <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/portals/lipics/index.php?semnr=16108">conference proceedings are open access through LIPIcs</a>.</p>

<p>The conference started on Tuesday (after some earlier social activities) with the best paper talk by Arnaud de Mesmay, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.27">Almost tight lower bounds for hard cutting problems in embedded graphs</a>” (with V. Cohen-Addad, É. Colin de Verdière, and D. Marx) proving that, to find the shortest set of cuts to slice a genus- surface into a disk, the exponent must depend linearly on  (assuming the exponential time hypothesis).</p>

<p>Several of the contributed talks from throughout the conference particularly caught my attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shay Moran’s paper with A. Yehudayoff, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.51">On weak -nets and the Radon number</a>” concerned abstract convexity spaces where the convex sets are any set family closed under intersection. A space has Radon number  if every  points can be partitioned into two subsets whose convex hulls (smallest containing convex sets) intersect, and a point in the intersection is called a Radon point. Having bounded Radon number turns out to be equivalent to having weak -nets, subsets of points that (for a given measure on the space) intersect every large convex set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mitchell Jones’ “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.41">Journey to the center of the point set</a>” (with Sariel Har-Peled) improved an old paper of mine on using Radon points to find points of high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centerpoint_(geometry)">Tukey depth</a> in high-dimensional point sets in time polynomial in the dimension, improving both the polynomial and the depth of the resulting points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sariel Har-Peled spoke on his work with Timothy Chan, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.23">Smallest -enclosing rectangle revisited</a>”. As well as shaving logs from the time bounds for finding rectangles that enclose a given number of points and minimize their area or perimeter, they found a general reduction from problems on  points to  problems on  points, allowing one to turn factors of  in the time bounds into factors of . Previously such reductions were only known for -point subset problems where the optimal solution lies among the  nearest neighbors of some input point, true for rectangle perimeter but not rectangle area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timothy Chan’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.20">Computing Shapley values in the plane</a>” concerns an interesting combination of game theory and computational geometry. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value">Shapley value</a> is a method for assigning credit when multiple people collaborate to produce some value (given as input a function from subsets of people to the value of a subset). It can be defined by adding contributors one-by-one in a random order and setting each contributor’s Shapley value to the expected increase in value when that contributor is added. It sums to the total value and is the unique function with this property that obeys several other natural and desirable axioms for credit assignment. For arbitrary functions from subsets of  contributors to subset values, it takes time  to compute, but Timothy described polynomial time algorithms for cases when the value function has some geometric meaning, such as when it measures the area of the convex hull of a subset of  points. There’s probably a lot more to be done in the same direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Patrick Schnider’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.56">Ham-Sandwich cuts and center transversals in subspaces</a>” has some partial results towards a conjectured generalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_sandwich_theorem">ham sandwich theorem</a>: given  probability distributions in -dimensional Euclidean space, it should be possible to find  hyperplanes whose checkerboard partition of space simultaneously bisects all of the distributions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jie Xue spoke on “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.60">Near-optimal algorithms for shortest paths in weighted unit-disk graphs</a>” (with Haitao Wang). Here “weighted” means that overlapping unit disks are connected by an edge whose length is the Euclidean distance between their centers. Previous methods obtained near-linear algorithms by using bichromatic closest pair data structures to simulate Dijkstra’s algorithm. Instead, Wang and Xue use a related relaxation algorithm that partitions the plane into a grid and at each step relaxes all edges between certain pairs of grid squares, using data structures for additively weighted nearest neighbors. By avoiding the overhead of closest pairs they shave several logs from the runtime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arnaud de Mesmay spoke again towards the end of the conference on “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.49">The unbearable hardness of unknotting</a>”, with Yo’av Rieck, Eric Sedgwick, and Martin Tancer. They used a reduction from 3-satisfiability, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_link">Hopf links</a> for variables and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings">Borromean links</a> for clauses (connected to each other by ribbons), to prove that it’s NP-complete to find an unlinked subset of a link with a maximum number of components. By a second level of replacement that doubles the strands of each link, they also showed that it’s NP-complete to find the minimum number of crossing changes or of Reidemeister moves to unlink a link or to unknot a knot.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon I went to the workshop on open problems. After the obligatory open problem session, we debated whether we should collect problems on <a href="https://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/">The Open Problems Project</a>, <a href="http://www.openproblemgarden.org/">The Open Problem Garden</a>, or some new system that, since it doesn’t exist, can be more perfect than anything that does. Then I switched to the Young Researcher’s Forum (unfortunately missing the open problem implementation challenge); at the YRF, my student Daniel Frishberg spoke about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06875">our work on using nearest neighbor chains to speed up greedy algorithms</a>.</p>

<p>The invited talks on Wednesday and Friday were by Sanjoy Dasgupta and Bruce Donald, respectively. Dasgupta spoke on using concepts from geometric data structures to interpret the neural structure of the olfactory system in fruit flies (and hopefully, eventually, vice versa: to use our understanding of neural structures to develop new data structures). For instance, the first three layers of neurons in this system appear to implement an “expand-and-sparsify” data structure that represents low-dimensional normalized vectors by randomly mapping them to much higher dimensional vectors and then listing as a set a smaller number of high-value coordinates. This appears to be closely analogous to known methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing">locality-sensitive hashing</a>.  Donald spoke on using geometric methods to represent and infer the shapes of proteins, and to design proteins with desired shapes and functions.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening was the conference banquet, at the famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Ballroom_(Portland,_Oregon)">Crystal Ballroom</a>, conveniently located near Powell’s Books. Matthew Dickerson showed up (after many years absence from SoCG) and brought some musical family members for a live concert.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Marquee for Michael Dickerson and Shaky Situation" src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/portland/ShakySituation-m.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;"/></p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon I stopped by the workshop on algebraic methods where I had the pleasure of seing Josh Zahl give his talk on a whiteboard instead of using prepared slides. It was on methods for proving bounds on the number of incidences among geometric objects by combining naive bounds based on forbidden complete bipartite subgraphs of the incidence graphs, cuttings of space into smaller regions within which one applies these naive bounds, and cuttings of the objects into pieces in order to make the forbidden subgraphs smaller.</p>

<p>The conference business meeting was also Thursday, and ran very smoothly.
Next year SoCG will be in Zurich; the year after that, in Buffalo. We now have an officially incorporated society, <a href="http://www.computational-geometry.org/society/index.html">The Society for Computational Geometry</a>, so that we can maintain buffer funds for the conference from one year to the next; it will be supported by an increase of $30-$35 in non-student registration fees. And the attendees voted overwhelmingly in favor of both <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/safetoc.html">the SafeTOC anti-harassment guidelines</a> and ensuring and better advertising the availability of childcare at future conferences.</p>

<p>The conference was dedicated to the memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Pollack">Ricky Pollack</a>, but it also included a celebration on Friday of a living computational geometer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hershberger">John Hershberger</a>, who led the effort to bring SoCG to Oregon, and turned 60 just before the conference began. Happy birthday, John!</p>

The context is as follows: in a <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09353">STOC 2018 paper</a> followed by a <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08647">COLT 2019 paper</a>, the following corruption model was discussed: stochastic bandits, except for <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> rounds which are adversarial. The state of the art bounds were of the form: optimal (or almost optimal) stochastic term plus <img alt="K C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-189063850ed2dd251e3453bcdf72bb1f_l3.png?resize=30%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="30"/>, and it was mentioned as an open problem whether <img alt="KC" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a11b6676b92ebe2d33985ebf5d9107fe_l3.png?resize=30%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="30"/> could be improved to <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> (there is a lower bound showing that <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> is necessary — when <img alt="C = O(\sqrt{T})" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="20" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7a63a8eb07aa9c2f39df62272d6a867e_l3.png?resize=92%2C20&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="92"/>). As was discussed in the comment section, it seemed that indeed this clean best of both worlds approach should certainly shed light on the corruption model. It turns out that this is indeed the case, and a one-line calculation resolves positively the open problem from the COLT paper. The formal result is as follows (recall the notation/definitions from <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/06/10/amazing-progress-in-adversarially-robust-stochastic-multi-armed-bandits/">the previous blog post</a>):</p>

<p>I’m writing this post to draw attention to the imminent deadline of <a href="https://tpdp.cse.buffalo.edu/2019/">TPDP 2019</a>, co-located with CCS 2019 in London. I’ll spare you the full details (click the link for more information), but most pressing is the deadline tomorrow, June 21, 2019, anywhere on Earth (let me know if this presents hardship for you, and I can pass concerns on to the chair). Essentially anything related to the theory or practice of differential privacy is welcome. Submissions are limited to four pages in length and are lightly refereed, based on originality, relevance, interest, and clarity. There are no published proceedings, and previously published results are welcome. If you’ve been looking to get to know the community, consider either submitting or attending the workshop! </p></div>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">In Quanta magazine, Kevin Hartnett has a recent article entitled A New Law to Describe Quantum Computing’s Rise? The article discusses “Neven’s Law”—a conjecture, by Hartmut Neven (head of Google’s quantum computing effort), that the number of integrated qubits is now increasing exponentially with time, so that the difficulty of simulating a state-of-the-art QC on […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In <em>Quanta</em> magazine, Kevin Hartnett has a recent article entitled <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/does-nevens-law-describe-quantum-computings-rise-20190618/">A New Law to Describe Quantum Computing’s Rise?</a>  The article discusses “Neven’s Law”—a conjecture, by Hartmut Neven (head of Google’s quantum computing effort), that the number of integrated qubits is now increasing exponentially with time, so that the difficulty of simulating a state-of-the-art QC on a fixed classical computer is increasing <em>doubly</em> exponentially with time.  (Jonathan Dowling tells me that he expressed the same thought years ago.)</p>



<p>Near the end, the <em>Quanta</em> piece quotes some UT Austin professor whose surname starts with a bunch of A’s as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“I think the undeniable reality of this progress puts the ball firmly in the court of those who believe scalable quantum computing can’t work.   They’re the ones who need to articulate where and why the progress will stop.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The quote is perfectly accurate, but in context, it might give the impression that I’m endorsing Neven’s Law.  In reality, I’m reluctant to fit a polynomial or an exponential or any other curve through a set of numbers that so far hasn’t exceeded about 50.  I say only that, regardless of what anyone believes is the ultimate rate of progress in QC, what’s already happened today puts the ball firmly in the skeptics’ court.</p>



<p>Also in <em>Quanta</em>, Anil Ananthaswamy has a new article out on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-to-turn-a-quantum-computer-into-the-ultimate-randomness-generator-20190619/">How to Turn a Quantum Computer Into the Ultimate Randomness Generator</a>.  This piece covers two schemes for using a quantum computer to generate “certified random bits”—that is, bits you can <em>prove</em> are random to a faraway skeptic.  one due to me, the other due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00640">Brakerski et al</a>.  The article cites my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">paper with Lijie Chen</a>, which shows that under suitable computational assumptions, the outputs in my protocol are hard to spoof using a classical computer.  The randomness aspect will be addressed in a paper that I’m currently writing; for now, see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/certrand2.ppt">these slides</a>.</p>



<p>As long as I’m linking to interesting recent <em>Quanta</em> articles, Erica Klarreich has <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-disproves-hedetniemis-graph-theory-conjecture-20190617/">A 53-Year-Old Network Coloring Conjecture is Disproved</a>.  Briefly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedetniemi%27s_conjecture">Hedetniemi’s Conjecture</a> stated that, given any two finite, undirected graphs G and H, the chromatic number of the tensor product G⊗H is just the minimum of the chromatic numbers of G and H themselves.  This reasonable-sounding conjecture has now been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02167">falsified</a> by Yaroslav Shitov.  For more, see also <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/05/10/sansation-in-the-morning-news-yaroslav-shitov-counterexamples-to-hedetniemis-conjecture/">this post by Gil Kalai</a>—who appears here <em>not</em> in his capacity as a quantum computing skeptic.</p>



<p>In interesting math news beyond <em>Quanta</em> magazine, the Berkeley alumni magazine has a piece about the crucial, neglected topic of <a href="https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2019-06-14/chalk-market-where-mathematicians-go-get-good-stuff">mathematicians’ love for Hagoromo-brand chalk</a> (hat tip: Peter Woit).  I can personally vouch for this.  When I moved to UT Austin three years ago, most offices in CS had whiteboards, but I deliberately chose one with a blackboard.  I figured that chalk has its problems—it breaks, the dust gets all over—but I could live with them, much more than I could live with the Fundamental Whiteboard Difficulty, of all the available markers always being dry whenever you want to explain anything.  With the Hagoromo brand, though, you pretty much get all the benefits of chalk with none of the downsides, so it just strictly dominates whiteboards.</p>



<p>Jan Kulveit asked me to advertise the <a href="https://espr-camp.org/">European Summer Program on Rationality</a> (ESPR), which will take place this August 13-23, and which is aimed at students ages 16-19.  I’ve <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410">lectured</a> both at ESPR and at a similar summer program that ESPR was modeled after (called SPARC)—and while I was never there as a student, it looked to me like a phenomenal experience.   So if you’re a 16-to-19-year-old who reads this blog, please consider applying!</p>



<p>I’m now at the end of my annual family trip to Tel Aviv, returning to the Eastern US tonight, and then on to <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2019/stocprogram.html">STOC’2019</a> at the <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">ACM Federated Computing Research Conference</a> in Phoenix (which I can blog about if anyone wants me to).  It was a good trip, although marred by my two-year-old son Daniel falling onto sun-heated metal and suffering a second-degree burn on his leg, and then by the doctor botching the treatment.  Fortunately Daniel’s now healing nicely.  For future reference, whenever bandaging a burn wound, <em>be sure</em> to apply lots of Vaseline to prevent the bandage from drying out, and also to change the bandage daily.  Accept no fancy-sounding substitute.</p></div>

<div/>
<div>Dear all,</div>
<div/>
<div>The TCS Women 2019 program is finalized: <a href="https://sigact.org/tcswomen/tcs-women-2019/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://sigact.org/tcswomen/tcs-women-2019/</a>. Here are some details:</div>
<div/>
<div>On June 23rd, we have our TCS Women Spotlight workshop from 2 pm to 5 pm. This will feature an inspirational talk by Ronitt Rubinfeld (MIT &amp; Tel Aviv University)–“Comedy of Errors”, and rising stars talks by Naama Ben-David (CMU), Debarati Das (Charles University), Andrea Lincoln (MIT) and Oxana <span style="color: #000000;">Poburinnaya (Boston University). The workshop is open to all and we would love to see you all there.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">On June 24th, we have the TCS Women lunch and panel of distinguished researchers from academia and industries. This year’s panelists include Shuchi Chawla (University of Wisconsin), Julia Chuzhoy (TTIC), Edith Cohen (Google), Faith Ellen (University of Toronto), Rachel Lin (University of Washington) and Nutan Limaye (Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai). The event is open to all women participants of FCRC.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to these, there will be a TCS Women poster session held jointly with the STOC poster session on June 24th. Fourteen women researchers will be presenting posters on their research. More information is available on our website. All are welcome. </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">We are providing travel scholarships to more than forty women students this year to attend STOC and FCRC. We secured funding from the NSF, Akamai, Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Thank you!<br/>
</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Looking forward to seeing you soon!</span></div>

Just a reminder that Grigory Yaroslavtsev has <a href="http://grigory.us/blog/theory-jobs-2019/">taken over</a> the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oegc0quwv2PqoR_pzZlUIrPw4rFsZ4FKoKkUvmLBTHM/edit?usp=sharing">Theory Jobs Spreadsheet</a>. Check out who is moving where and let everyone know where you will continue your research career.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
In 1999 when I considered leaving the University of Chicago for NEC Research I had a conversation with Bob Zimmer, then VP of Research and current U of C President. Zimmer said it was a shame I didn't live in Hyde Park, the Chicago South Side neighborhood where the university resides, and thus not fully connected with the school. At the time I didn't fully understand his point and did leave for NEC, only to return in 2003 and leave again in 2008. I never did live in Hyde Park.<br/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Recently I served on a review committee for a computer science department in a rural college town. You couldn't help but notice the great collegiality among the faculty. Someone told me their theory that you generally get more faculty collegiality in rural versus urban locations. Why?</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
In urban locations faculty tend to live further from campus, to get bigger homes and better schools, and face more traffic. They are likely to have more connections with people unconnected with the university. There are more consulting opportunities in large cities, a larger variety of coffee houses to hang out in and better connected airports make leaving town easier. Particularly in computer science, where you can do most of your research remotely, faculty will find themselves less likely to come in every day and you lose those constant informal connections with the rest of the faculty. </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
This is a recent phenomenon, even going back to when I was a young faculty you needed to come to the office for access to research papers, better computers to write papers, good printers. Interactions with students and colleagues is always better in person but in the past the methods of electronic communication proved more limiting.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
The University of Chicago helped create and promote its own neighborhood and ran a very strong private school with reduced tuition for faculty children. Maybe my life would have been different had I immersed myself in that lifestyle. </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Or maybe we should go the other extreme. If we can find great ways to do on-line meetings and teaching, why do we need the physical university at all?</div></div>

The Internet has enabled new markets with previously unknown features (e-commerce, web-based advertisement, viral marketing, sharing economy, real-time trading), and algorithms play a central role in many decision processes involved in these markets. For example, algorithms run electronic auctions, adjust prices dynamically, trade stocks, harvest big data to decide market strategies and to provide recommendations to customers. The focus of the proposal ALGADIMAR is on the development of new methods and tools in research areas that are critical to the understanding of digital markets: algorithmic game theory, market and mechanism design, machine learning, algorithmic data analysis, optimization in strategic settings. We plan to apply these methods so as to solve fundamental algorithmic problems motivated by Internet advertisement, sharing economy, mechanism design for social good, security games. While our research is focused on foundational work —with rigorous design and analysis of algorithms, mechanisms and games— it will also include empirical validation on large-scale datasets from real-world applications.<br/><br/>Main activities:  The research activity will be on one or more of the following topics: design and analysis of algorithms; algorithms and data structures for big data; approximation algorithms; combinatorial optimization; algorithms for graphs and networks; autonomous agents and mobile computing; distributed algorithms; algorithmic game theory, algorithmic aspects of internet and social networks.</div>

<p>
Jeff Lagarias is a mathematician <b>or</b> a professor at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>
Today I wish to discuss Diophantine equations.</p>
<p>
Note, the “or” is a poor joke: For mathematicians <img alt="{A \text{ or } B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Ctext%7B+or+%7D+B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \text{ or } B}"/> is true also when both <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> are true.</p>
<p>
Jeff has a paper titled <i>Complexity of Diophantine Equations</i> and related <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~lagarias/TALK-SLIDES/dioph-cplx-icerm2011aug.pdf">talk</a> version. It is a nice review of some of the issues around Diophantine equations. </p>
<p>
He has worked on number theory, on complexity theory, and on many other <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/eulers-constants/">problems</a>. Some are applied and some theoretical. He with Peter Shor solved an open problem years ago that was first stated by Ott-Heinrich Keller in 1930. Our friends at Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keller%27s_conjecture">state</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In geometry, Keller’s conjecture is the conjecture that in any tiling of Euclidean space by identical hypercubes there are two cubes that meet face to face. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>For dimensions ten or more it is now proved to be false thanks to Jeff and Peter. I am amazed by such geometric results, since I have no geometric intuition. Ten dimensions is way beyond me—although curiously I am okay in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> dimensions. Strange? Jeff has a relevant <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/765002">quote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every dimension is special.</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Complexity of Diophantine Equations </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Recall the main problem is to find solutions to equations usually restricted to be integers or rationals. This restriction makes the problems hard as in <em>open</em>, and hard as in <em>computationally difficult</em>. </p>

<p>Jeff mentions the following hardness result in his talk: Solving in nonnegative integers for <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y}"/> 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (x+2)(y+2) = N, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2B2%29%28y%2B2%29+%3D+N%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  (x+2)(y+2) = N, "/></p>
<p>is as hard as integer factoring. This follows since <img alt="{x+2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x+2}"/> and <img alt="{y+2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%2B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y+2}"/> must be non-trivial factors of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>. Note this relies on the fact that <img alt="{x+2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x+2}"/> and <img alt="{y+2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%2B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y+2}"/> are both greater than or equal to <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/>.</p>
<p>
We can delete “nonnegative” in the above by the following simple idea. Suppose that <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> has two factors that are both congruent to <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3}"/> modulo <img alt="{8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{8}"/>. If not, then we can still factor, but I believe the idea is clearer without adding extra complications. Then solve in integers 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (8x + 3)(8y+3) = N. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%288x+%2B+3%29%288y%2B3%29+%3D+N.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  (8x + 3)(8y+3) = N. "/></p>
<p>By assumption on <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> there is a solution of this equation. Moreover suppose that <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y}"/> are some solution. The key is that <img alt="{8x + 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8x+%2B+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{8x + 3}"/> cannot be <img alt="{\pm 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 1}"/> and <img alt="{8y+3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8y%2B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{8y+3}"/> also cannot be <img alt="{\pm 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 1}"/>. Then it follows that each is also not equal to <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> in absolute value. Thus 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  1 &lt; |8x+3| &lt; N, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++1+%3C+%7C8x%2B3%7C+%3C+N%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  1 &lt; |8x+3| &lt; N, "/></p>
<p>and we have factored <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3>  NP-hard </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
Jeff points out that it is unlikely that Diophantine problems are going to be classified by the NP-hard machinery. He says </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> shows the (possible) mismatch of “natural” Diophantine problems with the P versus NP question. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Factoring is one of those in between problems that could be in P, but most believe that it could not be NP-hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Rational Case </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The problem of deciding whether a polynomial has a <i>rational</i> root is still open. That is given a polynomial with integer coefficients, does the equation 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(x,y,z,\dots)= 0, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2C%5Cdots%29%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(x,y,z,\dots)= 0, "/></p>
<p>have a rational solution <img alt="{x,y,z,\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y,z,\dots}"/>? Of course the famous Hilbert’s Tenth problem asks for integer solutions of polynomials and is undecidable. The rational case is open. We have discussed it before <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/hilberts-tenth-over-the-rationals/">here</a>. See <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~morrow/336_16/2016papers/peter%20gc.pdf">this</a> for a survey. </p>
<p>
I had tried to see if we could at least prove the following: The decision problem over the rationals is at NP-hard. I thought for a while that I could show that solving equations over the rationals is at least NP-hard. My idea was to try to replace <img alt="(x+2)(y+2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2B2%29%28y%2B2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(x+2)(y+2)"/> by a equation that works over the rationals. The attempt failed. I was also unable to find a reference for such a result either. So perhaps it is open.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is it undecidable to determine whether a polynomial has a root over the rationals? Can we at least get that it is factoring hard?</p>

    <title>Postdoctoral positions at the GSSI on modelling and verification for cyber-physical and smart systems</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a href="http://cs.gssi.it/">Computer Science group at the Gran Sasso Science Institute</a> (GSSI, an international PhD school and centre for advanced studies located in L’Aquila, Italy) has two available postdoctoral positions on topics related to modelling and verification for cyber-physical and smart systems. The positions are in the context of two PRIN projects funded by the Italian Ministry for University and Research, namely  "Designing Spatially Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems under Uncertainty (SEDUCE)" (Catia Trubiani, PI at the GSSI) and "IT MATTERS: Methods and Tools for Trustworthy Smart Systems" (Luca Aceto, PI at the GSSI).  Each position is for two years and the salary is 36,000€ per year before taxes. The positions are renewable for a third year if this is mutually agreeable.<br/><br/>The positions are briefly described below. We foresee a close collaboration between the members of the teams working on the two projects.   The application must be submitted through the online form available at <a href="https://applications.gssi.it/postdoc/">https://applications.gssi.it/postdoc/</a> by <b>Thursday, 11 July 2019 at 6 p.m. (Central European Time)</b>. For more information, please consult the Call for Applications at <a href="https://applications.gssi.it/postdoc/">https://applications.gssi.it/postdoc/ </a>or write an email to the PIs of the respective projects.<br/><br/>Note that the Computer Science group at the GSSI also has a further position financed by the institute, which can be filled in any of the research themes within the group. See <a href="http://cs.gssi.it/">http://cs.gssi.it</a> for more information.<br/><br/>Requirements: Candidates are expected to have a PhD degree in Computer Science or related disciplines. Preference will be given to applicants who have previous research experience on topics related to the themes of the project.<br/><br/>P<b>ostdoctoral position within the project "Designing Spatially Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems under Uncertainty"</b>, supervised by Catia Trubiani: <a href="https://cs.gssi.it/catia.trubiani">https://cs.gssi.it/catia.trubiani</a>.<br/><br/>Brief description of the project: Emerging scenarios such as autonomous vehicles and the Internet-of-Things require large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS), i.e., computing devices that interact with the physical world. To cope with their complexity, model-based design has long been advocated as a prominent approach for their rigorous development. However, the state of the art does not adequately account for two major issues: space, to capture the distribution of CPS devices as well as their mobility; and uncertainty, e.g., to reflect lack of knowledge about the environment, the accuracy of the model, or errors occurring in the real world. Our goal is to develop modelling and analysis techniques for CPS where space and uncertainty are first-class citizens. We envisage a component-based framework where digital and physical components have locality and mobility features, and where uncertainty is captured by means of probabilistically distributed activities to describe their dynamics. We devise a system to specify spatio-temporal CPS requirements, turning them into probabilistic spatio-temporal logical specifications that will be at the basis of efficient algorithms for the analysis, verification, and synthesis. We will apply our techniques to real case studies on smart buildings and crowd-navigating robots.<br/><br/>Main activities: The successful candidate will develop a component-based modelling language for the specification of cyber physical systems, where digital components (i.e., the computational devices), need to co-exist with physical components (i.e., the dynamical models of the physical world). Each component will feature an appropriate location and mobility model. Uncertainty will be specified with either probabilistically distributed activities, or nondeterministically, leading to reasoning that will take into account worst- and best-case scenarios under any possible value of such uncertain actions. The modelling framework will allow the specification of spatio-temporal requirements, which establish the behavioural guarantees to be satisfied by the CPS under analysis.   The postdoctoral researcher will work with Catia Trubiani at the GSSI, and she/he will also collaborate with the project partners at IMT Lucca (Mirco Tribastone, coordinator of the project), University of Trieste (Luca Bortolussi and Stefano Seriani), and University of Camerino (Francesco Tiezzi).<br/><br/><br/><b>Postdoctoral position within the project "IT MATTERS: Methods and Tools for Trustworthy Smart Systems"</b> supervised by Luca Aceto: <a href="http://www.gssi.it/people/professors/lectures-computer-science/item/225-aceto-luca">http://www.gssi.it/people/professors/lectures-computer-science/item/225-aceto-luca</a>.<br/><br/>Brief description of the project: The goal of the project is the development and the application of a novel methodology for the specification, implementation and validation of trustworthy smart systems based on formal methods. We envisage system development in three steps by first providing and analysing system models to find design errors, then moving from models to executable code by translation into domain-specific programming languages and, finally, monitoring runtime execution to detect anomalous behaviours and to support systems in taking context-dependent decisions autonomously. Scientifically, the research will yield new, fundamental insights on the general properties of large scale, physically located, smart systems, leading to an end-to-end, principled approach to their design, implementation and deployment. The developed software tools and the work on the case studies will show the effectiveness of our proposed approach in three practical scenarios at different application scales.<br/><br/>Main activities: The successful candidate will develop runtime-monitoring and software-model-checking techniques for “smart systems”, that is, systems that take context-dependent decisions autonomously. The research activities will involve developing frameworks that can deal with the distributed nature of smart systems and will  build on existing work on specification-based monitoring and software model checking of cyber-physical systems. The postdoctoral researcher will also devise techniques to use information derived from the runtime analysis to guide the software-model-checking effort and to refine the models of the runtime environment used in model checking.    The postdoctoral researcher will work with Luca Aceto, Omar Inverso, Ludovico Iovino and Emilio Tuosto at the GSSI. He/she will also collaborate with the project partners at IMT Lucca, CNR Pisa, University of Camerino, University of Pisa and University of Udine. Moreover, he/she will also interact with the concurrency group at ICE-TCS (<a href="http://icetcs.ru.is/">http://icetcs.ru.is/</a>), Reykjavik University, led by Luca Aceto and Anna Ingólfsdóttir.</div>

    <title>Why does the Nevalina Prize (now Abacus) got to Algorithms/Complexity people</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In my post about the Nevanlinna prize  name change (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/imus-non-controversial-changing-name-of.html">here</a>) one of my readers raised a different question about the prize:<br/>
<br/>
BEGIN QUOTE<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: start;">
<br/></div>
<span>So there's one of my main questions about the prize answered (or at least resolved). The second remains. The IMU's website(which still refers to the Nevanlinna Prize) says that it is awarded "for outstanding contributions in Mathematical Aspects of Information Sciences including:"</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>1)All mathematical aspects of computer science, including complexity theory, logic of programming languages, analysis of algorithms, cryptography, computer vision, pattern recognition, information processing and modelling of intelligence.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>2)Scientific computing and numerical analysis. Computational aspects of optimization and control theory. Computer algebra.</span><br/>

<span>Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that the recognized work of the ten winners of the award all fits into two or three of the possible research areas for which the prize may be rewarded. Why do people think that this is the case?</span><br/>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;">First off, lets see if this is true. Here is a list of all the winners:</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;"><br/></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;">Tarjan, Valiant, Razborov, Wigderson, Shor, Sudan, Kleinberg, Spielman, Khot, Daskalakis </span></span><br/>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;"><br/></span></span>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;">Yup, they all seem to be in Algorithms or Complexity.</span></span><br/>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;"><br/></span></span>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;">Speculation as to why:</span></span><br/>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;"><br/></span></span>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;">1) Algorithms and Complexity have problems with short descriptions that can easily be understood: Tarjan proved Planarity was in O(n) time. Valiant defined Sharp-P and showed the Permanent was Sharp-P complete. Hence it is easy to see what they have done. In many of the fields listed, while people have done great work, it may be harder to tell since the questions are not as clean.  If my way to do Vision is better than your way to do Vision, that may be hard to prove. And the proof  may need to be non-rigorous.</span></span><br/>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;"><br/></span></span>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;">2) If someone does great work in (for example) Logic of Programming Languages, it may not be recognized until she is past 40 years old. </span></span><br/>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;"><br/></span></span>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;">3) This one I am less sure of (frankly I'm not that sure of any of these and invite polite commentary): areas that are more practical may take longer to build and get to work.</span></span><br/>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;"><br/></span></span>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;">But there is still a problem with this. Numerical Analysis and Cryptography would seem to not have these problems. </span></span><br/>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;"><br/></span></span>
<span><span style="background-color: #ccff99; font-size: 14px;">I invite the reader to speculate</span></span></div></div>
