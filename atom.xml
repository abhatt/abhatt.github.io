    <title>TR22-042 |  Matrix Polynomial Factorization via Higman Linearization | 

	Vikraman Arvind, 

	Pushkar Joglekar</title>
    <summary>In continuation to our recent work on noncommutative
 polynomial factorization, we consider the factorization problem for
 matrices of polynomials and show the following results.
\begin{itemize}  
\item Given as input a full rank $d\times d$ matrix $M$ whose entries
  $M_{ij}$ are polynomials in the free noncommutative ring
  $\mathbb{F}_q\langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$, where each $M_{ij}$ is given by a
  noncommutative arithmetic formula of size at most $s$, we give a
  randomized algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $d,s, n$ and
  $\log_2q$ that computes a factorization of $M$ as a matrix product
  $M=M_1M_2\cdots M_r$, where each $d\times d$ matrix factor $M_i$ is
  irreducible (in a well-defined sense) and the entries of each $M_i$
  are polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_q \langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ that are output
  as algebraic branching programs. We also obtain a deterministic
  algorithm for the problem that runs in $poly(d,n,s,q)$.
\item A special case is the efficient factorization of matrices whose
  entries are univariate polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[x]$. When $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite
  field the above result applies. When $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of rationals
  we obtain a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the problem.
  \end{itemize}</summary>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Reproducibility is vital to ensuring scientific conclusions are reliable, but failures of reproducibility have been a major issue in nearly all scientific areas of study in recent decades. A key issue underlying the reproducibility crisis is the explosion of methods for data generation, screening, testing, and analysis, where, crucially, only the combinations producing the most significant results are reported. Such practices (also known as p-hacking, data dredging, and researcher degrees of freedom) can lead to erroneous findings that appear to be significant, but that don’t hold up when other researchers attempt to replicate them.</p>
<p>In this talk, we introduce a new notion of reproducibility for randomized algorithms. This notion ensures that with high probability, an algorithm returns exactly the same output when run with two samples from the same distribution. Despite the exceedingly strong demand of reproducibility, there are efficient reproducible algorithms for several fundamental problems in statistics and learning. We show that any statistical query algorithm can be made reproducible with a modest increase in sample complexity, and we use this to construct reproducible algorithms for finding approximate heavy-hitters and medians. Using these ideas, we give the first reproducible algorithm for learning halfspaces via a reproducible weak learner and a reproducible boosting algorithm. We initiate the study of lower bounds and inherent tradeoffs for reproducible algorithms, giving nearly tight sample complexity upper and lower bounds for reproducible versus non-reproducible SQ algorithms. Finally, we discuss connections to other well-studied notions of algorithmic stability, such as differential privacy.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>by <a href="https://meyn.ece.ufl.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sean Meyn</a> (University of Florida) and <a href="http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gergely Neu</a> (Pompeu Fabra University)</p>



<p>One theoretical foundation of reinforcement learning is optimal control, usually rooted in the Markovian variety known as Markov decision processes (MDPs). The MDP model consists of a state process, an action (or input) process, and a one-step reward that is a function of state and action. The goal is to obtain a policy (function from states to actions) that is optimal in some predefined sense. Chris Watkins introduced the Q-function in the 1980s as part of a methodology for reinforcement learning. Given its importance for over three decades, it is not surprising that the question of the true meaning of <em>Q</em> was a hot topic for discussion during the Simons Institute’s Fall 2020 program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/rl20" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Theory of Reinforcement Learning</a>.</p>



<p>This short note focuses on interactions at the start of the program, and research directions inspired in part by these interactions. To start with, <em>who is Q</em>? Was this code for one of Watkins’ friends at Cambridge? The question was posed early on, which led to an online investigation. The mystery was shattered through a response from Chris: we now know that the letter <em>Q</em> stands for <em>quality</em>, not Quinlyn or Quincy. To discuss further questions and potential answers requires some technicalities.</p>



<p>The discounted-cost optimality criterion is a favorite metric for performance in computer science and operations research, and is the setting of the original Q-function formulation. The definition requires a state process <span class="math inline">\(\{X_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span> and an action (or input) process <span class="math inline">\(\{A_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span>, evolving on respective spaces (which are assumed discrete in this note). There is a controlled transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that describes dynamics: <span class="math inline">\(X_{k+1}\)</span> is distributed according to <span class="math inline">\(P(\cdot|x,a)\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_k=x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_k=a\)</span>, for any action sequence that is adapted to the state sequence.</p>



<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> denoting the discount factor, the Q-function is the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation <span class="math inline">\(T^*Q = Q\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> is the Bellman operator: <span class="math display">\[\left(T^*Q\right)(x,a) = r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\]</span> This must hold for each state-action pair <span class="math inline">\((x,a)\)</span>, with the maximum over all possible actions. This is a version of the dynamic programming (DP) equation that has been with us for about seven decades.</p>



<p>The magic of Q-learning, which is based on this DP equation, is that the maximum appears within an expectation. This makes possible the application of Monte Carlo methods to obtain an approximate solution based solely on observations of the actual system to be controlled, or through simulations.</p>



<p>One core idea of modern reinforcement learning (RL) is to find approximate solutions of the DP equation within a function class (e.g., neural networks, as popularized by the deep Q-learning approach of Mnih et al., 2015). While success stories are well-known, useful theory is scarce: we don’t know if a solution exists to an approximate DP equation except in very special settings, and we don’t know if a good approximation will lead to good performance for the resulting policy. We don’t even know if the recursive algorithms that define Q-learning will be stable — estimates may diverge to infinity.</p>



<p>There are many ways to read these negative results, and indeed many articles have been written around this subject. Our own reading is probably among the most radical: without understanding the issues around the existence of solutions to these DP equation approximations or their interpretation, we should search for alternative approximations of dynamic programming suitable for application in RL.</p>



<p>These concerns were raised at Sean Meyn’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUaFu3WzW7o" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">boot camp lecture</a>, where he called on listeners to revisit an alternate foundation of optimal control: the linear programming (LP) approach introduced by Manne (1960) and further developed by Denardo (1970) and d’Epenoux (1963). The message was greeted with enthusiasm from some attendees, including Gergely Neu, who responded, “You have blown my mind!” He had been working on his own formulation of this idea, which became logistic Q-learning (more on this below).</p>



<span id="more-636"/>



<p>The least-squares approach that is central to most traditional RL algorithms (such as DQN) is replaced by an LP, so that we move from <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> approximation. There is ample motivation for this point of view:</p>



<ul><li>
		<p>Lyapunov theory and the theory of inverse dynamic programming provide firm motivation: a good approximation of the DP equation in an <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> sense implies strict bounds on closed-loop performance of the resulting policy. You can learn more about this theory in standard RL texts, and Meyn’s new RL monograph to appear this year.</p>
	</li><li>
		<p>The LP approach reframes the DP approximation as a numerical optimization problem rather than a root-finding problem. Existence of a solution is guaranteed under minimal assumptions, even when working with a restricted set of candidate solutions.</p>
	</li></ul>



<p>Despite these advantages, LP-based approaches were left out of the mainstream RL tool kit until recently. One reason may be a glaring gap in the framework: the classical LPs are phrased in terms of state-value functions and not Q-functions! This means it was not obvious how to bring in Monte Carlo methods for algorithm design.</p>



<p>In 2020, we independently discovered the following LP that can be used to cast Q-learning as a constrained optimization problem — the so-called DPLP: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned} \mbox{minimize } \qquad &amp; \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_{a} Q(X,a)\right] \\ \mbox{subject to } \qquad &amp; Q(x,a) \ge r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> Without any constraints on the function class, the optimizer is the solution to the DP equation. The constraints amount to the DP inequality <span class="math inline">\(Q \ge T^* Q\)</span>, which tells us only <em>negative</em> deviations should be penalized! This is to be contrasted with the commonly used squared Bellman error criterion that penalizes deviations of both signs. In seeking an approximation within a function class <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, it is not at all difficult to ensure a feasible solution exists, even when there is no theory to ensure that an approximate Bellman optimality operator has a fixed point.</p>



<p>There are a variety of possible ways of turning <span> this</span> insight into practical algorithms. One path (taken by Bas-Serrano et al., 2021) is to replace the hard constraint in the LP with a smooth upper bound on the expected constraint violations, resulting in the following unconstrained minimization problem: <span class="math display">\[%  \mbox{minimize } \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}[\max_a Q(X,a)] + \frac 1\eta \log 
% \mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}[e^{\eta(r(X,A) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|X,A)}[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)] – Q(X,A))}].
\mbox{minimize} \;\;\;\;\;\;\,\, \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_a Q(X,a)\right] + \frac 1\eta \log 
\mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}\left[e^{\eta((T^*Q)(X,A) – Q(X,A))}\right].\]</span> Bas-Serrano et al. (2021) dubbed the above objective function the “logistic Bellman error” and have shown that it enjoys several favorable properties that make it an ideal objective for stochastic optimization. Interactions at the Simons Institute led to the development of another related algorithmic framework called “convex Q-learning,” in which the hard constraints in the LP are replaced with a different continuous approximation (Lu et al., 2021).</p>



<p>It is straightforward to derive practical algorithms from both approaches by replacing the expectations with sample averages. This approach led to good empirical performance, along with the beginnings of theory for convergence and performance bounds.</p>



<p>The LP approach had been simmering in the background over the prior decade: de Farias and Van Roy (2003) proposed an LP approach for approximate dynamic programming, and Mehta and Meyn (2009) contains foundations for convex Q-learning, including a variant of the DPLP for deterministic systems in continuous time.</p>



<p>The new techniques bring challenges that must be overcome before these LP-based approaches can take on the world. One is that these optimization problems can be very poorly conditioned. Another is that the approximation may greatly underestimate the true Q-function when using a poor choice of function class for approximation. We remain optimistic: just like the RL community has successfully developed numerical recipes for addressing the much more severe issue of nonexistence of fixed points to the approximate Bellman operators, we believe that similar know-how can be developed for LP-based methods if theorists and practitioners join forces. Now that we understand where Q comes from, let us decide together where it will go next!</p>



<p><em>Acknowledgment</em>. The authors owe a great debt to the Simons Institute for providing inspiration and interactions throughout the fall program. In particular, our joint work (Lu et al., 2021) was in large part an outcome of discussions at the meeting. The LP approach is one theme of the new textbook (Meyn, 2022), and the impact of the program is seen throughout the book.</p>

    <title>Graph Neural Networks are Dynamic Programmers</title>

(GNNs) are propped up by the notion of algorithmic alignment. Broadly, a neural
network will be better at learning to execute a reasoning task (in terms of
sample complexity) if its individual components align well with the target
algorithm. Specifically, GNNs are claimed to align with dynamic programming
(DP), a general problem-solving strategy which expresses many polynomial-time
algorithms. However, has this alignment truly been demonstrated and
theoretically quantified? Here we show, using methods from category theory and
abstract algebra, that there exists an intricate connection between GNNs and
DP, going well beyond the initial observations over individual algorithms such
as Bellman-Ford. Exposing this connection, we easily verify several prior
findings in the literature, and hope it will serve as a foundation for building
stronger algorithmically aligned GNNs.

disk graphs and interval graphs. These graphs are of great importance due to
their structural similarity with wireless communication networks. Firefighter
problem on unit disk graph is interesting as it models the virus spreading in
an wireless network and asks for a solution to stop it. In this paper, we
consider the MIN-BUDGET firefighter problem where the goal is to determine the
minimum number of firefighters required and the nodes to place them at each
time instant to save a given set of vertices of a given graph and a fire
breakout node. We show that, the MIN-BUDGET firefighter problem in a unit disk

properties, centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVT) have found a wide range of
applications and correspondingly a vast development in their literature.
However the computation of CVT in higher dimensional spaces still remains
difficult. In this paper, we exploit the non-uniqueness of CVTs in higher
dimensional spaces for their computation. We construct such high dimensional
tessellations from CVTs in one-dimensional spaces. We then prove that such a
tessellation is centroidal under the condition of independence among densities
over the one-dimensional spaces considered. Various numerical evaluations
backup the theoretical result through the low energy of the tessellations. The
resulting grid-like tessellations are obtained efficiently with minimal
computation time.

changing associative array of counters. Here we analyse the counting version of
Count-Min under a stronger update rule known as \textit{conservative update},
assuming the uniform distribution of input keys. We show that the accuracy of
conservative update strategy undergoes a phase transition, depending on the
number of distinct keys in the input as a fraction of the size of the Count-Min
array. We prove that below the threshold, the relative error is asymptotically
$o(1)$ (as opposed to the regular Count-Min strategy), whereas above the
threshold, the relative error is $\Theta(1)$. The threshold corresponds to the
peelability threshold of random $k$-uniform hypergraphs. We demonstrate that
even for small number of keys, peelability of the underlying hypergraph is a
crucial property to ensure the $o(1)$ error.

differentially private (DP) mechanisms via graphs, where datasets are vertices
in the graph and edges represent dataset neighborhood. The boundary set
contains datasets where an individual's response changes the binary-valued
query compared to its neighbors. Previous work was limited to the homogeneous
case where the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ across all datasets was the same
and the mechanism at boundary datasets was identical. In our work, the
mechanism can take different distributions at the boundary and the privacy
parameter $\varepsilon$ is a function of neighboring datasets, which recovers
an earlier definition of personalized DP as special case. The problem is how to
extend the mechanism, which is only defined at the boundary set, to other
datasets in the graph in a computationally efficient and utility optimal
manner. Using the concept of strongest induced DP condition we solve this
problem efficiently in polynomial time (in the size of the graph).

different perspective on solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this
paper, we propose a quantum inspired algorithm for general locally constrained

The complexity of modeling, in terms of the number and the order of operations
and time required to execute them makes it challenging to learn and execute.
Our goal is to automatically derive a polygonal modeling sequence for a given
target. Then, one can learn polygonal modeling by observing the resulting
sequence and also expedite the modeling process by starting from the
auto-generated result. As a starting point for building a system for 3D
modeling in the future, we tackle the 2D shape modeling problem and present
AutoPoly, a hybrid method that generates a polygonal mesh construction sequence
from a silhouette image. The key idea of our method is the use of the Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm and differentiable rendering to separately
predict sequential topological actions and geometric actions. Our hybrid method
can alter topology, whereas the recently proposed inverse shape estimation
methods using differentiable rendering can only handle a fixed topology. Our
novel reward function encourages MCTS to select topological actions that lead
to a simpler shape without self-intersection. We further designed two deep
learning-based methods to improve the expansion and simulation steps in the
MCTS search process: an $n$-step "future action prediction" network (nFAP-Net)
to generate candidates for potential topological actions, and a shape warping
network (WarpNet) to predict polygonal shapes given the predicted rendered
images and topological actions. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on
2D polygonal shapes of multiple man-made object categories.

    <title>Efficient Algorithm for Deterministic Search of Hot Elements</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1648598400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kowalski:Dariusz_R=.html">Dariusz R. Kowalski</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Pajak:Dominik.html">Dominik Pajak</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15043">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>When facing a very large stream of data, it is often desirable to extract
most important statistics online in a short time and using small memory. For
example, one may want to quickly find the most influential users generating
posts online or check if the stream contains many identical elements. In this
paper, we study streams containing insertions and deletions of elements from a
possibly large set $N$ of size $|N| = n$, that are being processed by online
deterministic algorithms. At any point in the stream the algorithm may be
queried to output elements of certain frequency in the already processed
stream. More precisely, the most frequent elements in the stream so far. The
output is considered correct if the returned elements it contains all elements
with frequency greater than a given parameter $\varphi$ and no element with
frequency smaller than $\varphi-\epsilon$. We present an efficient online
deterministic algorithm for solving this problem using $O(\min(n,
\frac{polylog(n)}{\epsilon}))$ memory and $O(polylog(n))$ time per processing
and outputting an element. It is the first such algorithm as the previous
algorithms were either randomized, or processed elements in substantially
larger time $\Omega(\min(n, \frac{\log n}{\epsilon}))$, or handled only
insertions and required two passes over the stream (i.e., were not truly
online). Our solution is almost-optimally scalable (with only a polylogarithmic
overhead) and does not require randomness or scanning twice through the stream.
We complement the algorithm analysis with a lower bound $\Omega(\min(n,
\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ on required memory.

    <title>Maximal origami flip graphs of flat-foldable vertices: properties and algorithms</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1648598400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Hull:Thomas_C=.html">Thomas C. Hull</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Morales:Manuel.html">Manuel Morales</a>, Sarah Nash, Natalya Ter-Saakov <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14173">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Flat origami studies straight line, planar graphs $C=(V,E)$ drawn on a region
$R\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ that can act as crease patterns to map, or fold, $R$
into $\mathbb{R}^2$ in a way that is continuous and a piecewise isometry
exactly on the faces of $C$. Associated with such crease pattern graphs are
valid mountain-valley (MV) assignments $\mu:E\to\{-1,1\}$, indicating which
creases can be mountains (convex) or valleys (concave) to allow $R$ to
physically fold flat without self-intersecting. In this paper, we initiate the
first study of how valid MV assignments of single-vertex crease patterns are
related to one another via face-flips, a concept that emerged from applications
of origami in engineering and physics, where flipping a face $F$ means
switching the MV parity of all creases of $C$ that border $F$. Specifically, we
study the origami flip graph ${\rm{OFG}}(C)$, whose vertices are all valid MV
assignments of $C$ and edges connect assignments that differ by only one face
flip. We prove that, for the single-vertex crease pattern $A_{2n}$ whose $2n$
sector angles around the vertex are all equal, ${\rm{OFG}}(A_{2n})$ contains as
subgraphs all other origami flip graphs of degree-$2n$ flat origami vertex
crease patterns. We also prove that ${\rm{OFG}}(A_{2n})$ is connected and has
diameter $n$ by providing two $O(n^2)$ algorithms to traverse between vertices
in the graph, and we enumerate the vertices, edges, and degree sequence of
${\rm{OFG}}(A_{2n})$. We conclude with open questions on the surprising
complexity found in origami flip graphs of this type.

    <title>An Algorithm for Solving Solvable Polynomial Equations of Arbitrary Degree by Radicals</title>

algebraic equation $f(x)=0$ ($f(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$) of arbitrary degree and
obtaining the exact radical roots. This method requires that we know the Galois
group as the permutation group of the roots of $f(x)$ and the approximate roots
with sufficient precision beforehand. Of course, the approximate roots are not
necessary but can help reduce the quantity of computation. The algorithm
complexity is approximately proportional to the 4th power of the size of the
Galois group of $f(x)$. The whole algorithm doesn't need to deal with
tremendous polynomials or reduce symmetric polynomials.

<p>
Keith Kirkpatrick is the author of an interesting CACM <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/4/259392-still-waiting-for-self-driving-cars/fulltext">article</a> on self-driving cars. It is titled “Still Waiting For Self-Driving Cars” and appears in the news section of this month’s issue. </p>
<p>
Today we discuss why it has been so difficult to get self-driving cars started.</p>
<p>
Kirkpatrick’s article starts:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Over the past decade, technology and automotive pundits have predicted the “imminent” arrival of fully autonomous vehicles that can drive on public roads without any active monitoring or input from a human driver. Elon Musk has predicted his company Tesla would deliver fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2021, but he made similar predictions in 2020, 2019, and 2017. Each prediction has fallen flat, largely due to real-world safety concerns, particularly related to how self-driving cars perform in adverse conditions or situations.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> An Issue </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
As printed in the current CACM issue, his article says the following on page 13:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A potential intermediate solution currently being tested in Germany is to utilize remote drivers to control vehicles. Vay, a Berlin-based startup, has been testing a fleet of remote-controlled electric vehicles in that city and plans to roll out a mobility service in Europe and potentially the U.S. this year. The service will allow customers to order a remote-controlled car and have it drive them to their desired destination; on arrival, they get out if the vehicle and leave it to a human teledriver miles away to either park the vehicle or steer it to the next client. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I claim this shows the issue that we have with automatic driving systems. There is a typo in the above paragraph. A typo that shows what we are up against in the attempt to make automatic driving systems. </p>
<p>
<b>DO YOU SEE IT?</b></p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/cacmifoftypo/" rel="attachment wp-att-19792"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19792" height="36" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CACMifoftypo.jpg?resize=253%2C36&amp;ssl=1" width="253"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
We claim that a typo like this in a CACM article is part of the reason it is so hard to make self-driving cars. Do you agree? Or is the typo not critical? While we’re at it, does the title of this post have a typo?  Read on…</p>
<p>
Ken contributes a more difficult example of this kind, one he used while addressing the same issue of AI advances in his department’s Freshman Seminar. It relates to a later section in Kirkpatrick’s article, where he discusses the issue of</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …testing to ensure vehicle navigation systems understand the complex social interactions that often occur between oncoming and adjacent drivers, or drivers and pedestrians. Generally, if a pedestrian is about to cross or is crossing a street, the driver and pedestrian will make eye contact, and will use nonverbal cues to indicate the direction and speed of their movement. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Over to Ken:</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ken’s Example </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is the relevant portion of the White House <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia">transcript</a> of Barack Obama’s July 2012 campaign speech in Roanoke, Virginia—the one with the notorious phrase “you didn’t build that”:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/youdidntbuildthat/" rel="attachment wp-att-19798"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19798" height="229" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/YouDidntBuildThat.jpg?resize=363%2C229&amp;ssl=1" width="363"/></a></p>
<p>
The question we could submit to Google—whose own automated-driving efforts have had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/personaltech/google-says-its-not-the-driverless-cars-fault-its-other-drivers.html">difficulties</a> with interpreting rules—is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What does the word “that” in “you didn’t build that” refer to? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
By rules of linguistic derivation, the answer seems clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The word “that” refers to the most recent noun, which is “business.” <p/>
</li><li>
The dashes ‘- -‘ connect two parts that refer to each other. <p/>
</li><li>
The word cannot anyway refer to “roads and bridges” because that is plural whereas “that” is singular, like “business.” <p/>
</li><li>
(The preceding point is not a self-contradiction because in quotes, “roads and bridges” is a phrase—singular.)
</li></ul>
<p>
Now please take a minute-plus to listen to the actual delivery of this part of the speech (you may need to click back from 0:00:08 to 0:00:00 to get the start):</p>
<p/><center><br/>
<br/>
</center><p/>
<p/><p><br/>
First, the transcript is missing a word: Obama actually said “<em>that</em>—you didn’t build <em>that</em>.” Perhaps having a rhetorically emphasized <em>that</em> right after “business” makes the semantic designation even clearer? But then notice that the part “if you’ve got a business” was delivered in a quick and parenthetical manner inside the full phrase “Somebody invested in roads and bridges … you didn’t build that.” </p>
<p>
The interpretation that the “that” refers to <em>infrastructure</em> is supported by the speech’s immediate segue to the Internet, sandwiched around “somebody else made that happen.” Going out to sources, Obama was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/an-unoriginal-obama-quote-taken-out-of-context/2012/07/20/gJQAdG7hyW_blog.html">channeling</a> a point already notoriously made by Elizabeth Warren in a 2011 <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-agenda/elizabeth-warrens-quote-reihan-salam/">speech</a>. But without going out to sources—something we cannot expect an AI to do in the moment—there is Obama’s next sentence (also included in the speech clip):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Whether Obama intended to say that people did not build their businesses can still be argued, but that’s not the real point. My first point is that AIs based on current art for ascribing meanings not only would make that ascription, but <em>should</em> do so for overall consistency. And the second, larger, point at the end of my <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse199/InternetAndData199np.pdf">slides</a>, where I get to hard AI problems, is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We base our confidence in developing AI systems on Alan Turing’s principle that whatever the human mind can resolve, a computer can be programmed to apprehend and execute. But what if important data, on fine scales, concern matters that our human minds cannot resolve? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
CACM puts in a bubble Kirkpatrick’s quoting another expert that “it will take years and massive compute power to train self-driving systems to understand the nonverbal cues that pass between drivers and pedestrians.”  We believe the task and need of getting cars to <em>self-derive</em> meanings is greater still.  </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Do these issues say anything about the difficulty of getting code right? We think so, but what do you think?</p>
<p/><p><br/>
[some word changes; I seem unable to fix the endpoints of my clip on the C-SPAN website.]</p></font></font></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>The 2022 STOC Test of Time Award</strong> recognizes papers published in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. This is the second year of this annual award. There are three awards, targeting the STOC conferences 10, 20, and 30 years prior to the year in which the award is given. While there is a preference for papers in the target years (and nominations from those years are encouraged), in each of these award categories it is also possible to nominate STOC conference papers published up to four conferences earlier than the targeted conference. Thus, the 2022 STOC Test of Time Awards will be for papers presented at the STOC conferences in 2008-2012, 1998-2002, and 1988-1992. The awards, which will be presented at STOC 2022, include a prize of US $500 per author as well as complimentary registration for all authors who attend the conference at which the award is given.</p>



<h2>Nomination Procedure</h2>



<p>Nominations should be sent to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>stoc22.tot.award@gmail.com</strong></a><strong> </strong>with a subject line of <strong>“STOC Test of Time Award” </strong>no later than <strong>April 30, 2022</strong>. Nominations should contain an explanation of the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. A nomination may be accompanied by up to three additional endorsement letters, which may be sent by the endorsers directly to the same email address with the same subject line. Self-nominations are disallowed. </p>



<h2>Selection</h2>



<p>The winners will be selected by a committee appointed by the SIGACT Executive Committee. For 2022 the selection committee consists of Toniann Pitassi (Columbia), Satish Rao (Berkeley), Salil Vadhan (Harvard, chair), Avi Wigderson (Institute for Advanced Study). </p>



<p>In selecting the Test of Time Award winners, the Committee will pay particular attention to long-term impact. This impact can come in many forms, including but not limited to:</p>



<ol><li>Opening up a new area of research</li><li>Introducing new techniques</li><li>Solving a problem of lasting importance</li><li>Stimulating advances in other areas of computer science or in other disciplines.</li></ol>



<p>The committee expects to select exactly one paper for each award. However, when circumstances justify it, up to three may be selected. The committee may consider papers that were not explicitly nominated and gather additional input from experts, but formal nominations are extremely helpful in the committee’s deliberations and strongly encouraged.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  In the Pandora’s Box problem, the algorithm is provided with a number of boxes with unknown (stochastic) rewards contained inside them. The algorithm can open any box at some cost, discover the reward inside, and based on these observations can choose one box and keep the reward contained in it. Given the distributions from which the rewards are drawn, the algorithm must determine an order in which to open the boxes as well as when to stop and accept the best reward found so far. In general, an optimal algorithm may make both decisions adaptively based on instantiations observed previously. The Pandora’s Box problem and its extensions capture many kinds of optimization problems with stochastic input where the algorithm can obtain instantiations of input random variables at some cost. Previous work on these problems assumes that different random variables in the input are distributed independently. As such it does not capture many real-world settings. In this work, we provide the first algorithms for Pandora’s Box-type problems with correlations. In the independent setting, optimal algorithms are non-adaptive and based on the notion of the Gittins index. These techniques fail to extend to the correlated case. We assume that the algorithm has access to samples drawn from the joint distribution on input and provide solutions that require few samples; are computationally efficient; and guarantee approximate optimality. <br/>This is joint work with Evangelia Gergatsouli, Yifeng Teng, Christos Tzamos, and Ruimin Zhang and appeared in FOCS’20.</p>

    <title>TR22-041 |  Boolean functions with small approximate spectral norm | 

	Hamed Hatami, 

	TsunMing Cheung, 

	Rosie Zhao, 

	Itai Zilberstein</title>
    <summary>The sum of the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients of a function $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is called the spectral norm of $f$.    Green and Sanders' quantitative version of  Cohen's idempotent theorem states that if the spectral norm of $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{0,1\}$ is at most $M$, then the support of $f$ belongs to the ring of sets generated by at most $\ell(M)$ cosets,  where $\ell(M)$ is a constant that only depends on $M$.
    
    We prove that the above statement can be generalized to approximate spectral norms if and only if the support of $f$ and its complement satisfy a certain arithmetic connectivity condition. In particular, our theorem provides a new proof of the quantitative Cohen's theorem for $\mathbb{F}_2^n$.</summary>

    <title>TR22-040 |  Should decisions in QCDCL follow prefix order? | 

	Benjamin Böhm, 

	Tomáš Peitl, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff</title>
    <summary>Quantified conflict-driven clause learning (QCDCL) is one of the main solving approaches for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). One of the differences between QCDCL and propositional CDCL is that QCDCL typically follows the prefix order of the QBF for making decisions.
We investigate an alternative model for QCDCL solving where decisions can be made in arbitrary order. The resulting system QCDCL-ANY is still sound and terminating, but does not necessarily allow to always learn asserting clauses or cubes. To address this potential drawback, we additionally introduce two subsystems that guarantee to always learn asserting clauses (QCDCL-UNI-ANY) and asserting cubes (QCDCL-EXI-ANY), respectively.
We model all four approaches by formal proof systems and show that QCDCL-UNI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on false formulas, whereas QCDCL-EXI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on true QBFs. Technically, this involves constructing specific QBF families and showing lower and upper bounds in the respective proof systems.
We complement our theoretical study with some initial experiments that confirm our theoretical findings.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A few days ago I received by mail Imre Bárány’s new book <em>Combinatorial Convexity</em>. The book presents Helly-type theorems and other results in convexity with combinatorial flavour. The choice of material and the choice of proofs is terrific and it is an ideal book for a course for graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  Congratulations, Imre!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/ulect-77/">AMS page</a> gives the following description</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>This book is about the combinatorial properties of convex sets, families of convex sets in finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, and finite points sets related to convexity. This area is classic, with theorems of Helly, Carathéodory, and Radon that go back more than a hundred years. At the same time, it is a modern and active field of research with recent results like Tverberg’s theorem, the colourful versions of Helly and Carathéodory, and the <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-3">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-4">p</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-5">,</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-6">q</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-7">)</span></span></span></span> theorem of Alon and Kleitman. As the title indicates, the topic is convexity and geometry, and is close to discrete mathematics. The questions considered are frequently of a combinatorial nature, and the proofs use ideas from geometry and are often combined with graph and hypergraph theory. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The book is intended for students (graduate and undergraduate alike), but postdocs and research mathematicians will also find it useful. It can be used as a textbook with short chapters, each suitable for a one- or two-hour lecture. Not much background is needed: basic linear algebra and elements of (hyper)graph theory as well as some mathematical maturity should suffice.</em></span></p></blockquote>

    <title>Do you want to be the SIGACT NEWS book review editor?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I ran the SIGACT Book Review Column from 1997-2015 (18 years). You can find all of my columns, plus reviews I did for Fred, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/bookrev.html">here</a>.</p><p>When I handed it off to Fred Green I gave him this sage advice:</p><p>                   <i>Nobody should do this kind of job for more than about 5 years.</i></p><p>He ran the SIGACT Book Review Column since the end of 2015. You can find some of his columns <a href="http://mathcs.clarku.edu/~fgreen/SIGACTReviews/bookrev/bookrev.html">here</a>.</p><p>Fred is taking my advice and looking for a successor.</p><p>SO, this blog is a call to ask</p><p>                 DO YOU WANT TO BE THE SIGACT NEWS BOOK REVIEW EDITOR?</p><p>If so then email</p><p>Fred: fgreen@clarku.edu</p><p><br/></p><p>DO NOT BE SHY! I suspect he won't get many applicants, so if you want the job its probably yours.</p><p><br/></p><p>PROS</p><p>1) You get to skim lots of books and read some of  them.</p><p>2) You get some free books.</p><p>3) You get plugged into the book community (this helped me when I wrote my two books).</p><p>4) You'll have two Veteran Book Review Editors happy to review for you.</p><p>5) You get to decide the direction the column goes in.</p><p>Both Fred and I did mostly CS theory books. However:</p><p>a) I did more combinatorics, educational, history, and Computers &amp; Society books than usual.</p><p>b) Fred did more Number Theory and Physics than usual.</p><p>(Since I did the job 18 years and Fred for 6, its not clear what <i>usual</i> means.) </p><p><br/></p><p>CONS</p><p>1) You have to get out a book review column 4 times a year.</p><p>2) You have to find reviewers for books and then email them when the reviews are due.</p><p>(I think Fred is still waiting for me to review a Biography of Napier. Oh well. On the other hand, I was the one who liked having history books, which may explain why Fred never hassled me about it.) </p><p><br/></p><p>ADVICE</p><p>Prob should be done by someone who already has Tenure. While seeing and skimming thosebooks is GOOD for your research career, and good in the long-termsomeone pre-tenure really needs to get papers out in the short term. Also, when you get a book think about who might be good to review it--- don't take on to many yourself. </p><p><br/></p><p>PARTING GIFT OR WELCOME GIFT</p><p>In a recent column I had a review of a 5-book set from the LESS WRONG blog. I amcurrently working on a review of a 4-book set set from the LESS WRONG blog. This willeither be a parting gift for Fred or a Welcome gift to his successor.</p><p><br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This fall, I taught my course <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/">CS 127: Cryptography</a>, based on my lecture notes: <a href="https://intensecrypto.org/">“An intensive introduction to cryptography”</a>. This is a course that starts with no background knowledge, and gets to advanced concepts including lattice-based (aka “post quantum”) encryption, fully homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, multiparty secure computation, software obfuscation, quantum computing and crypto, and more. </p>



<p><a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/projects/">As in previous years</a>, I had an fantastic group of students, several of whom produced impressive course projects. These include the following: </p>



<p><strong>Gavin Uberti</strong>, <strong>Kevin Luo</strong>, <strong>Oliver Cheng,</strong>  and <strong>Wittmann Goh</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04581">implemented Witness Encryption</a>. Witness encryption is a cool concept whereby you can encrypt a secret X (for example the private key corresponding to a bitcoin wallet) so that people can decrypt X if and only if they can find a solution to some puzzle P. You can do this <em>even if you don’t know a solution yourself!</em> So for example you could use this to offer an automatically paying reward for a formal proof of the Reimann Hypothesis, or as they did, offer 2270  Satoshis to anyone solving this Soduko puzzle:</p>

<p><strong>Simas Sakenis</strong> wrote a <a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/simas_project.pdf">survey of proofs of stake in cryptocurrencies</a>,  providing a uniform formalizaiton of proofs of work and proofs of stake, and explaining the difference. </p>



<p><strong>Michael Kiestra</strong> and <strong>Beatrice Nash</strong> proposed  <a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/kiestra_nash.pdf">CLAMBAKE</a>,  a protocol that uses broadcast encryption and Yao’s garbled circuits to achieve a privacy-preserving protocol for facilitating access to controlled resources such as university buildings.</p>



<p>(There were more projects in the course, but some students preferred not to post these publicly since they are still working on them; I will update this post with more projects if appropriate.)</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Pessiland is the worst of Impagliazzo’s five possible worlds: it is a world where NP is hard on average and pseudorandom generators do not exist. Excluding Pessiland (i.e., showing the equivalence between average-case hardness of NP and the existence of pseudorandom generators) is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science. In this talk, we propose to consider PH (Polynomial Hierarchy) variants of Impagliazzo’s five possible worlds. Our main result is to unconditionally rule out PH variants of Pessiland. I will also mention recent progress on excluding PH Heuristica: average-case hardness of PH follows from exponential worst-case hardness of PH.</p>
<p>Based on joint works with Rahul Santhanam.</p></blockquote></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I am on the <a href="https://focs2022.eecs.berkeley.edu/cfp.html">FOCS 2022 </a>Program Committee, and I am overjoyed that the PC meeting will be virtual.  Hopefully, the days are over when the program chair can brush aside all cost-benefit considerations, impose their backyard on far-away scholars who need service items, and then splash their offspring at the welcome party.</p>



<p>I am also overjoyed that we will be implementing double-blind reviews.  This issue has been discussed and ridiculed at length.  Admittedly, it makes it harder to adhere to Leonid Levin’s 1995 influential <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/202840.606487">STOC Criteria</a></em>.  For example, if a reviewer wanted to trash a paper based on the fact that the authors are not in the position to judge their own work, now they’ll have to check online for talks or preprints to know who the authors are.  Given the volume of reviews, it’s reasonable to expect that in some cases the reviewer won’t be able to conclusively exclude that a letter-writer is among the authors.  In such a situation they can resort to writing a very long, thorough, and competent review whose most significant digit is the STOC/FOCS death sentence: <em>weak accept</em>.</p>



<p>No, I actually do have something more constructive to say about this.  I was — as they say — privileged to serve on many NSF panels.  As an aside, it’s interesting that there the track-record of the investigators <em>is </em>a key factor in the decision; in fact, according to many including myself, it should carry even more weight, rather than forcing investigators to fill pages with made-up directions most of which won’t pan out.  But that’s another story; what is relevant for this post is that each panel begins with a quick “de-biasing” briefing, which I actually enjoy and from which I learnt something.  For example, there’s a classic experiment where the ratio of females hired as musicians increases if auditions hide the performer behind a tent and make them walk in on carpet so you can’t tell what shoes they are wearing.  Similar experiments exist that hide names from the folders of applicants, etc.  What I propose is to do a similar thing when reviewing papers.  That is, start with a de-biasing briefing: tell reviewers to ask themselves whether their attitude towards a paper would be different if:</p>



<ol><li>The authors of this paper/previous relevant work were ultra-big shots, or</li><li>The authors of this paper/previous relevant work were hapless nobodies, or</li><li>The proofs in this paper could be simplified dramatically to the point that even I understand them, or</li><li>This result came with a super-complicated proof which I can’t even begin to follow, or</li></ol>



<p>What other questions would be good to ask?</p></div>

    <title>The War and Math</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>During the early parts of the cold war of the 20th century, we saw two almost independent developments of computational complexity, in the west and in the then USSR. There was little communication between the two groups, and countless theorems proven twice, most notably the seminal NP-complete papers of Cook and Levin. To understand more, I recommend the two articles about the early days of complexity by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1981.10005">Juris Hartmanis</a> and by <a href="https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.1984.10036">Boris Trakhtenbrot</a>.</p><p>Russia's invasion and relentless bombing in Ukraine have quickly separated the east and the west again. </p><p>Our first concern needs to be with Ukraine and its citizens. We hope for a quick end to this aggression and Ukraine remaining a free and democratic country. Ukrainian cities have undergone massive damage, and even in the best possible outcome it will take years if not decades to fully rebuild the country. </p><p>Terry Tao has been <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2022/03/02/resources-for-displaced-mathematicians/">collecting resources</a> for displaced mathematicians due to the crisis.</p><p>We've cut off ties with Russia institutions. In our world, major events to be held in Russia, including the <a href="https://www.mathunion.org/">International Congress of Mathematics</a> and the <a href="https://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/csr2022/">Computer Science in Russia</a> conference are being moved online. I was invited to workshops in St Petersburg in 2020 and 2021, both cancelled due to Covid, and was looking forward to one in 2022, which if it happens, will now happen without me. </p><p>The music world has has cancelled some stars, most notably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/arts/music/ukraine-putin-valery-gergiev-anna-netrebko.html">Valery Gergiev and Anna Netrebko</a>, due to their close ties to Putin. It's rare that we do the same to mathematicians for political reasons though <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/imus-non-controversial-changing-name-of.html">not unheard of</a>. I suspect most of our colleagues in Russia oppose the war in Ukraine, or would if they had accurate information of what was going on. I have several Russian friends and colleagues including <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/compressing-in-moscow.html">two I travelled to Moscow in 2019 to honor</a> and would hate to be disconnected from them.</p><p>It's way too early to know how this will all play out. Will we see a quick Russian retreat? Not likely. Will we see a situation that sees a mass migration of Ukranian and Russian mathematicians and computer scientists to Europe and North America, like in the 1990's? Possibly. We will see a repeat of the cold war, disconnected internets and science on both sides happening in isolation? I hope not but we can't rule it out.</p></div>

Neil L. is a leprechaun. He has been visiting me or Ken once every year since we started GLL. We had never seen a leprechaun before we began the blog—there must be some connection. </p>
<p>
Today we want to share the experience we each had with him this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.<br/>
<span id="more-19755"/></p>
<p>
That’s right—Neil visited both of us separately. Four years ago, when I had major heart surgery on St. Patrick’s Eve, Neil <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/03/17/leprechauns-know-what-it-feels/">came</a> to my previous New York apartment, grabbed a page of my notes, and took it to Ken. The past two years, Ken was on Zoom with me when Neil appeared. This time, Neil had a bone to pick with Ken—after posing a problem to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Neil’s Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Kathryn, my dear wife, and I are still in our new midtown Manhattan apartment after my procedure two weeks ago. She went to sleep in the bedroom, but I stayed up awaiting Neil’s arrival. I must have dozed off, but jolted awake to his laugh and the waft of his pipe’s green smoke.</p>
<p>
Neil said hi and explained right away that he had a problem. “A classic problem that leprechauns have faced forever.” I nodded to him and rubbed my eyes to be awake enough to listen. Neil continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The other day I was minding me business and I fell into a trap. Nasty fall. The trapper was an old foe of mine. She told me she had three wishes. And I was bound to grant them as usual. Sae much, sae normal. But then she breached the rules. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> No More Wishes </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Now I knew the rules of wishes, so Neil did not have to tell me: Must be about something contingent, not love or death, no self-transmogrification, and most of all—well, let’s hear it from the genie in Disney’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)">Aladdin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Three wishes, three. Uno, dos, tres, no substitutions, exchanges, or refunds, and ixnay on the wishing for more wishes.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/></font><p><font color="darkgreen">
Neil picked up his story: “Her first two wishes were:<br/>
</font> </p>
<ol>
<li>
A pot of gold coins. <p/>
</li><li>
Another pot of gold.
</li></ol>
<p><font color="darkgreen"/></p><font color="darkgreen">
<p>
Those were fair and I showed I could handle them forthwith. But then she asked for: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> ‘Please ten chirag oil lamps, each with a genie who can grant three wishes.’ </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This was terrible. It sent me to the lore. Ye cannot ask your servant for more wishes. Ye cannot involve another leprechaun. But lamps of themselves are just objects. That a <em>chirag</em> lamp has a genie is like an oyster has a pearl. Even if half the lamps be duds, that still  compounds the wishes—and she wished for ten that were not duds.”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Math and Myth </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Neil puffed a few more times, as if really expecting an answer from me. He even prompted, “What do ye think?” </p>
<p>
That sent me into befuddlement. Usually I try to engage Neil on a <em>math</em> problem, to trick him into telling the answer to Riemann or factoring or P=NP. But despite the “<img alt="{&gt; 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3E+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>” aspect, this wasn’t math—it was more about <em>myth</em>. Math I can take seriously, but with weighty matters personal and worldwide, I did not want to play “meta” games. </p>
<p>
Neil read my mind: “Nay, I assure ye—it be really about math. Even the Riemann—”</p>
<p>
That made me think: if Neil knew that it had real math content, he must know the answer already. No sense groping for it groggily. I just retorted: “I don’t want to guess the answer. Please just tell me.”</p>
<p>
“Ye know there be only one way I ever tell ye answers…”</p>
<p>
“Sure. OK.” I really wanted to join Kathryn for some sleep.</p>
<p>
I blinked as Neil vanished in green light. Only his pipe smoke remained, and it curled around into a shape I couldn’t place at first. It took awhile to become sharp enough that I could tell what it was:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/17/meta-wishes/greenzeta/" rel="attachment wp-att-19758"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19758" height="123" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GreenZeta.png?resize=60%2C123&amp;ssl=1" width="60"/></a></p>
<p/><h2> Myth and Math </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I, Ken, shall tell the rest. Ordinarily, I would have been eager to engage Neil again about the NCAA basketball tournaments. But I too am too touched by the same weighty matters, and quite forgot the day.</p>
<p>
My unawareness did not matter because Neil apparated and instantly started confronting me: “What gave ye the mickey to <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/14/are-these-the-last-digits-of-pi/">write</a> of mathematics being ’emergent’? Ye dinna even define it.”</p>
<p>
I had to concede I’d not only been vague but had analogized it too to two senses of “emergent” in philosophy. I started to explain: “It’s like Albert Einstein’s famous question, ‘Did God have a choice?’ among physical laws. Now about math…”</p>
<p>
Neil cut me off: “When Einstein said ‘God,’ he meant nature—but when <em>you</em> say it, you mean leprechauns. You are asking: ‘Do we leprechauns have the power to change mathematical truths in advance of your learning them?’ That’s our turf—!”</p>
<p>
I stammered that I had a right to pose the question and had not meant to insinuate. But Neil kept on: “If we really could change outcomes then what would <em>maths</em> rest on? On <em>myths</em> just as well. But where ye speak of <em>law</em>, we have <em>lore</em>. Established rules. And they suffice.”</p>
<p>
This was waxing cryptic and I thought bringing up Kurt Gödel would only make it more so. Neil sensed I was adrift and went on: “I shall inform ye via the same story I told Dick.”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Neil’s Solution </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Neil unfurled his story. At his same pause, one perception dawned on me: “Neil, did the lady’s wish imply a recursion—meaning the genies would be asked for a wish generator in the same proportion?”</p>
<p>
Neil nodded: “The lore says yes—the lore on hearing what is said. That is what I consulted it for. The rest I could work out on paper.” </p>
<p>
The paper part was easy up to a point. The wishes implied an infinite summation: the original <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then <img alt="{30}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> more of the ten genies, with the third wishes to each bringing <img alt="{30}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at the next level, for <img alt="{30 \cdot 10 = 300}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30+%5Ccdot+10+%3D+300%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> more wishes there, and so on. In sum, </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  3 + 30 + 300 + 3000 + \cdots = 3\cdot (1 + 10 + 100 + 1000 + \cdots) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3+%2B+30+%2B+300+%2B+3000+%2B+%5Ccdots+%3D+3%5Ccdot+%281+%2B+10+%2B+100+%2B+1000+%2B+%5Ccdots%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>wishes. Clearly the number of wishes is bounded by the series </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  3\cdot(1 + 10 + 3^{\log_2 10} + 100 + 5^{\log_2 10} + 6^{\log_2 10} + 7^{\log_2 10} + 1000 + \cdots) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%5Ccdot%281+%2B+10+%2B+3%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+100+%2B+5%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+6%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+7%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+1000+%2B+%5Ccdots%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Which equals <img alt="{3\cdot \zeta(-\log_2 10)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%5Ccdot+%5Czeta%28-%5Clog_2+10%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Without asking Neil how he’d computed that, I went to an <a href="https://solvemymath.com/online_math_calculator/number_theory/riemann_function/index.php">online</a> zeta <a href="https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1180573439">calculator</a> and obtained a bounding total of </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  3\cdot 0.006023525392866159581193... \;\;= \;\;+0.018070576178598478743579... " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%5Ccdot+0.006023525392866159581193...+%5C%3B%5C%3B%3D+%5C%3B%5C%3B%2B0.018070576178598478743579...+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>wishes. Neil puffed and chortled and finished his story:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “So the unlucky lass had wished herself into wishing a grand total of less than one-fiftieth of a wish. Since only whole wishes can be honoured, this sprang me from the trap and kept me both me pots o’ gold to boot. I gave her one coin as a peace offering.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I joined the laughter for just a moment. This followed mathematical rules but outlandishly, and I groped for the point. But Neil supplied it directly:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Some of your fellow travelers have felt reaching answers by non-constructive methods to be less outlandish only in degree not kind. If ye later apprehend the answer by calculation—which is what your post styled as “emergent” knowledge—then it must be exactly the same object previously described non-constructively. Thus in the realms ye ascribed to us wee folk, we are the guardians and gatekeepers of truth, not the forgers of it.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Neil tipped his hat and simply faded out—no green smoke for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Can Neil’s zeta-function calculations insulate against any attempt at recursively gaining infinite wishes? The zeta function whips up and down in tune with the Bernoulli numbers, but the leprechauns do have freedom to choose a bounding series. Or is there an infinite series scheme that rises above 3 wishes even so? We hope this has given some St. Patrick’s Day diversion.</p>

    <summary>Here’s a silly but probably new proof that the harmonic series diverges (\(\mathbb{M}\)). The expected number of comparisons used by randomized quicksort on an input of size \(n\) is at most \(2nH_n\), where \(H_n\) is the \(n\)th partial sum of the harmonic series (see Cormen et al, Introduction to Algorithms, Chapter 7). However, every comparison sorting algorithm requires at least \(\log_2n!=n\log_2n-O(n)\) comparisons, by the standard decision tree argument (Cormen et al, Section 8.1). Therefore, \(H_n=\Omega(\log n)\).</summary>

    <title>Differentially private deep learning can be effective with self-supervised models</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Differential Privacy (DP) is a formal definition of privacy which guarantees that the outcome of a statistical procedure does not vary much regardless of whether an individual input is included or removed from the training dataset. 
This guarantee is desirable when we are tasked to train machine learning models on private datasets that should not memorize individual inputs. 
Past works have shown that differentially private models can be resilient to strong membership inference [<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kairouz15.html">1</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9519424">34</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/fc4ddc15f9f4b4b06ef7844d6bb53abf-Abstract.html">35</a>] and data reconstruction attacks [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/carlini">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12383">3</a>] when the privacy parameter is set to be sufficiently small. 
See a <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/how-to-deploy-ml-with-dp/">prior post</a> for more background on differentially private machine learning.</p>

<p>Yet, in practice, most attempts at training differentially private deep learning models on moderately-sized datasets have resulted in large performance drops compared to when training without privacy-protection baked in. 
These performance drops are oftentimes large enough to discourage the adoption of differential privacy protection into machine learning pipelines altogether.</p>

<p>To provide a reference of the potential performance hit, the authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12677">5</a>] trained a ResNet-20 from scratch on CIFAR-10 with a privacy budget of \(\epsilon=8\) that has test accuracy barely over 62% (see their Table 1). 
Contrast this with the 8.75% error rate (91.25% accuracy) reported for training the same architecture without enforcing differential privacy [<a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html">6</a>]. 
While some works report private learning results better than the above, absent additional data, pre-training, or external knowledge, most improvements have been incremental, and the test accuracy for CIFAR-10 models trained under modest privacy leakage (\(\epsilon=3\)) has roughly settled to ~70% in the literature [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>].</p>

<p>One reason behind the performance drop lies in sample efficiency — differentially private learning generally requires much more data than non-private learning to reach an acceptable level of performance. 
This also means that learning the high-level features (e.g., syntactic structure in text, edge detectors for images) necessary to perform specific tasks with private data can be much more sample-costly.</p>

<p>This blog post surveys results that leverage public self-supervised pre-training to obtain high-performing models through differentially private fine-tuning.
The pre-train-fine-tune paradigm is straightforward to execute and results in high-performing models under modest privacy budgets for many standard computer vision and natural language processing tasks. 
Moreover, existing results have shown that private fine-tuning consistently benefits from improvements in public pre-training.</p>

<h2 id="self-supervised-pre-training">Self-Supervised Pre-Training</h2>

<p>Self-supervised learning is a paradigm which leverages unlabeled data to learn representations that can be useful for a range of downstream tasks.
Since self-supervised learning doesn’t target specific tasks itself, 
the (pre-)training procedure doesn’t require labeled data — in many cases, mildly curated unlabeled data is sufficient for self-supervised pre-training to produce models for subsequent fine-tuning. 
So far, there have been two broadly successful instantiations of this learning paradigm in computer vision [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chen20j.html">9</a>] and natural language processing [<a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf">7</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">8</a>]. 
We recap the two approaches below.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Contrastive pre-training for vision:</strong> 
One class of self-supervised methods in computer vision (SimCLR, [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chen20j.html">9</a>]) performs pre-training through contrastive learning. 
Algorithms of this type produce embeddings for images with the goal of creating different embeddings for semantically different images and similar embeddings for similar ones. 
Concretely, the algorithm used in SimCLR forces models to produce similar embeddings for an image and its augmented siblings (e.g., image rotated by some degrees), 
and different embeddings for separate images (and their augmentations). 
The SimCLR framework with large scale models and compute led to state-of-the-art (non-private) ImageNet fine-tuning results at the time of its writing.</p>

<p><strong>Masked language modeling and autoregressive language modeling for text:</strong> 
Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Auto-regressive Language Modeling (ALM) are two self-supervised pre-training approaches. 
While the former asks models to predict deliberately masked out tokens from a piece of text, the latter asks models to simply predict the next token in a sequence. 
With large amounts of unlabeled text data, large and expressive Transformer models [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Abstract.html">24</a>], and lots of compute, both approaches produce powerful models that are good starting points for downstream fine-tuning. 
For instance, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT, [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">8</a>]), produced state-of-the-art (non-private) results (at the time) for a large collection of language understanding tasks when fine-tuned on each.</p>

<h2 id="fine-tuning-self-supervised-models-with-dp-optimization">Fine-Tuning Self-Supervised Models With DP-Optimization</h2>
<p>Self-supervised pre-training is appealing in the context of differentially private machine learning. 
This is because (i) the mildly curated data needed for pre-training can usually be obtained cheaply from the public domain, and (ii) pre-trained models may contain useful domain knowledge that can reduce the sample complexity of subsequent private learning. 
A paradigm for private learning that leverages self-supervised pre-training could follow two steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collect cheap and public (unlabeled) data from the task domain (e.g., vision, language, etc.) to pre-train a model with self-supervised learning, and</li>
  <li>collect moderate amounts of task-specific private (labeled) data and fine-tune the pre-trained model under differential privacy to perform the task.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>To date, some of the best differentially private deep learning results in the literature have resulted from instantiating this paradigm [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06500">12</a>].
Below, we review works which capitalize on self-supervised pre-training by differentially privately fine-tuning pre-trained models with an iterative gradient method like DP-SGD [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978318">19</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6736861">20</a>].<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
<img alt="" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/fine-tuning-paradigm.png"/></p>

<p><strong>Private fine-tuning with SimCLR features:</strong> 
The authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>] fine-tuned a linear model on top of the embedding vectors produced by SimCLRv2 from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Under a privacy budget of \(\epsilon=2\), 
these models reached an average test accuracy of 92.7%. This number can be further improved to ~94% with the use of larger and wider pre-trained models in the SimCLRv2 family.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> 
These test accuracies are very close to some standard non-private results attained by an off-the-shelf ResNet architecture [<a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html">6</a>].</p>

<p><strong>Privately fine-tuning BERT variants and GPT-2:</strong> 
The authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06500">12</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yu21f.html">16</a>] showed that with appropriate hyper-parameters, fine-tuning BERT variants and GPT-2 with DP-optimization results in high-performing private models for text classification and language generation — even on datasets of modest sizes and under modest privacy budgets. 
Notably, some of these models attain a task performance close to non-private models from previous years in the literature. 
These results also exceed many non-private learning results from the pre-BERT and pre-GPT years.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>More interestingly, the authors showed that the larger (and thus better) the pre-trained model, the better the private fine-tuning performance gets. 
This empirical observation in private fine-tuning of large Transformers is qualitatively different from what’s implied by the usual minimax optimal rates derived for vanilla private learning with convex loss functions under approximate differential privacy [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6979031">14</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/3bd8fdb090f1f5eb66a00c84dbc5ad51-Abstract.html">15</a>]. 
This discrepancy between experimental results for training large models and the theory for learning with convex losses suggests there is more to be understood.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Overall, for both vision and language tasks, private learning performance has consistently improved with the improvement in the quality of pre-training, 
where the latter is measured by the non-private fine-tuning performance.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-outlook">Conclusion and Outlook</h2>

<p>We surveyed recent works in the literature that obtained highly performant private machine learning models leveraging self-supervised pre-training. 
Common to these results is the trend that the performance of private learning consistently improved with the quality of public pre-training. 
We therefore anticipate that the general paradigm may be useful in additional settings (e.g., federated learning) and tasks (e.g., private synthetic image generation), and lead to better private learning results.</p>

<p>We have thus far assumed that the data for public pre-training can be cheaply obtained.
This, however, does not imply that determining whether a particular source of data is appropriate for public pre-training is an easy problem.
Using publicly available data is not necessarily risk-free in terms of privacy.
For instance, the authors of [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/carlini-extracting">33</a>] were able to extract personally identifiable information from a GPT-2 model pre-trained on data scraped from the public internet.</p>

<p>Self-supervised pre-training has led to progress in private deep learning, but leveraging pre-trained models alone will not address several fundamental challenges to differentially private learning.
First and foremost, the datasets of machine learning tasks may be sampled from long-tailed distributions [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1e14bfe2714193e7af5abc64ecbd6b46-Abstract.html">21</a>]. 
When privately trained on such datasets, a machine learning model may fail to acquire the learning signal necessary to perform accurate predictions for examples on the tail [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445934">28</a>] or from underrepresented (sub)populations [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/fc0de4e0396fff257ea362983c2dda5a-Abstract.html">29</a>]. 
Second, many machine learning problems are in a domain where public data (even unlabeled data) may be sparse, e.g., medical imaging. 
Developing refined versions of the pre-train-fine-tune approach for problems from these domains is an interesting avenue for future work.</p>

<p>Lastly, differential privacy as one specific definition of privacy may not capture all that’s desired for privacy in reality. 
For instance, while differentially private algorithms naturally give machine unlearning guarantees [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9519428">30</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7163042">32</a>], tailored unlearning algorithms tend to have higher capacities of unlearning [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/9627c45df543c816a3ddf2d8ea686a99-Abstract.html">31</a>].
In addition, what constitutes a record in the differential privacy framework can oftentimes be unclear. 
Inappropriately defined example boundaries can create correlated records which cause differential privacy guarantees to degrade [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01508">22</a>].
Moreover, differential privacy guarantees won’t directly prevent the inference of private data outside the original context [<a href="https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/washlr79&amp;section=16">23</a>]. 
These are fundamental limitations of differential privacy which improvements to differentially private learning won’t touch on.</p>

While some showed that using more filters in a convolutional network can degrade the performance of private learning after some threshold [<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJg851rYwH">27</a>], others showed that a larger model can outperform a smaller model from a different model family [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>]. Note these results are conditioned on their particular hyperparameter choices. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:6">↩</a></p>

    <li id="fn:7">
      <p>Since the pre-training data for large language models are oftentimes collected through large scale web scraping (e.g., WebText), a common concern is that some training and test instances for downstream tasks may already appear in the pre-training data. Self-supervised pre-training therefore can give models an opportunity to “see” this data even before they are privately fine-tuned. Authors of [<a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">17</a>] confirmed that there is a 1-6% overlap between the test set of many natural language processing tasks and the pre-training data they collected (WebText); these common tasks, however, don’t include those studied by authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>]. The numbers suggest a possibility that existing private fine-tuning results in the literature could be slightly inflated compared to when the pre-training data didn’t contain any instance for any downstream task for which evaluation was performed. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:7">↩</a></p>

    <title>Problem X won't be solved in MY lifetime- but what about...</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>1) In 1989 on the episde The Royale of Star Trek: The Next Generation (which takes place in the far future)  Captain Picard is working on Fermat's last theorem which he says quite explicitly is still open.</p><p>When I saw the episode I asked Larry Washington, a Number Theorist at Univ of MD, when he thought FLT would be solved. He said</p><p>                                      <i>It will be solved within the next 10 years.</i></p><p>And indeed- Wiles solved it in 1993-sort of. There was a flaw in the proof which he fixed in 1994 with the help of his former student Richard Taylor. Wiles published the correction to the flaw in 1995, so we will date it as having been solved in 1995. Larry Washington was correct.  And in an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in 1995 (episode name:Facets) Dax says that a previous host, Tobin Dax, had done the most creative work on FLT since Wiles. Maybe Tobin wrote this limerick:</p><p>A challenge for many long ages</p><p>Had baffled the savants and sages</p><p>Yet at last came the light</p><p>Seems that Fermat was right</p><p>To the margin add 200 pages.</p><p><br/></p><p>I asked Larry W when he thought Riemann would be solved. He said  </p><p>                   <i> In your lifetime but not in mine.</i></p><p>He is about 10 years older than I am and I think we are both in good health. This seems like a rather precise prediction so I am skeptical. But he did get FLT right...</p><p>2) In class I sometimes say things like </p><p><i>I do not think Quantum Computers will factor faster than classical in my lifetime. </i></p><p><i>I do not think P vs NP will be solved in my lifetime.</i></p><p><i>I can imagine P=BPP will be proven in my lifetime. (I said that 10 years ago. I am less imaginative now.) </i></p><p><i>I hope the muffin problem is solved in my lifetime (it was, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08726">here</a>).</i></p><p>I didn't quite think about the difference in my age and the students until recently when I was working with Ilya Hajiaghayi (Mohammd H's 9 year old son) on cryptography and he said </p><p><i>In your recorded lecture you said you don't think quantum computers will be a threat to cryptography  in your lifetime. What about in my lifetime?</i></p><p>Indeed- his lifetime and mine are rather far apart. </p><p>I am reminded that one of the answers to my P vs NP poll made the point that while we have some sense of what will happen in the next 10 years, maybe even 20, math and life can change so much that conjectures beyond that are guesswork. Any  prediction for x years from now you should have confidence &lt; 1/ln(x) of it being true.</p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><br/></p></div>
