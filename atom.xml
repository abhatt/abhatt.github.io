    <title>TR19-114 |  Singular tuples of matrices is not a null cone (and, the symmetries of algebraic varieties) | 

	Visu Makam, 

	Avi Wigderson</title>
    <summary>The following multi-determinantal algebraic variety plays a central role in algebra, algebraic geometry and computational complexity theory: ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$, consisting of all $m$-tuples of $n\times n$ complex matrices which span only singular matrices. In particular, an efficient deterministic algorithm testing membership in ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$ will imply super-polynomial circuit lower bounds, a holy grail of the theory of computation.
  A sequence of recent works suggests such efficient algorithms for memberships in a general class of algebraic varieties, namely the null cones of linear group actions. Can this be used for the problem above? Our main result is negative: ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$ is not the null cone of any (reductive) group action! This stands in stark contrast to a non-commutative analog of this variety, and points to an inherent structural difficulty of ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$.
  To prove this result we identify precisely the group of symmetries of ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$. We find this characterization, and the tools we introduce to prove it, of independent interest. Our work significantly generalizes a result of Frobenius for the special case $m=1$, and suggests a general method for determining the symmetries of algebraic varieties.</summary>

Farber also
established a number of different characterisations for this class of graphs.
These include an intersection graph characterisation that is analogous to a
similar characterisation for chordal graphs. Seker et al. exploited this
characterisation of chordal graphs to obtain an algorithm for generating them.
In this paper, we propose an algorithm to show that strongly chordal graphs can
also be generated using their intersection graph characterisation.

    <title>A Simple Reduction for Full-Permuted Pattern Matching Problems on Multi-Track Strings</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1567814400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Barton:Carl.html">Carl Barton</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Birney:Ewan.html">Ewan Birney</a>, Tomas Fitzgerald <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02364">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we study a variant of string pattern matching which deals with
tuples of strings known as \textit{multi-track strings}. Multi-track strings
are a generalisation of strings (or \textit{single-track strings}) that have
primarily found uses in problems related to searching multiple genomes and
music information retrieval
\cite{Lemstrom:2003:MPS:175<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/6553.17565">6553.17565</a>71,Lemstrom:2003:TIP:96<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/7792.96779">7792.96779</a>3}. There
is a \textit{full-permuted-match} between two multi-track strings if given two
multi-track strings (multi-sets of strings) $\mathcal{T} = (t_1, t_2,\ldots ,
t_N)$ and $ \mathcal{P} = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_N)$ such that $| p_1 | = | p_2 |
= \ldots = | p_N | = | t_1 | = | t_2 | = \ldots = | t_N |$, then there is a
full-permuted-match between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ if $\mathcal{P} =
(t_{r_1}, t_{r_2},\ldots , t_{r_n})$ for some permutation $(r_1,\ldots,r_N)$ of
$(1,\ldots,N)$, we denote this $\mathcal{P}\asymp\mathcal{T}$.
</p>
<p>Efficient algorithms for some full-permuted match problems on multi-track
strings have recently been presented
\cite{Hendrian_2019,PSC2016-2,10.1007/978-3-642-35843-2_25}. In this paper we
show a reduction from multi-track strings of length $n$ with alphabet size
$\sigma_U$ to single-track strings of length $2n-1$ with alphabet size
$\sigma_U^N$. Through this reduction we allow any string matching algorithm to
be used on multi-track string problems using $\asymp$ as the match relation.

in flow fields where the FIFO (first-in-first-out) assumption is violated. This
problem variant is important for autonomous vehicles in the ocean, for example,
that cannot arbitrarily hover in a fixed position and that are strongly
influenced by time-varying ocean currents. Although polynomial-time solutions
are available for discrete-time problems, the continuous-time non-FIFO case is
NP-hard with no known relevant special cases. Our main result is to show that
this problem can be solved in polynomial time if the edge travel time functions
are piecewise-constant, agreeing with existing worst-case bounds for FIFO
problems with restricted slopes. We present a minimum-time algorithm for graphs
that allows for paths with finite-length cycles, and then embed this algorithm
within an asymptotically optimal sampling-based framework to find time-optimal
paths in flows. The algorithm relies on an efficient data structure to
represent and manipulate piecewise-constant functions and is straightforward to
implement. We illustrate the behaviour of the algorithm in an example based on
a common ocean vortex model in addition to simpler graph-based examples.

manufacturing (3D printing), is widely known for its capability of programming
post-fabrication shape-changing into artifacts. Fused deposition modeling
(FDM)-based 4D printing, in particular, uses thermoplastics to produce
artifacts and requires computational analysis to assist the design processes of
complex geometries. However, these artifacts are weak against structural loads,
and the design quality can be limited by less accurate material models and
numerical simulations. To address these issues, this paper propounds a
composite structure design made of two materials - polylactic acid (PLA) and
carbon fiber reinforced PLA (CFPLA) - to increase the structural strength of 4D
printed artifacts and a workflow composed of several physical experiments and
series of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to characterize materials. We apply
this workflow to 3D printed samples fabricated with different printed
parameters to accurately characterize the materials and implement a sequential
finite element analysis (FEA) to achieve accurate simulations. The accuracy of
our method is both computationally and experimentally verified with several
creative design examples and is measured to be at least 95\%. We believe the
presented workflow is essential to the combination of geometry, material
mechanism and design, and has various potential applications.

Problem of linear codes over $\mathbb F_2$, which can be stated as follows:
given a generator matrix $\mathbf A$ and an integer $k$, determine whether the
code generated by $\mathbf A$ has distance at most $k$, or in other words,
whether there is a nonzero vector $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\mathbf A \mathbf{x}$
has at most $k$ nonzero coordinates. The question of whether $k$-Even Set is
fixed parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the distance $k$ has been
repeatedly raised in literature; in fact, it is one of the few remaining open
questions from the seminal book of Downey and Fellows (1999). In this work, we
show that $k$-Even Set is W[1]-hard under randomized reductions. We also
consider the parameterized $k$-Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), in which we are
given a lattice whose basis vectors are integral and an integer $k$, and the
goal is to determine whether the norm of the shortest vector (in the $\ell_p$
norm for some fixed $p$) is at most $k$. Similar to $k$-Even Set, understanding
the complexity of this problem is also a long-standing open question in the
field of Parameterized Complexity. We show that, for any $p &gt; 1$, $k$-SVP is
W[1]-hard to approximate (under randomized reductions) to some constant factor.

    <title>Transitioning</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You may have noticed, or not, that I haven't posted or tweeted much in the last month. I've had a busy time moving back to Chicago and starting my new position as Dean of the College of Science at Illinois Tech.<br/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Part of that trip involved driving my electric Chevy Bolt from Atlanta to Chicago. You can do it, but it got a bit nerve wracking. There is only one high-speed charging station between Indianapolis and Chicago and you pray the charger outside the Lafayette Walmart actually works (it did). We passed many Tesla charging superstations, I will have to admit they have the better network. </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Theoremwise, Ryan Alweiss, Shachar Lovett, Kewen Wu and Jiapeng Zhang had <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/amazing-ryan-alweiss-shachar-lovett-kewen-wu-jiapeng-zhang-made-dramatic-progress-on-the-sunflower-conjecture/">significant improvements on the sunflower conjecture</a>. I posted on the sunflower theorem for Richard Rado's <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/04/richard-rado-1906-1989.html">centenary</a>. Nice to see there is still some give in it.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I probably will post less often in this new position. Bill asked me "Why is being a dean (or maybe its just the move) more time then being a chair? Were you this busy when you moved and first became chair?"<br/>
<br/>
When I moved to Atlanta, I moved a year ahead of the rest of the family and rented a condo. We had plenty of time to search for a house in Atlanta and plan the move. Here it all happened in a much more compressed time schedule and, since we've bought a condo, into a much more compressed space.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Being a chair certainly ate up plenty of time but it feels different as dean with a more external focus. I won't give up the blog but you'll probably hear a lot more from Bill than from me at least in the near future.</div></div>

    <title>TR19-113 |  Instance Complexity and Unlabeled Certificates in the Decision Tree Model | 

	Tomer Grossman, 

	Ilan Komargodski, 

	Moni Naor</title>
    <summary>Instance complexity is a measure of goodness of an algorithm in which the performance of one algorithm is compared to others per input. This is in sharp contrast to worst-case and average-case complexity measures, where the performance is compared either on the worst input or on an average one, respectively.

  We initiate the systematic study of instance complexity and optimality in the query model (a.k.a. the decision tree model). In this model, instance optimality of an algorithm for computing a function is the requirement that the complexity of an algorithm on any input is at most a constant factor larger than the complexity of the best correct algorithm. That is we compare the decision tree to one that receives a certificate and its complexity is measured only if the certificate is correct (but correctness should hold on any input).  We study both deterministic and randomized decision trees and provide various characterizations and barriers for more general results.

  We introduce a new measure of complexity called unlabeled-certificate complexity, appropriate for graph properties and other functions with symmetries, where information about the structure of the graph is given as a certificate, but not labels of individual vertices. More precisely, the certificate is some permutation of the input (rather than the input itself) and the correctness should be maintained even if the certificate is wrong. We study both worst case complexity and instance optimality with respect to this measure of complexity. In this setting an algorithm is said to be instance optimal if for every input it performs roughly as well as the best algorithm that is given an unlabeled certificate (but is correct on every input).  We show that instance optimality depends on the group of permutations in consideration. Our proofs rely on techniques from hypothesis testing and analysis of random graphs.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A comparatively slow month, as summer draws to a close: we found three papers online. Please let us know if we missed any!</p>



<p><strong>Testing convexity of functions over finite domains</strong>, by Aleksandrs Belovs, Eric Blais, and Abhinav Bommireddi (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/092/">arXiv</a>). This paper studies the classic problem of convexity testing, and proves a number of interesting results on the adaptive and non-adaptive complexity of this problem in single- and multi-dimensional settings. In the single-dimensional setting on domain \([n]\), they show that adaptivity doesn’t help: the complexity will be \(O(\log n)\) in both cases. However, in the simplest two-dimensional setting, a domain of \([3] \times [n]\), they give a polylogarithmic upper bound in the adaptive setting, but a polynomial lower bound in the non-adaptive setting, showing a strong separation. Finally, they provide a lower bound for \([n]^d\) which scales exponentially in the dimension. This leaves open the tantalizing open question: is it possible to avoid the curse of dimensionality when testing convexity?</p>



<p><strong>Testing Isomorphism in the Bounded-Degree Graph Model</strong>, by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/102/">ECCC</a>). This work investigates the problem of testing isomorphism of graphs, focusing on the special case when the connected components are only polylogarithmically large (the general bounded-degree case is left open). One can consider when a graph is given as input, and we have to query a graph to test if they are isomorphic. This can be shown to be equivalent (up to polylogarithmic factors) to testing (from queries) whether a sequence is a permutation of a reference sequence. In turn, this can be shown to be equivalent to the classic distribution testing question of testing (from samples) whether a distribution is equal to some reference distribution. The same sequence of equivalences <em>almost</em> works for the case where there is no reference graph/sequence/distribution, but we only have query/query/sample access to the object. The one exception is that the reduction doesn’t work to reduce from testing distributions to testing whether a sequence is a permutation, due to challenges involving sampling with and without replacement. However, the author still shows the lower bound which would be implied by such a reduction by adapting Valiant’s proof for the distribution testing problem to this case.   </p>



<p><strong>Learning Very Large Graphs with Unknown Vertex Distributions</strong>, by Gábor Elek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10170">arXiv</a>). In this note, the author studies a variant of distribution-free property testing on graphs, in which (roughly) neighboring vertices have probabilities of bounded ratio, and a query reveals this ratio. Applications to local graph algorithms and connections to dynamical systems are also discussed.</p>



<p>EDIT: We apparently missed one paper from June — please check out the following paper, recently accepted to NeurIPS 2019.<br/><strong>The Broad Optimality of Profile Maximum Likelihood</strong>, by Yi Hao and Alon Orlitsky (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10170">arXiv</a>). Recently, Acharya, Das, Orlitsky, and Suresh (ICML 2017) showed that the Profile Maximum Likelihood (PML) estimator enables a unified framework for estimating a number of distribution properties, including support size, support coverage, entropy, and distance to uniformity, obtaining estimates which are competitive with the best possible. The approach is rather clean: simply estimate the PML of the distribution (i.e., the maximum likelihood distribution of the data, if the the labels are discarded and only the multiplicities of elements are kept), and apply the plug-in estimator (i.e., if you want to estimate entropy, compute the entropy of the resulting PML distribution). The present work shows that PML is even more broadly applicable — such an approach applies to <em>any</em> property which is additive, symmetric, and appropriately Lipschitz. They also show specific results for many other properties which have been considered in the past, including Rényi entropy, distribution estimation, and identity testing.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Microsoft Powerpoint has a surprisingly powerful equation editor, which also allows to use latex macros such as <code>\alpha </code>to get <img alt="\alpha" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\alpha"/>. </p>



<p>I’ve blogged about the equation editor <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2013/01/31/alt-equals/">before</a> but one pet peeve of mine was that I like to have my math in a different color, but never found a way to do this automatically. I finally decided to invest the time and find out how to do it. After a mere several years of investigation, I am happy to report that it is in fact possible to do so using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). </p>

<p>
Avrim Blum is the CAO for TTIC. That is he is the Chief Academic Officer at the Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago. Avrim has and continues to make key contributions to many areas of theory—including machine learning, approximation algorithms, on-line algorithms, algorithmic game theory, the theory of database privacy, and non-worst-case analysis of algorithms. </p>
<p>
Today I want to discuss a suggestion of Avrim for research on self-play.</p>
<p>
Self-play is the key to many recent AI results on playing games. These results include essentially solving the games Chess, Go, Shogi, forms of poker, and many others. They were solved by algorithms that start with no knowledge of the game, save the rules. The algorithm then learn the secrets of playing the game by self-play: by playing games against itself. For example, the AI chess programs did not know that “a rook is worth more than a pawn.” But they discover that by playing the game over and over. Impressive. </p>
<p>
For example, David Sweet on his hacker <a href="https://hackernoon.com/self-play-1f69ceb06a4d">site</a> says referring to self-play: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This is mysterious to me. If it only played against itself, where did new information come from? How did it know if it was doing well? If I play a game of chess against myself, should I say I did well if I beat myself? But when I beat myself, I also lose to myself. And how could I ever know if I’d do well against someone else? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Planted Clique Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I was at TTIC last month and over lunch we discussed self-play possibilities for theory problems. I suggested that the planted clique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planted_clique">problem</a> might be a potential example. Recall the planted clique problem is the task of distinguishing two types of graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Random graphs on <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> vertices generated with <img alt="{p=1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p=1/2}"/>, the probability that there is an edge between each pair of nodes; <p/>
</li><li>
Random graphs on <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> vertices generated with <img alt="{p=1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p=1/2}"/>, with a clique of size <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> added, the planted clique.
</li></ul>
<p>
If <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> is large, it is easy to tell these apart—just count the number of edges. If <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> is small enough, it is open if one can tell them apart. The largest clique in a random graph typically has size near <img alt="{k=2\log_{2} n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D2%5Clog_%7B2%7D+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k=2\log_{2} n}"/>. This implies that there is a quasi-polynomial time average-case algorithm: just try all subsets of size around <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>.</p>
<p>
My intuition was that a program might be able to exploit self-play to solve planted clique problems. The point is that it is easy, by definition, to generate “yes” and “no” examples for this problem. Note, this is not known for SAT problems—generating hard instances there is not clear. This was my point. Could the AI methods somehow divine the planted clique version of “a rook is worth more than a pawn”? Could they use self-play to solve planted clique problems?</p>
<p>
I wondered to the lunch group about all this. It left the group unexcited. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ramsey Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Then Avrim asked a better question. He wondered if self-play methods could be used to solve a long standing problem concerning Ramsey numbers. Recall the Ramsey number <img alt="{R(s,s)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28s%2Cs%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(s,s)}"/> is defined as the smallest <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> such every red-green coloring of the edges of the complete graph <img alt="{K_{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{n}}"/> has either a red or a green subgraph of size at least <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/>.</p>
<p>
The exact value of <img alt="{R(5, 5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C+5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(5, 5)}"/> is unknown, although it is known to lie between <img alt="{43}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{43}"/> and <img alt="{48}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B48%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{48}"/>. See a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/r55">post</a> by Gil Kalai on his blog for some discussions. Joel Spencer quotes Paul Erdős: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Erdős asks us to imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us, landing on Earth and demanding the value of <img alt="{R(5, 5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C+5%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(5, 5)}"/> or they will destroy our planet. In that case, he claims, we should marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find the value. But suppose, instead, that they ask for <img alt="{R(6, 6)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%286%2C+6%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(6, 6)}"/>. In that case, he believes, we should attempt to destroy the aliens.	 </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Aliens are not attacking currently, but Avrim’s idea is that perhaps we could organize a self-play attack on the <img alt="{R(5,5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(5,5)}"/> problem. The idea would be to try to build a “game” version of this question. The algorithm would try to create a strategy that finds a red/green coloring for the complete graph so that no <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5}"/>-clique is all red or all green. </p>
<p>
We need to arrange the computation of the Ramsey number as the result of some type of game. The paradox to me is that the play of a game suggests <img alt="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPSPACE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}"/>, while the Ramsey calculation is clearly of complexity <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>. So how do we make the Ramsey calculation into a game? Ken and I wonder if there is a natural game <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> so that playing the game well yields insight into the value of a Ramsey number.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Is there a game <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> with simple rules so that playing it well yields bounds on general Ramsey numbers?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Attacks on Ramsey Numbers </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There have been several attempts to use non-standard methods to compute Ramsey numbers. See the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
In this <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-013-0541-9">article</a>, quantum methods studied for the future, when hopefully quantum computers will be available. <p/>
</li><li>
In this <a href="https://themusegarden.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/a-genetic-algorithm-approach-to-ramsey-theory/">project</a> genetic methods are used on related Ramsey numbers. <p/>
</li><li>
In this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01613.pdf">approach</a>, AI methods are used on related Ramsey numbers.
</li></ul>
<p>
See also this <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0662/893d7e04745a0709b3f1a092574f9dd3bf7b.pdf">survey</a> on computational methods in general.</p>
<p>
The asymmetry between the upper and lower bounds shapes approaches. The lower bound of 43 was proved by finding a two-coloring of the edges of <img alt="{K_{42}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7B42%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{42}}"/> without a green or red <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5}"/>-clique. Once a single coloring is guessed its property is easy to prove. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08768">improvement</a> of the upper bound from 49 to 48 two years ago <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/r55">needed</a> checking two trillion cases in order to fence-away all possible colorings. This has led to a common belief that 43 is the answer—if it were higher then a coloring of <img alt="{K_{43}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7B43%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{43}}"/> would have been found by now.</p>
<p>
Can we use self-play to turn this belief into something more concrete? The training would begin on running self-play on the known cases <img alt="{\dots 38,39,40,41,42}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots+38%2C39%2C40%2C41%2C42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots 38,39,40,41,42}"/>. This should create a neural net that is highly skilled at finding colorings that are free of small monochrome cliques. The question is how to leverage its presumed failure once we hit size <img alt="{43}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{43}"/>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Perhaps someone should take Avrim’s suggestion and try it out. A natural idea would be to see if this approach could compute the known smaller Ramsey numbers—getting their exact upper bounds. </p>

    <title>Happy New Academic Year:  Teaching Randomized Algorithms</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It seems I haven't written on this blog for a while.<br/><br/>Today was the start of a new semester.  I'll be teaching Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis, using the new edition of my book with Eli Upfal as a base, and throwing in other material.  (Everyone should buy the book!  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/110715488X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=michaelmitzen-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=110715488X&amp;linkId=d598fb636637ebb656410099e7042a7c">Here's a link</a>.)  <br/><br/>It's a graduate level class, but generally designed for first year graduate students, and there were a lot of undergrads "shopping" it today.  (We don't do pre-registration at Harvard, and students get the first week to choose classes, known as shopping.)  So many that people were standing out the doors of the room.  But because we have a bit of a shortage of classes this semester, I'm guessing there's a good fraction of students just checking it out.  We'll see Thursday, but for now I'll predict we'll fit in the classroom, and wait to see if I'm wrong.  (If I'm wrong, that's wonderful too.)    <br/><br/>It's been four years since I last taught the course, so this time I'm trying something new.  When I've previously taught the course, I tried to make the class inviting and friendly by telling the class we'd begin without assuming the class knew probability, and so the first couple of weeks would be reviewing basics (like, say, linearity of expectations and union bounds), albeit in a CS algorithms context.  This time, I let the class know I'm assuming they know (or will pick up) basic probability, and so they should read chapters 1-4 on their own, and we'll start with Chapter 5, Balls and Bins models.  Over the last decade, I've seen a huge shift in probability knowledge -- Stat 110, Harvard's probability course, has become one of Harvard's biggest classes.  Many students have already taking AI or ML or even data science courses where they've done some (further) probability.  It feels appropriate (and safe) to assume people entering in the class know probability, or can review what they need on their own, and start the class further along.<br/><br/>Now finally, a request.  It's actually hard for me to teach when using this book, because I don't want to just read the book to the students.  That's boring.  On the other hand, if I thought something was important, I most likely already put it in the book.  We have to mix up the standard lecturing format a bit.  So two things we'll be doing are<br/><br/>1)  doing some "puzzle problems" at the beginning of most classes, so people can try to solve problems.  (Kind of a flipped classroom approach, but not a full commitment.)<br/>2)  reading papers, related to the class topics.<br/><br/>So if you have any good suggestions of probability puzzle problems, or readable papers (particularly application papers) that use relatively basic probabilistic analysis in neat ways, send them over.  I've got a semester to fill.<br/><br/>For curious people, here's one of today's starting problems, which I first learned about in graduate school.  (I'm pretty sure I owe thanks to Claire Kenyon for teaching it.  I'll link to the corresponding Wikipedia page on the problem maybe later.)<br/><br/>After lunch, Bob suggests the following game to see who pays.  Alice and Bob will each choose a different sequence of three flips.  (So they could choose "Heads-Tails-Heads'', or "Tails-Tails-Tails'' for example.)  After they choose, a fair coin will be tossed until one of their sequences appears as a consecutive subsequence of the coin tosses.  The player whose sequence appears first wins. (Note that if they choose the above sequences, and if the flips come up Heads-Tails-Tails-Tails, the player that chose Tails-Tails-Tails would win as soon as their subsequence appears;  it's not three flips, then start over again.)  Bob politely says that Alice can choose first, and after she chooses and tells him her sequence he'll choose a different sequence.  What should Alice choose?</div>

    <title>Can Mathematicians Fix Iphones? Can anyone?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
In my last post I noted that if I am asked (since I am a CS prof)<br/>
<br/>
<i>Can you fix my iphone</i><br/>
<br/>
is<br/>
<br/>
<i>No, I work on the math side of CS</i><br/>
<br/>
Some readers emailed me (I told them to comment instead but they were worried that other readers would argue with them) that NO, this is a tired and incorrect stereotype.  Here are some samples:<br/>
<br/>
1) People in Mathematics are no better or worse at fixing iphones, fixing cars, programming their VCR's, etc than the public.<br/>
<br/>
2) For that matter, people in academica, even in practical sounding fields like Systems, are no better.<br/>
<br/>
3) Is your nephew Jason who used to fix forklifts for a living  better at these things then the general public? I asked him. Answer: No, though he is better at fixing forklifts.<br/>
<br/>
I think something else is going on here. Lets look at fixing your own car. I think this is the sort of thing that some people used to be able to do but now very few can do it. Cars have gotten more complicated. <br/>
<br/>
Iphones are not quite there yet but its getting that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course somethings have gotten easier--- programming a DVR is much easier than programming a VCR.   And people can easily use WORD or write programs without having to know any hardware.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY, after all these random thoughts, here is the question: What do you think? <br/>
<br/>
Are people in CS or Math or CS theory better at X than the general public where X is NOT CS, Math or CS theory, but something like fixing their cars?<br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
<br/>
What has gotten harder? What has gotten easier?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <title>TR19-112 |  Agreement testing theorems on layered set systems | 

	Yotam Dikstein, 

	Irit Dinur</title>
    <summary>We introduce a framework of layered subsets, and give a sufficient condition for when a set system supports an agreement test. Agreement testing is a certain type of property testing that generalizes PCP tests such as the plane vs. plane test. 

Previous work has shown that high dimensional expansion is useful for agreement tests. We extend these results to more general families of subsets, beyond simplicial complexes. These include

* Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are faces of high dimensional expanders. Our new tests apply to all dimensions of complexes both in case of two-sided expansion and in the case of one-sided partite expansion.  This improves and extends an earlier work of Dinur and Kaufman (FOCS 2017) and applies to matroids, and potentially many additional complexes.
* Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are neighborhoods of vertices in a high dimensional expander. This family resembles the expander neighborhood family used in the gap-amplification proof of the PCP theorem. This set system is quite natural yet does not sit in a simplicial complex, and demonstrates some versatility in our proof technique. %It could potentially be useful towards new and more efficient constructions of locally testable codes and PCPs.
* Agreement tests on families of subspaces (also known as the Grassmann poset). This extends the classical low degree agreement tests beyond the setting of low degree polynomials.

Our analysis relies on a new random walk on simplicial complexes which we call the ``complement random walk'' and which may be of independent interest. This random walk generalizes the non-lazy random walk on a graph to higher dimensions, and has significantly better expansion than previously-studied random walks on simplicial complexes.</summary>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Richard Ehrenborg with a polyhedron</span></p>
<p>In the Problem session last Thursday in Oberwolfach, Steve Klee presented a beautiful problem of Richard Ehrenborg regarding the number of spanning trees in bipartite graphs.</p>
<p>Let <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G"/> be a bipartite graph with <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m"/> vertices on one side and <img alt="n " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n "/> vertices on the other side, and with vertex-degrees <img alt="d_1,d_2,\dots ,d_m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_1%2Cd_2%2C%5Cdots+%2Cd_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d_1,d_2,\dots ,d_m"/> and <img alt="e_1,e_2,\dots e_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1%2Ce_2%2C%5Cdots+e_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="e_1,e_2,\dots e_n"/>.</p>
<p><strong>Ehrenborg’s problem:</strong> Is it the case that the number of spanning trees of <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G"/> is at most</p>
<p><img alt="m^{-1}n^{-1} \prod_{i=1}^m d_i \prod_{j=1}^n e_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%5E%7B-1%7Dn%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cprod_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Em+d_i+%5Cprod_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+e_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m^{-1}n^{-1} \prod_{i=1}^m d_i \prod_{j=1}^n e_j"/>.</p>
<p>In words, the number of spanning trees is at most the product of the vertex degrees divided by the sizes of the two sides.</p>
<p>For example for the complete bipartite graph the number of the spanning trees is <img alt="n^{m-1}m^{n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bm-1%7Dm%5E%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{m-1}m^{n-1}"/> so equality hold.  More genarally,  equality holds for <strong>Ferrer’s graphs</strong>. Those are graphs where the vertices on the two sides are ordered and if <img alt="(a,b)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(a,b)"/> is an edge so are <img alt="(a',b)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%27%2Cb%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(a',b)"/> and <img alt="(a,b')" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%27%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(a,b')"/> for <img alt="a'&lt;a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%27%3Ca&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="a'&lt;a"/> and <img alt="b'&lt;b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%27%3Cb&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="b'&lt;b"/>. See<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2918"> this paper of Richard Ehrenborg and Stephanie van Willigenburg</a>.</p>
<p>Steve Klee and Matthiew Stamps  found a new point of view for both the weighted and unweighted settings. (See<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03575"> this paper</a> by Klee and Stamps and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04973">this paper</a>.) <span id="more-17923"/></p>
<p>There is an analogous problem for general graphs where threshold graphs replace Ferrer’s graphs. This is related to a conjecture by Grone and Merris. (There are importat related works by Kelmans.) See <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2002-354-11/S0002-9947-02-03082-9/home.html">this paper</a> by Duval and Reiner and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0302213">this paper</a> by Martin and Reiner for related results and conjectures on spectrum of Laplacians for general simplicial complexes and shifted simplicial complexes.</p>
<p>I have learned that the Crone-Merris conjecture itself was <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2011-363-08/S0002-9947-2011-05393-6/home.html">settled by Hua Bai in 2012</a>.

<p>Update and follow-up on the Safe ToC initiative:  </p>



<p>Last year, a group of us served on an ad hoc committee to combat harassment and discrimination in the Theory of Computing community.  In our report, we suggested a number of measures that the various theory conferences could adopt to help in this effort.  At a minimum, we wanted conferences to adopt a code of conduct and to appoint volunteers to serve as ToC Advocates whose role will be to provide support to any individual who has experienced harassment at a conference.  Our full final report is now available here:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/ToC_SH_report.pdf">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/ToC_SH_report.pdf</a></p>



<p>A small subset of the original committee along with Yuval Rabani in his capacity as IEEE TCMF chair are working on implementing some of the recommendations in the recent report. We have now launched a web site for the SafeToC Initiative: <a href="http://safetoc.org">safetoc.org</a><br/></p>



<p>So far, the support from the broader community has been strong. Quite a few conferences have passed resolutions to adopt the recommended practices in our report. The new web site lists all the participating conferences as well as the names of volunteers who have signed on to be ToC Advocates. The web site also provides information for ToC Advocates, conference organizers, and members of the ToC community. <br/></p>



<p>Participating conferences all have codes of conduct and are ensuring that participants agree to abide by the code as part of their registration process. In addition, some of these conferences are adopting new mechanisms for author-declared conflicts of interests. This is especially important if an author feels that he or she may receive an unfair review due to a previous harassment-related incident. <br/></p>



<p>Of course, the work is not done, and this important effort needs to continue. What can everyone do from here?<br/></p>



<ul><li>First, we are in need of trained ToC Advocates, to spread this important service around!  An advocate would be a designated conference attendee who would be available to provide support and information to anyone who has observed or experienced harassment at the conference The work is not difficult. Right now the training consists of an hour-long webinar sponsored by the ACM. We are envisioning one or two group Skype meetings per year to share experiences and best practices. If you are interested in serving as a ToC Advocate for a conference, you can contact someone on the steering committee for that conference.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Second, even if you are not serving as an Advocate, please familiarize yourself with the various codes of conduct, and perhaps even listen to a training video!  A larger community of invested bystanders who are aware of these issues and prepared to support and/or intervene as needed is critical.  This does not have to mean formal reporting – even helping to diffuse a problematic situation or checking in on a colleague to be sure they are ok after a difficult conversation can make a big difference to someone involved in an incident.</li></ul>



<p>We will continue to update the web page as participation in this effort grows. Thank you to everyone for helping to make our community a safe and welcoming place for everyone.<br/></p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Recently, my Facebook wall was full of discussion about instituting an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/16/mathematicians-need-doctor-style-hippocratic-oath-says-academic-hannah-fry?fbclid=IwAR1yvNyv8P4UJWhiAH_kshgXjjs_MZ2aVsfmLxrEv4d2sKAIzf2q3TtS4PQ">oath for STEM workers</a>, analogous to the Hippocratic oath for doctors.  Perhaps some of the motivation for this comes from a worldview I can’t get behind—one that holds STEM nerds almost uniquely responsible for the world’s evils.  Nevertheless, on reflection, I find myself in broad support of the idea.</p>



<p>But I prefer writing the oath myself.  Here’s my attempt:</p>



<p>1. I will never allow anyone else to make me a cog.  I will never do what is stupid or horrible because “that’s what the regulations say” or “that’s what my supervisor said,” and then sleep soundly at night.  I’ll never do my part for a project unless I’m satisfied that the project’s broader goals are, at worst, morally neutral.  There’s no one on earth who gets to say: “I just solve technical problems.  Moral implications are outside my scope.”  </p>



<p>2. If I build or supply tools that are used to do evil or cause suffering, I’ll be horrified as soon as I learn about it.  Yes, I might judge that the good of the tools outweighs the bad, that the bad can’t be prevented, etc.  But I’ll be hyper-alert to the possibility of self-serving bias in such reflections, and will choose a different course of action whenever the reflections are no longer persuasive to my highest self.</p>



<p>3. I will pursue the truth, and hold the sharing of truth and exposing of falsehoods among my highest moral values.</p>



<p>4. I will make a stink, resign, leak to the press, sabotage, rather than go along quietly with decisions inimical to my values.</p>



<p>5. I will put everything on the line for my students, advisees, employees—my time, funds, reputation, and credibility.  And not only because it can somewhat make up for failings in the other areas.</p>



<p>6. Black, white, male, female, trans, gay, straight, Israeli, Palestinian, young, old.  Whatever ideologies I might subscribe to about which groups are advantaged and which disadvantaged in which aspects of life—when it comes time to interact with a person, I will throw ideology into the ocean and treat them solely as an individual, not as a representative of a group.</p>



<p>7. I will not be Jeffrey Epstein—and not just in the narrow sense of not collecting underage girls on a private sex island.  I’ll see myself always as accountable to the moral judgment of history.  Whenever I’m publicly accused of wrongdoing, I’ll consider only two options: (a) if guilty, then confess, offer restitution, beg for forgiveness, or (b) if innocent, then mount a full public defense.  Finding some escape that avoids the need for either of these—from legal maneuvering to suicide—will never be on the table for me.</p>



<p>8. I’m under no obligation to blog or tweet every detail of my private life.  Yet even in my most private moments, I’ll act in such a way that, <em>if</em> my actions were made public, I’d have a defense of which I was unashamed.</p>



<p>9. To whatever extent I was gifted at birth with a greater-than-average ability to prove theorems or write code or whatever, I’ll treat it as just that—a gift, which I didn’t earn or deserve.  It doesn’t make me inherently worthier than anyone else, but it <em>does</em> give me a moral obligation to use the gift for good.  And whenever I’m tempted to be jealous of various non-nerds—of their ease in social or romantic situations, wealth, looks, power, athletic ability, or anything else about them—I’ll remember the gift, and that all in all, I made out better than I had a right to expect.</p>



<p>10. I’ll be conscious always of living in a universe where catastrophes—genocides, destructions of civilizations, extinctions of magnificent species—have happened and will happen again.  The burning of the Amazon, the deaths of children, the bleaching of coral reefs, will weigh on me daily, to the maximum extent consistent with being able to get out of bed in the morning, live, and work.  While it’s not obvious that <em>any</em> of these problems are open to a STEM-nerd solution, of the sort I could plausibly think of or implement—nevertheless, I’ll keep asking myself whether any of them are.  And if I ever <em>do</em> find myself before one of the levers of history, I’ll pull with all my strength to try to prevent these catastrophes.</p></div>

    <title>Grid majors</title>
    <summary>I’ve written here about grid minors before, more than once. These are grid graphs that you can get from a given graph as a minor (that is, by removing edges or vertices from and contracting others of its edges). So, in the other direction, a “grid major” of must be a grid graph that has as a minor. These are the subject of my new preprint, “Homotopy height, grid-major height and graph-drawing height” (arXiv:1908.05706, with Therese Biedl, Erin Chambers, Arnaud De Mesmay, and Tim Ophelders, to appear at Graph Drawing).</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’ve <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2012/12/16/grid-minors-in.html">written here about grid minors</a> before, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2013/03/05/more-on-grid.html">more than once</a>. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_graph">grid graphs</a> that you can get from a given graph  as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_minor">minor</a> (that is, by removing edges or vertices from  and contracting others of its edges). So, in the other direction, a “grid major” of  must be a grid graph that has  as a minor. These are the subject of my new preprint, “Homotopy height, grid-major height and graph-drawing height” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05706">arXiv:1908.05706</a>, with Therese Biedl, Erin Chambers, Arnaud De Mesmay, and Tim Ophelders, to appear at Graph Drawing).</p>

<p>You can define the terms in the paper’s title for any planar graph, but our results are cleanest for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_planar_graph">maximal planar graphs</a>. If we define the height of a grid to be the smaller of its two dimensions, then the grid-major height of a graph  is just the smallest height of a grid that has  as a minor. The detailed definition of homotopy height is trickier to explain, but the rough idea is that (after choosing one face of your graph to be the outer one) you should sweep a path from one edge of the outer face, across the graph, to another edge of the outer face, trying as you do to keep the path as short as possible. Paths can move across triangular faces (changing the number of vertices by ) or path vertices can “slide” along edges  (leaving the total number unchanged. The smallest length  such that you can do this sweep and always maintain length at most  turns out to equal the grid-major height, and both are lower bounds on the height of a conventional drawing of the graph (with its vertices at grid points and its edges as straight line segments).</p>

<p>For instance, the following drawing shows a height- grid drawing of a maximal planar graph, a sequence of  paths of length at most  sweeping from the left to the right edge of the graph, and the subsets of vertices to contract in a  grid to produce the graph as a minor. Each column of the grid has the same vertices as the corresponding path in the walk. For this graph, the drawing height, homotopy height, and grid-major height are all equal, but it is possible for the drawing height to be much larger than the other two quantities.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Grid drawing of a maximal planar graph, homotopy sequence for the graph, and grid major representation of the graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/grid-majors.svg"/></p>

<p>Both homotopy height and grid-major height come in simple and non-simple variations. They are equal for both variations, and both variations give a valid lower bound on graph drawing height. In simple homotopy height the swept path is required to stay simple (as it is in the example here) while more generally we allow walks that can repeat vertices. (In particular they can have “spikes”, parts of paths that double back along a single edge.) Correspondingly, non-simple grid-major height does not restrict how  is formed as a minor of a grid while the simple variant requires the parts of the grid corresponding to a single vertex of  to be contiguous within each column of the grid (as they are in the example here).</p>

<p>Because grid-major height behaves nicely under graph minor operations, it is automatically fixed-parameter tractable, but in a non-uniform way. What this means is that for each  there are finitely many graphs that, when they are a minor of , prevent  from having grid-major height . We can find the grid-major height of  by looking for these “obstacles” and returning the smallest  for which no obstacles are found. And, whenever  is bounded, the time of the resulting algorithm is a polynomial whose exponent is independent of the size of . So an algorithm exists for any fixed , but we don’t know how to actually write it down as a program because we don’t know what the obstacles are or even whether the number of obstacles is computable.</p>

<p>Simple grid-major height is nicer from the algorithmic point of view, but still not entirely satisfactory. Our paper describes the existence of a simple grid major using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_graphs">logic of graphs</a>. When  is bounded this gives us a linear-time algorithm via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courcelle%27s_theorem">Courcelle’s theorem</a>. The algorithm could in principle be written out explicitly as a program,
with  given as an input to the program rather than hardcoded into it. There is no problem with unknown lists of obstacles. But the logical description is huge and the dependence of Courcelle’s theorem on the size of the logical description is very high, so although the time is linear in the size of the graph it gets multiplied by a very quickly growing function <span style="white-space: nowrap;">of .</span></p>

Danny Cohen was a pioneer who advanced many areas of computer science. He made contributions to computer graphics, networking, and flight simulation, and much more.</p>
<p>
Today I want to remember him and his work.</p>
<p><span id="more-16208"/></p>
<p>
Danny is hard to label. Leonard Kleinrock, said that Cohen “had the uncanny ability to employ his deep mathematical intellect and insight to real world challenges, with enormous impact.” Indeed. This is quoted in last week’s New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/obituaries/danny-cohen-who-helped-set-the-stage-for-a-digital-era-dies-at-81.html">obit</a>. The Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2019-08-20/danny-cohen-computer-scientist-dead">obit</a> noted his 1981 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667115">paper</a> addressed to warring “Big Endian” and “Little Endian” camps.</p>
<p>
Obituaries for Danny do not, in my opinion, explain why Danny was so remarkable. For example, he impacted theory even though he never worked in it. Let me explain in a moment. But first <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Danny—isms </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I worked with Danny. I was on a government committee that he chaired, years ago. He was an excellent leader, a tough chair, and ran a tight ship. He had been a fighter pilot, perhaps that is why he was such a great leader. On that committee—I will not identify it—he once fired a new committee member as he left the first meeting. Really as he walked out the door, while the rest of us were still meeting. He immediately said that he would not be staying on the committee. Tough. Yes. But Danny knew how to run a meeting.</p>
<p>
Danny had a clever wit. One of his favorite jokes was based on a form he had printed out:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The_____________________________technology is a promising technology and always will be.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He then would fill in the blank with whatever you thought was a great technology and hand it to you. Today perhaps we might fill in “quantum computing”—or is that wrong to say?</p>
<p>
Danny loved irony. His son revealed that Danny had joined the Flat Earth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">Society</a>. Danny was initially rejected—no scientists allowed. After he got in—this time he did not list his profession—he framed the certificate of membership, the rejection letter and the Flat Earth Society’s map of the world, complete with an emblazoned “Australia Not Down Under..”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> MOSIS </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A key contribution that seems to be missed in obits I’ve seen is that he helped create the VLSI revolution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSIS">MOSIS</a> is the <i>Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service</i>. Danny created it, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/9412602.pdf">styling</a> it after the earlier work of the pioneer Lynn Conway. Ten points if you know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration">VLSI</a> stands for.</p>
<p>
MOSIS allowed researchers to actually fabricate their designs: to convert digital plans into chips that worked. You designed the chips yourself, encoded in a strange digital file format. Then you sent the files to MOSIS. They then placed you design along with other designs onto one wafer. A wafer held many designs. The wafer files were finally sent to a commercial foundry. There they were converted from digital into silicon. When MOSIS got them back they broke the wafers up and sent you the chips that you designed. </p>
<p>
This was magical. The beauty was we could make working chips without having to have our own foundry. At that time frame many companies in the computer business would boast that they had they own <i>captive foundry</i>. Few could afford the huge cost of having their own fabrication foundry. Danny liked to say: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A captive foundry was one that captured you. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>His point was that if you had your own foundry, you probably would be forced to use it, even if it was not the right type for your needs. Captive indeed.</p>
<p>
Since 1981, when it started, countless projects have been fabricated. MOSIS was a brilliant idea that made it possible for many to build working VLSI chips. We did that more that once while I was at Princeton University. While at Princeton my students and I sent several designs to MOSIS. For example, Dan Lopresti sent in a design that we discussed before <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/nsf-workshop-on-design-automation-and-theory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/29/danny-cohen-passed-away/lop/" rel="attachment wp-att-16217"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16217" height="300" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/lop.png?w=140&amp;h=300" width="140"/></a></p>
<p>
The ability to make chips was a terrific motivator. I believe that the excitement of being able to make your own devices helped move the field forward. Without MOSIS, without Danny, the field would have advanced much slower. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Perhaps the lesson of MOSIS is not lost on us. Today there are “MOSIS” like systems that allow even theorists to execute physically real quantum computations. This is indirectly thanks to Danny. We owe him much.</p>

    <title>Congratulations, Dr. Besa!</title>
    <summary>Juan Besa’s successful dissertation defense was last Thursday, but I’ve been holding off posting about it here because one of his committee members took ill and couldn’t sign off on it until today.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="http://sites.uci.edu/juanbesa/">Juan Besa’s</a> successful dissertation defense was last Thursday, but I’ve been holding off posting about it here because one of his committee members took ill and couldn’t sign off on it until today.</p>

<p>Juan started his graduate work in embedded systems, but for the last several years he has been one of the theory students at UCI, advised by Mike Goodrich. <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/a-besa.html">My joint papers with him</a> have included <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2016/09/16/directing-traffic.html">algorithms for scheduling traffic signals to allow groups of vehicles to move through them quickly</a> and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/05/09/sorting-when-sorted.html">maintaining an approximately sorted list</a> of items whose sorted order is changing dynamically in a context where comparisons are expensive.</p>

<p>He also has papers on which I was not involved, on chess knights’ tours with few crossings or bends (mentioned briefly with links <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/31/linkage.html">here</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01630">embedding planar digraphs so each vertex has few alternations between incoming and outgoing edges</a> (to appear at ESA), and another one on low-width tree drawing that has yet to appear publicly as a paper but forms part of his dissertation.</p>

<p>Juan has dual Chilean and Spanish citizenship, and (having the usual double-barreled Spanish surname “Besa Vial”) had to deal with the difficulties of getting that name format understood in non-Spanish-speaking countries; he ended up choosing to truncate it to “Besa” in his recent publications. He is heading to England to work at a machine learning company there. With Brexit coming up quickly, I worry about how that will work out, but I hope it does work well for him.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Juan!</p>

James Oxley and Geoff Whittle are mathematicians at LSU and Victoria University (Wellington, New Zealand), respectively. They have written many joint papers on matroid theory, but none on quantum computing.</p>
<p>
Today we observe that they really have <i>indirectly</i> written a paper on quantum computing.</p>
<p><span id="more-16196"/></p>
<p>
Their <a href="http://homepages.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~whittle/pubs/Tutte_invariants_of_2-polymatroids.pdf">paper</a>, “A Characterization of Tutte Invariants of 2-Polymatroids,” has implications for quantum complexity theory. It introduced a polynomial <img alt="{S_G(u,v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_G%28u%2Cv%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_G(u,v)}"/> where <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> is a graph and <img alt="{u,v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%2Cv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u,v}"/> are numbers. Like many polynomials defined on graphs this one is in general hard to compute—it is <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/>-hard, so if it is polynomial time computable, then surprising stuff happens. </p>
<p>
The same paper observes that <img alt="{S_G(u,v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_G%28u%2Cv%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_G(u,v)}"/> is easy to compute when 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  uv = 1 \text{ for rational } u,v. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++uv+%3D+1+%5Ctext%7B+for+rational+%7D+u%2Cv.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  uv = 1 \text{ for rational } u,v. "/></p>
<p>However, a 2006 <a href="https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/818/1/polymatroid.pdf">paper</a> by Steve Noble proves that <em>all</em> other rational cases are <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/>-hard. Our work finds easy cases in another family where <img alt="{v = \pm \sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv+%3D+%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v = \pm \sqrt{2}i}"/> and <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> is a rational multiple of <img alt="{\sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{2}i}"/>. This result goes through quantum complexity theory. </p>
<p>
It is interesting to note that quantum computations welcome complex numbers such as <img alt="{\sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{2}i}"/>. In mathematics insights to behavior of real functions are often found when we extend them to the complex functions. A beautiful example to compare is that the behavior of 	</p>

<p>is best understood by noting that <img alt="{1+x^{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Bx%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1+x^{2}}"/> can be zero at <img alt="{x=i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%3Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x=i}"/>. </p>

</p><p/><h2> Matroids and Polymatroids </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In order to best understand the above results it is helpful to look at matroids and generalizations. Matroids are a bit scary, since they seem quite abstract. But that is wrong. The matroid concept is a natural generalization of the notion of rank in an ordinary vector space. </p>
<p>
Let’s take a look. A <em>matroid</em> is defined by a set <img alt="{U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{U}"/> and a function <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> from finite subsets of <img alt="{U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{U}"/> to <img alt="{\mathbb{N}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{N}}"/> that obeys the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<img alt="{f(\emptyset) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5Cemptyset%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(\emptyset) = 0}"/>; <p/>
</li><li>
for all <img alt="{a \in U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Cin+U%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a \in U}"/>, <img alt="{f(\{a\}) \leq 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5C%7Ba%5C%7D%29+%5Cleq+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(\{a\}) \leq 1}"/>; <p/>
</li><li>
if <img alt="{A \subseteq B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Csubseteq+B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \subseteq B}"/> then <img alt="{f(A) \leq f(B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28A%29+%5Cleq+f%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(A) \leq f(B)}"/>; and <p/>
</li><li>
if <img alt="{A \subseteq B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Csubseteq+B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \subseteq B}"/> and <img alt="{c \notin B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%5Cnotin+B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c \notin B}"/> then <img alt="{f(A \cup \{c\}) - f(A) \geq f(B \cup \{c\}) - f(B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28A+%5Ccup+%5C%7Bc%5C%7D%29+-+f%28A%29+%5Cgeq+f%28B+%5Ccup+%5C%7Bc%5C%7D%29+-+f%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(A \cup \{c\}) - f(A) \geq f(B \cup \{c\}) - f(B)}"/>.
</li></ol>
<p>
The notion of <em>rank</em> in an ordinary vector space obeys these axioms. The rules are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The empty set has rank <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>; <p/>
</li><li>
Each vector has rank at most <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>; <p/>
</li><li>
The rank of a set of vectors can increase only by adding more vectors; <p/>
</li><li>
Suppose that adding <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> to a set <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> increases the rank. Then <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> also increases the rank of any subset of <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. Or if <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> is independent of a set of vectors <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>, then it is independent of any subset of <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>.
</li></ol>
<p>
The definition of a <em>polymatroid</em> simply wipes out rule 2. OK, a <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>-polymatroid replaces it by the rule that for all singleton sets <img alt="{\{a\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7Ba%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{a\}}"/> have <img alt="{f(\{a\}) \leq k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5C%7Ba%5C%7D%29+%5Cleq+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(\{a\}) \leq k}"/>. An important kind of 2-polymatroid springs from the following idea:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The “<img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>-rank” of a subset <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> of the <b>edges</b> in a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> is the number of vertices collectively touched by edges in <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
In a simple undirected graph, every edge has <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>-rank 2. In graphs with self-loops, however, the loops have rank <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. We can also allow the universe <img alt="{U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{U}"/> to include members of <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>-rank <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>. Those are visualized as loops without a vertex and called <em>circles</em>. We could also visualize edges of rank <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> that stick out from a vertex <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/> into empty space, but those are formally the same as loops at <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/>. This defines a <em>graphic(al) 2-polymatroid</em> <img alt="{M = (U,f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%3D+%28U%2Cf%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M = (U,f)}"/>. </p>
<p>
The theory of polymatroids ignores the notion of “vertex” apart from the definition of the rank function <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>. Hence all graphs composed of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> isolated vertices define the empty 2-polymatroid. To preserve the distinction, we define an <em>m-graph</em> to be a graph with circles allowed. The empty m-graph is denoted by <img alt="{\oslash}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Coslash%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\oslash}"/> and called a “wisp.” Every m-graph specializes to a unique graphical polymatroid but we can include isolated nodes when thinking of it as a graph (plus circles).</p>

<p/><p>
We revisit the definition of “exploding” an edge <img alt="{e = (u,v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be+%3D+%28u%2Cv%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e = (u,v)}"/> in a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> from the previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/contraction-and-explosion/">post</a> in this series:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If there are an odd number of edges incident only to <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> and/or <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/>, then <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> and <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/> become a circle and a wisp, else they become two wisps. <p/>
</li><li>
Any other edge incident to <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> or <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/> from another vertex <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> becomes a loop at <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/>.
</li></ul>
<p>
If we ignore vertices, then the rank function <img alt="{f'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f'}"/> of the resulting m-graph <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G'}"/> is such that for all subsets <img alt="{A'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A'}"/> of its edge set <img alt="{E' = E \setminus \{e\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27+%3D+E+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Be%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E' = E \setminus \{e\}}"/>, <a name="contract"/></p><a name="contract">

</a><p><a name="contract"/> One can verify that the “explosion” description obeys (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#contract">1</a>).

The equation (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#contract">1</a>), however, is more fundamentally natural. The simple extension </p>

<p/><p>
In a previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/contraction-and-explosion/">post</a> we derived a recurrence for the <em>amplitude</em> <img alt="{a(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a(G)}"/> in terms of explosion. The presence of circles and use of the function <img alt="{f(e)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28e%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(e)}"/> now allows us to write it as: </p>

<p>
If we have a single node <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/> with <em>two</em> loops, something portentous happens. Exploding one of the loops <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> leaves a circle. Removing <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> still leaves one loop. So we get: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  Q_{G}(x) = Q_{loop}(x) - Q_{\bigcirc}(x) = x - 1 - (-1) = x. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++Q_%7BG%7D%28x%29+%3D+Q_%7Bloop%7D%28x%29+-+Q_%7B%5Cbigcirc%7D%28x%29+%3D+x+-+1+-+%28-1%29+%3D+x.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  Q_{G}(x) = Q_{loop}(x) - Q_{\bigcirc}(x) = x - 1 - (-1) = x. "/></p>
<p>This agrees with the value on one isolated node. Similarly, if <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> has just a double edge between two nodes <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> and <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/>, then one edge <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> becomes a circle upon exploding the other edge, so recursing on the other edge makes </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  Q_{G}(x) = Q_e(x) - \frac{1}{2}Q_{\bigcirc}(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = x^2. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++Q_%7BG%7D%28x%29+%3D+Q_e%28x%29+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7DQ_%7B%5Cbigcirc%7D%28x%29+%3D+x%5E2+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%3D+x%5E2.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  Q_{G}(x) = Q_e(x) - \frac{1}{2}Q_{\bigcirc}(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = x^2. "/></p>
<p>Thus the double edge gives the same result as having two isolated nodes. The upshot is that equation (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#recurse">2</a>) naturally treats edges modulo two. We can recurse on a <em>non</em>-edge as if it were a double-edge, and the circle left by the explosion (i.e., by the matroid contraction) becomes a <img alt="{-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-1}"/> multiplier on the entire remainder of that branch of the recursion. The <em>circle</em> thus becomes a placeholder for calculating phase flips and cancellations, which is why we believe the matroid notions are useful in analyzing quantum processes.</p>
<p>
It may not be obvious, however, that <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> is well-defined when <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> has more than one edge. That is, does it come out the same for any order of choosing edges <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> for the recursion? We will prove this by connecting <img alt="{Q_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G}"/> to the polynomial <img alt="{S_G(u,v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_G%28u%2Cv%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_G(u,v)}"/> mentioned above.</p>

To verify the recursion, we note facts observed by Oxley and Whittle as consequences of (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#rankgen">3</a>):</p>

Every connected graph other than those we put in our basis has an edge <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> that falls into one of these three cases. So we can prove (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#specialize">4</a>) by induction on them. The details convey why we need to use the particular value <img alt="{\alpha = -\sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+-%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha = -\sqrt{2}i}"/> but are otherwise straightforward and tedious, so we’ve put them in a longer PDF <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/GLL/wmatroids.pdf">version</a>. Since the equation (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#rankgen">3</a>) for <img alt="{S_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_G}"/> involves no recursion, this also proves that the recursive definition of <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> is confluent. <img alt="\Box" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\Box"/></p>
<p>
Note how the sum in the case (c) echoes the sum defining the Tutte polynomial, but with “explosion” in place of ordinary graph contraction. A more salient difference is that whereas the Tutte polynomial is the same on all <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-vertex trees, <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> differs on them. </p>

<p>
Also interesting is that if <img alt="{\ell = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell = 0}"/> and we delete each of the <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> edges independently with probability <img alt="{(1-p)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281-p%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(1-p)}"/>, then the probability that the deletions did not cause any isolated vertices is </p>

"/></p>
<p>Of course, this is classical probability. What interests us here is the import of <img alt="{S_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_G}"/> for quantum amplitude and probability. We have already observed in <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/04/a-quantum-connection-for-matrix-rank/">previous</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/10/net-zero-graphs/">posts</a> that <img alt="{Q_{G}(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_%7BG%7D%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_{G}(1)}"/> gives the amplitude for an outcome in a special kind of quantum circuit. This means that <img alt="{S_{G}(\alpha,-\alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_%7BG%7D%28%5Calpha%2C-%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_{G}(\alpha,-\alpha)}"/> gives the same information, where <img alt="{\alpha^2 = -2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%5E2+%3D+-2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha^2 = -2}"/>. </p>
<p>
We are curious about is the significance of <img alt="{S_{G}(\alpha x,-\alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_%7BG%7D%28%5Calpha+x%2C-%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_{G}(\alpha x,-\alpha)}"/> for other values of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> besides <img alt="{x = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x = 1}"/>. The complex value <img alt="{\alpha = -\sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+-%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha = -\sqrt{2}i}"/> takes us outside the real-valued domain of Noble’s paper. His proof that most real cases are <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/>-hard to compute does not extend because <img alt="{\alpha^2 = -2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%5E2+%3D+-2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha^2 = -2}"/>, which causes a denominator in his proof to vanish. Thus <img alt="{S_{G}(\alpha x,-\alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_%7BG%7D%28%5Calpha+x%2C-%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_{G}(\alpha x,-\alpha)}"/> and hence <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> may be polynomial-time computable for various other real <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>.</p>
<p>
The specialization <img alt="{Q_G(x) = S_G(\alpha x, -\alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29+%3D+S_G%28%5Calpha+x%2C+-%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x) = S_G(\alpha x, -\alpha)}"/> (times other easily-computed factors) does not seem to intersect with any of the above cases. Hence the field is wide open for finding new interpretations of it. Whatever we find, however, is bound to relate to the analysis of quantum circuits. It might help fulfill the aim in our <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/10/net-zero-graphs/">post</a> drawing analogy to Gustav Kirchhoff’s laws for electrical circuits.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>

We had thought to imitate how the Tutte polynomial <img alt="{T(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T(x,y)}"/> has base monomials <img alt="{x^q y^r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Eq+y%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x^q y^r}"/> for graphs composed of <img alt="{q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q}"/> “bridge” edges and <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> loop edges at otherwise-isolated nodes. One can base a polynomial <img alt="{R_G(x,y,z,w)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_G%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2Cw%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R_G(x,y,z,w)}"/> on monomials </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x^\ell y^r z^s w^t " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5E%5Cell+y%5Er+z%5Es+w%5Et+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  x^\ell y^r z^s w^t "/></p>
<p>for <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> composed of <img alt="{\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell}"/> isolated nodes, <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> disjoint single-node loops, <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/> circles, and <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> “wisps.” The recursion is the same: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  R_G(x,y,z,w) = R_{G \setminus e}(x,y,z,w) - \frac{1}{f(e)} R_{G \backslash\!\backslash e}(x,y,z,w). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++R_G%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2Cw%29+%3D+R_%7BG+%5Csetminus+e%7D%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2Cw%29+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bf%28e%29%7D+R_%7BG+%5Cbackslash%5C%21%5Cbackslash+e%7D%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2Cw%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  R_G(x,y,z,w) = R_{G \setminus e}(x,y,z,w) - \frac{1}{f(e)} R_{G \backslash\!\backslash e}(x,y,z,w). "/></p>
<p>
The point is that in the explosion case, the inclusion of the factors for wisps and circles (namely, <img alt="{w^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w^2}"/> if the explosion leaves two wisps, <img alt="{wz}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bwz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{wz}"/> if it leaves a wisp and a circle, or <img alt="{z^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z^2}"/> for two circles) keeps <img alt="{R_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R_G}"/> homogeneous of degree <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> for an <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-vertex graph. The conditions for this recursion to be confluent, however, essentially leave something equivalent to <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> with <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> as a homogenizing variable. In particular, this idea appears not to yield a two-variable polynomial that gives more leverage.</p>

    <title>`Are you a math genius?' `Can you fix my Iphone?' `What do you think about Facebook and Privacy?'</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
When I meet non-math people and tell them I am a computer science professor I get a range of responses. Here are some and my responses.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) <i>Are you a math genius?</i><br/>
<br/>
Here is the answer I give:<br/>
<br/>
<i>I know some things in math, frankly obscure things, that most people in math don't know. On the other hand, I probably can't help your teenage daughter with her trigonometry homework.  Academics, like most people, forget what they don't use, and there are some things in math I rarely use, so I've forgotten them.</i><br/>
<br/>
I wonder how a Fields' Medal winner would answer the question.<br/>
<br/>
Although the above is the answer I give I really think its an ill defined and pointless question. Its very hard to measure genius or even define what it means (there are exceptions). After a certain age, what you've done is more important than how smart you allegedly are.  <br/>
<br/>
2)<i> Can you fix my iPhone?</i><br/>
<br/>
That's an easy one: <i>No. I work on the math end of computer science.</i> I don't elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
3) <i>What do you think of Facebook and  privacy?</i><br/>
<br/>
This is an odd one. I DO have opinions on this but they are NOT better informed just because I'm a comp sci professor. Since I don't have a Facebook account my opinions might be worse informed. So how do I respond? I show them<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqggW08BWO0">this Onion News Network Video about how the CIA created Facebook </a><br/>
<br/>
Some think it's real. They may be right.<br/>

    <title>TR19-111 |  Noisy Beeps | 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Gillat Kol, 

	Raghuvansh Saxena</title>
    <summary>We study the effect of noise on the $n$-party beeping model. In this model, in every round, each party may decide to either `beep' or not. All parties hear a beep if and only if at least one party beeps. The beeping model is becoming increasingly popular, as it offers a very  simple abstraction of wireless networks and is very well suited for studying biological phenomena. Still, the noise resilience of the beeping model is yet to be understood.

Our main result is a lower bound, showing that making protocols in the beeping model resilient to noise may have a large performance overhead. Specifically, we give a protocol that works over the (noiseless) beeping model, and prove that any scheme that simulates this protocol over the beeping model with correlated stochastic noise will blow up the number of rounds by an $\Omega(\log n)$ multiplicative factor.

We complement this result by a matching upper bound, constructing a noise-resilient simulation scheme with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ overhead for any noiseless beeping protocol.</summary>

    <title>TR19-110 |  Improved bounds for the sunflower lemma | 

	Jiapeng Zhang, 

	Shachar Lovett, 

	Ryan Alweiss, 

	Kewen Wu</title>
    <summary>A sunflower with $r$ petals is a collection of $r$ sets so that the
intersection of each pair is equal to the intersection of all. Erd\H{o}s and Rado proved the sunflower lemma: for any fixed $r$, any family of sets of size $w$, with at least about $w^w$ sets, must contain a sunflower. The famous sunflower conjecture is that the bound on the number of sets can be improved to $c^w$ for some constant $c$. In this paper, we improve the bound to about $(\log w)^w$. In fact, we prove the result for a robust notion of sunflowers, for which the bound we obtain is tight up to lower order terms.</summary>

    <summary>In a recent paper, Kim and Kopparty (Theory of Computing, 2017) gave a deterministic algorithm for the unique decoding problem for polynomials of bounded total degree over a general grid $S_1\times\cdots \times S_m.$ We show that their algorithm can be adapted to solve the unique decoding problem for the general family of Downset codes. Here, a downset code is specified by a family $\mathcal{D}$ of monomials closed under taking factors: the corresponding code is the space of evaluations of all polynomials that can be written as linear combinations of monomials from $\mathcal{D}.$</summary>

    <title>TR19-108 |  Beating the probabilistic lower bound on perfect hashing | 

	Chaoping Xing, 

	chen yuan</title>
    <summary>For an interger $q\ge 2$, a perfect $q$-hash code $C$  is a  block code over $\ZZ_q:=\ZZ/ q\ZZ$ of length $n$ in which every subset $\{\bc_1,\bc_2,\dots,\bc_q\}$ of $q$ elements is separated, i.e., there exists $i\in[n]$ such that $\{\proj_i(\bc_1),\proj_i(\bc_2),\dots,\proj_i(\bc_q)\}=\ZZ_q$, where $\proj_i(\bc_j)$ denotes the $i$th position of $\bc_j$. Finding the maximum size $M(n,q)$ of  perfect $q$-hash codes of length $n$, for given $q$ and $n$, is  a fundamental problem in combinatorics, information theory, and computer science. In this paper, we are interested in asymptotical behavior of this problem. More precisely speaking, we will focus on the quantity $R_q:=\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\log_2 M(n,q)}n$.

A well-known probabilistic argument shows an existence lower bound on $R_q$, namely $R_q\ge\frac1{q-1}\log_2\left(\frac1{1-q!/q^q}\right)$ \cite{FK,K86}.  This is still the best-known lower bound till now except for the case $q=3$  for which K\"{o}rner and Matron \cite{KM} found that the concatenation technique could lead to a perfect $3$-hash code beating this the probabilistic lower bound. The improvement on the lower bound on $R_3$ was discovered in 1988 and there has been no any progress on lower bound on $R_q$ for more than 30 years despite of some work on upper bounds on $R_q$.
 In this paper we show that this  probabilistic lower bound can be improved for $q=4,8$ and all odd integers between $3$ and $25$, and \emph{every sufficiently large odd} $q$. Our idea is based on a modified concatenation which is different from the classical concatenation for which both the inner and outer codes are separated. However, for our concatenation we do not require that the inner code is a perfect $q$-hash code. This gives  a more flexible choice of inner codes and hence we are able to beat the  probabilistic  existence lower bound on $R_q$.</summary>

The new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483</a> improved bounds for the sunflower lemma gives the most dramatic progress on the sunflower conjecture since it was asked.

<p>(Written on my smartphone will expand it when reconnected to my laptop.)  (Reconnected) Rather, I will write about it again in a few weeks. Let me mention now that while the old difficult and ingenious improvements stayed in the neighborhood of Erdos and Rado <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/09/28/extremal-combinatorics-iii-some-basic-theorems/">initial upper bound</a> the new result is in the neighborhood of the conjecture! (And is tight for a certain robust version of the problem!)</p>
<p>Let me also mention that we <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/?s=sunflower+conjecture">discussed</a> the sunflower conjecture here many times and polymath10 (<a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=The_Erdos-Rado_sunflower_lemma">wiki page</a>,  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/polymath10-the-erdos-rado-delta-system-conjecture">first post</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/polymath10-conclusion/">last post</a>) was devoted to the problem.)</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Let me mention an important progress on the sunflower conjecture from 2018 by Junichiro Fukuyama in his paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10318">Improved Bound on Sets Including No Sunflower with Three Petals</a>. I missed Fukuyama’s paper at the time and I thank Sasha Kostochka and Andrew Thomason for telling me about it now.</p></div>

    <title>Serpentine belts</title>
    <summary>Many car engines use a serpentine belt, passing across multiple pulleys and tensioner wheels, to transmit mechanical power and timing information from the car’s crankshaft to its alternator, engine fan, water pump, air conditioning, steering pump, and other systems. Another (usually separate) belt, the timing belt, similarly connects the crankshaft to the camshaft, which controls and drives the timing of the engine’s valves. The Volvo bus engine below shows both of these belts:</summary>

The <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Belt_drive_systen_01.JPG">Volvo bus engine</a> below shows both of these belts:</p>

<p>But suppose you encounter such an engine with its belt removed. How can you tell where to run the belt to connect it all back together again? There may be many different orderings in which you can connect a given set of wheels by a belt. On a real engine (such as the one in a Ford Escort on which I loosely modeled the top image below), you might get a little more information from which of the wheels are ribbed (inside the belt) and which are smooth (outside the belt) but even that extra information won’t always give you a unique solution:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Two serpentine belts for the Ford Escort" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/escort.svg"/></p>

<p>Connecting wheels with belts like this is the topic of my latest preprint, “Existence and hardness of conveyor belts” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07668">arXiv:1908.07668</a>, with a large group of co-authors merging groups from the University of Washington and the Bellairs workshops). The name isn’t really accurate, because most conveyor belts have simpler geometry, but that’s what the question was called in past work. At least we managed to avoid the misspelling “conveyer” of some of that work.</p>

<p>To be tight, a belt for a system of disjoint disks (representing the pulleys and wheels) must be a smooth simple closed curve, made by connecting arcs of the disks with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_lines_to_circles#Tangent_lines_to_two_circles">bitangents</a> between pairs of disks. It was already known that some systems of disks have no belt, and conjectured that unit disks always have one. Our work shows that it’s -complete to tell whether a belt exists, that they do exist for certain special systems of disks (e.g. when no vertical line crosses multiple disks), and that by adding a linear number of extra disks one can always make a belt exist.</p>

<p>The question of how many different belts can connect the same system of disks (posed to me by co-author Sara Billey) was to a large extent the inspiration for <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/counting-polygon-triangulations.html">my earlier paper on counting triangulations</a>. If counting simple polygons through a set of points is hard, then so is counting belts for tiny disks. And when I couldn’t prove that counting simple polygons is hard, I turned to other problems for which the proof was easier.</p>

<p>As part of this project I wrote <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/drawbelts.py">a little Python program to draw systems of disks and their belts</a>, used for the image above and for some of the images in the paper. It doesn’t find which belts are possible itself; instead, you have to specify the belt by listing the disks that it touches in order (allowing repetitions although some of the versions of the problem that we studied do not) and specifying for each disk which direction it turns when the belt touches it (equivalently, whether it is inside or outside the belt). To use it, you’ll need my <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/">PADS Python library</a>, or at least <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/SVG.py">the package in it for generating SVG files</a>.</p>
