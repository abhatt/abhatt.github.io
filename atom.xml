    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">This month, I will follow up on <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">last month’s blog post</a>, and describe classical techniques from numerical analysis that aim at accelerating the convergence of a vector sequence to its limit, by only combining elements of the sequence, and without the detailed knowledge of the iterative process that has led to this sequence. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Last month, I focused on sequences that converge to their limit exponentially fast (which is referred to as <em>linear</em> convergence), and I described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) method</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanks_transformation">Shanks transformation</a>, Anderson acceleration and its <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04133">regularized version</a>. These methods are called “non-linear” acceleration techniques, because, although they combine linearly iterates as \(c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m x_{k+m}\), the scalar weights in the linear combination depend non-linearly on \(x_k,\dots,x_{k+m}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will focus on sequences that converge sublinearly, that is, with a difference to their limit that goes to zero as an inverse power of \(k\), typically in \(O(1/k)\). </p>



<h2>Richardson extrapolation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a sequence \((x_k)_{k \geq 0} \in \mathbb{R}^d\), with an asymptotic expansion of the form $$ x_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k}\Delta + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big), $$ where \(x_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the limit of \((x_k)_k\) and \(\Delta\) a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The idea behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation">Richardson extrapolation</a> [<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.1911.0009">1</a>] is to combine linearly two iterates taken at two different values of \(k\) so that the zero-th order term \(x_\ast\) is left unchanged, but the first order term in \(1/k\) cancels out. For \(k\) even, we can consider $$  2 x_k – x_{k/2} =  2 \Big( x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta  +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big)  \Big) \, – \Big( x_\ast +  \frac{2}{k} \Delta  + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big) \Big)  =  x_\ast +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big).$$</p>

<p class="justify-text">The key benefit of Richardson extrapolation is that we only need to know that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion is proportional to \(1/k\), <em>without the need to know the vector \(\Delta\)</em>. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2481" height="280" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/richardson_2d.gif" width="332"/>Richardson extrapolation in two dimensions. The sequence is of the form \(x_k = \frac{1}{k} \Delta_1 + \frac{(-1)^k}{k^2} \Delta_2\). The extrapolated sequence \(2 x_k – x_{k/2}\) is only plotted for \(k\) even.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, following [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], I will explore situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful within machine learning. I identified three situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful (there are probably more):</p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>Iterates of an optimization algorithms \((x_k)_{k \geq 0}\), and the extrapolation is \( 2x_k – x_{k/2}.\)</li><li>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent, where we will combine iterates obtained from two different values of the step-size.</li><li>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter.</li></ol>



<p class="justify-text">As we will show, extrapolation techniques come with no significant loss in performance, but in several situations strong gains. It is thus “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences">unreasonably effective</a>“.</p>



<h2>Application to optimization algorithms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider an iterate \(x_k\) of an iterative optimization algorithm which is minimizing a function \(f\), thus converging to a global minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(f\). Then so is \(x_{k/2}\), and thus also $$  x_k^{(1)} = 2x_k – x_{k/2}.$$ Therefore, performance is never significantly deteriorated (the risk is essentially to lose half of the iterations). The potential gains depend on the way \(x_k\) converges to \(x_\ast\). The existence of a convergence rate of the form \(f(x_k) -f(x_\ast) = O(1/k)\) or \(O(1/k^2)\) is not enough, as Richardson extrapolation requires a specific direction of asymptotic convergence. As illustrated below, some algorithms are oscillating around their solutions, while some converge with a specific direction. Only the latter ones can be accelerated with Richardson extrapolation, while the former ones are good candidates for <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">Anderson acceleration</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2395" height="162" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nonoscillating_oscillating-1024x350.png" width="476"/> Left: Oscillating convergence, where Richardson extrapolation does not lead to any gain. Right: non-oscillating  convergence, with a main direction \(\Delta\) (in red dotted), where Richardson extrapolation can be beneficial if the oscillations orthogonal to the direction \(\Delta\) are negligible compared to convergence along the direction \(\Delta\). </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Averaged gradient descent.</strong> We consider the usual gradient descent algorithm $$x_k = x_{k-1} – \gamma f'(x_{k-1}),$$ where \(\gamma &gt; 0 \) is a step-size, with Polyak-Ruppert averaging [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>]: $$ y_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i.$$ Averaging is key to robustness to potential noise in the gradients [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070704277">5</a>]. However it comes with the unintended consequence of losing the exponential forgetting of initial conditions for strongly-convex problems [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4316-non-asymptotic-analysis-of-stochastic-approximation-algorithms-for-machine-learning.pdf">6</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">A common way to restore exponential convergence (up to the noise level in the stochastic case) is to consider “tail-averaging”, that is, to replace \(y_k\) by the average of only the latest \(k/2\) iterates [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-595/16-595.pdf">7</a>]. As shown below for \(k\) even, this corresponds exactly to Richardson extrapolation on the sequence \((y_k)_k\): $$ \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=k/2}^{k-1} x_i = \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i – \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k/2-1} x_i = 2 y_k – y_{k/2}. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">With basic  assumptions on \(f\), it is shown in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>] that for locally strongly-convex problems: $$y_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta + O(\rho^k), $$ where  \(\displaystyle \Delta = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (x_i – x_\ast)\) and \(\rho \in (0,1)\) depends on the condition number of \(f”(x_\ast)\). This is illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2507" height="250" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/averaged_gradient.png" width="342"/>Averaged gradient descent on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> problem in dimension \(d=400\), and with \(n=4000\) observations. For the regular averaged recursion, the line in the log-log plot has slope \(-2\). See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We can make the following observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Before Richardson extrapolation, the asymptotic convergence rate after averaging is of order \(O(1/k^2)\), which is better than the usual \(O(1/k)\) upper-bound for the rate of gradient descent, but with a stronger assumption that in fact leads to exponential convergence before averaging.</li><li>While \(\Delta\) has a simple expression, it cannot be computed in practice (but Richardson extrapolation does not need to know it).</li><li>Richardson extrapolation leads to an exponentially convergent algorithm from an algorithm converging asymptotically in \(O(1/k^2)\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Accelerated gradient descent.</strong> Above, we considered averaged gradient descent, which is asymptotically converging as \(O(1/k^2)\), and on which Richardson extrapolation could be used with strong gains. Is it possible also for the accelerated gradient descent method [<a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=dan&amp;paperid=46009&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng">8</a>], which has a (non-asymptotic) convergence rate of \(O(1/k^2)\) for convex functions?</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that the behavior of the iterates of accelerated gradient descent is exactly of the form depicted in the left plot of the figure above: that is, the iterates \(x_k\) oscillate around the optimum [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-084/15-084.pdf">9</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Flammarion15.pdf">10</a>], and Richardson extrapolation is of no help, but is not degrading performance too much. See below for an illustration. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2509" height="243" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/accelerated_gradient.png" width="332"/>Accelerated gradient descent on a quadratic optimization problem in dimension \(d=1000\). See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].  </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Other algorithms.</strong> It is tempting to test it on other optimization algorithms. For example, as explained in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], Richardson extrapolation can be used to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe</a> algorithm, where sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. Others could be tried.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While above we have focused on Richardson extrapolation applied to the number of iterations of an iterative algorithm, it is most often used in integration methods (for computing integrals or solving ordinary differential equations), and then often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method">Romberg-Richardson extrapolation</a>. Within machine learning, in a similar spirit, this can be applied to the step-size of stochastic gradient descent [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6514-stochastic-gradient-richardson-romberg-markov-chain-monte-carlo.pdf">11</a>], which I now describe.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the minimization of a function \(F(x)\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), which can be written as an expectation as $$F(x) = \mathbb{E}_{z} f(x,z).$$ We assume that we have access to \(n\) independent and identically distributed observations (i.i.d.) \(z_1,\dots,z_n\). This is a typical scenario in machine learning, where \(f(x,z)\) represents the loss for the predictor parameterized by \(x\) on the observation \(z\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">The stochastic gradient method is particularly well adapted, and we consider here a single pass, as $$x_i= x_{i-1} – \gamma f'(x_{i-1},z_i),$$ where the gradient is taken with respect to the first variable, for \(i = 1,\dots,n\). It is known that with a constant step-size, when \(n\) tends to infinity, \(x_n\) will <em>not</em> converge to the minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(F\), as the algorithm always moves [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0324039">16</a>], as illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2488" height="279" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/logistic_2d-1.gif" width="403"/>Stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem: (blue) without averaging, (red) with averaging.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">One way to damp the oscillations is to consider averaging, that is, $$ y_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i$$ (we consider uniform averaging for simplicity). For least-squares regression, this leads to a converging algorithm [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">12</a>] with attractive properties for ill-conditioned problems (see also <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-sum-of-a-geometric-series-is-all-you-need/">January’s blog post</a>). However, for general loss functions, it is shown in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>] that \(y_n\) converges to some \(y^{(\gamma)} \neq x_\ast\). There is a bias due to a step-size \(\gamma\) that does not go to zero. In order to apply Richardson extrapolation, together with Aymeric Dieuleveut and Alain Durmus [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>], we showed that $$ y^{(\gamma)} = x_\ast + \gamma \Delta + O(\gamma^2),$$ for some \(\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^d\) with some complex expression. Thus, we have $$2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2),$$ thus gaining one order. If we consider the iterate \(y_n^{(\gamma)}\) and \(y_n^{(2 \gamma)}\) associated to the two step-sizes \(\gamma\) and \(2 \gamma\), the linear combination $$2 y_n^{(\gamma)} – y_n^{(2\gamma)} $$ has an improved behavior as it tends to \(2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2)\): it remains not convergent, but get to way smaller values. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2525" height="274" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SGD_logistic-1.png" width="359"/>Averaged stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem in dimension 20.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Higher-order extrapolation.</strong> If we can accelerate a sequence by extrapolation, why not extrapolate the extrapolated sequence? This is possible if we have an higher-order expansion of the form $$ y^{(\gamma)} = \theta_\ast + \gamma \Delta_1 + \gamma^2 \Delta_2 + O(\gamma^3),$$ for some (typically unknown) vectors \(\Delta_1\) and \(\Delta_2\). Then, the sharp reader can check that $$3 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 3 y_n^{(2\gamma)} +  y_n^{(3\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first two orders \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma^2\). This is illustrated above for SGD.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not extrapolate the extrapolation of the extrapolated sequence? One can check that $$4 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 6 y_n^{(2\gamma)} + 4  y_n^{(3\gamma)}  -y_n^{(4\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first three orders of an expansion of \(y^{(\gamma)}\). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">binomial coefficient</a> aficionados have already noticed the pattern there, and checked that $$ \sum_{i=1}^{m+1} (-1)^{i-1} { m+1 \choose i} y_n^{(i\gamma)}$$ will lead to cancellations of the first \(m\) orders.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not go on forever? First because \(m+1\) recursions have to be run in parallel, and second, because the constant in front of the term in \(\gamma^{m+1}\) typically explodes, a phenomenon common to many expansion methods.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now explore the application of Richardson extrapolation to regularization methods. In a nutshell, regularization allows to make an estimation problem more stable (less subject to variations for statistical problems) or the algorithm faster (for optimization problems). However, regularization adds a bias that needs to be removed. In this section, we apply Richardson extrapolation to the regularization parameter to reduce this bias. I will only present an application to smoothing for non-smooth optimization (see an application to  ridge regression in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-smooth optimization problems</strong>. We consider the minimization of a convex function of the form \(f = h + g\), where \(h\) is smooth and \(g\) is non-smooth. These optimization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning and signal processing, where the lack of smoothness can come from (a) non-smooth losses such as max-margin losses used in support vector machines and more generally structured output classification [<a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2005/proceedings/papers/113_StructuredPrediction_TaskarEtAl.pdf">13</a>], and (b) sparsity-inducing regularizers (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">14</a>] and references therein). While many algorithms can be used to deal with this non-smoothness, we consider a classical smoothing technique below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Nesterov smoothing</strong>. In this section, we consider the smoothing approach of Nesterov [<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A_Files/Nesterov-2005.pdf">15</a>] where the non-smooth term is “smoothed” into \(g_\lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is a regularization parameter, and accelerated gradient descent is used to minimize \(h+g_\lambda\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">A typical way of smoothing the function \(g\) is to add \(\lambda\) times a strongly convex regularizer (such as the squared Euclidean norm) to the Fenchel conjugate of \(g\); this leads to a function \(g_\lambda\) which has a smoothness constant (defined as the maximum of the largest eigenvalues of all Hessians) proportional to \(1/\lambda\), with a uniform error of \(O(\lambda)\) between \(g\) and \(g_\lambda\). Given that accelerated gradient descent leads to an iterate with excess function values proportional to \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) after \(k\) iterations, with the choice of \(\lambda \propto 1/k\), this leads to an excess in function values proportional to \(1/k\), which improves on the subgradient method which converges in \(O(1/\sqrt{k})\). Note that the amount of regularization depends on the number of iterations, so that this smoothing method is not “anytime”.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Richardson extrapolation.</strong> If we denote by \(x_\lambda\) the minimizer of \(h+g_\lambda\) and \( x_\ast\) the global minimizer of \( f=h+g\), if we can show that \( x_\lambda = x_\ast + \lambda \Delta + O(\lambda^2)\), then \( x^{(1)}_\lambda = 2 x_\lambda – x_{2\lambda} = O(\lambda^2)\) and we can expand \( f(x_\lambda^{(1)})  = f(x_\ast)  + O(\lambda^2)\), which is better than the \(O(\lambda)\) approximation without extrapolation. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, given a number of iterations \(k\), with \( \lambda \propto k^{-2/3}\), to balance the two terms \( 1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \( \lambda^2\),  we get an overall convergence rate for the non-smooth problem of \( k^{-4/3}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>\(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation</strong>. Like above for the step-size, we can also consider \(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation \(x_{\lambda}^{(m)}\), which leads to a bias proportional to \(\lambda^{m+1}\). Thus, if we consider \(\lambda \propto 1/k^{2/(m+2)}\), to balance the terms \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \(\lambda^{m+1}\), we get an error for the non-smooth problem of \(1/k^{2(m+1)/(m+2)}\), which can get arbitrarily close to \(1/k^2\) when \(m\) gets large. The downsides (like for the extrapolation on the step-size above) are that (a) the constants in front of the asymptotic equivalent may blow up (a classical problem in high-order expansions), and (b) \(m\)-step extrapolation requires running the algorithm \(m\) times (this can be down in parallel). In the experiment below, 3-step extrapolation already brings in most of the benefits.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to experimentally study the benefits of extrapolation, for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">Lasso</a> optimization problem, and for a series of regularization parameters equal to \(2^{i}\) for \(i\) between \(-18\) and \(1\) (sampled every \(1/5\)), we run accelerated gradient descent on \(h+g_\lambda\) and we plot the value of \(f(x)-f(x_\ast)\) for the various estimates, where for each number of iterations, we minimize over the regularization parameter. This is an oracle version of varying \(\lambda\) as a function of the number of iterations. </p>

There is indeed a strong improvement approaching the rate \(1/k^2\).</figure></div>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">These last two blog posts were dedicated to acceleration techniques coming from numerical analysis. They are cheap to implement, typically do not interfere with the underlying algorithm, and when used in the appropriate situation, can bring in significant speed-ups.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As data science has broadened its scope in recent years, a number of domains have applied computational methods for classification and prediction to evaluate individuals in high-stakes settings. These developments have led to an active line of recent discussion in the public sphere about the consequences of algorithmic prediction for notions of fairness and equity. In part, this discussion has involved a basic tension between competing notions of what it means for such classifications to be fair to different groups. We consider several of the key fairness conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and in particular how these properties operate when the goal is to rank-order a set of applicants by some criterion of interest, and then to select the top-ranking applicants. The talk will be based on joint work with Sendhil Mullainathan and Manish Raghavan.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">I don’t know of any user of iterative algorithms who has not complained one day about their convergence speed. Whether the data are too big, the processors not fast or numerous enough, waiting for an algorithm to converge unfortunately remains a core practical component of computer science and applied mathematics. This was already a concern long before computers were invented (and most of the techniques I will describe date back to the early 19th century): imagine you are doing all the operations (multiplications, additions, divisions) by hand, wouldn’t you want some cheap way to accelerate your algorithm (and here literally reduce your pain)?</p>



<p class="justify-text">Acceleration is a key concept in numerical analysis and can be carried through in two main ways. The first way is to modify some steps of the algorithm (such as Nesterov acceleration for gradient descent, or <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">Chebyshev</a> / <a href="https://francisbach.com/jacobi-polynomials/">Jacobi</a> acceleration for linear recursions). This requires a good knowledge of the inner structure of the underlying algorithm. A second way is to totally ignore the specifics of the algorithm, and see the acceleration problem as trying to find good “combinations” of the observed iterates that converge faster.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I thus consider a sequence of iterates \((x_k)_{k \geq 0}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) obtained from an iterative algorithm \(x_{k+1} = T(x_k)\), which will typically be an optimization algorithm. The main question I will address is: Can we do better than outputting the last iterate?</p>



<p class="justify-text">This has a long history in numerical analysis, where many techniques have been developed for uni-dimensional sequences. Acceleration techniques vary according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_convergence">type of convergence</a> of the original sequence (quadratic, linear, sublinear), the amount of knowledge about the asymptotic behavior, and the possibility of extensions to high-dimensional and noisy problems.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Acceleration techniques are often based on an explicit or implicit modelling of the sequence \(x_k\), either through a model of the function \(T: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) (the iteration of the algorithm) or through an asymptotic expansion of \(x_k\). In this post, I will focus on linearly convergent sequences, that is, sequences \(x_k\) converging to some \(x_\ast\) at an exponential rate. As we will see, this will done through modelling \(x_k\) as an autoregressive process.</p>



<p class="justify-text">I will first start from the simplest scheme, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</a> from 1926 [1], then look at higher order generalizations still in one dimension, and finally to the general vector case. We will then apply all that to gradient descent.</p>



<h2>Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This is the simplest of all techniques and the source of all others in this post. We try to model \(x_k\in \mathbb{R}\) as first-order auto-regressive sequence, that is, \(x_{k+1} = ax_{k}+b\), for \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\). The method works by (a) estimating \(a\) and \(b\) from a sequence of few consecutive (here three) iterates, and (b) extrapolating by computing the limit \(x_{\rm acc}\) of the estimated model. Given that we fit the model to consecutive iterates \((x_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2})\), the model \((a,b)\) will also depend on \(k\), as well as its limit \(x_{\rm acc}\). In order to avoid having too many \(k\)’s in my notations, I will drop the dependence in \(k\) of the model parameters.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this situation, the model recursion has a limit when \(a \neq 1\), and the limit is \(x_{\rm acc} =  \frac{b}{1-a}\). In order to fit the two parameters, we need two equations, which can be obtained by considering two consecutive evaluations of the recursions (which require three iterates). That is, we consider the linear system in \((a,b)\): $$ \Big\{ \begin{array}{ll} ax_{k}+b  &amp; = x_{k+1} \\    ax_{k+1}+b &amp; = x_{k+2} \end{array}$$ which can be solved in a variety of ways. All of them are equivalent, but naturally lead to different extensions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Solving by elimination.</strong> We can eliminate \(b\) by subtracting the two equations, leading to $$ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1} = a ( x_{k+1} – x_{k}),$$  and thus $$a = \frac{ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}}.$$ We then get $$b = x_{k+1} – a x_{k} = x_{k+1} –  \frac{ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}} x_{k} =  \frac{  x_{k+1}^2 – x_{k} x_{k+2}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}}, $$ and the extrapolating sequence $$x_{\rm acc} = \frac{b}{1-a} = \frac{x_{k} x_{k+2} – x_{k+1}^2 }{-2 x_{k+1} + x_{k+2} + x_{k}},$$ which we denote \(x^{(1)}_k\), to highlight its dependence on \(k\). Note that to compute \(x^{(1)}_k\), we need access to the three iterates \((x_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2})\), and thus, when comparing the original sequence to the extrapolated one, we will compare \(x_k\) and \(x^{(1)}_{k-2}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Asymptotic auto-regressive model</strong>. A key feature of the acceleration techniques that I describe in this post is that although they implicitly or explicitly model sequence with auto-regressive processes, the models do not need to be correct, that is, they also work if the autoregressive recursion is true only asymptotically, for example \(\displaystyle \frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast}\) converging to a constant \(a \in [-1,1)\). Then we also get some acceleration, which can be quantified (see the end of the post for details), and for which we present a classical example below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Approximating \(\pi\).</strong> We consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80">Leibniz formula</a>, which is one of many ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80">approximating \(\pi\)</a>: $$ \pi = \lim_{k \to +\infty} x_k  \mbox{ with } x_k = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}.$$ This formula can be proved by expanding the derivative \(x \mapsto \frac{1}{1+x^2}\) of \(x \mapsto \arctan x\) as a power series and then integrating it. We can check that $$\frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast} =  \ – 1 + \frac{1}{k} + o( \frac{1}{k}), $$ and as detailed at the end of the post, we should expect the error to go from \(1/k\) to \(1/k^3\).  Below, we show the first 10 iterates of the two sequences, with the correct significant digits in bold. $$ \begin{array}{|l|l|l|} \hline k &amp; x_k &amp;  x_k^{(1)} \\ \hline  1  &amp;   4.0000   &amp;  \times \\      2  &amp;  2.6667     &amp;    \times \\  3  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.4667   &amp; \mathbf{3.1}667 \\   4 &amp;   2.8952  &amp;  \mathbf{3.1}333 \\     5  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.3397  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}52 \\  6 &amp;   2.9760 &amp;   \mathbf{3.1}397 \\   7  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.2837  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}27 \\   8  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.0171  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}09 \\  9  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.2524  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}21 \\   10  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.0418 &amp;  \mathbf{3.141}3 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ We see that the extrapolated sequence converges much faster.

Notice the improvement from \(O(1/k)\) to \(O(1/k^3)\).</figure></div>



<h2>Higher-order one-dimensional extensions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process relies on fitting a first-order auto-regressive model, or on assuming that \(x_{k+1} – x_\ast – a (x_k – x_\ast) \to 0\) asymptotically. This can be extended to \(m\)-th order constant recursions. This corresponds to modelling \(x_k\) as the sum of \(m\) exponentials.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus try to fit the model $$x_{k+m} = a_0 x_k + a_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + a_{m-1} x_{k+m-1} + b = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i x_{k+i} + b, $$ which has \(m+1\) parameters. We thus need \(m + 1\) equations, that is we consider the recursion for \(k, k+1,\dots, k+m\), which requires the knowledge of the \(2m+1\) iterates \(x_k, x_{k+1},\dots,x_{k+2m}\). This leads to the \(m+1\) equations: $$x_{k+m+j} = a_0 x_{k+j} + a_1 x_{k+j+1} + \cdots + a_{m-1} x_{k+j+m-1} + b = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i x_{k+j+i} + b,$$ for \(j \in \{0,\dots,m\}\). This is a system with \(m+1\) unknowns and \(m+1\) equations, from which we could get all \(a_j\)’s and \(b\), and then the model limit as the extrapolated sequence \(x^{(m)}_k = \frac{b}{1 – a_0 – a_1 – \cdots – a_{m-1}}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This linear system can be solved in a variety of ways. At the end of the blog post, I show how it can be solved using determinants of Hankel-like matrices, often referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanks_transformation">Shanks transformation</a>, which then leads to an iterative algorithm dating back from Wynn [2], which is called the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_algorithme">\(\varepsilon\)-algorithm</a>. In order to smooth our way to the vector case extension, I will present it in a slightly non-standard way. See [3] for a detailed survey on acceleration and extrapolation.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Instead of learning the model parameters to estimate \(x_{k+m}\) from the past iterates, we focus directly on the prediction of the limit \(x_{\rm acc}\) by looking for real numbers \(c_0,\dots,c_m\) such that for all \(k\), $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_{k+i} – x_{\rm acc} ) = 0,$$ with the arbitrary normalization \(\sum_{i=0}^m c_i = 1\). The \(c_i\)’s can be obtained from the \(a_i\)’s and \(b\) as \((c_0,c_1,\dots,c_{m-1},c_m)\propto (a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{m-1},-1)\). We then have $$x_{\rm acc} = \sum_{i=0}^m c_{i} x_{k+i}.$$ Again, the parameters \(c_i\)’s depend on \(k\), but we omit this dependence.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to estimate the \(m+1\) parameters \(c_0,\dots,c_m\), we subtract two versions of the equality for \(k\) and \(k+1\), leading to $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_{k+1+i} – x_{k+i} ) = 0.$$ Defining the matrix \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times (m+1)}\) by $$U_{ji} = x_{k+1+i+j} – x_{k+i+j},$$ for \(i \in \{0,\dots,m\}\) and \(j \in \{0,\dots,m-1\}\), we have $$ U c = 0. $$ Together with the constraint \(1_{m+1}^\top c = 1\), this leads to the correct number of equations to estimate \(c\), from \(2m+1\) iterates \(x_k,\dots,x_{k+2m}\). The extrapolated iterate \(x^{(m)}_k\) is then $$x^{(m)}_k = x_{\rm acc} =   \sum_{i=0}^m c_{i} x_{k+i}.$$ Note that the extrapolation is exact when the sequence is exactly following a \(m\)-th order recursion. See an example of application on the Leibniz formula below.</p>

Acceleration is possible only up to machine precision.</figure></div>



<h2>Extension to vectors</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider accelerating vector sequences \(x_k \in \mathbb{R}^d\). There are multiple approaches to extend acceleration from real numbers to vectors, as presented in [4, 5]. The simplest way is to apply high-order extrapolation to all coordinates separately (which is often called the vector \(\varepsilon\)-algorithm [10]); this depends however a lot on the chosen basis, requires too many linear systems to solve, and performs worse (see examples below for gradient descent). We now present a vector extension which exists under many names: the Eddy-Mesina method [6,7], reduced rank extrapolation [4, 11, 12], or Anderson acceleration [8]. </p>



<p class="justify-text">We want to model the sequence \(x_k \in \mathbb{R}^d\) as $$x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + b,$$ where \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) and \(b \in \mathbb{R}^d\). By a simple variable / equation counting arguments, there are \(d^2+d\) parameters, and we thus need \(d+1\) equations in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and thus \(d+2\) consecutive iterates, to estimate \(A\) and \(b\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to use only \(m+2\) iterates, with \(m \) much less than \(d\), we will focus directly on the extrapolation equation $$x_{\rm acc} = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m}, $$ with the constraint that \(c_0+c_1+\cdots+c_m =1\). Therefore, we will not try to explicitly fit the model parameters \(A\) and \(b\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">A sufficient condition for good extrapolation weights is that the extrapolated version is close for two consecutive \(k\)’s, that is $$c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m} \approx c_0 x_{k+1} + c_1 x_{k+2}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m+1},$$ which can be rewritten as $$c_0 (x_{k}-x_{k+1}) + c_1 ( x_{k+1} -x_{k+2}) + \cdots + c_m (x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1}) \approx 0.$$ A natural criterion is thus to minimize the \(\ell_2\)-norm $$ \big\| c_0 \Delta x_{k} + c_1  \Delta x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m \Delta x_{k+m} \big\|_2 \mbox{ such that } c_0+c_1+\cdots+c_m = 1,$$ where \(\Delta x_{i} = x_{i} -x_{i+1}\). Denoting \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times (m+1)}\) the matrix with columns \(\Delta x_{k}, \dots,  \Delta x_{k+m}\), we need to minimize \(\| U c \|_2\) such that \(c^\top 1_{m+1} = 1\), whose solution is $$ c \propto ( U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}, \mbox{ that is, } c = \frac{1}{1_{m+1}^\top (U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}}  ( U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}.$$ Note that while the weights \(c_0,\dots,c_m\) sum to one, they may be negative, that is, the extrapolated sequence is not always a convex combination (hence the name extrapolation). Moreover, note that unless \(m\) is large enough, the optimal \(U c\) is in general not equal to zero (it is when modelling real sequences, see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For \(m=1\), the solution is particularly simple, as we need to minimize $$ \|\Delta x_{k+1}  – c_0 ( \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k ) \|^2,$$ leading to $$c_0 = \frac{\Delta x_{k+1}^\top ( \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k )}{ \|  \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k \|^2} \mbox{ and } c_1 = \frac{\Delta x_{k}^\top ( \Delta x_{k} – \Delta x_{k+1} )}{ \|  \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k \|^2}.$$ The acute reader can check that when \(d=1\), we recover Aitken’s formula. See an example in two dimensions below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2276" height="319" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/anderson_2d.gif" width="380"/>Anderson acceleration in two dimensions. The sequence is following an auto-regressive process with a symmetric \(A\) with eigenvalues in \((-1,1)\). Anderson acceleration cancels the oscillation due to the eigenvalue with largest magnitude.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recovering one-dimensional sequence acceleration.</strong> Given a real sequence \(y_k \in \mathbb{R}\), we can define the vector \(x_k\) in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) as $$x_k = \left( \begin{array}{c} y_k \\  y_{k+1} \\ \vdots \\ y_{k+m-1} \end{array} \right).$$ One can then check that the matrix \(U\) defined for this vector sequence is exactly the same as the matrix \(U\) defined earlier for the real valued sequence. The optimal \(\| Uc \|\) is then equal to zero (which is not the case in general).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>When is it exact?</strong> The derivation I followed is only intuitive, and as for the other acceleration mechanisms, a natural question is: when is it exact? We will consider linear recursions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Analysis for linear recursions.</strong> Assuming that \(x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + b\) is exact for all \(k \geq 0\), then \(x_k – x_\ast = A^{k} ( x_0 – x_\ast)\), and thus, following [13], $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i (x_{k+i}-x_{k+i+1}) = \sum_{i=0}^m c_i A^{i} A^{k}(I – A )(x_0 -x_\ast) = P_m(A)(I – A) A^{k}(x_0 -x_\ast) ,$$ for \(P_m(\sigma)  =  \sum_{i=0}^m c_i \sigma^{i}\) a \(m\)-th order polynomial such that \(P_m(1) = 1\). We can write \(Uc\)  as $$ Uc = P_m(A) ( x_k – x_{k+1}) = ( I – A)  P_m(A)  (x_k – x_\ast) .$$ The error between the true limit and the extrapolation is equal to: $$  x_\ast – \sum_{i=0}^m c_i x_{k+i} = \sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_\ast – x_{k+i}  ) = P_m(A) (   x_\ast -x_{k}) = (I-A)^{-1} Uc.$$ Thus, we have $$ \Big\| x_\ast – \sum_{i=0}^m c_i x_{k+i} \Big\|_2 \leq \| U c \|_2 \times  \|(I – A)^{-1}\|_{\rm op} \leq \|(I – A)^{-1}\|_{\rm op}  \|I – A\|_{\rm op} \|P_m(A) ( x_k – x_\ast)\|.  $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The method will be exact when one can find a degree \(m\) polynomial so that \(P_m(A) (x_{k} – x_\ast) = 0 \), and a sufficient condition is that \(P_m(A)=0\), which is only possible if \(A\) had only \(m\) distinct eigenvalues. This is exactly minimal polynomial extrapolation [9]. Another situation is when \(m = d\) (like for the special case of real sequences above). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Otherwise, the method will be inexact, but the method can find a good polynomial \(P_m\), and the error is less than the infimum of \( \|P_m(A) ( x_k – x_\ast)\|\) over all polynomial of degree \(m\) such that \(P_m(1)=1\). Assuming that the matrix \(A\) is symmetric and with all eigenvalues between \(-\rho\) and \(\rho\) (which will be the case for the gradient method below), then the error is less than the infimum of \(\sup_{\sigma \in [-\rho,\rho]} |P_m(\sigma)|\),  which is attained for the Chebyshev polynomial (see a <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">previous post</a>). The improvement in terms of convergence is similar to Chebyshev acceleration, but (a) without the need to know \(\rho\) in advance (the method is totally adaptive), and (b) with a provable robustness when the iterates deviate from following an autoregressive process (see [13] for details).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Going beyond linear recursions. </strong>As presented, Anderson acceleration does not lead to stable acceleration (see the experiment below for gradient descent). The main reason is that when iterates deviate from an autoregressive process, or when the recursion is naturally noisy, the estimation of the parameters \(c\) is unstable, in particular because the matrix \(U^\top U\) which has to be inverted is severely ill-conditioned [14]. In a joint work with Damien Scieur and Alexandre d’Aspremont, we considered regularizing  the estimation of \(c\) by penalizing its \(\ell_2\)-norm. We thus minimize  \( \| U c \|_2^2 + \lambda \| c\|_2^2\) such that \(c^\top 1_{m+1} = 1\), whose solution is $$ c \propto ( U^\top U + \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}, \mbox{ that is, } c = \frac{1}{1_{m+1}^\top (U^\top U + \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}}  ( U^\top U +  \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}.$$ This simple modification leads to theoretical guarantees for non-linear recursions, and I will refer to it as regularized non-linear acceleration (RNA, see [13] for details; the “non-linearity” comes from the non-linear dependence of \(c\) on the iterates).</p>



<h2>Application to gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can apply RNA to the recursion, $$x_{k+1}  = x_k – \gamma \nabla f(x_k),$$ where \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) is a differentiable function, and \(\gamma\) a step-size. In the plot below, we consider accelerating gradient descent with \(m\)-th order RNA, with \(m=8\). We compare this acceleration with applying RNA to each variable separately (“RNA-univ.”), and to the unregularized version (“Anderson”). We can see the benefits of our simple extrapolation steps, and in particular the instability of unregularized acceleration.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2331" height="326" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/anderson_grad_nonest.png" width="419"/>Gradient descent on a regularized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> problem, with 1000 observations in dimension 100. We compare regular gradient descent, to plain Anderson acceleration (with no regularization), RNA [13] applied to each variable separately, and RNA. All accelerations are with order \(m =8\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In order to obtain stronger benefits from non-linear acceleration, several extensions are considered in [13]; in particular line search to find the good regularization parameter \(\lambda\) is quite useful. Another interesting extension is the <em>online</em> version of the algorithm [16, section 2.5], where the extrapolated sequence is used directly within the acceleration procedure, and not as a separate sequence with no interaction with the original gradient method: this corresponds to using RNA to accelerate iterates coming from RNA!</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, while the simplest theoretical guarantees come for deterministic convex optimization problems and gradient descent, RNA can be extended to stochastic algorithms [15] and to non-convex optimization problems such as the ones encountered in deep learning [16].</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I described acceleration techniques that combine iterates of an existing algorithm, without the need to understand finely the inner structure of the original algorithm. They come at little extra-cost and can provide strong benefits.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This month’s post was dedicated to algorithms which converge linearly, that is, the iterates are asymptotically equivalent to sums of exponentials. Next month, I will consider situations where the convergence is sublinear, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation">Richardson extrapolation</a> excels.</p>

<h2>Asymptotic analysis for Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In one dimension, we do not need the auto-regressive model to be exact, and an asymptotic analysis is possible. The asymptotic condition corresponds to \(\displaystyle \frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast}\) converging to a constant \(a \in [-1,1)\). More precisely if $$\frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast} = a + \varepsilon_{k+1},$$ with \(\varepsilon_k\) tending to zero, then we can estimate \(a\) through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitkens \(\Delta^2\) method</a> [1] as, $$ a_{k+1} = \frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{x_{k}-x_{k-1}} = \frac{(x_{k+1}-x_\ast) – (x_k-x_\ast) }{(x_{k} – x_\ast) -( x_{k-1}-x_\ast) } = \frac{ a + \varepsilon_{k+1} – 1}{1 – 1/(a+\varepsilon_{k})} = a + \varepsilon_{k+1} + o( \varepsilon_{k+1}).$$ A closer Taylor expansion leads to $$ a + \varepsilon_{k} + \frac{1}{a-1}( \varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}) + O(\varepsilon_{k}^2).$$ We can then provide a better estimate of \(x_\ast\) as $$ \frac{x_{k+1} – a_{k+1}x_k}{1- a_{k+1}} = x_\ast + \frac{x_{k+1} -x_\ast – a_{k+1}( x_k-x_\ast)}{1- a_{k+1}} = x_\ast + \frac{(a+\varepsilon_{k+1}-a_{k+1}) ( x_k – x_\ast)}{1-a_{k+1}},$$ whose difference with \(x_\ast\) is equivalent to $$ \frac{(a+\varepsilon_k-a_{k+1}) ( x_k – x_\ast)}{1-a }  \sim \frac{\varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}}{(1-a)^2} ( x_k – x_\ast).$$ We have thus provided an acceleration of order \(\displaystyle \frac{\varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}}{(1-a)^2} \).</p>



<h2>High-order Shanks transformation</h2>



<p>In order to relate our formulas to classical expressions, we first rewrite the recursion for \(m=1\) and then \(m=2\), and then to general \(m\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>First-order recursion (Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\)).</strong> We write the autorecursive recursion as $$ (x_{k+1} – x_\ast) = a ( x_{k} – x_\ast) \Leftrightarrow c_0(x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_\ast) = 0 ,$$ with the constraint \(c_0 + c_1 = 1\), that is, \(c_0 = \frac{-a}{1-a}\) and \(c_1 = \frac{1}{1-a}\). We can then write \(x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}\), and we have the linear system in \((c_0,c_1,x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ x_k &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using Cramer’s formula $$x_{\rm acc} = x_\ast = \frac{\left| \begin{array}{cc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}  \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} \end{array}\right|}{\left| \begin{array}{cc}  x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}  \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right|},$$  which leads to the same formula for \(x^{(1)}_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Second-order recursion.</strong> Here, we only consider the case \(m=2\) for simplicity. We consider the model, $$c_0 (x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1} – x_\ast)+ c_{2} (x_{k+2} – x_\ast) = 0, $$ with the normalization \(c_0 + c_1 + c_2 = 1\). We can then extract \(x_\ast\) as $$ x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} +  c_2 x_{k+2}.$$ In order to provide the extra \(2\) equations that are necessary to estimate the three parameters, we take first order differences and get $$c_0 (x_k -x_{k+1}) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}) +  c_2 ( x_{k+2} – x_{k+3} ) =0,$$ for \(k\) and \(k+1\). This leads to the linear system in \((c_0,c_1, c_2, x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3} &amp; 0 \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+2} &amp;  – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ c_2 \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c}  0  \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule">Cramer’s rule</a> (and classical manipulations of determinants) as $$x_k^{(2)} = \frac{\left| \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3}   \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4}   \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+2}    \end{array} \right|}{\left| \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3}     \\ x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4}   \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp;  \end{array} \right|}.$$  </p>



<p class="justify-text">The formula extends to order \(m\) (see below) and is often called the Shanks transformation; it is cumbersome and not easy to use. However, the coefficients can be computed recursively (which is to be expected for a Hankel matrix, but rather tricky to derive), through Wynn’s \(\varepsilon\)-algorithm.  See [3] for a survey on acceleration and extrapolation.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Higher-order recursion.</strong> We consider the model, for \(m \geq 1\), $$c_0 (x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1} – x_\ast) + \cdots + c_{m} (x_{k+m} – x_\ast) = 0, $$ with the normalization \(c_0 + c_1 + \cdots + c_m = 1\). We can then extract \(x_\ast\) as $$ x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m x_{k+m}.$$ In order to provide the extra \(m\) equations, we take first order differences and get $$c_0 (x_k -x_{k+1}) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}) + \cdots + c_m ( x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} ) =0,$$ for \(k, k+1,\dots, k+m-1\). This leads to the linear system in \((c_0,c_1,\cdots, c_m, x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{ccccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} &amp; 0 \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m+1} – x_{k+m+2} &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots  &amp; \vdots \\ x_{k+m-1}-x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m}-x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m-1} – x_{k+2m} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\ x_{k+m+1} &amp; x_{k+m+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m+1} &amp;  – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_m \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using Cramer’s formula $$x_\ast = \frac{\left|\begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m+1} – x_{k+m+2}   \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots  \\ x_{k+m-1}-x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m}-x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m-1} – x_{k+2m} \\ x_{k+m+1} &amp; x_{k+m+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m+1}  \end{array} \right|}{\left|\begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m+1} – x_{k+m+2}   \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots  \\ x_{k+m-1}-x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m}-x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m-1} – x_{k+2m} \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \end{array}  \right|}.$$  </p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In a <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">previous post</a> I reported on the beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">recent result</a> by Natarajan and Wright showing the astounding power of multi-prover interactive proofs with quantum provers sharing entanglement: in letters, <img alt="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEEXP%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}"/>. In this post I want to report on follow-up work with Ji, Natarajan, Wright, and Yuen, that we just posted to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">arXiv</a>. This time however I will tell the story from a personal point of view, with all the caveats that this implies: the “hard science” will be limited (but there could be a hint as to how “science”, to use a big word, “progresses”, to use an ill-defined one), the story is far too long, and it might be mostly of interest to me only. It’s a one-sided story, but that has to be. (In particular below I may at times attribute credit in the form “X had this idea”. This is my recollection only, and it is likely to be inaccurate. Certainly I am ignoring a lot of important threads.) I wrote this because I enjoyed recollecting some of the best moments in the story just as much as some the hardest; it is fun to look back and find meanings in ideas that initially appeared disconnected. Think of it as an example of how different lines of work can come together in unexpected ways; a case for open-ended research. It’s also an antidote against despair that I am preparing for myself: whenever I feel I’ve been stuck on a project for far too long, I’ll come back to this post and ask myself if it’s been 14 years yet — if not, then press on.</p>
<p>It likely comes as a surprise to me only that I am no longer fresh out of the cradle. My academic life started in earnest some 14 years ago, when in the Spring of 2006 I completed my Masters thesis in Computer Science under the supervision of Julia Kempe, at Orsay in France. I had met Julia the previous term: her class on quantum computing was, by far, the best-taught and most exciting course in the Masters program I was attending, and she had gotten me instantly hooked. Julia agreed to supervise my thesis, and suggested that I look into some interesting recent result by Stephanie Wehner that linked the study of entanglement and nonlocality in quantum mechanics to complexity-theoretic questions about interactive proof systems (specifically, this was Stephanie’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508201">paper</a> showing that <img alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BQIP%7D%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}"/>).</p>
<p>At the time the topic was very new. It had been initiated the previous year with a beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404076">paper</a> by Cleve et al. (that I have recommended to many a student since!). It was a perfect fit for me: the mathematical aspects of complexity theory and quantum computing connected to my undergraduate background, while the relative concreteness of quantum mechanics (it is a physical theory after all) spoke to my desire for real-world connection (not “impact” or even “application” — just “connection”). Once I got myself up to speed in the area (which consisted of three papers: the two I already mentioned, together with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0102013">paper</a> by Kobayashi and Matsumoto where they studied interactive proofs with quantum messages), Julia suggested looking into the the “entangled-prover” class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> introduced in the aforementioned paper by Cleve et al. Nothing was known about this class! Nothing besides the trivial inclusion of single-prover interactive proofs, IP, and the containment in…ALL, the trivial class that contains all languages.<br/>
Yet the characterization MIP=NEXP of its classical counterpart by Babai et al. in the 1990s had led to one of the most productive lines of work in complexity of the past few decades, through the PCP theorem and its use from hardness of approximation to efficient cryptographic schemes. Surely, studying <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> had to be a productive direction? In spite of its well-established connection to classical complexity theory, via the formalism of interactive proofs, this was a real gamble. The study of entanglement from the complexity-theoretic perspective was entirely new, and bound to be fraught with difficulty; very few results were available and the existing lines of works, from the foundations of nonlocality to more recent endeavors in device-independent cryptography, provided little other starting point than strong evidence that even the simplest examples came with many unanswered questions. But my mentor was fearless, and far from a novice in terms of defraying new areas, having done pioneering work in areas ranging from quantum random walks to Hamiltonian complexity through adiabatic computation. Surely this would lead to something?</p>
<p>It certainly did. More sleepless nights than papers, clearly, but then the opposite would only indicate dullness. Julia’s question led to far more unexpected consequences than I, or I believe she, could have imagined at the time. I am writing this post to celebrate, in a personal way, the latest step in 15 years of research by dozens of researchers: today my co-authors and I uploaded to the quant-ph arXiv what we consider a complete characterization of the power of entangled-prover interactive proof systems by proving the equality <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}"/>, the class of all recursively enumerable languages (a complete problem for RE is the halting problem). Without goign too much into the result itself (if you’re interested, we have a long introduction waiting for you), and since this is a personal blog, I will continue on with some personal thoughts about the path that got us there.</p>
<p>When Julia &amp; I started working on the question, our main source of inspiration were the results by Cleve et al. showing that the nonlocal correlations of entanglement had interesting consequences when seen through the lens of interactive proof systems in complexity theory. Since the EPR paper a lot of work in understanding entanglement had already been accomplished in the Physics community, most notably by Mermin, Peres, Bell, and more recently the works in device-indepent quantum cryptography by Acin, Pironio, Scarani and many others stimulated by Ekert’s proposal for quantum key distribution and Mayers and Yao’s idea for “device-independent cryptography”. By then we certainly knew that “spooky action-at-a-distance” did not entail any faster-than-light communication, and indeed was not really “action-at-a-distance” in the first place but merely “correlation-at-a-distance”. What Cleve et al. recognized is that these “spooky correlations-at-a-distance” were sufficiently special so as to not only give numerically different values in “Bell inequalities”, the tool invented by Bell to evidence nonlocality in quantum mechanics, but also have some potentially profound consequences in complexity theory. In particular, examples such as the “Magic Square game” demonstrated that enough correlation could be gained from entanglement so as to defeat basic proof systems whose soundness relied only on the absence of communication between the provers, an assumption that until then had been wrongly equated with the assumption that any computation performed by the provers could be modeled entirely locally. I think that the fallacy of this implicit assumption came as a surprise to complexity theorists, who may still not have entirely internalized it. Yet the perfect quantum strategy for the Magic Square game provides a very concrete “counter-example” to the soundness of the “clause-vs-variable” game for 3SAT. Indeed this game, a reformulation by Aravind and Cleve-Mermin of a Bell Inequality discovered by Mermin and Peres in 1990, can be easily re-framed as a 3SAT system of equations that is <em>not</em> satisfiable and yet is such that the associated two-player clause-vs-variable game has a <em>perfect</em> quantum strategy. It is this observation, made in the paper by Cleve et al., that gave the first strong hint that the use of entanglement in interactive proof systems could make many classical results in the area go awry.</p>
<p>By importing the study of non-locality into complexity theory Cleve et al. immediately brought it into the realm of asymptotic analysis. Complexity theorists don’t study fixed objects, they study families of objects that tend to have a uniform underlying structure and whose interesting properties manifest themselves “in the limit”. As a result of this new perspective focus shifted from the study of single games or correlations to infinite families thereof. Some of the early successes of this translation include the “unbounded violations” that arose from translating asymptotic separations in communication complexity to the language of Bell inequalities and correlations (e.g. this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5043">paper</a>). These early successes attracted the attention of some physicists working in foundations as well as some mathematical physicists, leading to a productive exploration that combined tools from quantum information, functional analysis and complexity theory.</p>
<p>The initial observations made by Cleve et al. had pointed to <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> as a possibly interesting complexity class to study. Rather amazingly, nothing was known about it! They had shown that under strong restrictions on the verifier’s predicate (it should be an XOR of two answer bits), a collapse took place: by the work of Hastad, XOR-MIP equals NEXP, but <img alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}"/> is included in EXP. This seemed very fortuitous (the inclusion is proved via a connection with semidefinite programming that seems tied to the structure of XOR-MIP protocols): could entanglement induce a collapse of the entire, unrestricted class? We thought (at this point mostly Julia thought, because I had no clue) that this ought not to be the case, and so we set ourselves to show that the equality <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}"/>, that would directly parallel Babai et al.’s characterization MIP=NEXP, holds. We tried to show this by introducing techniques to “immunize” games against entanglement: modify an interactive proof system so that its structure makes it “resistant” to the kind of “nonlocal powers” that can be used to defeat the clause-vs-variable game (witness the Magic Square). This was partially successful, and led to one of the papers I am most proud of — I am proud of it because I think it introduced elementary techniques (such as the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality — inside joke — more seriously, basic things such as “prover-switching”, “commutation tests”, etc.) that are now routine manipulations in the area. The paper was a hard sell! It’s good to remember the first rejections we received. They were not unjustified: the main point of criticism was that we were only able to establish a hardness result for exponentially small completeness-soundness gap. A result for such a small gap in the classical setting follows directly from a very elementary analysis based on the Cook-Levin theorem. So then why did we have to write so many pages (and so many applications of Cauchy-Schwarz!) to arrive at basically the same result (with a <img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>)?</p>
<p>Eventually we got lucky and the paper was accepted to a conference. But the real problem, of establishing any non-trivial lower bound on the class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> with constant (or, in the absence of any parallel repetition theorem, inverse-polynomial) completeness-soundness gap, remained. By that time I had transitioned from a Masters student in France to a graduate student in Berkeley, and the problem (pre-)occupied me during some of the most difficult years of my Ph.D. I fully remember spending my first year entirely thinking about this (oh and sure, that systems class I had to pass to satisfy the Berkeley requirements), and then my second year — yet, getting nowhere. (I checked the arXiv to make sure I’m not making this up: two full years, no posts.) I am forever grateful to my fellow student Anindya De for having taken me out of the cycle of torture by knocking on my door with one of the most interesting questions I have studied, that led me into quantum cryptography and quickly resulted in an enjoyable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4680">paper</a>. It was good to feel productive again! (Though the paper had fun reactions as well: after putting it on the arXiv we quickly heard from experts in the area that we had solved an irrelevant problem, and that we better learn about information theory — which we did, eventually leading to another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5514">paper</a>, etc.) The project had distracted me and I set interactive proofs aside; clearly, I was stuck.</p>
<p>About a year later I visited IQC in Waterloo. I don’t remember in what context the visit took place. What I do remember is a meeting in the office of Tsuyoshi Ito, at the time a postdoctoral scholar at IQC. Tsuyoshi asked me to explain our result with Julia. He then asked a very pointed question: the bedrock for the classical analysis of interactive proof systems is the “linearity test” of Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld (BLR). Is there any sense in which we could devise a quantum version of that test?</p>
<p>What a question! This was great. At first it seemed fruitless: in what sense could one argue that quantum provers apply a “linear function”? Sure, quantum mechanics is linear, but that is besides the point. The linearity is a property of the prover’s answers as a function of their question. So what to make of the quantum state, the inherent randomness, etc.?</p>
<p>It took us a few months to figure it out. Once we got there however, the answer was relatively simple — the prover should be making a question-independent measurement that returns a linear function that it applies to its question in order to obtain the answer returned to the verifier — and it opened the path to our subsequent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">paper</a> showing that the inclusion of NEXP in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> indeed holds. Tsuyoshi’s question about linearity testing had allowed us to make the connection with PCP techniques; from there to MIP=NEXP there was only one step to make, which is to analyze multi-linearity testing. That step was suggested by my Ph.D. advisor, Umesh Vazirani, who was well aware of the many pathways towards the classical PCP theorem (indeed a lot of the activity that led to the proof of the theorem took place in Berkeley, with many of Umesh’s current or former students making substantial contributions). It took a lot of technical work, yet conceptually a single question from my co-author had sufficed to take me out of a 3-year slumber.</p>
<p>This was in 2012, and I thought we were done. For some reason the converse inclusion, of <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> in NEXP, seemed to resist our efforts, but surely it couldn’t resist much longer. Navascues et al. had introduced a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that seemed to give the right answer (technically they could only show convergence to a relaxation, the commuting value, but that seemed like a technicality; in particular, the values coincide when restricted to finite-dimensional strategies, which is all we computer scientists cared about). There were no convergence bounds on the hierarchy, yet at the same time commutative SDP hierarchies were being used to obtain very strong results in combinatorial optimization, and it seemed like it would only be a matter of time before someone came up with an analysis of the quantum case. (I had been trying to solve a related “dimension reduction problem” with Oded Regev for years, and we were making no progress; yet it seemed <em>someone</em> ought to!)</p>
<p>In Spring 2014 during an open questions session at a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/qhc2014-1">workshop</a> at the Simons Institute in Berkeley Dorit Aharonov suggested that I ask the question of the possible inclusion of QMA-EXP, the exponential-sized-proofs analogue of QMA, in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. A stronger result than the inclusion of NEXP (under assumptions), wouldn’t it be a more natural “fully quantum” analogue of MIP=NEXP? Dorit’s suggestion was motivated by research on the “quantum PCP theorem”, that aims to establish similar hardness results in the realm of the local Hamiltonian problem; see e.g. <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/quantum-pcp-conjectures/">this post</a> for the connection. I had no idea how to approach the question — I also didn’t really believe the answer could be positive — but what can you do, if Dorit asks you something… So I reluctantly went to the board and asked the question. Joe Fitzsimons was in the audience, and he immediately picked it up! Joe had the fantastic ideas of using quantum error-correction, or more specifically secret-sharing, to distribute a quantum proof among the provers. His enthusiasm overcame my skepticism, and we eventually <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0260">showed</a> the desired inclusion. Maybe <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> <em>was</em> bigger than <img alt="{\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{NEXP}}"/> after all.</p>
<p>Our result, however, had a similar deficiency as the one with Julia, in that the completeness-soundness gap was exponentially small. Obtaining a result with a constant gap took 3 years of couple more years of work and the fantastic energy and insights of a Ph.D. student at MIT, Anand Natarajan. Anand is the first person I know of to have had the courage to dive in to the most technical aspects of the analysis of the aforementioned results, while also bringing in the insights of a “true quantum information theorist” that were supported by Anand’s background in Physics and upbringing in the group of Aram Harrow at MIT. (In contrast I think of myself more as a “raw” mathematician; I don’t really understand quantum states other than as psd matrices…not that I understand math either of course; I suppose I’m some kind of a half-baked mish-mash.) Anand had many ideas but one of the most beautiful ones led to what he poetically called the “Pauli braiding test”, a “truly quantum” analogue of the BLR linearity test that amounts to doing <em>two</em> linearity tests in conjugate bases and piecing the results together into a robust test for <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-qubit entanglement (I wrote about our work on this <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/pauli-braiding/">here</a>).</p>
<p>At approximately the same time Zhengfeng Ji had another wonderful idea, that was in some sense orthogonal to our work. (My interpretation of) Zhengfeng’s idea is that one can see an interactive proof system as a computation (verifier-prover-verifier) and use Kitaev’s circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction to transform the entire computation into a “quantum CSP” (in the same sense that the local Hamiltonian problem is a quantum analogue of classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSP)) that could then itself be verified by a quantum multi-prover interactive proof system…with exponential gains in efficiency! Zhengfeng’s result implied an exponential improvement in complexity compared to the result by Julia and myself, showing inclusion of NEEXP, instead of NEXP, in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. However, Zhengfeng’s technique suffered from the same exponentially small completeness-soundness gap as we had, so that the best lower bound on <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> per se remained NEXP.</p>
<p>Both works led to follow-ups. With Natarajan we promoted the Pauli braiding test into a “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">quantum low-degree test</a>” that allowed us to show the inclusion of QMA-EXP into <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>, with constant gap, thereby finally answering the question posed by Aharonov 4 years after it was asked. (I should also say that by then all results on <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> started relying on a sequence of parallel repetition results shown by Bavarian, Yuen, and others; I am skipping this part.) In parallel, with Ji, Fitzsimons, and Yuen we showed that Ji’s compression technique could be “iterated” an arbitrary number of times. In fact, by going back to “first principles” and representing verifiers uniformly as Turing machines we realized that the compression technique could be used iteratively to (up to small caveats) give a new proof of the fact (first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08618">shown</a> by Slofstra using an embedding theorem for finitely presented group) that the zero-gap version of <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> contains the halting problem. In particular, the entangled value is uncomputable! This was not the first time that uncomputability crops in to a natural problem in quantum computing (e.g. the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04573">spectral gap paper</a>), yet it still surprises when it shows up. Uncomputable! How can anything be uncomputable!</p>
<p>As we were wrapping up our paper Henry Yuen realized that our “iterated compression of interactive proof systems” was likely optimal, in the following sense. Even a mild improvement of the technique, in the form of a slower closing of the completeness-soundness gap through compression, would yield a much stronger result: undecidability of the constant-gap class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. It was already known by work of Navascues et al., Fritz, and others, that such a result would have, if not surprising, certainly consequences that seemed like they would be taking us out of our depth. In particular, undecidability of any language in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> would imply a negative resolution to a series of equivalent conjectures in functional analysis, from Tsirelson’s problem to Connes’ Embedding Conjecture through Kirchberg’s QWEP conjecture. While we liked our result, I don’t think that we believed it could resolve any conjecture(s) in functional analysis.</p>
<p>So we moved on. At least I moved on, I did some cryptography for a change. But Anand Natarajan and his co-author John Wright did not stop there. They had the last major insight in this story, which underlies their recent STOC best paper described in the previous <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">post</a>. Briefly, they were able to combine the two lines of work, by Natarajan &amp; myself on low-degree testing and by Ji et al. on compression, to obtain a compression that is specially tailored to the existing <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> protocol for NEXP and compresses that protocol without reducing its completeness-soundness gap. This then let them show Ji’s result that <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> contains NEEXP, but this time with constant gap! The result received well-deserved attention. In particular, it is the first in this line of works to not suffer from any caveats (such as a closing gap, or randomized reductions, or some kind of “unfair” tweak on the model that one could attribute the gain in power to), and it implies an unconditional separation between MIP and <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>.</p>
<p>As they were putting the last touches on their result, suddenly something happened, which is that a path towards a much bigger result opened up. What Natarajan &amp; Wright had achieved is a one-step gapless compression. In our iterated compression paper we had observed that iterated gapless compression would lead to <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}"/>, implying negative answers to the aforementioned conjectures. So then?</p>
<p>I suppose it took some more work, but in some way all the ideas had been laid out in the previous 15 years of work in the complexity of quantum interactive proof systems; we just had to put it together. And so a decade after the characterization <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4737">QIP = PSPACE</a> of single-prover quantum interactive proof systems, we have arrived at a characterization of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems, <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}"/>. With one author in common between the two papers: congratulations Zhengfeng!</p>
<p>Even though we just posted a paper, in a sense there is much more left to do. I am hopeful that our complexity-theoretic result will attract enough interest from the mathematicians’ community, and especially operator algebraists, for whom CEP is a central problem, that some of them will be willing to devote time to understanding the result. I also recognize that much effort is needed on our own side to make it accessible in the first place! I don’t doubt that eventually complexity theory will not be needed to obtain the purely mathematical consequences; yet I am hopeful that some of the ideas may eventually find their way into the construction of interesting mathematical objects (such as, who knows, a non-hyperlinear group).</p>
<p>That was a good Masters project…thanks Julia!</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">I sometimes joke with my students about one of the main tools I have been using in the last ten years: the explicit sum of a geometric series. <em>Why is this?</em></p>



<h2>From numbers to operators</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The simplest version of this basic result for real numbers is the following: $$ \forall r \neq 1, \ \forall n \geq 0, \   \sum_{k=0}^n r^k = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r},$$ and is typically proved by multiplying the two sides by \(1-r\) and forming a telescoping sum. When \(|r|&lt;1\), we can let \(n\) tend to infinity and get $$ \forall |r| &lt;  1, \  \sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = \frac{1}{1-r}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proofs without words.</strong> There is a number of classical proofs of the last identities, many of them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_without_words">without words</a>, presented in the beautiful series of books by Roger Nelsen [1, 2, 3]. I particularly like the two below.</p>

<p class="justify-text"><strong>High school: from philosophy to trigonometry.</strong> Before looking at extensions beyond real numbers, I can’t resist mentioning some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes">Zeno’s paradoxes</a>, like Achilles and the tortoise, which are intimately linked with the sum of a geometric series (and which were a highlight of my high school philosophy “career”).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Speaking of high school, it is interesting to note that there, the core identity of this blog post, is often used as \(a^{n+1}-b^{n+1} = (a-b)(a^n+a^{n-1}b+\cdots+ab^{n-1}+b^{n})\) in order to factorize polynomials (and not in the other way around like done later in this post).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another nice elementary use of geometric series comes up with complex numbers, in order to compute sum of cosines, such as: $$\! \sum_{k=0}^n \! \cos k\theta = {\rm Re} \Big(\!\sum_{k=0}^n e^{ i k \theta}\!\Big) = {\rm Re} \Big(\!\frac{e^{i(n+1)\theta}-1}{e^{i\theta}-1}\!\Big) =  {\rm Re} \Big(\! \frac{ \sin \frac{n+1}{2} \theta e^{i(n+1)\theta/2}}{ \sin \frac{\theta}{2} e^{i\theta/2} }\!\Big) = \frac{  \sin \frac{n+1}{2} \theta}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} \cos \frac{n\theta}{2}. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Square matrices and operators.</strong> Within applied mathematics, the matrix and operator versions are the most useful. For \(A\) a square matrix or any linear operator, we have $$ \forall A \mbox{ such that } I-A \mbox{ is invertible}, \  \sum_{k=0}^n A^k = (I-A)^{-1}(I-A^{n+1}),$$ with the classical proof: \(\displaystyle (I – A)\sum_{k=0}^n A^k = \sum_{k=0}^n A^k – \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} A^k = I – A^{n+1}.\)</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\| A\| &lt;1\) for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm">matrix norm</a> induced from a vector norm, we can let \(n\) go to infinity, to obtain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_series">Neumann series</a> \(\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^n A^k = (I-A)^{-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are now ready to talk about machine learning and optimization!</p>



<h2>Stochastic gradient for quadratic functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Matrix geometric series come up naturally when analyzing iterative algorithms based on linear recursions. In this blog post, I will focus on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) techniques to solve the following problem: $$ \min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d} F(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E} \big[ y – \theta^\top \Phi(x) \big]^2,$$ where the expectation is taken with respect to some joint distribution on \((x,y)\). We denote by \(\theta_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^d\) the minimizer of the objective function above (which is assumed to exist). We assume the feature vector \(\Phi(x)\) is high-dimensional, so that the moment matrix \(H = \mathbb{E} \big[ \Phi(x)\Phi(x)^\top \big]\) cannot be assumed to be invertible.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stochastic gradient descent recursion. </strong>Starting from some initial guess \(\theta_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d\), typically \(\theta_0 =0\), the SGD recursion is: $$  \theta_n = \theta_{n-1} – \gamma ( \theta_{n-1}^\top \Phi(x_n) \, – y_n) \Phi(x_n),$$ where \((x_n,y_n)\) is an independent sample from the distribution mentioned above, and \(\gamma &gt; 0\) is the step-size. This algorithm dates back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_approximation">Robbins and Monro</a> in the 50’s and is particularly adapted to machine learning as it updates the parameter \(\theta\) after each observation \((x_n,y_n)\) (as opposed to waiting for a full pass over the data).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Denoting \(\varepsilon_n = y_n – \theta_\ast^\top \Phi(x_n)\) the residual between the observation \(y_n\) and the optimal linear prediction \(\theta_\ast^\top \Phi(x_n)\), we can rewrite the SGD recursion as $$\theta_n = \theta_{n-1} – \gamma ( \theta_{n-1}^\top \Phi(x_n) \, – \theta_{\ast}^\top \Phi(x_n) -\, \varepsilon_n) \Phi(x_n),$$ leading to $$\theta_n \, – \theta_\ast = \big[ I – \gamma \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top \big] ( \theta_{n-1}- \theta_\ast) + \gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This is a stochastic linear recursion on the deviation to optimum \(\theta_n \, – \theta_\ast\). The expectation of the SGD recursion is: $$\mathbb{E} [ \theta_n] \, – \theta_\ast = \big[ I – \gamma H \big] ( \mathbb{E}[ \theta_{n-1}] – \theta_\ast), $$ where \(H = \mathbb{E} \big[ \Phi(x) \Phi(x)^\top \big]\), and where we have used that  \(\gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n)\) has zero expectation (as a consequence of optimality conditions for \(\theta_\ast\)). This is exactly the gradient descent recursion on the expected loss (which cannot be run in practice because we only have access to a finite amount of data).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simplification. </strong>The main difficulty in analyzing the stochastic recursion is the presence of two sources of randomness when compared to the gradient descent recursion: (A) some additive noise \(\gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n)\) independent of the current iterate \(\theta_{n-1}\) and with zero expectation, and (B) some multiplicative noise \(\gamma \big[  H – \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top \big] (\theta_{n-1} – \theta_\ast)\), which comes from the use of \(  I – \gamma \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top  \) instead of \(I – \gamma H\), and depends on the current iterate \(\theta_{n-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, for simplicity, I will ignore the multiplicative noise and only focus on the additive noise, and thus consider the recursion $$\theta_n\, – \theta_\ast = ( I – \gamma H )  ( \theta_{n-1}- \theta_\ast) + \gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n).$$ Detailed studies with multiplicative noise can be found in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/defossez15.pdf">5</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-335/16-335.pdf">6</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-595/16-595.pdf">7</a>], and lead to similar results. Moreover, I will assume (again for simplicity) that \(\varepsilon_n\) and \(\Phi(x_n)\) are independent, and that \(\mathbb{E} [ \varepsilon_n^2 ] = \sigma^2\) (which corresponds to uniform noise of variance \(\sigma^2\) on top of the optimal linear predictions); again, results directly extends without this assumption.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bias / variance decomposition. </strong>Having a constant multiplicative term \(I – \gamma H\) in the recursion leads to an explicit formula: $$\theta_n – \theta_\ast = ( I – \gamma H ) ^n ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \sum_{k=1}^n \gamma  ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k} \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k),$$ which is now easy to analyze. It is the sum of a deterministic term depending on initial conditions,  and a zero mean term which is the sum of independent zero-mean terms due to the noise in the gradients. Thus, we can compute the expectation of the excess risk \(F(\theta_n)\, – F(\theta_\ast) = \frac{1}{2} ( \theta_n – \theta_\ast)^\top H ( \theta_n – \theta_\ast)\), as follows: $$\! \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_n) \,- F(\theta_\ast)\big] = {\rm Bias} + { \rm Variance}, $$ where the bias term characterizes the forgetting of initial conditions: $$ {\rm Bias} = \frac{1}{2}  ( \theta_0 – \theta_\ast)^\top ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n} H ( \theta_0 – \theta_\ast),  $$ and the variance term characterizes the effect of the noise: $${\rm Variance} =  \frac{\gamma^2 }{2}\! \sum_{k=1}^n \! \mathbb{E} \big[ \varepsilon_k^2 \Phi(x_k)^\top ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n-2k}H  \Phi(x_k) \big] = \frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}\! \sum_{k=1}^n \! {\rm tr} \big[  ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n-2k}H^2   \big] .$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The bias term is exactly the convergence rate of gradient descent on the expected risk, and can be controlled by upper-bounding the eigenvalues of the matrix  \(( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n} H\). As shown at the end of the post, when \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), where \(L\) is the largest eigenvalue of \(H\), then this matrix has all eigenvalues less than \(1/(4n\gamma)\), leading to a bound on the bias term of $$ \frac{1}{8 \gamma n} \|\theta_0 – \theta_\ast\|^2.$$ We recover the traditional \(O(1/n)\) convergence rate of gradient descent. For the variance term we use the sum of a geometric series, to obtain the bound $$\frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}   {\rm tr} \big[ H^2( I – (I – \gamma H)^2 )^{-1}  \big] = \frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}  {\rm tr} \big[ H^2( 2\gamma H – \gamma^2 H^2 )^{-1}  \big] \leq \frac{\gamma  \sigma^2}{2}  {\rm tr}(H) .$$ While the bias term that characterizes the forgetting of initial conditions goes to zero as \(n\) goes to infinity, this is not the case for the variance term. This is the traditional lack of convergence of SGD with a constant step-size. In the left plot of the figure below, we compare deterministic gradient descent to stochastic gradient with a constant step-size. For convergence rates in higher dimension, see further below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2039" height="236" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/paths_video-1.gif" width="564"/>Gradient descent algorithms run from the same starting point. Left plot: plain gradient descent (GD), plain (non-averaged) gradient descent (SGD). Right plot: averaged SGD with uniform weights (ASGD-1) and with weights proportional to the iteration index (ASGD-k).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Convergence can be obtained by using a decreasing step-size, typically of the order \(1 / \sqrt{n},\) leading to an overall convergence rate proportional to \(1 / \sqrt{n}.\) This can be improved through averaging, which I now present.</p>



<h2>Impact of averaging</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the averaged iterate \(\bar{\theta}_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n \theta_k\), an off-line (no interaction with the stochastic recursion) averaging often referred to as Polyak–Ruppert averaging, after [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">8</a>, 9]. The averaged iterate can also be expressed as a linear function of initial conditions and noise variables as $$\bar{\theta}_n -\theta_\ast = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n  ( I – \gamma H ) ^k ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \frac{\gamma}{n+1}   \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{j=k}^n   ( I – \gamma H ) ^{j-k} \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k).$$ Geometric series come in again! We can get a closed form for \(\bar{\theta}_n -\theta_\ast\) as: $$\frac{1}{n+1} (\gamma H)^{-1} \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big] ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \frac{\gamma}{n+1} (\gamma H)^{-1} \sum_{k=1}^n \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k+1} \big] \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The bound on \(\mathbb{E} \big[ F(\bar{\theta}_n) \,- F(\theta_\ast)\big] \), will here also be composed of a bias term and a variance term. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bias.</strong> The bias term is equal to $$\frac{1}{2(n+1)^2}( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) ^\top   (\gamma H)^{-2} H \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big]^2 ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast).$$ Using the fact that the eigenvalues of the matrix \( (\gamma H)^{-2} H \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big]^2\) are all less than \((n+1)/\gamma\) (see proof at the end of the post), we obtain the upper bound $$ \frac{1}{2 (n+1)\gamma} \| \theta_0 – \theta_\ast\|^2,$$ which is essentially the same than with averaging (but, see an important difference in the discussion below, regarding the behavior for large \(n\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Variance.</strong> The variance term is equal to $$ \frac{\gamma^2}{2 (n+1)^2}  \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma^2 {\rm tr} \Big( \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k+1} \big]^2 (\gamma H)^{-2} H^2 \Big).$$ Using the positivity of the matrix \(( I – \gamma H )\), we finally obtain the following bound for variance term: $$  \frac{ \sigma^2 n {\rm tr}(I)}{2(n+1)^2}\leq \frac{\sigma^2 d}{2n}.$$ We now have a convergent algorithm, and we recover traditional quantities from the statistical analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least-squares regression</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Experiments.</strong> Now, both bias and variance are converging at rate \(1/n\). See an illustration in two dimensions in the right plot of the figure above, as well as a convergence rates below. In these two figures, what differs is the decay of eigenvalues of \(H\) (fast in the first figure, slower in the second).</p>

<p>We can make the following observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Depending on the amount of noise in the gradients, the sum of the variance and the bias terms will either be dominated by one of the two; typically the bias term in early iterations, and then the variance term (see more  details in [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/defossez15.pdf">5</a>]).</li><li>The variance term of non-averaged SGD is converging to a constant (while the bias term is exactly the one of regular gradient descent).</li><li>With averaging, the variance terms decay as a line in a log-log plot. The reader with good eyes can check that the slope is indeed -1, thus illustrating the convergence rate in \(1/n\) (here the bound is tight). For the variance terms (right plots), there is no significant difference between the two eigenvalue decays.</li><li>The bias terms have different behaviors for the two decays. For the fast decays (top plot), the bounds in \(1/n\) are reasonably tight (lines of slope -1). For slower decay, we see some strong-convexity behavior entering the scene, as the slowest eigenvalue is 1/100 and the number of iterations is far larger than 100, and thus the optimization problem looks strongly convex, and then the bias term of plain SGD (which corresponds to deterministic gradient descent) converges exponentially fast, while the two averaging techniques decay as powers of \(n\) (again, the acute reader can spot slopes of -2 and -4, and the smart reader can explain why; more on this in a future post dedicated to SGD).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Pros and cons of averaging.</strong> Overall, we can see that averaging may slow down the forgetting of initial conditions, while it makes the method robust to noise in the gradients. The trade-off depends on the amount of noise, but in most high-dimensional learning problems and for the accuracies practitioners are interested in (no need to have an excess risk of \(10^{-5}\) then the best risk is of order \(10^{-1}\)), the bias term is the one which is seen the most. Thus, a less-aggressive form of averaging that puts more weights on later iterates seems advantageous (pink curve above). More on this in a future blog post.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond least-squares.</strong> In this blog post, to illustrate the use of sums of geometric series, I have focused on an idealized version (no multiplicative noise) of least-squares regression. For other losses, e.g., logistic loss, the analysis is more involved, and averaging does not lead to a converging algorithm, but transforms a term in \(\gamma\) into a term in \(\gamma^2\), which is still a significant improvement when the step-size \(\gamma\) is small (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">10</a>] for more details).</p>



<h3>Extensions</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The sum of a geometric series can be extended in a variety of ways. For example, we can take the derivative with respect to \(r\), to get $$ \forall r \neq 1, \  \sum_{k=1}^n k r^{k-1} = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{(1-r)^2} – \frac{ (n+1) r^n}{1-r} = \frac{1 + n r^{n+1} – (n+1) r^n }{(1-r)^2}.$$ This is useful for example to compute the performance of the weighted average \(\frac{2}{n(n+1)} \sum_{k=1}^n k \theta_k\). This can be extended further with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_series">binomial series</a> $$ (1-r)^{-1-\beta} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty { k + \beta \choose k} r^k. $$</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I have essentially used the sum of a geometric series as an excuse to talk about stochastic gradient descent, but there are other places where such series pop out, such as in the analysis of Markov chains and the associated ergodic theorems [11], which are ubiquitous in the analysis of simulation algorithms.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This year, I am still planning to post every first Monday of the month. Expect additional posts on acceleration, stochastic gradient, and orthogonal polynomials, but also new topics should be covered, always with connections with machine learning. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Happy new year!</p>

<h2>Detailed computations</h2>



<p><strong>Bounds on eigenvalues – I.</strong> In order to show the first desired inequality on eigenvalues, we simply need to show that \((1-t)^{2n} t \leq 1/(4n)\) for any \(\in [0,1]\), which is the consequence of $$(1-t)^{2n} t \leq (e^{-t})^{2n} t \leq \frac{1}{2n} \sup_{u \geq 0} e^{-u} u = \frac{1}{2e n} \leq \frac{1}{4n}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bounds on eigenvalues – II.</strong> In order to show the second desired inequality on eigenvalues, we simply need to show that \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq \sqrt{n+1} \sqrt{t}\), for any \(t \in [0,1]\). This is a simple consequence of the straightforward inequality \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq 1\) and the inequality \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq (n+1) t \), which itself can be obtained by integrating the inequality \((1-u)^n \leq 1\) between \(0\) and \(t\).</p></div>

<h2>Quantum algorithms for edit distance?</h2>
<p>One way to try to circumvent the computational barriers is by approximation algorithms (see my <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/07/20/approximating-edit-distance/">blog post</a>). A different approach is to go with quantum algorithms: Grover’s search can solve NC-SAT in <img alt="2^{n/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="2^{n/2}"/> time. Even those of us less skeptic than <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/">Gil Kalai</a> can probably agree that quadratic quantum speedups won’t be practical anytime soon. But in theory, I find the question of whether we can design subquadratic quantum algorithms for edit distance very interesting (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04178">[BEG+18]</a>).</p>
<p>Alas, even with the power of quantum computers we don’t know any truly subquadratic algorithms for computing LCS/ED. On the other hand, it is not clear how to rule out even linear-time algorithms. A few weeks ago, Buhrman, Patro, and Speelman, posted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05686">paper</a> that gives a <img alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n^{3/2}"/> quantum <em>query complexity </em>lower bound for LCS/ED.</p>
<blockquote><p>Open Problem: Close the <img alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n^{3/2}"/> vs <img alt="n^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n^2"/> gap for quantum query complexity of ED/LCS.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is “query complexity” of ED/LCS? Buhrman et al. consider the following query model: In LCS, we want a <strong>maximum monotone matching</strong> between the characters of the two strings, where we can match two characters if they’re identical. Now suppose that in the query complexity problem we still want to find a maximum monotone matching, but instead of the character-equality graph (which is a union of disjoint cliques), we have an arbitrary bipartite graph, and <strong>given a pair of vertices, the oracle tells you if there is an edge between them</strong>.</p>
<p>This model may seem a bit counter-intuitive at first since the graphs may not correspond to any pair of strings; and indeed other models have been considered before <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=321922">[UAH76]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4033">[AKO10]</a>. But it turns out that this model is well-motivated by the NC-SETH lower bound (see discussion below).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The ultimate hardness hypothesis</h2>
<p>What does the <img alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n^{3/2}"/> query complexity lower bound mean for algorithms on actual strings? Instead of a black box oracle, our algorithms have access to an NC-circuit that implements it. Intuitively, we don’t know how to do very much with white box circuits, so it seems plausible to hypothesize that the running time will be lower bound by the query complexity. In some sense, this is a special case of the following <em>ultimate hardness hypothesis </em>that unifies a lot of the computational hardness assumptions that we like to assume but have no idea how to prove (e.g. P!=NP, P!=BQP, NC-SETH, FP!=PPAD, etc):</p>
<blockquote><p>[Ultimate Hardness Hypothesis] For every problem, the white-box computational complexity is lower bounded by the black-box query complexity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In communication complexity similar statements are known and are called simulation/lifting theorems (see e.g. <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~mika/thesis.pdf">Mika’s thesis</a>). For computational complexity, there are obvious counter examples such as “decide if the oracle can be implemented by a small circuit”. So it only makes sense to continue to assume the ultimate hardness hypothesis for “reasonable problems” instead of “every problem”.</p>
<p>But Burhman et al. identify the following variant of the ultimate hardness hypothesis which I find very interesting. It is defined with respect to a function <img alt="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7B2%5En%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}"/> which takes as input the truth-table of a circuit and outputs True or False. Roughly, they hypothesize that:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Burhman et al.-QSETH, paraphrased] For <em>every</em> <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="T"/>, deciding if <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="T"/> is true or false is as hard whether we’re given the actual circuit, or only the guarantee that the oracle is implemented by a small circuit”</p></blockquote>
<p>At a first read, I thought that arguments a-la impossibility of obfuscation <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2001/21390001.pdf">[BGI+01]</a> should refute this hypothesis, but a few weeks later I still don’t know how to prove it. Do you?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A tip for the upcoming holidays</h2>
<p>During my postdoc, I worked on the quantum query complexity of ED/LCS with Shalev Ben-David, Rolando La Placa, and John Wright. I was a bit bummed to find out that we got scooped by Buhrman et al, but I know of at least 3 other groups that were also scooped by the same paper, so at least we’re in good company <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>
<p>At the time, a fellow postdoc from Psychology asked me what I was working on. I resisted the temptation to try to explain the various quantum variants of NC-SETH, and instead told him I was working on “DNA sequencing with quantum computers”. His reaction was priceless. Regardless of what you’re actually working on, try this line during the holidays when your relatives ask you about your work.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Following up my last post on Chebyshev polynomials, another piece of polynomial magic this month. This time, Jacobi polynomials will be the main players.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since definitions and various formulas are not as intuitive as for Chebyshev polynomials, I will start by the machine learning / numerical analysis motivation, which is an elegant refinement of Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<h2>Spectral measures and polynomial acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Like in the previous post, we consider the iteration in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) $$x_{k+1} = Ax_{k} – b,$$ with \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) a symmetric matrix with spectrum \({\rm Spec}(A) \subset (-1,1)\), with unique fixed point \(x_\ast\) such that \(x_\ast = A x_\ast – b\), that is, \(x_\ast = ( A – I)^{-1} b\).  These recursions naturally come up in gradient descent for quadratic functions or gossip algorithms (as described later).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to speed-up convergence, a classical idea explored in the <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">last post</a> is to take linear combinations of all past iterates. That is, we consider \(y_k = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k x_i\) for some weights \(\nu_i^k\) such that \(\sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k=1\) (so that if all iterates are already at \(x_\ast\), then the weighted average stays there). We have $$ y_k – x_\ast =  \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k ( x_i – x_\ast) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k A^i (x_0-x_\ast) = P_k(A) (x_0-x_\ast),$$ where \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k X^i\) is a polynomial such that \(P_k(1)=1\).  </p>



<p class="justify-text">For Chebyshev acceleration, we used the following bound: $$  \frac{1}{n} \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2^2 =   \frac{1}{n} ( x_0 – x_\ast)^\top P_k(A)^2 (x_0 -x_\ast)   \leq \max_{\lambda \in {\rm Spec}(A)} |P_k(\lambda)|^2 \cdot \frac{1}{n}\|x_0 – x_\ast\|_2^2.$$ Using the fact that  \({\rm Spec}(A) \subset [-1\!+\!\delta,1\!-\!\delta]\) for some \(\delta&gt;0\), minimizing \(\max_{\lambda \in {\rm Spec}(A)} |P_k(\lambda)|^2\) subject to \(P_k(1)=1\) led to a rescaled Chebyshev polynomials. This allowed to go from a convergence rate proportional to \((1\!-\!\delta)^k\) to a convergence rate proportional to \((1 – \sqrt{2\delta})^k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\delta\) is small, this is a significant gain. But when \(\delta\) is really small, none of the two techniques converge quickly enough, in particular in early iterations where the exponential convergence regime has not been reached. However, only a few eigenvalues are close to \(-1\) or \(1\)  (see examples in gossip matrices below), and using more information about eigenvalues beyond the smallest and largest ones can be advantageous.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1600" height="159" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comparing_spectra-1-1024x266.png" width="613"/>Histogram of eigenvalues of gossip matrices for gossiping within the 1D, 2D and 3D grid, with the same number of nodes \(n = 4096\): the eigengap \(1-\rho\) is small, and the eigenvalues are well-spread. See more details in the gossip section below.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We will use the spectral decomposition \(A = \sum_{i=1}^n\! \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), where \(\lambda_i\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\) with orthonormal eigenvectors \(u_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\). We thus have $$  \frac{1}{n} \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{n} ( x_0 – x_\ast)^\top P_k\Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top \Big)^2 ( x_0 – x_\ast) =  \frac{1}{n}\! \sum_{i=1}^n P_k(\lambda_i)^2 \big[ (x_0 – x_\ast)^\top u_i \big]^2.$$ Assuming \(\big[ (x_0 – x_\ast)^\top u_i \big]^2 \leq \tau^2\) for all \(i=1,\dots,n\) (that is, the initial deviation from the optimum has uniform magnitude on all eigenvectors), we need to minimize $$ e(P_k) = \frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! P_k(\lambda_i)^2  = \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)$$ with respect to \(P_k\), where \(d\sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n\! \delta_{\lambda_i}\) is the spectral probability measure of \(A\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Now, the new goal is to minimize \(\displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)\) with respect to a polynomial \(P_k\) with degree \(k\) and such that \(P_k(1)=1\). This is where orthogonal polynomials naturally come in. Their use in creating acceleration mechanisms dates back from numerical analysis in the 1980’s and 1990’s (with a very nice and detailed account in [1]).</p>



<h2>Orthogonal polynomials and kernel polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a sequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal polynomials</a> \(Q_k\) for the probability measure \(d\sigma\) in support within \([-1,1]\), each of degree \(k\), which we do not assume normalized. They are essentially unique (up to rescaling); see, e.g., the very good books by Gábor Szegő [2] and Theodore Seio Chihara [3].</p>



<p class="justify-text">We denote by \(\alpha_i = \int_{-1}^1 \! Q_i^2(\lambda)d\sigma(\lambda)\), for \(i \geq 0\), the squared norm of \(Q_i\), so that the sequence of polynomials \(({\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i)\) is <em>orthonormal</em>. We can then solve the optimization problem above for \(P_k\), by writing it \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k u_i {\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(X)\), and the problem in \(u \in\mathbb{R}^{k+1}\) becomes: $$\min_{u \in \mathbb{R}^{k+1}} \sum_{i=0}^k u_i^2 \mbox{ such that }  \sum_{i=0}^k u_i {\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(1) = 1.$$ This optimization problem can be solved in closed form, and the solution is such that \(\displaystyle u_i = \frac{{\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(1)}{\sum_{j=0}^k \!{\alpha_j^{-1}} Q_j(1)^2}\) for all \(i\), with the optimal polynomial $$P_k(X) =  \frac{\sum_{i=0}^k \! {\alpha_i^{-1}} Q_i(1) Q_i(X) }{\sum_{i=0}^k \!{\alpha_i^{-1}} Q_i(1)^2}.$$ The optimal value is thus equal to $$\big({\sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_i^{-1} Q_i(1)^2 } \big)^{-1}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The polynomials \(\sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_i^{-1} Q_i(X)Q_i(Y)\) are called the <em>kernel polynomials</em> [3, Chapter I, Section 7] associated to \(d\sigma\), and have many properties (beyond the optimality property which we just proved) that we will use below. </p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, the problem seems essentially solved: one can construct iteratively the polynomials \(Q_k\) using classical second-order recursions for orthogonal polynomials, and thus compute \(P_k(X)\) which is proportional to \(\sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{\alpha_i} Q_i(1) Q_i(X)\). This leads however to a somewhat complicated algorithm, and some additional polynomial magic can be invoked.</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that kernel polynomials, of which \(P_k\) is a special case, are themselves proportional to orthogonal polynomials for the modified measure \((1-\lambda) d \sigma(\lambda)\) (see proof at the end of the post). This is useful to generate the optimal polynomial with a second-order recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To summarize, if we know the spectral measure \(d\sigma\), then we can derive a sequence of polynomials \(P_k\) that leads to an optimal value for \(\displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)\). However, knowing precisely the spectral density is typically as hard as finding the fixed point of the recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since convergence properties are dictated by the behavior of the spectral measure around \(-1\) and \(1\), i.e., by the number of eigenvalues around \(-1\) and \(1\), we can model the spectral measure by simple distributions with varied behavior at the two ends of the spectrum. A known family is the rescaled Beta distribution, with density proportional to \((1-x)^\alpha (1+x)^\beta\). This will lead to Jacobi polynomials and “simple” formulas below.</p>



<h2>Jacobi polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">For \(\alpha, \beta &gt; -1\), the \(k\)-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_polynomials">Jacobi polynomial</a> \(J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}\) is equal to $$J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) = \frac{(-1)^k}{2^k k!} (1-x)^{-\alpha} (1+x)^{-\beta} \frac{d^k}{dx^k} \Big\{ (1-x)^{\alpha + k} (1+x)^{\beta + k} \Big\}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Denoting \(\displaystyle d\sigma(x) =   \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} ( 1 -x )^\alpha (1+x)^\beta dx\) the rescaled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta distribution</a> (with \(\Gamma(\cdot)\) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>), the Jacobi polynomials are orthogonal for the probability measure \(d\sigma\). That is, $$ \int_{-1}^1  \! J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) J_\ell^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) d\sigma(x) = 0, $$ if \(k \neq \ell\), and equal to \(\displaystyle \alpha_k = \frac{1}{2k+\alpha + \beta + 1} \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2) \Gamma(k+\alpha+1) \Gamma(k+\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)  \Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(k+\alpha+\beta+1)}\) if \(k=\ell\). We have the following equivalent \( \displaystyle \alpha_k \sim \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1) }\frac{1}{2k}\) when \(k\) tends to infinity. All the formulas in these sections can be obtained from standard references on orthogonal polynomials [2, 3] (with a summary on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_polynomials">Wikipedia</a>) and are presented without proofs.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The value at 1 is an important quantity for acceleration, and is equal to: $$ J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(1) = {k+\alpha \choose k} = \frac{\Gamma(k+\alpha+1)}{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(\alpha+1)} \sim \frac{ (k/e)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)},$$ while the value at -1 is equal to $$ J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(-1) =(-1)^k {k+\beta \choose k} = \frac{\Gamma(k+\beta+1)}{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(\beta+1)} \sim \frac{ (k/e)^\beta}{\Gamma(\beta+1)}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to compute the polynomials, the following recursion is key: $$  J_{k+1}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = (a_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} X + \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)})J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} – c_k J_{k-1}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X),$$ with coefficients with explicit (and slightly complicated) formulas (in the case you wonder why I use \(\tilde{b}\) instead of \(b\), this is to avoid overloading the notation with the iteration \(x_{k+1}= Ax_{k}-b\)): $$a_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} =   \frac{(2k+\alpha+\beta+1)  (2k+2+\alpha+\beta)  }{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta)  },\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $$ $$ \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}  =   \frac{(2k+\alpha+\beta+1) ( \alpha^2 – \beta^2 )}{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta) (2k + \alpha+\beta )},$$ $$c_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}  =\frac{ 2 (k+\alpha)(k+\beta)(2k +2+\alpha+\beta) }{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta) (2k + \alpha+\beta )}.  $$ It can be started with \(J_0^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = 1\) and \(J_1^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = \frac{\alpha – \beta}{2} +\frac{ \alpha + \beta +2}{2} X\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The class of Jacobi polynomials includes many of other important polynomials, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomials</a> (\(\alpha = \beta = -1/2\)), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials">Legendre polynomials</a> (\(\alpha = \beta = 0\)) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegenbauer_polynomials">Gegenbauer polynomials </a>(\(\alpha = \beta = d-1/2\)). Here are plots below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1604" height="202" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jacobi-1.gif" width="387"/>Jacobi polynomials, as used for the acceleration of gossip algorithms in one-dimension, with \((\alpha,\beta) = (1/2,-1/2)\).</figure></div>



<h2>Jacobi acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now apply the polynomial acceleration technique above to the Beta distribution, that is for \(\displaystyle d\sigma(x) =   \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} ( 1 -x )^\alpha (1+x)^\beta dx\), we have:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Regular recursion error</strong> (no acceleration):  the error \(e(X^k) = \displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \lambda^{2k} d\sigma(\lambda)\) is asymptotically equivalent to \(\displaystyle \frac{C_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{\alpha+1}}+\frac{C_{\beta,\alpha}}{k^{\beta+1}}\), for some constants \(C_{\alpha,\beta}\) (see details at the end of the post). Before acceleration, there is thus an equivalent impact of the spectrum around \(-1\) and \(1\).</li><li><strong>Jacobi acceleration error</strong>: as shown at the end of the post, the error \(e(P_k)\) is equivalent to \(\displaystyle  \frac{E_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{2\alpha+2}} \) for some constant \(E_{\alpha,\beta}\). </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">What’s happening around \(-1\) and \(1\) is important, and particular the behavior around 1, and we thus see that \(\beta\) is less important for the accelerated version (in fact, using \(\beta=0\) to construct the Jacobi polynomial, as done in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>], leads to a similar acceleration). In particular, when considering distributions where \(\beta = \alpha\), then we see that Jacobi acceleration transforms a rate proportional to \(1/k^{\alpha+1}\) to a rate proportional to \(1/k^{2\alpha+2}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The final recursion is then equal to (see detailed computations at the end of the post): $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(2k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta\!+\!2)   }{2(k\!+\!2\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta)(k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!2)  }  \big[ (2k\!+\!3\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta) (Ay_k-b) +  \frac{ (\alpha\!+\!1)^2\! -\! \beta^2  }{  2k \!+\! 1\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta }    y_k    \Big] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  $$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  –  \frac{    (k+\beta)(2k +3+\alpha+\beta) }{ (k+2+\alpha+\beta) (2k + 1+\alpha+\beta )} \frac{ k }{ k+\alpha+2} y_{k-1}, $$ with initialization \(y_0=x_0\) and \(y_1 = \frac{\alpha+\beta+3}{2\alpha+4}(Ax_0 – b) + \frac{\alpha+1-\beta}{2\alpha+4}x_0\). For \(\alpha = \frac{d}{2}-1\) and \(\beta =0\), this exactly recovers the recursion from [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>].</p>



<h2>Application to gossip</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Like in the previous post we consider the gossip problem. For large grid graphs, the gap is small, equivalent to \(\frac{1}{2d} \frac{1}{n^{2/d}}\) for the \(d\)-dimensional grid. The gap is tending to zero with \(n\), and using acceleration techniques for non-zero gaps, such as Chebyshev acceleration, is not efficient for the earlier iterations.</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that for grid graphs, the spectral measure tends to a limit with behavior \((1-x^2)^{d/2-1}\) around \(-1\) and \(1\). This is formerly true for the grid graph, and the behavior around 1 (which is the one that matters for acceleration) is the same for a large class of graphs with an underlying geometric structure [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>]. This thus corresponds to the Beta distribution of parameters \(\alpha = \beta = \frac{d}{2}-1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Below, I consider gossiping on a chain graph with \(n=200\) nodes, and compare regular gossip with Chebyshev acceleration and Jacobi acceleration. In early iterations, Jacobi acceleration is much better. </p>

(left) regular gossip, (center) Chebyshev acceleration, (right) Jacobi acceleration</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">When looking at the convergence rate (plot below), for late iterations, the linear convergence of Chebyshev acceleration does take over; for a method that achieves the best of both world (good in early and late iterations), see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Section 7].</p>

Chebyshev acceleration is slow at the beginning, and faster at the end (once the error is already quite small).</figure></div>



<p>Similar plots may be made in two dimensions, gossiping a white noise signal, where the stationary behavior is observed much sooner for Jacobi acceleration. Here, Chebyshev acceleration performs worse than the regular iteration because the eigengap is very small (equal to \(6 \times 10^{-4}\)).</p>

<p class="justify-text">When gossiping a Dirac signal, we can also observe the spreading of information from the original position of the Dirac to the rest of the grid.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I tried to move from the worst-case analysis of spectral acceleration which typically focuses on largest and smallest eigenvalues of the involved contracting operators, closer to an average-case analysis that takes into account the whole spectrum. This led to acceleration by Jacobi polynomials rather than Chebyshev polynomials. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond gossip.</strong> While I have focused primarily on applications to gossip where the spectral measure can be well approximated, this can be extended to other situations. For example, Fabian Pedregosa and Damien Scieur [<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MSVk90bvK3m-GM1y-RirKdy_HRoJzZwV">5</a>] recently considered an application of polynomial acceleration to gradient descent for least-squares regression with independent covariates, where the spectral measure of the covariance matrix tends to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchenko%E2%80%93Pastur_distribution">Marchenko-Pastur</a> distribution (which is close to the rescaled Beta distributions above).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Jacobi polynomials beyond acceleration.</strong> In this post, I focused only on the acceleration properties of Jacobi polynomials. There are many more interesting applications of these polynomials in machine learning and associated fields. For example, their role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics">spherical harmonics</a> to provide an orthonormal basis of the square-integrable functions on the unit sphere in any dimension, is quite useful for the theoretical study of neural networks (see, e.g., [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">6</a>] and references therein). I would typically say that this is a topic for another post, but this would be even more technical…</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will probably take a break in the polynomial magic series, and go back to less technical posts.</p>

<h2>Detailed computations</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kernel polynomial as orthogonal polynomial</strong>. We consider a series \((R_k)\) of orthogonal polynomials for the measure \((1-\lambda) d\sigma(\lambda)\). Assuming that \(R_k \neq 0\) (see proof in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Appendix D]), then we show that the polynomial \(\frac{R_k(X)}{R_k(1)}\) is the optimal polynomial of degree \(k\) minimizing \(\int_{-1}^1 P^2(\lambda) d\sigma(\lambda)\) such that \(P(1)=1\). Indeed, taking any polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) and such that \(P(1)=1\), the polynomial \(P(X) \, – \frac{R_k(X)}{R_k(1)}\) vanishes at \(1\) and can thus be written as \(A(X)(X-1)\) with \(A(X)\) of degree equal or less than \(k-1\). Then we have: $$\! \int_{-1}^1 \! \! P(\lambda)^2 d\lambda = \! \int_{-1}^1\!\!   \frac{R_k(\lambda)^2}{R_k(1)^2}d\sigma(\lambda) + 2 \! \int_{-1}^1 \!\!  \frac{R_k(\lambda)}{R_k(1)} A(\lambda)(\lambda-1)d\sigma(\lambda)+ \! \int_{-1}^1  \!\! \! A(\lambda)^2(\lambda-1)^2 d\sigma(\lambda).$$ The second term in the right hand side is equal to zero by orthogonality of \((R_k)\), and the third term is non-negative. Therefore, we must have  \(\displaystyle \! \int_{-1}^1 \! \! P(\lambda)^2 d\lambda \geq  \! \int_{-1}^1\!\!   \frac{R_k(\lambda)^2}{R_k(1)^2}d\sigma(\lambda)\), which shows optimality.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Jacobi recursion</strong>. Given the original recursion \(x_{k+1} = A x_k – b\), we consider \(y_k = \frac{Q_k(A) ( x_0  – x_\ast)}{Q_k(1)} + x_\ast\), where \(Q_k = J_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)}\). We get: $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} A + b_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)})Q_{k}(A)( x_0  – x_\ast) – c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} Q_{k-1}(A) ( x_0  – x_\ast)}{Q_{k+1}(1)} + x_\ast.$$ This leads to $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} A + b_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)})Q_{k}(1) (y_k – x_\ast) – c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} Q_{k-1}(1) ( y_{k-1}  – x_\ast)}{Q_{k+1}(1)} + x_\ast.$$ Removing all terms in \(x_\ast\) (which have to cancel), we get: $$ y_{k+1} =  a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}(Ay_k-b) + \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}y_k –  c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k-1}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}y_{k-1}. $$ Using the explicit formula for \(Q_{k}(1)\), we get after some calculations: $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(2k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta\!+\!2)   }{2(k\!+\!2\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta)(k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!2)  }  \big[ (2k\!+\!3\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta) (Ay_k-b) +  \frac{ (\alpha\!+\!1)^2\! -\! \beta^2  }{  2k \!+\! 1\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta }    y_k    \Big] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  $$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  –  \frac{    (k+\beta)(2k +3+\alpha+\beta) }{ (k+2+\alpha+\beta) (2k + 1+\alpha+\beta )} \frac{ k }{ k+\alpha+2} y_{k-1}, $$ with initialization \(y_0 = x_0\) and \(y_1 = \frac{\alpha+\beta+3}{2\alpha+4}(Ax_0 – b) + \frac{\alpha+1-\beta}{2\alpha+4}x_0\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Equivalents of performance</strong>. We first provide an equivalent of $$ \int_{-1}^1 \lambda^{2k} d\sigma(\lambda) = \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)}\int_{-1}^1 \! x^{2k} (1-x)^\alpha(1+x)^\beta dx.$$ By splitting the sum in two, this is equivalent to $$ \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)}\Big\{ 2^\beta\!\! \int_{0}^1 \! x^{2k} (1-x)^\alpha dx  + 2^\alpha \!\! \int_{0}^1 \! x^{2k}(1-x)^\beta dx \Big\},$$ leading to, using the normalizing factor of the Beta distribution, $$\frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} \Big\{ 2^\beta\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Gamma(2k+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+2k+2)} +2^\alpha\frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)\Gamma(2k+1)}{\Gamma(\beta+2k+2)}   \Big\}, $$ and finally to  $$ \displaystyle \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} \Big\{ 2^\beta\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1) }{ (2k/e)^{\alpha+1} }  +2^\alpha\frac{\Gamma(\beta+1) }{ (2k/e)^{\beta+1} }    \Big\} ,$$ which is indeed of the form \(\displaystyle \frac{C_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{\alpha+1}}+\frac{C_{\beta,\alpha}}{k^{\beta+1}}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to estimate \(e(P_k)\), since \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{\alpha_i} Q_i(1) Q_i(X)\), we first need an equivalent of the term \(\displaystyle \frac{Q_i(1)^2}{\alpha_i^2} \sim \frac{(i/e)^{2\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)^2} \Big( \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1) }\frac{1}{2i}\Big)^{-1} \sim E_{\alpha,\beta}’ i^{2\alpha+1}\), for some \(E_{\alpha,\beta}’\), leading to an error of the form \(e(P_k) \displaystyle \sim \frac{1}{ E_{\alpha,\beta}’  \sum_{i=0}^k i^{2\alpha+1}} \sim\frac{2\alpha+2}{ E_{\alpha,\beta}’} \frac{1}{k^{2\alpha+2}} \), which is of the desired form.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Spectral density of a grid</strong>. As seen at the far end of the <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">previous blog post</a>, the eigenvalues of \(A\) for the grid in one-dimension, with \(m=n\), is (up to negligible corrections) \(–  \cos \frac{k\pi}{m}\) for \(k =1,\dots,m\). This leads to a limiting spectral measure as \(– \cos \theta\) for \(\theta\) uniformly distributed on \([0,\pi]\). This leads to a spectral density \(\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}}\) supported on \([-1,1]\). In the plot below, we see that the histogram of eigenvalues for a finite \(m\) matches empirically this density.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1855" height="234" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1D_spectral_density.png" width="308"/>Histogram of eigenvalues for 1D gossip matrix for \(m=4096\), with associated limiting spectral density.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">For a \(d\)-dimensional grid, with \(n = m^d\), the spectral density is the one of \(\frac{1}{d} (X_1+\cdots X_d)\) for \(X_i\) independent and distributed as \(\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}} d\lambda\) on \([-1,1]\), for each \(i=1,\dots,d\). This leads to a convolution power of the density above, rescaled to have support in \([-1,1]\). This can be shown to lead to behavior as \((1-\lambda^2)^{d/2-1}\) around \(1\) and \(-1\) (see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Prop. 5.2]).</p></div>

<div>We prove bounds on the generalization error of convolutional networks. The bounds are characterized in terms of the training loss, the number of parameters, the Lipschitz constant of the loss, and the distance of the initial and final weights. The bounds are independent of the number of pixels in the input, as well as the width and height of hidden feature maps. These are the first bounds for DNNs with such guarantees.  We present experiments with CIFAR-10, varying hyperparameters of a deep convolutional network, comparing our bounds with practical generalization gaps.</div>

<p>Existing techniques for derandomizing algorithms based on circuit lower bounds yield a large polynomial slowdown in running time. We show that assuming exponential lower bounds against nondeterministic circuits, we can convert any randomized algorithm running in time T to a deterministic one running in time nearly T^2. Under complexity-theoretic assumptions, such a slowdown is nearly optimal.</p>
<p>In this talk I will concentrate on the role of error-correcting codes in those techniques. We will see which properties of error-correcting codes are useful for constructing pseudorandomness primitives sufficient for derandomization, where they came short of achieving better slowdown, and how we can overcome that.</p>

<div> There are many basic problems over sequences. For example, computing the edit distance between two sequences, detecting how RNA sequences fold, finding the distance between a sequence and a language (collection of sequences), understanding how disbalanced a parenthesis sequence is. They have natural applications in various areas including computational biology, natural language processing, compiler optimization, and data cleaning. The last few years have seen a plethora of results where new faster algorithms have been developed for these problems with various trade-offs between approximation (quality of solution) and running time (scalability). In this talk, I will present some of the tools that have been developed from my work related to these problems. Depending on time and audience choices, we will cover one or more of the following.</div>
<div/>
<div>(i) A random walk based technique useful to measure how disbalanced a parenthesis sequence is, which has also been useful for streaming computation of edit distance.</div>
<div/>
<div>(ii) A dependent rounding technique that gives nearly optimal result in nearly optimal time for estimating distance between a sequence and a language, which can also be used to speed up other polynomial time problems, such as the all pairs shortest path computation on graphs.</div>
<div/>
<div>(iii) An amnesic dynamic programming technique that gives significantly faster approximation algorithm for RNA-folding, which can also be useful for many dynamic programming based problems that have Lipschitz property (most sequence problems have it).</div>
<div/>
<div>(iv) An elimination of shortest path technique that gives sublinear time algorithms for estimating edit distance for certain regimes of edit distance.</div>

<p><em>Local Computation Algorithms</em></p>
<p>Consider a setting in which inputs to and outputs from a computational problem are so large, that there is not time to read them in their entirety.   However, if one is only interested in small parts of the output at any given time, is it really necessary to solve the entire computational problem? Is it even necessary to view the whole input? We survey recent work in the model of  “local computation algorithms” which for a given input, supports queries by a user to values of specified bits of a legal output.  The goal is to design local computation algorithms in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order to determine the value of any single bit of the output. Though this model describes sequential computations, techniques from local distributed algorithms have been extremely important in designing efficient local computation algorithms. In this talk, we describe results on a variety of problems for which sublinear time and space local computation algorithms have been developed — we will give special focus to finding maximal independent sets and sparse spanning graphs.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Orthogonal polynomials pop up everywhere in applied mathematics and in particular in numerical analysis. Within machine learning and optimization, typically (a) they provide natural basis functions which are easy to manipulate, or (b) they can be used to model various acceleration mechanisms.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will describe one class of such polynomials, the Chebyshev polynomials (Tchebychev in French, Чебышёв in Russian), whose extremal properties (beyond being orthogonal) are useful in the analysis of accelerated algorithms. </p>



<h2>Definition and first properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The \(k\)-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomial</a> \(T_k\) is classically defined as the unique polynomial such that $$\forall  \theta \in [0,2\pi], \  \cos (k\theta) = T_k(\cos \theta).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence</strong>. Summing the two equations \(\cos [(k\pm 1)\theta] = \cos (k\theta) \cos \theta \mp \sin (k\theta) \sin \theta\), the following recurrence relationship can be deduced: $$\forall k &gt;0, \ T_{k+1}(X) = 2X T_k(X) \, – T_{k-1}(X).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Together with the first two polynomials \(T_0 (X) = 1\) and \(T_1(X) = X\), this leads to \(T_2(X) = 2X^2 – 1\), \(T_3(X) = 4X^3 – 3X\), and so on.</p>



<p class="justify-text">From the recurrence relationships, one can easily deduce that \(T_k\) has the parity of \(k\) and that \(T_k\) has degree \(k\), with leading coefficient \(2^{k-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Oscillatory behavior</strong>. For \(k\theta = j \pi\), for \(j\) integer, we have \(\cos (k \theta)=(-1)^j\), while when \(j\) goes from \(k\) to \(0\), \(\cos \theta = \cos\! \big( \frac{ j \pi}{k}\big)\) goes from -1 to 1. Thus, on \([-1,1]\), \(T_k(x)\) oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\), with equality for \(\cos\! \big(  \frac{j \pi}{k} \big)\) for \(j = 0,\dots,k\). This oscillatory behavior is illustrated below and crucial for the extremal properties below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1592" height="223" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chebyshev-3.gif" width="306"/>First 33 Chebyshev polynomials, plotted between -1 and 1. Note the stronger oscillatory behavior between -1 and 1 as \(k\) grows.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthogonality</strong>. Using the orthogonality of the Fourier basis on \([0,2\pi]\), we have for \(k \neq \ell\),  \(\int_0^{\pi} \cos (k\theta) \cos (\ell\theta) d\theta=0\), and with the change of variable \(x = \cos \theta\), we obtain $$\int_{-1}^1 \frac{T_k(x) T_\ell(x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx = 0.$$ Thus the Chebyshev polynomials inherit from many properties from such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal polynomials</a> (such as the two-term recursion above, but for the Chebyshev polynomials, these can obtained more directly). For further properties, see [1].</p>



<h2>Extremal properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Chebyshev polynomials exhibit many “extremal properties”, of the form: among all polynomials of degree \(k\) with some form of normalization (e.g., fixed \(k\)-th order coefficient or value at given point), the one with smallest specific norm is proportional to \(T_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical one is as follows: the polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) with \(k\)-th order coefficient equal to one, and with minimum \(\ell_\infty\)-norm \(\max_{ x \in [-1,1]} \! | P(x)|\) on \([-1,1]\), is \(P = \frac{1}{2^{k-1}}T_k\). The proof is particularly elegant and simple (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">here</a>). Since this is not the property that we need for optimization, we will consider another one.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong> (<em>largest value outside of \([-1,1]\)</em>). For any polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) such that \(|P(x)| \leq 1\) for \(x \in [-1,1]\), and any \(z &gt; 1\), \(|P(z)| \leq T_k(z)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><em>Proof</em>. By contradiction, we assume that there exists \(z &gt; 1\) such that \(P(z)&gt;T_k(z)\) (the other possibility \(P(z) &lt; -T_k(z)\) is done by replacing \(P\) by \(-P\)). Without loss of generality, we can assume that \(\max_{x \in [-1,1]} |P(x) | &lt; 1\) (by potentially rescaling \(P\)). Then, the polynomial \(Q = P – T_k\) of degree \(k\) has alternatively strictly positive and negative values between \(-1\) and \(z&gt;1\). Indeed, \(Q(z) &gt; 0\), and \((-1)^j Q\big(\cos\! \big(\frac{j \pi}{k}\big)\big) &lt; 0 \) for all \(j = 0,\dots,k\). Therefore there are \(k+2\) alternating signs, and thus \(k+1\) zeros, which implies that \(Q=0\) since \(Q\) has degree \(k\). This is a contradiction with the existence of \(z\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that for any \(\theta\), \(T_k( \cosh \theta) = \cosh (k\theta)\) (which can be shown by induction), and \(T_k\) is thus increasing on \([1,+\infty)\) with values quickly increasing as \(k\) grows. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1589" height="221" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chebyshev_beyong_one-1.gif" width="303"/>First 33 Chebyshev polynomials, plotted between 1 and 4 in logarithmic scale. Note the exploding behavior as \(k\) grows.</figure></div>



<h2>Chebyshev acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a recursion in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) of the form \(x_k = A x_{k-1} – b\), with \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) a symmetric matrix and eigenvalues in \([-\rho,\rho]\) with \(\rho \in [0,1)\). Such recursions are ubiquitous in data science, as (1) gradient descent on a strongly-convex quadratic function, or (b) gossip for distributed averaging [<a href="http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/gossip.pdf">2</a>] (see an example in a section below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The recursion converges to the unique (because \(\rho \in [0,1)\)) fixed point \(x_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(x_\ast =  A x_\ast – b\). We have, by unrolling the recursion: $$ x_k – x_\ast = A ( x_{k-1} – x_\ast) = A^k (x_0 – x_\ast).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to the usual exponential convergence rate \(\| x_k – x_\ast\|_2 \leq \rho^k \| x_0 – x_\ast\|_2\). In the following, writing \(\rho = 1 – ( 1-\rho)\) makes explicit the importance of \(1-\rho\), which is the gap between \(1\) and the largest eigenvalue of \(A\). Increasing this gap is equivalent to accelerating the convergence rate.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to speed-up convergence, a classical idea is to take linear combinations of all past iterates. That is, we consider \(y_k = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k x_i\) for some weights \(\nu_i^k\) such that \(\sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k=1\) (so that if all iterates are already at \(x_\ast\), then the weighted average stays there). We have $$ y_k – x_\ast =  \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k ( x_i – x_\ast) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k A^i (x_0-x_\ast) = P_k(A) (x_0-x_\ast),$$ where \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k X^i\) is a polynomial such that \(P_k(1)=1\).  Therefore, we have: $$  \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2 \leq \max_{\lambda \in [-\rho, \rho]} |P_k(\lambda)| \cdot \|x_0 – x_\ast\|_2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to select the best polynomial, we are looking for \(P_k\) such that \(P_k(1)=1\) and \(\max_{\lambda \in [-\rho,\rho]}\! |P_k(\lambda)|\) is as small as possible. Up to mapping \([-\rho,\rho]\) to \([-1,1]\), we know from the extremal property above that the optimal polynomial is exactly a rescaled Chebyshev polynomial, that is, $$P_k(X) = \frac{T_k(X/\rho)}{T_k(1/\rho)}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The maximal value on \([-\rho,\rho]\) is then \((T_k(1/\rho))^{-1}\). In order to compare to \(\rho^k\) (no acceleration), we can provide an equivalent of \([T_k(1/\rho)]^{-1/k}\) as \(\frac{\rho}{ 1+ \sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\) (see end of the post). There is no real acceleration when \(\rho\) is bounded away from 1, but as \(\rho\) tends to \(1\), this can be shown (see also the end of the post) to be equivalent to \(1 – \sqrt{2(1\!-\!\rho)}\), with the usual “square root” acceleration: \(1\!-\!\rho\) is essentially replaced by \(\sqrt{1\!-\!\rho}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus get an acceleration, but as is, computing \(y_k\) seems to require to store all values of \(x_1,\dots,x_k\), which is not practical. Since there is a second-order recursion for Chebyshev polynomials, one can derive one as well, directly for the sequence \((y_k)\).  A somewhat lengthy calculation (see end of the post) leads to the recursion $$ y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}, $$<br/>with a sequence \(\omega_{k+1}\) also defined by recursion as \(\omega_{k+1} = ( 1 – \frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega_k)^{-1}\), initialized with \(\omega_1 = 2\), \(y_0 = x_0\), \(y_1 = Ax_0 – b\). Therefore, on top of the usual computation of \(A y_k -b\), Chebyshev acceleration comes at no extra computational cost.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simpler stationary recursion</strong>. In the recursion above, the parameter \(\omega_k\) varies with \(k\). A similar (then non totally optimal) acceleration can be obtained by replacing all \(\omega_k\)’s by their limit \(\omega\) when \(k\) tends to infinity, which is characterized by the equation \(\omega = ( 1-\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega)^{-1}\) with smallest solutions \(\frac{ 1/\rho    – \sqrt{1/\rho^2 -1}}{\rho/2}\)  (see end of the post for detailed computations). The now stationary recursion then becomes $$ y_{k+1} = \omega ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega) y_{k-1}, $$ and is exponentially convergent with rate proportional to \(\rho \omega/2 =  \frac{1}{1/\rho + \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1}} = \frac{\rho}{1+ \sqrt{ 1 – \rho^2}}\). Thus, the recursion is simpler and the final speed asymptotically the same as full Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<h2>Relationship with other acceleration mechanisms</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-adaptive schemes</strong>. As seen above for an affine operator \(F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n\) (i.e., \(F(x) = Ax-b\)), Chebyshev acceleration takes a recursion of the form $$x_{k+1} = F(x_{k}),$$ and linearly combines iterates; it ends up creating second-order recursions of the form $$ y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} F(y_k) + (1-\omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}, $$ with the same fixed points. Other formats (with fixed point preservation) can be considered such as $$ y_{k+1} = F(y_k) + \delta_{k+1}(y_k –  y_{k-1}),$$ or $$ y_{k+1} = F(y_k) + \delta_{k+1}(F(y_k) –  F(y_{k-1})), $$ for some constants \(\delta_{k+1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(F\) is affine, the format does not matter much (and all end up being essentially equivalent), but for gradient descent algorithms where \(F(x) = x – \gamma f'(x)\) for some non-quadratic function \(f\) and \(\gamma\) a step-size, there is a difference, the last one corresponding to Nesterov acceleration (see a nice post on it <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2014/03/06/nesterovs-accelerated-gradient-descent-for-smooth-and-strongly-convex-optimization/">here</a>), and the one before to classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">momentum</a>, also known as the heavy-ball method (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7457">3</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptive schemes</strong>. The methods above need to know the bound on the spectrum \(\rho\). They have to commit to such a value (which is typically only known through upper bounds) and cannot “get lucky”, that is, even if the best value \(\rho\) is known, they cannot benefit from additional better properties of the spectrum of \(A\) (e.g., clustered eigenvalues). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method">conjugate gradient</a> method, which accesses the matrix \(A\) with the slightly stronger oracle of computing \(Ax\) any \(x\) (and not only \(Ax – b\)), or Anderson acceleration (which does not need a stronger oracle), are adaptive for similar problems [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/10078356X">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04133">5</a>]. Again, Chebyshev polynomials are present; probably more on this in future posts!</p>



<h2>Application to accelerated gossip</h2>



<p class="justify-text">A interesting linear recursion pops out in distributed optimization, where we assume that computers or processors are placed in \(n\) nodes in a network, and the goal is to minimize an average of function \(f_1,\dots,f_n\), each of them only accessible by the corresponding node. The nodes are allowed to communicate messages along each edge of a network. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1367" height="221" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2dgrid.png" width="255"/>Two-dimensional grid with \(d = 8 \times 8 = 64\) nodes.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The simplest of such problem is the network averaging problem where \(f_i(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} (\theta – \xi_i)^2\), for a uni-dimensional parameter \(\theta\) and \(\xi \in \mathbb{R}^n\). The solution of this consensus is \(\theta_\ast = \frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! \xi_i\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The gossip algorithm [<a href="http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/gossip.pdf">2</a>] consists in iteratively replacing the value \(\theta_i\) at a given node by a weighted average \(\sum_{j \sim i} W_{ij} \theta_j\) of the values at neighboring nodes (and node \(i\)). If all \(n\) nodes communicate simultaneously, then the vector \(\theta \) is replaced by \(W \theta\), hence a linear recursion $$ \theta_{k+1} = W \theta_{k},$$ initialized at \(\theta_0 = \xi\). Assuming that \(W\) is symmetric, with non-negative off-diagonal elements, and such that \(W 1_n = 1_n\) (where \(1_n \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the vector of all ones), then all eigenvalues of \(W\) except the largest one are included in the interval \([-\rho, \rho]\), with \(\rho \in (0,1)\) for a connected graph. A simple such matrix \(W\) can be obtained from the adjacency matrix \(A\) of the graph, such that \(A_{ij} = 1\) if nodes \(i\) and \(j\) are connected, and zero otherwise, as \(W = I – \alpha L \), with \(L = {\rm Diag}(A 1_n) – A\) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">Laplacian matrix</a> and \(\alpha\) selected so that the eigenvalues are all between \(-\rho\) and \(\rho\), except one, which is equal to 1 (see values of \(\rho\) and \(\alpha\) at the end of the post). We will see below that this extra eigenvalue which is equal to one is in fact not a problem for analyzing the convergence of this network averaging procedure.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When applying the gossip matrix \(W\) iteratively to \(\theta_0 = \xi\), the projection on the eigensubspace corresponding to the unit eigenvalue is not changed, while all other projections on the other eigensubspaces converge to zero at rate at most \(\rho^k\). Thus \(\theta_k\) converges to the constant vector \(\frac{1}{n} 1_n 1_n^\top \xi\) at rate \(\rho^k\), and thus to a constant vector, with the average \(\frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! \xi_i\) in all components.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that we have a linear recursion, we can use Chebyshev acceleration defined above and obtain substantial improvements, as illustrated below.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Among classical classes of orthogonal polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials are special, because beyond being orthogonal, they satisfy extremal properties that are particularly useful in numerical analysis.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In future posts, I plan to go over Jacobi polynomials (which include Legendre, Gegenbauer and Chebyshev polynomials), Hermite polynomials, and finally Bernoulli polynomials (which are not orthogonal but still very special). For all of these, there are natural applications in machine learning.</p>

<h2>Detailed Computations</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Limit of </strong>\([T_k(1/\rho)]^{-1/k}\). For \(z \geq 1\), then a well-known property of Chebyshev polynomials is that \(T_k(z) = \cosh [ k \, {\rm acosh} (z)]\) (which can be shown by induction using basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function">hyperbolic trigonometry</a> identities). Moreover, we have \({\rm acosh} (z) = \log( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} )\) and thus $$T_k(z) = \frac{1}{2} \big[ \big( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} \big)^k + \big(z – \sqrt{z^2-1}\big)^k  \big].$$ For \(z = 1/\rho\), and taking limits, we get that \([T_k(z)]^{1/k}\) tends to \( z + \sqrt{z^2-1}\), which leads to the limit \(\frac{\rho}{ 1+ \sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\) for \([T_k(z)]^{-1/k}\). Then a classical Taylor expansion in \(1-\rho\) leads to \(1 – \sqrt{2(1-\rho)}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence for Chebyshev acceleration</strong>. We have, using the recursion for Chebyshev polynomials $$y_{k+1} – x_\ast = \frac{ 2 }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} (A/\rho) T_k(A/\rho) ( x_0 – x_\ast) \ – \frac{ 1  }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} T_{k-1}(A/\rho) ( x_0 – x_\ast).$$ Using the equality \(x_\ast = A x_\ast -b\), the terms in \(x_\ast\) cancel (they have to anyway, because \(P_k(1)=1\)). We then get $$y_{k+1}  = \frac{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}  ( A y_k – b) \, – \frac{ T_{k-1}(1/\rho)  }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} y_{k-1}.$$</p>



<p>Using \(T_{k-1}(1/\rho) = (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho) – T_{k+1}(1/\rho)\), and denoting \(\omega_{k+1} =  \frac{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}\), we get $$y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} ( A y_{k} – b) + ( 1- \omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}.$$ Reusing one last time the Chebyshev recursion, we get $$\omega_{k+1}^{-1} = \frac{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}= 1 – \frac{T_{k-1}(1/\rho)}{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)} =1  – \frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega_{k},$$ which is the desired recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence of stationary recursion</strong>. The roots of \(\omega = ( 1-\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega)^{-1}\) are the ones of \(\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega^2 – \omega + 1 = 0\), with smallest solutions \(\omega = \frac{ 1/\rho   – \sqrt{1/\rho^2 -1}}{\rho/2}\). In order to study the second-order recursion $$ y_{k+1} = \omega ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega) y_{k-1}, $$ with constant coefficient, we need to compute the roots of \(r^2 = \omega \lambda r + (1-\omega)\), for \(|\lambda| \leq \rho\). The discriminant of this equation is \(\lambda^2 \omega^2 + 4 (1-\omega) \leq \rho^2 \omega^2 + 4(1-\omega) = 0\), and thus the roots are complex conjugate with squared modulus \((\omega\ – 1) = \frac{1}{4} \rho^2 \omega^2\) independent of \(\lambda\). Thus, as \(k\) tends to infinity, \(\| y_k  – x_\ast\|_2^{1/k}\) tends to \(\frac{1}{2} \rho \omega =   ( 1/\rho – \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1} ) = \frac{1}{1/\rho + \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1}}\), which is exactly the rate for Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a square grid</strong>. Given a chain of length \(m\) such as depicted below, the \(m \times m\) Laplacian matrix can be shown (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05210">7</a>]) to have eigenvalues \(2 + 2 \cos \frac{k\pi}{m}\) for \(k =1,\dots,m\).</p>

<p class="justify-text">For a two-dimensional grid of size \(m \times m\), then the \(m^2 \times m^2\) Laplacian matrix can be shown (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05210">7</a>]) to have eigenvalues \(4 + 2\cos \frac{k_1\pi}{m} + 2\cos \frac{k_2\pi}{m}\) for \(k_1,k_2 =1,\dots,m\). Therefore, the second smallest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_\min = 2 – 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\) and the largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_\max = 4 + 4  \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\). We then select \(\alpha\) such that \(1-\alpha \lambda_\min = \rho\) and \(1-\alpha \lambda_\max = -\rho\), leading to \(\alpha = \frac{2}{\lambda_\min + \lambda_\max} = \frac{2}{6 + 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\) and finally \(\rho = \frac{\lambda_\max – \lambda_\min}{\lambda_\max + \lambda_\min} = \frac{2 +6  \cos \frac{\pi}{m} }{6 + 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\sim \frac{8 – 3 \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}{8 –  \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}\sim 1 – \frac{\pi^2}{4 m^2}\). Thus, as a function of \(n = m^2\), the eigengap is proportional to \(1/n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">More generally, for the grid of size \(m\) in dimension \(d\), then we get \(\lambda_\min = 2 – 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\) and \(\lambda_\max = 2d + 2d  \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\), and \(\rho = \frac{\lambda_\max – \lambda_\min}{\lambda_\max + \lambda_\min} = \frac{2d-2 +(2d+2)  \cos \frac{\pi}{m} }{2d+2 + (2d-2) \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\sim \frac{4d – (d+1) \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}{4d –  (d-1)\frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}\sim 1 – \frac{\pi^2}{2d m^2}.\) Thus, as a function of \(n = m^d\), the eigengap is proportional to \(1/n^{2/d}\). Moreover, when \(m\) is large, the normalizing factor \(\alpha\) tends to \(1/(2d)\).</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>by Naman Agarwal, Karan Singh and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">this paper</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05062">this paper</a>. </em></p>
<p>The mainstream thought in classical control operates under the simplifying principle that nature evolves according to well-specified dynamics perturbed by i.i.d. Gaussian noise, a field called <b>Optimal Control</b>. While this principle has proven very successful in some real world systems, it does not lend itself to the construction of truly <b>robust</b> controllers. In the real world one can expect all sorts of deviations from this setting, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherent correlations between perturbations across time due to the environment.</li>
<li>Modeling misspecification, which can introduce unforeseeable, non-stochastic deviations from the assumed dynamics.</li>
<li>Completely adversarial perturbations introduced by a malicious entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, in the world of classical supervised learning, the presence of the above factors has led to the adoption of <a href="https://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">online learning</a> in lieu of statistical learning, which allows for robust noise models and game-theoretic / strategic learning. A natural question arises: <i>what is the analogue of online learning and worst-case regret in robust control? </i></p>
<h2>Linear Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control</h2>
<p>Dynamical systems constitute the formalism to describe time-dependent, dynamic real-world phenomenon, ranging from fluid flow through a pipe, the movement of a pendulum, to the change of weather. The archetypal example here is a linear dynamical system, which permits a particularly intuitive interpretation as a (configurable) vector field (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system">wikipedia</a>):</p>
<p><img alt="" height="158" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null.png?w=624&amp;h=158" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>A linear dynamical system (LDS) posits the state of a system evolves via the following dynamical relation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+Ax_t+%2B+Bu_t+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t"/></p>

<p>Here <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t"/> represents the state of the system, <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> represents a control input and <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> is a perturbation introduced to the dynamics, for the time step t. The vector fields above illustrate the behavior of the system for a few different choices of A, when the control input <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> is set to zero. The control inputs, when correctly chosen, can modify the dynamics to induce a particular desired behavior. For example, controlling the thermostat in a data center to achieve a particular temperature, applying a force to a pendulum to keep it upright, or driving a drone to a destination.</p>
<p>The goal of the controller is to produce a sequence of control actions <img alt="u_1 \ldots u_T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_1+%5Cldots+u_T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_1 \ldots u_T"/> aimed at minimizing the cumulative loss <img alt="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_t+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)"/>. In classical control the loss functions are convex quadratics and known ahead of time. However, in the quest for more robust controllers, henceforth we will consider a broader class of general (possibly non-quadratic) convex cost functions, which may be adversarially chosen, and only be revealed online per-time-step to the controller.</p>
<h2>Previous notions: LQR and H-infinity control</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most fundamental setting in control theory is a LDS is with quadratic costs <img alt="c_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t"/> and i.i.d Gaussian perturbations <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>. The solution known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear&#x2013;quadratic_regulator">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a>, derived by solving the Riccati equation, is well understood and corresponds to a linear policy (i.e. the control input is a linear function of the state).</p>
<p>The assumption of i.i.d perturbations has been relaxed in classical control theory, with the introduction of a min-max notion, in a subfield known as <a href="https://stephentu.github.io/blog/h-infinity-control/2018/07/01/hinf-optimal-control-dynamic-games.html"><img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control</a>. Informally, the idea behind <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control is to design a controller which performs well against <i>all </i>sequences of bounded perturbations. There are two shortcomings of this approach; firstly computing such a controller can be a difficult optimization problem in itself. While a closed form for such a controller is known for linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, no such form is known when costs can be non-quadratic. Secondly and perhaps more importantly, the min-max notion is non-adaptive and hence often too pessimistic. It is possible that during the execution of the system, nature produces a <i>benign (predictable)</i> sequence of perturbations (say, for instance, the perturbations are, in truth, highly correlated). The <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> controller in this setting could be overly pessimistic and lead to a higher cost than what could be achieved via a potentially more adaptive controller. This motivates our approach of minimizing regret, which we describe next.</p>
<h2>A less pessimistic metric: Policy regret</h2>
<p>Our starting point for more robust control is regret minimization in games. Regret minimization is a well-accepted metric in online learning, and we consider applying it to online control.</p>
<p>Formally, we measure the efficacy of a controller through the following notion of <i>policy </i>regret.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BRegret%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bt%7D+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29+-+%5Cmin_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bstable+%7D+K%7D+c_t%28x_t%28K%29%2C+-Kx_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)"/></p>
<p>Here in, <img alt="x_t(K)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t%28K%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t(K)"/> represents the state encountered when executing the linear policy $K$. In particular, the second term represents the total cost paid by the best(in hindsight) stable linear policy had it executed in the system facing the same sequence of perturbations as the controller. In this regard the above notion of regret is <b>counterfactual</b> and hence more challenging than the more common stateless notion of regret.<br/>
(Remark: a <span style="font-weight: 400;">stable linear policy K is one which ensures that the spectral radius of  A-BK is strictly less than one. For a formal quantitative definition, please see the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, the choice of comparing to a linear policy is made keeping tractability in mind. Note that this nevertheless generalizes the standard Linear Quadratic Regulator and <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control on Linear Dynamical Systems, as the optimal choice of controllers in those settings is indeed a linear policy (if the cost functions are quadratic, our setting allows more general loss functions).</p>
<p>Algorithms which achieve low regret on the above objective are naturally adaptive as they perform as well as the best controller (upto a negligible additive regret) oblivious to whether the sequence is <i>friendly </i>or <i>adversarial. </i></p>
<h2>A new type of controller</h2>
<p>In successive recent works (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1] </a>and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05062">[2]</a>), we show that the above notion of policy regret is tractable and can be sublinear (even logarithmic under certain conditions). Using a new parameterization for controller that we detail next, we obtain the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Robustness to Adversarial Perturbations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1]</a>) – </b>For arbitrary, but bounded, perturbations $w_t$, which may even be chosen adversarially, we provide an efficient algorithm that achieves regret of <b><img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/></b>.</li>
<li><b>Fast Rates under Stochastic Perturbations (</b>[2]<b>) – </b>Further, for strongly convex costs, and i.i.d. perturbations, we give an efficient algorithm with a poly-logarithmic (in T) regret guarantee.</li>
</ul>
<p>The former result is the first such result to establish vanishing average regret in an online setting for control with adversarial perturbations. The latter result offers a significant improvement over the work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07104">Cohen et al. </a>who established a rate of <img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/> in a similar (stochastic) setting.</p>
<p>We assume that the dynamical system i.e. (A,B) is completely known to us and the state is fully observable. These assumptions have been eliminated in further work with our collaborators, and will be a subject of a future blog post. We now describe the core ideas which go into achieving both our results.</p>
<h2>The Gradient Perturbation Controller</h2>
<p>Consider how the choice of the linear controller determines the control input.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="120" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-1.png?w=624&amp;h=120" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>The above display demonstrates that the action, state, and hence the cost are <b>non-convex</b> functions of the linear controller K. The first piece of our result evades this lack of convexity by over-parametrization, ie. relaxing the notion of a linear policy as described next.</p>
<p>In place of learning a direct representation of a linear controller K, we learn a sequence of matrices <img alt="M_1, M_2 \ldots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%2C+M_2+%5Cldots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="M_1, M_2 \ldots "/> which represent the dependence of <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> on <img alt="w_{t - i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_%7Bt+-+i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_{t - i}"/> under the execution of some linear policy. Schematically, we parameterize our policy as follows</p>
<p><img alt="" height="62" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-2.png?w=624&amp;h=62" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Note that, the assumption that the dynamics is known permits the exact inference of <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>’s and thereby making the execution of such a controller possible. While the choice of the controller ensures that control inputs are linear in <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/>, the superposition principle for linear dynamical systems ensures that the state sequence too is linear in the same variables. Therefore, the cost of execution of such a controller parameterized via <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/> is convex and we can hope to learn them using standard techniques like Gradient Descent. Observe that, by construction, it is possible to emulate the behavior any linear controller K by a suitable choice of <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/>’s.</p>
<p>There are two barriers though. First, the number of parameters grows with time $T$ and so can regret and running time. Secondly, since there is a state, the decision a controller makes at a particular instance affects the future. We deal with these two problems formally in the paper and show how they may be circumvented. One of the important techniques we use is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Online Convex Optimization with Memory</a>.</p>
<p>With all the core components in place, we provide a brief specification of our algorithm. Let’s fix some memory length H, and a time step t. Define a proxy cost as</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)"/> =</p>
</td>
<td>Cost Paid at Time t, had we execute the policy <img alt="\{M_1, \ldots M_H\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_1, \ldots M_H\}"/> for t-H steps, with the system reset to 0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The algorithm now as suggested by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Anava, Hazan and Manor</a>, is to take a gradient step on the above proxy.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="29" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-3.png?w=624&amp;h=29" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>The above algorithm achieves <img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/> regret against <b>worst-case</b> noise. For the full proof and the precise derivation of the algorithm, check out the paper.</p>
<h2>Achieving Logarithmic Regret</h2>
<p>Algorithms for (state-less) online learning often enjoy logarithmic regret guarantees in the presence of strongly convex loss functions. Prima facie, one could hope that for dynamical systems with strongly convex costs, such a stronger regret guarantee would hold. The cautionary note here is that <b>strong convexity of the cost <img alt="c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(x_t, u_t)"/> in the control input does not imply strong convexity in the controller representation</b>.,</p>
<p>In fact, the strong convexity of our proxy cost function <img alt="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)"/> in its natural parameterization over M’s is further hindered by the fact that the space of M’s constitutes a highly over-parametrized representation (say, vs. K). Indeed in the case of adversarial perturbations, it is easy to construct a case where the strong convexity does not transfer over from the control to the controller.</p>
<p>In a future blog post we detail how this technical difficulty can be overcome using the natural gradient method, giving rise to a logarithmic regret algorithm for control.</p>
<h2>Experimental Validation</h2>
<p>Below we provide empirical evaluations of the GPC controller in various scenarios, demonstrating it is indeed more robust to correlated noise than previous notions. <b>(All the plots below are produced by a new research-first control and time series library in the works — Alpha version scheduled to be released soon! STAY TUNED!!!) </b></p>
<p>To start, let’s reproduce the classical setting of controlling an LDS with i.i.d. Gaussian noise. Here, the LQR program is <i>optimal</i>. Yet, the plot below attests that our new control methodology offers a slightly suboptimal, yet comparable, performance. This observation also underlines the message the the proposed controller tracks the optimal controller without any foreknowledge of the structure of the perturbations. Here, for example, GPC is not made aware of the i.i.d. nature of the perturbations.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-4.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Moving on to correlated perturbations across time, a simple such setting is when the perturbations are drawn from a Gaussian Random Walk (as opposed to independent Gaussians). Note that here it is possible to derive the <i>optimal </i>controller via the separation principle. Here is the performance plot:</p>
<h1><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-5.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></h1>
<p>Note that the default LQR controller performs much worse, where as GPC is able to track the performance of the optimal controller quite closely. Next up, <b>sinusoidal noise</b>:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-6.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Here the full power of regret minimization is exhibited as the consecutive samples of the sine function are very correlated, yet predictable. GPC vastly outperforms LQR as one would expect. But, is this fundamentally a hard setting? What would happen if we use the H-infinity controller, or, god forbid, no control at all? We see this in the next plot (on the log-linear scale):</p>
<p><img alt="" height="202" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-7.png?w=624&amp;h=202" title="" width="624"/></p>
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>We have surveyed a new family of controls that are fundamentally different than classical optimal control: they are adaptive and attain regret guarantees vs. adversarial noise. Their preliminary experimental tests seem quite promising.</p>
<p>In the coming posts we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain how GPC can obtain the first logarithmic regret in the tracking/Kalman setting,</li>
<li>Reveal our new research-first library for control / time-series prediction,</li>
<li>Tackle more general settings.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Stay tuned! Preferably using the GPC… <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></h1>

    <title>Are all kernels cursed?</title>
    <summary>The word “kernel” appears in many areas of science (it is even worse in French with “noyau”); it can have different meanings depending on context (see here for a nice short historical review for mathematics). Within machine learning and statistics, kernels are used in two related but different contexts, with different definitions and some kernels...</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">The word “kernel” appears in many areas of science (it is even worse in French with “noyau”); it can have different meanings depending on context (see <a href="http://jeff560.tripod.com/k.html">here</a> for a nice short historical review for mathematics).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Within machine learning and statistics, kernels are used in two related but different contexts, with different definitions and some kernels like the beloved and widely used Gaussian kernel being an example of both. This has been and still is a source of confusion that I would like to settle for good with this post! In particular, these two types of kernels have different properties regarding their resistance (or lack thereof) to the curse of dimensionality.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Throughout this post, for simplicity, I will assume that data live in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), noting that most concepts can be extended to any space (e.g., images, graphs, etc.): this is the beauty of the (positive-definite) kernel trick but this is for another post. </p>



<p class="justify-text">I will consider a kernel function \(k\), which is a real-valued function defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d\). I will always assume that the kernel \(k\) is <strong>symmetric</strong>, that is, \(k(x,y) = k(y,x)\) for any \(x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">An important object of study will be the <strong>kernel matrix</strong> \(K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) obtained from \(n\) observations \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in\mathbb{R}^d\), which is defined through $$K_{ij} = k(x_i,x_j).$$ Given the symmetry assumption on \(k\), it will be a symmetric matrix (hence with real eigenvalues).</p>



<p class="justify-text">I will now present the two types of kernels, (1) <strong>non-negative</strong> kernels and (2) <strong>positive-definite</strong> kernels. For kernels of the form \(k(x,y) = q(x-y)\) for a function \(q: \mathbb{R}^d \to\mathbb{R}\), the two definitions will correspond to (1) \( q \) has non-negative values, and (2) the <em>Fourier transform</em> of \(q\) has non-negative values. This leads to different types of algorithms that I now present.</p>



<h2>I. Non-negative kernels</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Definition</strong> (<em>non-negative kernels</em>). A kernel \(k: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) is non-negative, if $$\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ k(x,y) \geq 0.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">An equivalent definition is that all kernel matrices have non-negative elements. The explicit terminology <em>pointwise</em> non-negativity is sometimes used.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical example is the Gaussian kernel, defined as $$k(x,y) =  \exp\Big( -\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \| x – y\|_2^2\Big),$$ where \(\| z\|_2^2 = \sum_{i=1}^d z_i^2\) is the squared \(\ell_2\)-norm (I have not added any normalizing constant because most algorithms ignore it). Other examples are shown below for \(d=1\).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1024" height="169" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/windows-1024x229.png" width="759"/>Various kernels plotted at \(y = 0\): Gaussian kernel \(\exp\big( – \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (x-y)^2\big)\), Exponential kernel \(\exp\big( – \frac{1}{\sigma} |x-y|\big)\), Cauchy kernel \(\frac{1}{1+(x-y)^2 / \sigma^2}\), and triangular kernel \(\max \big\{ 0, 1 – \frac{|x-y| }{2 \sigma} \big\}\).</figure>



<p class="justify-text"> There are many more choices (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)#Kernel_functions_in_common_use">here</a>), but the functions below all also have a non-negative Fourier transform, which will make them also a member of the other class of kernels (see the second part of the post). </p>



<h3>Kernel smoothing (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_regression">Nadaraya-Watson estimator</a>)</h3>



<p class="justify-text">This is a version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation">kernel density estimation</a> for supervised problems, which for simplicity I will describe with real-valued outputs (it can directly be extended to any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model">generalized linear model</a> to tackle other types of outputs). Given \(n\) observations \((x_i,y_i) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), the goal of kernel smoothing is to estimate a function \(\hat{f}: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) that can predict \(y\) from \(x\). It is defined at any test point \({x} \in \mathbb{R^d}\): $$\hat{f}(x) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n k(x,x_i) y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n k(x,x_i)}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">See an illustrative example below in one dimension for the Gaussian kernel. The non-negativity of the kernel is important to make sure the denominator above is positive.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-988" height="218" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nadaraya-2-1024x447.png" width="500"/>Nadaraya-Watson estimation. Left: function \(f\), with noisy observations \(y_i = f(x_i) + \varepsilon_i\). Right: kernel regression estimate \(\hat{f}\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Algorithms</strong>. In terms of computational complexity, computing \(\hat{f}(x)\) for a single \(x\) takes naively time \(O(n)\) to go through the \(n\) data points, but efficient indexing techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree">k-d trees</a> can be used to reduce this cost when \(d\) is not too large. The vector of prediction \(\hat{y}\) for the \(n\) observations, can be obtained as $$ \hat{y} = {\rm Diag}(K 1_n)^{-1} K y .$$ The complexity is \(O(n^2)\) but can also be made linear in \(n\) (in particular when the kernel matrix is in addition positive semi-definite, i.e., when the kernel is both non-negative and positive-definite).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It is important to note that the only free parameter is the bandwidth \(\sigma\), while there will be an extra regularization parameter for positive definite kernels.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Choice of bandwidth</strong>. As illustrated below, for kernels of the form \(k(x,y) = q\big( \frac{x-y}{\sigma} \big)\), like the Gaussian kernel, the choice of the <em>bandwidth</em> parameter \(\sigma\) is crucial.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-989" height="228" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nadaraya.gif" width="257"/>Varying \(\sigma\) from small (leading to overfitting when \(\sigma\) is too small) to large (leading to underfitting when \(\sigma\) is too large).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Note here that when \(\sigma\) tends to zero, then the estimated function \(\hat{f}\) interpolates the data (but without any wild behavior between input observations), while when \(\sigma\) grows, the function \(\hat{f}\) tends to a constant. We now consider only these translation-invariant kernels.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Statistical properties</strong>. Kernel smoothing is a simple instance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics">non-parametric</a> estimation procedure, that can in principle adapt to any underlying function \(f\) that generated the outputs (after additive noise is added, so that the observations are \(y_i = f(x_i) + \varepsilon_i\), with \(\varepsilon_i\) being zero-mean). This estimator is commonly used in low dimensions (e.g., \(d\) less than \(10\) or \(20\)). In higher dimensions however, it suffers from the <em>curse of dimensionality</em> common to most methods based on non-negative kernels.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Consistency and curse of dimensionality</strong>. Kernel regression is one instance of local averaging techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">k-nearest-neighbors</a>, where for any test point \(x\), the outputs \(y_i\) corresponding to inputs \(x_i\) which are closer to \(x\) are given higher weights. For simplicity, I will only consider the kernel \(k(x,y) = 1_{\| x – y\|_\infty \leq \sigma}\) where \(\| z\|_\infty = \max\{ |z_1|,\dots,|z_d|\}\) is the \(\ell_\infty\)-norm of \(z\). The discussion below extends with more technicalities to all translation-invariant kernels.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1086" height="178" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/filling_space_cube-3.png" width="389"/>\(n=11\) observations in dimension \(d=2\), with a test point \(\hat{x}\). Only three observations within distance \(\sigma\) in \(\ell_\infty\)-norm are counted for computing \(\hat{f}(x)\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In order to obtain a <em>consistent</em> estimator \(\hat{f}\) that converges to the true underlying function \(f\) when \(n\) tends to infinity, the bandwidth \(\sigma\) should depend on \(n\) (and hence denoted \(\sigma_n\)), with two potentially conflicting goals:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>Vanishing bias</em>: The bandwidth \(\sigma_n\) should be small enough so that the underlying function \(f\) does not vary much in a ball of radius \(\sigma_n\) around \(x\). When \(f\) is assumed Lipschitz-continuous, the deviation is proportional to \(\sigma_n\). Therefore, the error in estimating \(f\) is proportional to \(\sigma_n\) and we thus need $$ \sigma_n \to 0.$$ </li><li><em>Vanishing variance</em>: Since the observations \(y_i = f(x_i) + \varepsilon_i\) are noisy, around some test point \(\hat{x}\), we need to average sufficiently many of them so that the noise is averaged out, that is, for any test point \(\hat{x}\), the number of observations that are in a ball of radius \(\sigma_n\) should tend to infinity with \(n\). With a simple covering argument, this requires (at least) $$ n \sigma_n^d \to +\infty.$$ This illustrated below for the specific kernel I chose, which is based on the \(\ell_\infty\)-norm.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1093" height="211" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/covering_cube-2.png" width="456"/>Assuming the support of the distribution of inputs is an \(\ell_\infty\)-ball of radius \(1/2\) in dimension \(d=2\), then with \(\sigma_n = 1/8\), in order to have a consistent estimation for each of the \((2\sigma_n)^{-d} = 16\) candidate test points \(\hat{x}_1,\dots,\hat{x}_{16}\), the number of points in each of the \(m = (2\sigma_n)^{-d}\) balls has to grow unbounded and thus \(n/m = n (2\sigma_n)^{d}\) has to grow unbounded.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Therefore,  in order to obtain a consistent estimator, the bandwidth of translation-invariant kernels has to go to zero slowly enough, slower than \(n^{-1/d}\), and the final estimation error is converging to zero, but slower than \(n^{-1/d}\).  This is the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a>: in order to obtain a certain error \(\epsilon\), the number of observations has to grow at least as \(\epsilon^{-d}\), and thus exponentially in dimension. When the underlying function has weak smoothness properties (here just Lipschitz-continuous), such a dependence in \(d\) is provably unavoidable in general [1, 2].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Resistance to the curse of dimensionality</strong>. If the true function \(f\) happens to be more regular (i.e., with bounded higher order derivatives), kernel smoothing cannot adapt to it, that is, the rates of convergence still have the bad dependence on \(d\), while other techniques can have an improved dependence, such as positive-definite kernel methods below, or improved local averaging techniques based on local polynomials [1, 2].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that since the curse of dimensionality comes primarily from a covering argument of the input space, if the distribution of inputs is supported on a low-dimensional manifold, the dependence in \(d\) can be replaced by the same dependence, but now in the dimension of the manifold (see, e.g., [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.lnms/1196794952">7</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Kernel smoothing is one particular instance of methods based on negative-kernels. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation">kernel density estimation</a> is also commonly used. Spectral methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering">clustering</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction">non-linear dimensionality reduction</a>, and Laplacian-based semi-supervised learning [<a href="https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICML/2003/ICML03-118.pdf">8</a>], also use non-negative kernels, with similar conditions on the bandwidth \(\sigma\) (see [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume8/hein07a/hein07a.pdf">3</a>]) and similar curses of dimensionality.</p>



<p>I now turn to the other type of kernels.</p>



<h2>II. Positive-definite kernels</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Definition</strong> (<em>positive-definite kernels</em>). A kernel \(k: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) is positive-definite, if for any finite set of elements \(x_i,\dots,x_n\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), the kernel matrix is positive-semidefinite (that is, all its eigenvalues are non-negative).</p>



<p>The classical examples are:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>Polynomial kernels</em>: \(k(x,y) = (x^\top y)^r\) for \(r\) a positive integer.</li><li><em>Translation-invariant kernels</em>: they are of the form \(k(x,y) = q(x-y)\) for a function \(q: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) with a (pointwise) <strong>non-negative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a></strong>, which is equal to\(\displaystyle \hat{q}(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \! \! q(x) e^{-i \omega^\top x} dx\), and assumed to exist. For these, we see a clear distinction between non-negative kernels of that form, for which \(q\) (and not \(\hat{q}\)) has to have non-negative elements (note that all examples given at the beginning of the post are both, and that there are two hidden Fourier transform pairs).</li><li><em>Kernels on structured objects</em>: when the observations are not vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), such as graphs, trees,  measures, on in fact any objects, specific kernels can be designed with nice properties and many applications, see, e.g., [4].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"/>



<h3>Kernel trick and representer theorem</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The key consequence of positive-definiteness (with surprisingly no other assumptions needed regarding \(k\)) is the existence of an (essentially unique) Hilbert space \(\mathcal{F}\), called the <em>feature space</em>, and a function \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathcal{F}\), called the <em>feature map</em>, such that $$\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ k(x,y) = \langle \Phi(x), \Phi(y) \rangle_\mathcal{F}.$$ This is non-trivial to show and due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space">Aronszajn and Moore</a> in the 1950s.</p>



<p class="justify-text">From a positive-definite kernel, it is to common to define the space of functions \(f\) which are linear in the feature vector \(\Phi\), that is, of the form \(f(x) = \langle w, \Phi(x) \rangle_{\mathcal{F}}\), for a certain \(w \in \mathcal{F}\). When minimizing an empirical risk on \(n\) observations \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d\), regularized by the norm \(\| w\|_\mathcal{F}\), the celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a> (which is a direct consequence of Pythagoras’ theorem) states that \(w\) is of the form \(w = \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j \Phi(x_j)\), and thus \(f\) is of the form $$f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j \langle \Phi(x), \Phi(x_j) \rangle_\mathcal{F} =  \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j k(x,x_j),$$ for a certain vector \(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n\).</p>



<h3>Regularization through positive-definite kernels</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Given the function \(f\) defined as \(f(x) =  \langle w, \Phi(x) \rangle_{\mathcal{F}}\), the regularizer \(\| w\|_\mathcal{H}\) defines a regularization on the prediction function \(f\). This is a key property of positive-definite kernels: they lead to an <em>explicit</em> regularization \(\Omega(f)^2\) on the prediction function (this in fact defines a Hilbert space of functions, which is often referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space">reproducing kernel Hilbert space</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the translation-invariant kernels \(k(x,y) = q(x-y)\), it happens to be equal to (see [4]) $$ \Omega(f)^2 =\frac{1}{(2\pi)^d} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \!\! \frac{|\hat{f}(\omega)|^2 }{\hat{q}(\omega)} d\omega,$$ where \(\hat{f}\) and \(\hat{q}\) are the Fourier transforms of \(f\) and \(q\). For example, for \(d=1\) and the exponential kernel \(q(x-y) = \exp(-|x-y|/\sigma)\), we have \(\hat{q}(\omega) = 2 \sigma / ( 1 + \sigma^2 \omega^2)\), and \(\displaystyle \Omega(f)^2= \frac{1}{2\sigma} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \! |f(x)|^2 dx +\frac{ \sigma}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}}\! |f'(x)|^2 dx \), which is a squared <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev norm</a> (this extends to higher dimensions as well).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In addition, for the Gaussian kernel \(q(x-y) = \exp \big(-(x-y)^2/(2\sigma^2) \big)\), we have \(\hat{q}(\omega) = \sigma \sqrt{2\pi} \exp( – \sigma^2 \omega^2 / 2)\), and \(\displaystyle \Omega(f)^2 = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\sigma^{2k}}{2^k k!}\! \int_{\mathbb{R}} \!|f^{(k)}(x)|^2 dx\), and all derivatives are penalized (also, this extends in higher dimensions). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, some versions of splines can be obtained from positive-definite kernels (and kernel ridge regression below exactly leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing_spline">smoothing splines</a>).</p>



<h3>Kernel ridge regression</h3>



<p class="justify-text">As a consequence of the representer theorem above, when using the square loss, and for a vector of outputs / responses \(y \in \mathbb{R}^n\), when minimizing $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big( y_i – \langle w, \Phi(x_i) \rangle_{\mathcal{F}} \big)^2 + \lambda \| w\|_\mathcal{F}^2,$$ the \(i\)-th prediction \( \langle w, \Phi(x_i) \rangle_{\mathcal{F}}\) is equal to \(\sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j \langle \Phi(x_j),\Phi(x_i)\rangle_{\mathcal{F}}=(K\alpha)_i\) and \(\| w\|_\mathcal{F}^2\) is equal to \(\sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j K_{ij} = \alpha^\top K \alpha\). This leads to the equivalent problem of minimizing $$ \frac{1}{n} \| y – K \alpha \|_2^2 + \lambda \alpha^\top K \alpha,$$ with a solution \(\alpha = ( K + n\lambda I)^{-1} y \in \mathbb{R}^n\), and prediction vector \(\hat{y} = K ( K+ n\lambda  I)^{-1} y \in \mathbb{R}^n\).</p>



<p>See an illustration below for the Gaussian kernel.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1127" height="180" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/krr-1-1024x415.png" width="444"/>Kernel ridge regression estimation. Left: function \(f(x)\), with noisy observations. Right: kernel ridge regression estimate.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Running-time complexity</strong>. Implemented naively in a few lines of code, the complexity will be \(O(n^2)\) for computing the kernel matrix \(K\) and \(O(n^3)\) for solving the linear system to obtain \(\alpha\). This can be greatly reduced using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_matrix_approximations">low-rank approximations</a> (a.k.a. Nyström’s method) or random features [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines.pdf">5</a>]. More on these in future posts.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Do we really need positive-definiteness?</strong> In the objective function above, the only place where positive-definiteness seems needed is for the the regularization term \(\alpha^\top K \alpha\) to be convex, which automatically leads to a well-behaved optimization problem. We could do the same by replacing it by \(\| \alpha\|_2^2\) and no need for \(K\) to be positive-semidefinite. While this is implementable, it lacks a clear interpretation in terms of regularization of the prediction function and some of the techniques designed to avoid a running time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) cannot be used.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Choice of bandwidth</strong>. Compared to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, for translation-invariant kernels, there are two parameters, the kernel bandwidth \(\sigma\) and the regularization parameter \(\lambda\). Below, we vary \(\lambda\) for two fixed values of \(\sigma\). A few points to note:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>Strong overfitting for small \(\lambda\)</em>: compared to Nadaraya-Watson, which was interpolating nicely for small \(\sigma\), kernel ridge regression overfits a lot for small \(\lambda\), with a wild behavior between observed inputs.</li><li><em>Robustness to larger \(\sigma\)</em>: with a proper regularization parameter \(\lambda\), larger values of \(\sigma\) can still lead to good predictions (as opposed to Nadaraya-Watson estimation). Another illustration of the robustness to larger \(\sigma\) is the possibility of having consistent estimation without a vanishing bandwidth \(\sigma\) (see below).</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1128" height="177" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/krr-1.gif" width="438"/>Varying \(\lambda\) from small (leading to overfitting when \(\lambda\) is too small) to large (leading to underfitting when \(\lambda\) is too large). Two values of the bandwidth \(\sigma\).</figure></div>



<h3>Consistency and curse of dimensionality</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Positive-definite kernel methods are also non-parametric estimation procedures. They can adapt to any underlying function, if the kernel is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_embedding_of_distributions#Universal_kernels">universal</a></em>.  For translation-invariant kernels, a sufficient condition is a <em>strictly positive</em> Fourier transform (which is typically true for all bandwidths).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In most analyses, the bandwidth \(\sigma\) is <em>fixed</em>, and the regularization parameter \(\lambda\) goes to zero with \(n\) (a notable exception is the nice paper from the Vert brothers [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume7/vert06a/vert06a.pdf">6</a>]). With the proper decay of \(\lambda\), as \(n\) grows, we obtain a consistent estimator.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When only assuming Lipschitz-continuity of the true underlying function, the rate of convergence also has a bad behavior in dimension \(d\), typically of the form \(O(n^{-1/d})\) (any way, such dependence is provably unavoidable, this is the usual curse of dimensionality for regression in high dimension).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptivity to smooth functions</strong>. A key benefit of using positive-definite kernels is that if the underlying function is smoother than simply Lipschitz-continuous, then the convergence rates do improve with a proper choice of \(\lambda\). In the most favorable situation where the true regression function \(f\) belongs to the space of functions defined by the kernel, then the convergent rate is less than \(O(n^{-1/4})\). This may however require functions which are too smooth (in particular for the Gaussian kernel, these functions are infinitely differentiable). </p>



<p class="justify-text">However, kernel methods also lead to consistent estimation beyond this favorable situation, and such methods are adaptive to all functions which are in between Lipschitz-continuous functions (essentially bounded first order derivatives) and these potentially very smooth functions. For example, for the Gaussian kernel, as soon as it is \(s\)-times differentiable with bounded \(s\)-th order derivative, with \(s&gt;d/2\), then the convergence rate does not exhibit any more a dependence in \(d\) in the power of \(n\), i.e., the convergence rate is also less than \(O(n^{-1/4})\). If \(s\) is smaller than \(d/2\), then the convergence rate is in between \(O(n^{-1/4})\) and \(O(n^{-1/d})\), essentially of the form \(O(n^{-2s/d})\) or \(O(n^{-s/d})\) (for precise details, see [1, 2]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This adaptivity requires the proper regularization parameter \(\lambda\). For the Gaussian kernel, as outlined in [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v30/Bach13.pdf">9</a>], it may need to be very small (e.g., exponentially decaying with \(n\)), leading to optimization problems which are strongly ill-conditioned. More on this in a future post.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><em>Are all kernels cursed?</em> In this post, I have tried to highlight the difference between the two types of kernels, (1) the (pointwise) non-negative ones, which lead to local averaging techniques that cannot avoid the curse of dimensionality, even in favorable situations, and (2) the positive-definite ones, which exhibit some form of adaptivity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">If you went that far into the post, you are probably a kernel enthusiast, but if you are not and wondering why you should care about kernels in the neural network age, a few final thoughts: </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>What are the adaptivity properties of neural networks</strong>? They are indeed superior; for example, with a single hidden layer, neural networks are adaptive to linear structures, such as dependence on a subset of variables, while kernels with similar architectures are not [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">10</a>]. However, neural networks do not lead (yet) to precise guarantees on the solvability of the corresponding optimization problems.</li><li><strong>Can we learn with positive-definite kernels with lots of data</strong>? Yes! With proper tools such as random features [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines.pdf">5</a>] or column sampling, and with the proper and very nice pre-conditioning of [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6978-falkon-an-optimal-large-scale-kernel-method.pdf">11</a>], kernels can be used with ten millions of observations or more.</li><li><strong>Can we apply kernels to computer vision</strong>? Yes!

    <title>The Gumbel trick</title>
    <summary>Quantities of the form \(\displaystyle \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \exp( x_i) \Big)\) for \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\), often referred to as “log-sum-exp” functions are ubiquitous in machine learning, as they appear in normalizing constants of exponential families, and thus in many supervised learning formulations such as softmax regression, but also more generally in (Bayesian or frequentist) probabilistic...</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text" style="text-align: left;">Quantities of the form \(\displaystyle \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \exp( x_i) \Big)\) for \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\), often referred to as “log-sum-exp” functions are ubiquitous in machine learning, as they appear in normalizing constants of exponential families, and thus in many supervised learning formulations such as softmax regression, but also more generally in (Bayesian or frequentist) probabilistic modelling. Moreover, as often used in optimization, they are a standard way of performing a soft maximum. In this context, the function defined as  $$  \displaystyle f_\varepsilon(x) = \varepsilon \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \exp( x_i / \varepsilon) \Big),$$ is such that \( \displaystyle \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} f_\varepsilon(x) = \max\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Is it possible to go from the maximum back to the softmax \(f_\varepsilon(x)\) (for any strictly positive \(\varepsilon\), and thus equivalently for \(\varepsilon=1\)) ? Beyond being a nice mathematical puzzle, this would be useful for very large \(n\) when the maximization problem could be easier than the summation problem (more on this below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">While this seems at first impossible, the Gumbel trick provides a surprising randomized solution. We consider adding some independent and identically distributed random variables \(\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_n\), to form the vector \(x + \gamma \in \mathbb{R}^n\) and takes its maximum component, that is, $$<br/> y = x + \gamma \mbox{ and } z = \max \big\{ y_1,\dots, y_n \big\} = \max \big\{ x_1 + \gamma_1,\dots,x_n +\gamma_n \big\}.$$ With a well chosen distribution for the components of \(\gamma\), we exactly have $$\mathbb{E} z = <br/> \mathbb{E} \max \big\{ y_1,\dots, y_n \big\} =  \mathbb{E} \max \big\{ x_1 + \gamma_1,\dots,x_n +\gamma_n \big\} = \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \exp( x_i) \Big).$$ This is achieved by the Gumbel distribution, hence the name “Gumbel trick” (the first applications within machine learning seem to be from <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~manfred/pubs/open/P3.pdf">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~gpapan/pubs/confr/PapandreouYuille_PerturbAndMap_ieee-c-iccv11.pdf">[2]</a>, while this is a well-known fact in social sciences, see, e.g., <a href="https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7z91732x/qt7z91732x.pdf">[3]</a>). We first make a detour through exponential distributions. </p>



<h2>Minimum of independent exponential distributions</h2>



<p class="justify-text"> A random variable \(T\) is distributed according to the exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\), if  it is supported on the positive real line and its density there is equal to \(t \mapsto \lambda \exp( – \lambda t).\)  We have these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">classical properties</a>: </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>\(\mathbb{E} T = 1/\lambda\) and \({\rm var}(T) = 1/ \lambda^2\).</li><li>\(T\) has the same distribution as \(-( 1/\lambda)\log U\), where \(U\) has a uniform distribution on \([0,1]\), leading to a simple algorithm to sample \(T\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">A key property which is used heavily in point processes and queuing theory is characterizing the minimum and minimizer of independent exponentially distributed random variables.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong>. Given \(n\) independent variables \(T_i\)  distributed according to exponential distributions with parameter \(\lambda_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), the minimum \(V = \min \{T_1,\dots,T_n\}\) is distributed according to an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda_1+\dots+\lambda_n\), and the minimizer \(i^\ast= \arg \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} T_i\) (breaking ties arbitrarily) is distributed according to a multinomial distribution of parameter \(\pi\) with \(\displaystyle \pi_i = \frac{\lambda_i}{ \lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n}\), for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\). Moreover, \(i^\ast\) and \(V\) are independent.</p>



<p class="justify-text"> <em>(simple) Proof</em>. A direct integration shows that $$ \mathbb{P}( T \geq u) = \int_{u}^{+\infty} \lambda \exp( -\lambda t) = \exp(-\lambda u).$$ We can then directly compute the probability, for a fixed \(i \in {1,\dots,n}\) and \(u \in \mathbb{R}_+\): $$<br/> \mathbb{P}( I^\ast = i, V \geq u)  =  \mathbb{P}( T_i \geq u, \forall j \neq i, T_j \geq T_i),$$ which is equal by independence of all \(T_j\)’s to $$  \int_{u}^{+\infty} \Big( \prod_{ j\neq i} \exp( –  \lambda_j t_i) \Big) \lambda_i \exp( – \lambda_i  t_i) dt_i =  \exp\Big( – u \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \Big) \times \frac{\lambda_i}{ \lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n},$$ which exactly shows the desired result (both independence and the claimed distributions).</p>



<h2>From exponential to Gumbel distributions </h2>



<p class="justify-text">A real random variable \(\Gamma\) is distributed according to a Gumbel distribution with parameter \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), if it is equal in distribution to \(\Gamma = -\log T – C\), where \(T\) is distributed according to an exponential distribution of parameter \(\lambda = \exp(x)\), and \(C\approx 0.5772\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant">Euler constant</a> (note that in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution">conventions</a>, \(C\) is not subtracted). We have the following properties:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>\(\mathbb{E} \Gamma = x\) where Indeed, we have: $$ \mathbb{E} \Gamma= -\int_0^{+\infty} \log (y\exp(-x)) \exp(-y) dy\  – C= x \ – \int_0^{+\infty} (\log y)\exp(-y) dy \ – C = x,$$ with a standard property of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant">Euler constant</a>.</li><li>\({\rm var}(\Gamma) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\) (proof left as an exercise, derivatives of the Gamma function could be handy).</li><li>\(\Gamma\) has the same distribution as \(x – C – \log( – \log U) \), where \(U\) has a uniform distribution on \([0,1]\), leading to a simple algorithm to sample \(\Gamma\).</li><li>The density of \(\Gamma\) is \(p(\gamma) = \exp( x-\gamma -C  –  \exp( x – \gamma – C) )\), as shown below for \(x=0\).</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-150" height="261" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/gumbel-1024x635.png" width="422"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The proposition above on exponential distributions leads to the following result.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong>. Given \(n\) independent variables \(\Gamma_i\) distributed according to Gumbel distributions with parameter \(x_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), the maximum \(Z = \max \{\Gamma_1,\dots,\Gamma_n\}\) is distributed according to a Gumbel distribution with parameter (and thus mean) \(\log \big( \sum_{k=1}^n \exp(x_k) \big)\), the minimizer \(i^\ast= \arg \max_{i \in {1,\dots,n}} \Gamma_i\) (breaking ties arbitrarily) is distributed according to a multinomial distribution of parameter \(\pi\) with \(\displaystyle \pi_i = \frac{\exp(x_i)}{ \exp(x_1) + \cdots + \exp(x_n)}\), for \(i \in {1,\dots,n}\). Moreover, \(i^\ast\) and \(Z\) are independent.</p>



<h2>Applications in machine learning </h2>



<p>The Gumbel trick can be used in mainly two ways: (a) the main goal is to approximate the expectation using a finite average or using stochastic gradients (then only the value of the maximum is used), (b) the minimizer is used for sampling purposes. I will focus only on the first type of applications and refer to the very nice posts of <a href="http://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2014/08/01/gumbel-max-trick-and-weighted-reservoir-sampling/">Tim Vieira</a>, <a href="https://cmaddis.github.io/gumbel-machinery">Chris Maddison</a>, and <a href="https://laurent-dinh.github.io/2016/11/22/gumbel-max.html">Laurent Dinh</a> for the sampling aspects.</p>



<h3>Log-partition functions</h3>



<p class="justify-text">We consider \(d\) finite sets \(\mathcal{X}_1,\dots,\mathcal{X}_d\), and a probability mass function at \(x = (x_1,\dots,x_d)\) of the form: $$p(x) = p(x_1,\dots,x_d) = \exp( f(x)\  – A(f)),$$ where \(f:  \mathcal{X}_1 \times \dots \times \mathcal{X}_d \to \mathbb{R}\) is a any function, and $$  A(f) = \log \big( \sum_{x_1 \in \mathcal{X}_1,\dots,x_d \in \mathcal{X}_d} \exp( f(x) ) \big)$$ is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(mathematics)">log-partition function</a> (which is here to make the probability mass sum to one). The cardinality of \(\mathcal{X}_1 \times \dots \times \mathcal{X}_d\) is exponential in \(d\) and thus the sum defining \(A(f)\) cannot in general be computed even for moderate \(d\). Since computing \(A(f)\) or its derivatives is a key step in many inference tasks, finding approximations is one of the standard computational problems in probabilistic modelling.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The Gumbel trick allows to go from maximization problems to “log-sum-exp” problems, and is only useful when the maximization problem is easy to solve while the “log-sum-exp” problem is not. Can this really happen? In other words…</p>



<h3>Is the Gumbel trick useful?</h3>



<p class="justify-text">There are many conditions under which combinatorial optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time, but two properties have emerged as crucial (at least in machine learning applications): (1) dynamic programming, and (2) linear programming. For simplicity, I will illustrate them for binary problems where \(\mathcal{X}_i = \{0,1\}\) for all \(i\), and so-called “cut functions” \(f(x) = \sum_{i,j = 1}^d w_{i,j} x_i x_j + \sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i\), for arbitrary scalar weights \(w_{i,j}\), \(w_i\).</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Dynamic programming</strong>: this corresponds to the situations where most of the weights \(w_{i,j}\) are equal to zero, with the graph on the vertex set \(\{1,\dots,n\}\) with edge set equal to the pairs \((i,j)\) with \(w_{i,j}\neq 0\), being a tree, or a chain. <br/>For example, consider \(f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{d-1} w_{i,i+1} x_i x_{i+1} + \sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i\). In this situation, one can compute sequentially the functions (with increasing index \(k\)) $$  f_k(x_k) = \max_{x_1,\dots,x_{k-1}} \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} w_{i,i+1} x_i x_{i+1} + \sum_{i=1}^k w_i x_i,$$ noticing that $$f_{k+1}(x_{k+1}) = \max_{x_{k} \in \{0,1\}} f_k(x_k) + w_{k-1,k} x_k x_{k+1} + w_{k+1} x_{k+1}, $$ which can be computed easily; the recursion leads to the desired value \(\max_{x_{d} \in \{0,1\}} f_d(x_d)\). <br/>In order to obtain the identity above, we have simply used the property $$\max\{ A + B, C + B\} = B + \max \{A,C\}.$$ However, this property is also true for the softmax, as $$\log \big( \exp(A + B) + \exp(C + B) \big) = B+ \log \big( \exp(A) + \exp(C ) \big).$$ Thus, the same dynamic programming strategy works for softmax, and using the Gumbel trick is here useless. (here, we have described a particular instance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_propagation">sum-product and max-product</a> algorithms for graphical models). </li></ul>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Linear programming</strong>: for the particular generic quadratic binary problem, we can write for any \(x_i,x_j \in \{0,1\}\), \(x_i x_j = \min \{x_i,x_j\}\), and, if all \(w_{i,j}\) are non-positive (and here no constraint regarding having many zero values), then the function \(g: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) defined as  \(g(x) = \sum_{i,j = 1}^d w_{i,j} \min \{x_i,x_j\} + \sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i\)  is concave and equal to \(f\) for \(x \in \{0,1\}^d\). The convex relaxation of computing \(\max_{x \in \{0,1\}^d} f(x)\) is \(\max_{x \in [0,1]^d} f(x)\), which is a <em>concave maximization</em> problem, which can be solved in polynomial time (it can be cast as a linear programming problem). For this particular problems, due to a property called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submodular_set_function">submodularity</a></em>, the convex relaxation happens to be tight. In these situations, maximizing is feasible while “log-sum-exp” is not. However, the Gumbel trick requires to perturb \(f(x)\) with a different random values for <strong>all</strong> \(2^d\) assignments of \((x_1,\dots,x_d)\), thus totally losing the structure above. Therefore, using the Gumbel trick is here also useless.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">Thus it seems that for classical situations where maximization can be done in polynomial time, the Gumbel trick is useless, either because performing log-sum-exp is as simple (for dynamic programming), or because maximization is intractable once the Gumbel perturbations are added (for linear programming). Can we make it useful?</p>



<h3>Separable Gumbel perturbations</h3>



<p class="justify-text">This is where Tamir Hazan and Tommi Jaakkola <a href="https://icml.cc/2012/papers/528.pdf">[4]</a> come in with the following very nice and important result, which is true beyond cut functions, and shows that with a separable random perturbation, we get an upper-bound of the log-partition function.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong>. Given \(d\) random functions \(\gamma_i : \mathcal{X}_i \mapsto \mathbb{R}\), \(i=1,\dots,d\), such that each value (within and across the functions) is sampled independently distributed from a Gumbel distribution with zero mean, then $$A(f) \leq \mathbb{E} \Big[ \max_{x_1 \in \mathcal{X}_1,\dots,x_d \in \mathcal{X}_d} f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^d \gamma_i(x_i)\Big].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><em>Proof</em>. We can show the result by induction on \(d\), by first conditioning on \(\gamma_d\) to get $$\mathbb{E} \Big[ \! \max_{x_1,\dots,x_d} \!f(x_1,\dots,x_d) + \! \sum_{i=1}^d \gamma_i(x_i)\Big] = \mathbb{E} \bigg[\mathbb{E}  \Big[ \! \max_{x_1,\dots,x_d} \!f(x_1,\dots,x_d) + \! \sum_{i=1}^d \gamma_i(x_i) \  \Big| \ \gamma_d \Big] \bigg], $$ and the property that the expectation of the max is larger than the max of the expectation to get the lower-bound $$   \mathbb{E} \bigg[ \max_{x_d} \mathbb{E}  \Big[ \! \max_{x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}} \!f(x_1,\dots,x_d) + \! \sum_{i=1}^d \gamma_i(x_i) \  \Big| \ \gamma_d \Big] \bigg].$$ It is equal to $$   \mathbb{E} \bigg[ \max_{x_d} \Big\{  \gamma_{d}(x_d) + \mathbb{E}  \Big[ \! \max_{x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}} \!f(x_1,\dots,x_d) + \! \sum_{i=1}^{d-1} \gamma_i(x_i) \  \Big| \ \gamma_d \Big] \Big\} \bigg], $$ which is lower-bounded by applying the result for \(d-1\), by $$  \mathbb{E} \max_{x_d} \Big\{ \gamma_d(x_d) + \log \Big( \sum_{x_1 ,\dots,x_{d-1}} \exp(f(x))\Big) \Big\} =  \log \Big( \sum_{x_1 ,\dots,x_{d}} \exp(f(x))\Big),$$ by applying the regular Gumbel trick to \(\gamma_d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For binary problems like for cut-functions, this corresponds to adding to \(f(x) = \sum_{i,j = 1}^d w_{i,j} x_i x_j + \sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i\), the term \(\sum_{i=1}^d x_i \gamma_i(1) + \sum_{i=1}^d (1-x_i) \gamma_i(0)\), which is a linear function of \(x\), and still leading to a tight convex relaxation. Here \(2d\) Gumbel variables are used instead of \(2^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This seminal result led to a series of works using this result to approximate the log-partition function for parameter learning in intractable distributions where the maximization problem is efficient [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v33/gane14.pdf">5</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6402-parameter-learning-for-log-supermodular-distributions.pdf">6</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Interestingly, the Gumbel trick is a simple consequence of a special property of a specific exponential family (here the exponential distribution). Some other exponential families (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution">Gamma</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution">Dirichlet</a>) lead to different special properties with other nice consequences, but this is for future posts.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">In my <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-%CE%B7-trick-or-the-effectiveness-of-reweighted-least-squares/">previous post</a>, I described various (potentially non-smooth) functions that have quadratic (and thus smooth) variational formulations, a possibility that I referred to as the η-trick.

<p class="justify-text">While it seems most often used for deriving simple optimization algorithms, it has other applications and interpretations in machine learning, in particular for “multiple kernel learning” (MKL), super-Gaussian distributions and convex relaxations of combinatorial penalties. In this post, I will cover the MKL part, which leads to a framework for learning discriminative representations from data.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We first take a detour through supervised learning with <em>linear models</em> based on <em>features</em>.</p>



<h2>Learning “features” for “linear” predictions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Consider the typical supervised learning problem of estimating labels \(y_i \in \mathbb{R}\) from some inputs \(x_i\) in a input space \(\mathcal{X}\), for \(i = 1,\dots,n\). The input space \(\mathcal{X}\) is left generic on purpose, and, both in theory and practice, inputs can have a wide variety of structures (e.g., images, sequences, graphs, web pages, text documents, logs, etc.).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to deal with such potentially non-vectorial inputs, a <em>feature map</em> \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\) is often used, and then <em>linear models</em> consider prediction functions of the form \(f(x) = w^\top \varphi(x)\), where \(w \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a weight vector. The terminology “linear” refers to linearity in the parameters \(w\), and <strong><em>not</em></strong> linearity in the inputs \(x\); indeed, \(\varphi\) may be non-linear, and the notion can even have no meaning if \(\mathcal{X}\) is not a vector space (note that when \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\), and \(\varphi(x) = x\), which is common in many applications, we have <em>in this particular situation</em> predictions that are linear in the inputs). Given the feature map \(\varphi\), the first task is to learn the parameter vector \(w \in \mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Using the square loss for simplicity (but everything extends to convex loss functions such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification">logistic loss</a>), training is usually done by minimizing with respect to \(w\) the so-called regularized empirical risk $$ \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big(y_i – w^\top \varphi(x_i) \big)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| w\|_2^2,$$ where the \(\ell_2\)-norm-regularization is standard to avoid overfitting and makes the problem numerically well-behaved. While for general convex loss functions, we would get a convex optimization problem, here, with the square loss, it is even simpler as we can get a solution in closed form (see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">While explicit fixed feature maps \(\varphi : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\) have always been successfully used, learning these feature maps directly from data is an important task in machine learning. Given some parameterization \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) (with parameters \(\eta\)), one then minimizes the objective function $$ \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big(y_i – w^\top \varphi_\eta(x_i) \big)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| w \|_2^2,$$  both with respect to the weight vector \(w\) <em>and</em> the feature parameters \(\eta\) (the only change from the equation above is the replacement of \(\varphi(x_i)\) by \(\varphi_\eta(x_i)\)). Regardless of the particular parametrization of \(\varphi_\eta\), the optimization problem is convex in \(w\), but typically is not convex in \(\eta\) (and even more rarely jointly convex).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This framework includes (but is not limited to) neural networks, where \(w\) is the set of output weights and \(\eta\) corresponds to all other neuron weights, and \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) is the value of the last hidden layer; see an example below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-657" height="186" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/neuralnet-1.png" width="423"/>Neural networks with two hidden layers. The input weights \(\eta\) (in green) define a function \(x \mapsto \varphi_\eta(x)\), which is the last hidden layer (in blue), which can be linearly combined with output weights \(w\) (in red), leading to the output \(y\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The most direct approach is to estimate \((\eta,w)\) through joint gradient descent techniques. For neural networks, the problem is not jointly convex in \((\eta,w)\), but remains convex in \(w\); thus, even if \(\eta\) is not optimally estimated, the optimization in \(w\) by gradient descent, which is robust (since the objective function is convex), can still lead to a good prediction function \(x \mapsto w^\top \varphi_\eta(x)\) (in particular when  the size of the feature vector \(d\) is large). In other words (and in a quite intuitive/hand-wavy way), being very precise in the feature vector \(\varphi_\eta\) (which we cannot guarantee) is not as important as being precise in optimizing \(w\) (which we can). A key empirical property of (deep) neural networks is that, with the proper initialization and stochastic gradient descent algorithms, the feature parameters \(\eta\) can be learned with sufficient precision and great adaptivity to the final task (of predicting the labels). The theory about this now well-known empirical behavior is starting to emerge (a topic for another post).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another approach to learn parameters, which comes with theoretical guarantees because it relies on a jointly convex problem when using appropriate parameterizations, is to first minimize with respect to \(w\) (again, which is easy because of convexity), and optimize the resulting function with respect to the feature map \(\varphi_\eta\). It turns out that there is a nice connection with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel methods</a>, as I now show.</p>



<h2>Optimizing the weight vector \(w\) and the kernel trick</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a generic feature map \(\varphi_\eta: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\), and we denote by \(\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\) the concatenation of all \(n\) feature vectors \(\varphi_\eta(x_i)\), \(i=1,\dots,n\) (since we consider \(\eta\) fixed in this section, we drop the dependence in \(\eta\)). the objective writes in compact form $$ \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi  w \|_2^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| w\|_2^2.$$ Its gradient is equal to \(\frac{1}{n} \Phi ^\top ( \Phi  w – y ) + \lambda w\), and setting it to zero leads to the minimizer \(w = ( \Phi ^\top \Phi  + n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi^\top y \in \mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity">matrix inversion lemma</a>, to obtain \(w = \Phi^\top  ( \Phi  \Phi ^\top + n \lambda I)^{-1} y\). By doing so we went from the <em>empirical (non-centered) covariance matrix</em> \(\frac{1}{n} \Phi ^\top \Phi  \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) of the features, to the <em>kernel matrix</em> \(K = \Phi \Phi^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\). The notation \(\alpha = ( \Phi \Phi^\top + n \lambda I)^{-1} y = ( K + n \lambda I)^{-1} y \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is often used, so that \(w = \Phi^\top \alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \varphi_\eta(x_i)\), that is, \(w\) is a linear combination of the input features and the weights in this combination can be computed by only accessing the input features through the kernel matrix, which is composed of dot-products \(\varphi_\eta(x_i)^\top \varphi_\eta(x_j)\). This is exactly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel trick</a> and (an explicit version of) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The kernel trick allows to work with large feature spaces, i.e., feature maps \(\varphi\) with potentially high (and sometimes infinite) output dimension \(d\), with a computational cost which is independent of \(d\), if the kernel \(k(x,x’) = \varphi_\eta(x)^\top \varphi_\eta(x’)\) can be evaluated cheaply. Such kernels have been designed in the last twenty years for most of the common data types that I mentioned above (e.g., images, sequences, graphs, web pages, text documents, logs, etc.). See, e.g., the two reference books <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/kernel-methods-for-pattern-analysis/811462F4D6CD6A536A05127319A8935A">[1]</a> and <a href="http://agbs.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/lwk/">[2]</a>, as well as the nice <a href="http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/teaching/">teaching slides</a> of Jean-Philippe Vert. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that kernel methods unfortunately come naturally with a running time with a quadratic  dependence in \(n\) (as this is the cost of computing the kernel matrix), unless specific techniques are used (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5936-less-is-more-nystrom-computational-regularization.pdf">Nyström / column sampling</a> or <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines">random features</a>) to have a running-time which is subquadratic in \(n\) (these will be topics for future posts).</p>



<h2>Convexity of the optimized objective</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we can compute the minimizer of the optimization problem above in closed form \(w = ( \Phi^\top  \Phi+ n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi^\top  y\), we can evaluate the optimal value of the objective   $$ \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi w \|_2^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| w\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{2n} y^\top y \ – \frac{1}{n} y^\top \Phi w + \frac{1}{2n} w^\top ( \Phi^\top \Phi + n \lambda I) w . $$ This leads to after replacing \(w\) by its value, $$ \frac{1}{2n} y^\top y \ – \frac{1}{2n} y^\top  \Phi ( \Phi^\top  \Phi+ n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi^\top y = \frac{1}{2n} y^\top \big( I – \Phi ( \Phi^\top  \Phi+ n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi^\top\big) y.$$ Using the matrix inversion lemma again, the optimized objective is equal to $$\frac{1}{2n} y^\top \big( I –  ( \Phi \Phi^\top  + n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi \Phi^\top\big) y = \frac{1}{2n} y^\top \big( I – ( K + n \lambda I)^{-1} K \big) y =  \frac{\lambda}{2} y^\top ( K + n \lambda I)^{-1} y. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The features only enter this optimal value as a function \(R(K)\) of the kernel matrix \(K = \Phi \Phi^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\). This function happens to be convex, which can be seen here from the explicit expression of \(R(K)\) and a bit of knowledge in convex analysis (see the classical <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/">Boyd and Vandenberghe book</a>, example 3.4). This is true beyond the square loss and this can nicely be obtained by Lagrange duality (see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lanckriet04a/lanckriet04a.pdf">[3]</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">As I now present, this convexity is the source of approaches to learn the kernel matrix (and hence implicitly the feature vectors) directly from data. </p>



<h2>Multiple kernel learning (MKL)</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given that the set of kernel matrices is a convex cone, a natural parameterization is through a conic combination \(K(\eta) = \sum_{j=1}^m \eta_j K^j\) of base kernel matrices \(K^1,\dots,K^m\), with \(\eta \in \mathbb{R}^m\) being a vector of positive weights. The typical application scenario is as follows: for a given type of data (e.g., images or biological sequences), several kernel functions \(k^1,\dots,k^m : \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) exist in the literature, based on different principles and types of information. Combining them allows to benefit from the predictive power of all of them. This framework is referred to as <em>multiple kernel learning</em>. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Typically, a regularization constraint on the trace of the kernel matrix  \(K(\eta)\) is used as the trace of the kernel matrix is known to  be a good quantity to control generalization to unseen data (see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lanckriet04a/lanckriet04a.pdf">[3]</a>); this leads to a (positive) linear constraint on the vector \(\eta\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that there is a nice relationship with sparsity-inducing norms, which is obtained through the η-trick. We first reinterpret the problem as follows: we consider the feature maps \(\varphi^j: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^{d_j}\) associated with each kernel \(k^j\), \(j=1,\dots,m\), so that \(K^j_{a,b} = \varphi^j(x_a)^\top \varphi^j(x_b)\) for all \(a,b \in {1,\dots,n}\). We can then consider the weighted concatenated feature map $$\varphi_\eta(x) = ( \eta_1^{1/2} \varphi^1(x), \dots, \eta_m^{1/2} \varphi^m(x)) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1+\dots+d_m},$$ for which the kernel \(\varphi_\eta(x)^\top \varphi_\eta(x’) \) is equal to \(\sum_{j=1}^m \eta_j k^j(x,x’)\). See a representation below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-720" height="327" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mkl-1.png" width="495"/>Multiple kernel learning with three blocks of features (in green), multiplied by the kernel parameters \(\eta_1,\eta_2,\eta_3\) to obtain the weighted concatenated feature vector \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) (in blue), composed of three blocks.  Note that all blocks are typically multi-dimensional. These last blue blocks are linearly combined with weights \(w\) (in red), leading to the output \(y\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This provides a link between weighted sums of kernel matrices and specifically parameterized feature maps: we can indeed see the problem either as estimating a specific feature vector \(\varphi_\eta\), or as estimating a conic combination of matrices.  The key benefit of this formulation is that it is <em>jointly convex</em> in \((w,\eta)\), and thus provably “easy” to optimize.</p>



<p class="justify-text"> The η-trick provides an interesting link with sparsity-inducing norms.</p>



<h2>Equivalence with group Lasso</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider as above \(m\) block of features and we denote by \(\Phi^j \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_j}\) the design matrix for the block \(j \in \{1,\dots,m\}\). The (squared) group Lasso problem aims at estimating a linear combination of each block of variables with a regularization term that selects whole blocks (instead of individual variables regardless of the block structures if an \(\ell_1\)-norm was used): $$ \min_{ v_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}, \dots, \ v_m \in \mathbb{R}^{d_m}} \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi^1 v_1 – \cdots – \Phi^m v_m \|_2^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \Big( \| v_1\|_2 + \cdots + \| v_m\|_2 \Big)^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can apply the <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-%CE%B7-trick-or-the-effectiveness-of-reweighted-least-squares/">η-trick</a> to obtain the equivalent problem: $$ \min_{ v_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}, \dots, \ v_m \in \mathbb{R}^{d_m}} \min_{ \eta \in \Delta_m}  \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi^1 v_1 – \cdots – \Phi^m v_m \|_2^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \Big( \frac{\| v_1\|_2^2}{\eta_1} + \cdots + \frac{ \| v_m\|_2^2}{\eta_m} \Big),$$ where \(\Delta_m\) is the simplex in \(\mathbb{R}^m\). Using the change of variable \(w_j = \eta_j^{-1/2} v_j\), we exactly get the minimization of $$ \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi_\eta {w} \|^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| {w} \|_2^2,$$ where \(\Phi_\eta \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (d_1+\cdots+d_m)}\) is the design matrix associated with the concatenated weighted features \(\varphi_\eta(x_i)\), \(i=1,\dots,n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Applying our results above, we can minimize with respect to \({w}\) in closed form as \({w} =  (  \Phi_\eta^\top \Phi_\eta + n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi_\eta^\top  y\), and the resulting minimization problem in \(\eta\) becomes $$ \min_{\eta \in \Delta_m} \frac{\lambda}{2} y^\top \big( K(\eta) + n \lambda I \big)^{-1} y,$$ where \(K(\eta) = \sum_{j=1}^m \eta_j \Phi^j (\Phi^j)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is a kernel matrix which is a convex combination of the \(m\) kernel matrices \(K^j = \Phi^j (\Phi^j)^\top\) corresponding to each block of input variables. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, the group Lasso is equivalent to optimizing over kernel matrices of the form \(K(\eta)\) the convex function \(R: K \mapsto  \frac{\lambda}{2} y^\top ( K + n \lambda I  )^{-1} y\), which happens to be exactly the minimal value of the kernel ridge regression problem, that is, the regularized training error after training that we have presented above (note here that in order to have the constraint that \(\eta\) is on the simplex, that is, \(\eta_1+\cdots + \eta_m = 1\), we can simply impose that all kernel matrices, including \(K(\eta)\), have the same trace, which is standard in practice).</p>



<p class="justify-text">NB: This equivalence between group Lasso and MKL was first proved by Gert Lanckriet, Michael Jordan and myself <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2004/proceedings/papers/321.pdf">[4]</a>, using convex duality and a less intuitive argument, while Alain Rakotomamonjy, Stéphane Canu, Yves Grandvalet and myself <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/rakotomamonjy08a/rakotomamonjy08a.pdf">[5]</a> used the η-trick as described above (if you know about earlier references, please let me know).</p>



<h2>Consequences and extensions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The equivalence between MKL and group Lasso has several interesting consequences.</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Learning weights or using uniform weights:</strong> through the η-trick, we can thus see that minimizing the regularized training error with respect to the kernel matrix is in fact the solution of a sparsity-inducing formulation. Thus it should only be used when such behavior is expected, i.e., learning from a large set of kernel matrices \(K^j\), and selecting only a few of them (for theoretical guarantees, see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/bach08b/bach08b.pdf">[6]</a>). If all kernel matrices are well-selected by the practitioner, a uniform sum typically suffices. In particular, note that for our feature weighting parametrization, the space of functions \(x \mapsto w^\top \varphi_\eta(x)\) when \(w\) varies is always the same as soon as all components of \(\eta\) are strictly positive, and thus using learned or uniform weights should correspond to a prior knowledge that one has about the particular set of kernel matrices.</li><li><strong>Algorithms for MKL / group Lasso</strong>: Since the optimization problem is jointly convex in \((w,\eta)\), the global optimum can be found with arbitrary precision, with a variety of algorithms, working with kernels or not; see <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[7, section 1.5]</a>.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">This equivalence has several interesting extensions beyond plain sparsity or group sparsity.</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Beyond conic combinations</strong>: Other parameterizations of kernel matrices can be used, some of them related to the extension of the η-trick which I mention in my <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-%CE%B7-trick-or-the-effectiveness-of-reweighted-least-squares/">previous post</a>. For example, when using \(K(\Lambda) = \Phi \Lambda \Phi^\top\) where \(\Lambda\) is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, we obtain an equivalence with trace norm regularization [8].</li><li><strong>Different constraints on </strong>η<strong>‘s</strong>: The trace penalty leads to a linear constraint on top of positivity. Other constraints can be used, such as \(\ell_p\)-norms for \(p \geq 1\) <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/kloft11a/kloft11a.pdf">[9]</a>, or constraints that induce specific behaviors on the selection of blocks of variables <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[7, section 3.4]</a>, e.g., block \(\Phi^1\) always has to be selected before block \(\Phi^2\).</li></ul>



<h2>Learning features or kernels?</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In conclusion, we have seen two main ways of estimating data representations directly from data, which seem different: learning an explicit feature representation (often called an “embedding”) \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) or the corresponding kernel \(\varphi_\eta(x)^\top \varphi_\eta(x’)\), where features are only implicit. When using these representations through linear models (which is the standard way), using one or the other makes no difference in predictive performance, but usually it does on <em>algorithms</em> required to learn on these features, which may need one representation or the others.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For stochastic gradient based algorithms, using explicit \(d\)-dimensional representations leads to algorithms whose running-time complexity is proportional to \(nd\), which, when \(d\) is small, can be advantageous over the complexity in \(O(n^2)\) associated with just computing the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix. Therefore, explicit features numerically seem beneficial at first, but, specific techniques can be used (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5936-less-is-more-nystrom-computational-regularization.pdf">Nyström / column sampling</a> or <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines">random features</a>) to obtain a similar running time (again, to be explained in a future post). Thus, once appropriately done, going for features or kernels does not make a huge difference.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The parametrization of the feature vector \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) or the associated kernel makes however a key difference. To obtain a jointly convex representation in \((w,\eta)\), we need a representation in terms of kernels which is linear in \(\eta\), which is a significant modelling limitation: only feature reweighting is possible, which is already useful in presence of many such features. However, when non-linear feature building is required, more complex parametrizations are needed. Empirically, although leading to jointly non-convex problems, they have been used efficiently and successfully in a wide variety of neural networks. Providing theoretical guarantees and guidelines on how to achieve such non-linear feature learning is an active area of research.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>by Nataly Brukhim, Naman Agarwal and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">this paper</a> </em></p>
<p>In a famous 1906 competition at a local fair in Plymouth, England, participants were asked to guess the weight of an ox. Out of a crowd of hundreds, no one came close to the ox’s actual weight, but the average of all guesses was almost correct. How is it that combining the opinions of laymen can somehow arrive at highly reasoned decisions, despite the weak judgment of individual members? This concept of harnessing wisdom from weak rules of thumb to form a highly accurate prediction rule, is the basis of ensemble methods and <b>boosting</b>. Boosting is a theoretically sound methodology that has transformed machine learning across a variety of applications; in classification and regression tasks, online learning, and many more.</p>
<p>In the case of online learning, examples for training a predictor are not available in advance, but are revealed one at a time. Online boosting combines a set of online prediction rules, or <i>weak learners. </i>At every time step, each weak learner outputs a prediction, suffers some loss and is then updated accordingly. The performance of an online learner is measured using the <i>regret</i> criterion, which compares the accumulated loss over time with that of the best fixed decision in hindsight. A <i>Boosting</i> algorithm can choose which examples are fed to each of the weak learners, as well as the losses they incur. Intuitively, the online booster can encourage some weak learners to become really good in predicting certain common cases, while allowing others to focus on edge cases that are harder to predict. Overall, the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/beygelzimer15.pdf">online</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04820">boosting</a> framework can achieve low regret guarantees based on the learners’ individual regret values.</p>
<p>However, online learning can become more challenging when our actions have consequences on the environment. This can be illustrated with the following experiment: imagine learning to balance a long pole on your hand. When you move your hand slightly, the pole tilts. You then move your hand in the opposite direction, and it bounces back and tilts to the other side. One jerk the wrong way might have you struggling for a good few seconds to rebalance. In other words, a <u>sequence of decisions</u> you made earlier determines whether or not the pole is balanced at any given time, rather than the single decision you make at that point.<img alt="" class=" aligncenter" height="129" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.jpeg?w=136&amp;h=129" title="" width="136"/></p>
<p>More generally, consider cases when our environment has a <b>state, </b>and is in some sense “remembering” our past choices. A stateful framework, able to model a wide range of such phenomena, is a <i>dynamical system</i>. A dynamical system can be thought of as a function that determines, given the current state, what the state of the system will be in the next time step. Think of the physical dynamics that determines our pole’s position based on sequential hand movements. Other intuitive examples are the fluctuations of stock prices in the stock market, or the local weather temperatures; these can all be modeled with dynamical systems.</p>
<p>So how can boosting help us make better predictions for a dynamical system? In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">recent work</a> we propose an algorithm, which we refer to as DynaBoost, that achieves this goal. In the paper we provide theoretical regret bounds, as well as an empirical evaluation in a variety of applications, such as online control and time-series prediction.</p>
<p><b>Learning for Online Control</b></p>
<p>Control theory is a field of applied mathematics that deals with the control of various physical processes and engineering systems. The objective is to design an action rule, or <i>controller</i>, for a dynamical system such that steady state values are achieved quickly, and the system maintains stability.</p>
<p>Consider a simple Linear Dynamical System (LDS):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+A+x_t+%2B+B+u_t+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t + w_t"/></p>
<p>where <img alt="x_t,u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t%2Cu_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t,u_t"/> are the state and control values at time t, respectively. Assume a known transition dynamics specified by the matrices A and B, and an arbitrary disturbance to the system given by <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>. The goal of the controller is to minimize a convex cost function <img alt="c_t(x_t,u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28x_t%2Cu_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(x_t,u_t)"/>.</p>
<p>A provably optimal controller for the Gaussian noise case (where <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> are normally distributed) and when the cost functions are quadratic, is the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). LQR computes a pre-fixed matrix K such that <img alt="u_t^{LQR} = K x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BLQR%7D+%3D+K+x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t^{LQR} = K x_t"/>. In other words, LQR computes a linear controller – which linearly maps the state into a control at every time step.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/agarwal19c/agarwal19c.pdf">recent advancement</a> in online control considers <i>arbitrary</i> disturbances, as opposed to normally distributed noise. In this more general setting, there is no closed form for the optimal controller. Instead, it is proposed to use a weighted sum of previously observed noises, i.e., <img alt="u_t^{WL} = K x_t + \sum_{i=1}^H M_i w_{t-i} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BWL%7D+%3D+K+x_t+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EH+M_i+w_%7Bt-i%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t^{WL} = K x_t + \sum_{i=1}^H M_i w_{t-i} "/> , where <img alt="M_1,...,M_H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%2C...%2CM_H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="M_1,...,M_H"/> are learned parameters, updated in an online fashion. This method is shown to attain vanishing average regret compared to the best fixed linear controller in hindsight, and is applicable for general convex cost functions as opposed to only quadratics.</p>
<p>Crucially, the state-dependent term <img alt="Kx_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Kx_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="Kx_t"/> is not learned. Since the learned parameters of the above controller therefore considers only a fixed number of recent disturbances, we can apply existing <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">online convex optimization</a> techniques developed for <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6025-online-learning-for-adversaries-with-memory-price-of-past-mistakes">learning with loss functions that have bounded memory</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Boosting for Online Control</strong></p>
<p>Using the insights described above to remove state in online control, we can now use techniques from online boosting. DynaBoost maintains multiple copies of the base-controller above, with each copy corresponding to one stage in boosting. At every time step, the control <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> is obtained from a convex combination of the base-controllers’ outputs <img alt="u_t^{WL(1)},...,u_t^{WL(N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BWL%281%29%7D%2C...%2Cu_t%5E%7BWL%28N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t^{WL(1)},...,u_t^{WL(N)}"/>. To update each base-controller’s parameters, DynaBoost feeds each controller with a <i>residual</i> <i>proxy </i>cost function, and seeks to obtain a minimizing point in the direction of the residual loss function’s gradient. Stability ensures that minimizing regret over the proxy costs (which have finite memory) suffices to minimize overall regret. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">our paper</a> for the detailed description of the algorithm and its regret guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>Sanity check experiment</strong></p>
<p>We first conducted experiments for the standard LQR setting with i.i.d. Gaussian noise and known dynamics. We applied our boosting method to the non-optimal controller with learned parameters (Control-WL), and we observe that boosting improves its loss and achieves near-optimal performance (here the optimal controller is given by the fixed LQR solution). We have tested an LDS of different dimensions <img alt="d = 1,10,100" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%3D+1%2C10%2C100&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="d = 1,10,100"/>, and averaged results over multiple runs.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="182" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null.png?w=624&amp;h=182" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p><strong>Correlated noise experiment</strong></p>
<p>When the disturbances are not independently drawn, the LQR controller is not guaranteed to perform optimally. We experimented with two LDS settings with correlated disturbances in which (a) the disturbances <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> are generated from a Gaussian random-walk, and (b) where they are generated by a sine function applied to the time index. In these cases, boosted controllers perform better compared to the “weak” learned controller, and can also outperform the fixed LQR solution. We have also tested a Recurrent Neural Network, and observed that boosting is effective for RNNs as well.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="266" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-1.png?w=624&amp;h=266" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p><strong>Inverted Pendulum experiment</strong></p>
<p>A more challenging experiment with a non-linear dynamical system is the Inverted Pendulum experiment. This is very similar to the pole balancing example we discussed above, and is a standard benchmark for control methods. The goal is to balance the inverted pendulum by applying torque that will stabilize it in a vertically upright position, in the presence of noise. In our experiments, we used correlated disturbances from a Gaussian random-walk. We follow the dynamics implemented in <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a>, and test the performance of different controllers: LQR, a learned controller, and boosting. The video below visualizes this experiment:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"/>
<p>When averaging the loss value over multiple experiment runs, we get the following plot:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="276" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-2.png?w=369&amp;h=276" title="" width="369"/></p>
<p>It can be seen that the learned controller performs much better than the LQR in the presence of correlated noise, and that boosting can improve its stability and achieve lower average loss.</p>
<p><b>Boosting for Time-Series Prediction</b></p>
<p>Similarly to the control setting, in time-series prediction tasks it is sufficient to use fixed horizons, and online boosting can be efficiently applied here as well. In time-series prediction, the data is often assumed to be generated from an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j w_j + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Ek+%5Calpha_i+x_%7Bt-i%7D+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Eq+%5Cbeta_j+w_j+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j w_j + w_t"/></p>
<p>In words, each data point <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t"/> is given by a weighted sum of previous points, previous noises and a new noise term <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>, where <img alt="\alpha,\beta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%2C%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\alpha,\beta"/> are the coefficients vectors.</p>
<p>To test our boosting method, We experimented with 4 simulated settings: 1) normally distributed noises, 2) coefficients of the dynamical system slowly change over time, 3) a single, abrupt, change of the coefficients, and, 4) correlated noise: Gaussian random walk.</p>
<p>The weak learners tested here are the ARMA-ONS (online newton step) and ARMA-OGD (online gradient descent) algorithms for time-series prediction (See <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Anava13.pdf">this</a> paper for more details). We applied our boosting method, as well as a fast version of it, which applies to quadratic loss functions (we used squared difference in this case).</p>
<p><i><b>1) Gaussian Noise </b></i> <i><b>2) Changing Coefficients</b></i></p>
<p><img alt="" height="217" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-3.png?w=289&amp;h=217" title="" width="289"/><img alt="" height="217" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-4.png?w=289&amp;h=217" title="" width="289"/><img alt="" height="218" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-5.png?w=292&amp;h=218" title="" width="292"/><img alt="" height="217" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-6.png?w=290&amp;h=217" title="" width="290"/></p>
<p><i><b>3) Abrupt Change </b></i> <i><b>4) Correlated Noise</b></i></p>
<p>We can see in the plots above that all weak learners’ loss values (red) can be improved by online boosting methods (blue). A similar observation arises when experimenting with real-world data; we experimented with the Air Quality dataset from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI Machine Learning repository</a>, that contains hourly averaged measurements of air quality properties from an Italian city throughout one year, as measured by chemical sensors. We apply similar weak learners to this task, as well as our boosting algorithms. Here we again obtain better averaged losses for boosted methods (blue) compared to the baselines (red).</p>

Thus, reformulating a non-quadratic optimization problem into a sequence of quadratic problems is a natural idea.</p>



<p class="justify-text">While the standard generic way is Newton method, which is adapted to smooth (at least twice-differentiable) functions, another quite generic way is to use what I have been calling within my lab the “η-trick”. </p>



<p class="justify-text">This can be applied to non-smooth functions, and the simplest version is based on this simple identity: $$ |w| = \min_{ \eta \geq 0 } \frac{1}{2} \frac{w^2}{\eta} + \frac{1}{2} \eta, $$ with the optimal \(\eta\) being equal to \(|w|\) (a simple proof comes from “completing the square”, \(\frac{1}{2} \frac{w^2}{\eta} + \frac{1}{2} \eta = \frac{1}{2} \frac{(|w| – \eta)^2}{\eta} + |w|\), for another proof, simply differentiate with respect to \(\eta\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus obtain a variational formulation of \(|w|\) as the minimum over \(\eta\) of a quadratic function in \(w\), as shown below for four values of \(\eta\).</p>

<p class="justify-text">The most classical application is the Lasso problem (as proposed in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1500-outcomes-of-the-equivalence-of-adaptive-ridge-with-least-absolute-shrinkage.pdf">3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0575">4</a>]): $$\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \frac{1}{2n} \| y – X w \|_2^2 + \lambda \| w\|_1,$$ where \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\) is the design matrix (input variables), \(y \in \mathbb{R}^n\) the vector of responses (output variable), \(\| \cdot \|_2\) the \(\ell_2\)-norm defined through \(\|z\|_2^2 = \sum_{j=1}^d z_j^2\), and \(\|w\|_1 = \sum_{j=1}^d |w_j|\) is the \(\ell_1\)-norm, which is known to be “sparsity-inducing” (that is, it leads to many zero values in the minimizer \(w\) if \(\lambda\) is large enough). </p>



<p class="justify-text">With the variational formulation above applied to each \(w_j\), we get  $$ \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \frac{1}{2n} \| y – X w \|_2^2 + \lambda \| w\|_1 = \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \min_{\eta \in \mathbb{R}_+^d} \frac{1}{2n} \| y – X w \|_2^2 +  \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \frac{w_j^2}{\eta_j} + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \eta_j.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The key aspect of the variational formulation as a <em>minimization </em>problem is that we obtain a joint minimization problem in the variables \((w,\eta)\), for which we can consider alternating optimization (i.e., alternating between minimizing with respect to \(w\) and minimizing with respect to \(\eta\)). The optimum with respect to \(\eta\) is obtained as \(\eta_j = |w_j|\), and the optimization with respect to \(w\) is also simple because of the overall linear/quadratic dependence. The gradient with respect to \(w\) is equal to $$ \frac{1}{n}X^\top ( X w – y ) + \lambda{\rm Diag}(\eta)^{-1} w ,$$ and thus the zero gradient solution can be obtained by solving the linear system \(\big( \frac{1}{n} X^\top X + \lambda {\rm Diag}(\eta)^{-1} \big) w = \frac{1}{n} X^\top y\). This leads to a two-line (in Python or Matlab) algorithm for solving the Lasso problem. For more details on avoiding convergence issues around zero values of \(\eta\) or \(w\), and on solving the linear system efficiently and robustly, see the two monographs <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 5]</a> and <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/resources/pdf/review_sparse_arxiv.pdf">[2, Section 5.4]</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another nice aspect of the variational formulation above is that it is <em>jointly convex</em> in \((w,\eta),\) and hence traditional optimization algorithms are <em>globally</em> convergent.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This formulation as a “min-min” problem should be contrasted with the classical variational formulation of the \(\ell_1\)-norm as a maximum, that is, \(\|w\|_1 = \max_{ \|s\|_\infty \leq 1} w^\top s\), which would lead to a “min-max” problem (which leads also to a suite of interpretations and algorithms, but this is for another post).</p>



<p class="justify-text">There is another classical formulation for the <em>squared</em> \(\ell_1\)-norm through $$ \| w\|_1^2 =\min_{ \eta \in \Delta_d}  \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \frac{w_j^2}{\eta_j},$$ where \(\Delta_d = \{ \eta \in \mathbb{R}_+^d, \ \sum_{j=1}^d \eta_j = 1\}\) is the simplex in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).  Thus the squared \(\ell_1\)-norm is the minimum of squared weighted \(\ell_2\)-norms. This leads to the simple geometric interpretation (below in two dimensions).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-293" height="279" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/L1ball_two.png" width="588"/>The \(\ell_1\)-ball in green can be obtained as the union of properly scaled ellipsoids with principal axes parallel to the coordinate axes (like the two depicted in pink). For any point on the boundary of the \(\ell_1\)-ball, the enclosed ellipsoid can be made to contain the point.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">While the η-trick is most easy for the \(\ell_1\)-norm, it applies to many other situations which I describe below.</p>



<h2>Extension to “subquadratic” norms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given the representation of the \(\ell_1\)-norm as a quadratic function, one may wonder if this can be extended to other norms. In order to preserve the homogeneity of a norm \(\Omega\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), a natural generalization is a representation in the form $$\Omega(w) = \min_{ \eta \in \mathbb{R}_+^d}  \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \frac{w_j^2}{\eta_j} + \frac{1}{2} f(\eta),$$ where \(f\) is convex and \(1\)-homogeneous (then a constrained optimization formulation for \(\Omega(w)^2\) can then also be derived, with the simplex replaced by a level set of \(f\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that a minimum of linear functions is concave, we see that a necessary condition for the existence of such a parameterization is that \(\Omega(w)\) is a concave function of \(w \circ w = (w_1^2,\dots,w_d^2)\). It turns out that this is also a sufficient condition, and that the function \(f\) can be obtained from \(\Omega\) using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_conjugate">Fenchel conjugacy</a>  (see <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 1.4.2]</a>). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Examples include various group norms of the forms \(\Omega(w) = \sum_{G \in \mathcal{G}} \| w_G \|_2\), where \(\mathcal{G}\) is a set of subsets of \(\{1,\dots,d\}\) and \(\| w_G\|_2\) is the \(\ell_2\)-norm of the subvector \(w_G\) obtained from \(w\) by only keeping the components whose indices are in \(G\) (this form of “group penalty” is common in structured sparsity <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 1.3]</a> where one wants to force of lot of zeros in \(w\), but also wants to encourage some specific patterns in the set of non-zero components). Thus, for all of these, one can derive simple estimation algorithms with a sequence of least-squares problems (there is another connection with multiple kernel learning <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 1.5]</a>, see future posts).</p>



<h2>Extensions to all norms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This trick can in fact be extended to all norms, but this requires a non-diagonal Hessian for the quadratic term, where \({\rm Diag}(\eta)\) now becomes a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix \(\Lambda\): $$\Omega(w) = \min_{ \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d} }  \frac{1}{2} w^\top \Lambda^{-1} w + \frac{1}{2} g(\Lambda),$$ see <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 5.2]</a> for more details, where an explicit candidate for the function \(g(\Lambda)\) is given. Here, we impose that \(g(\Lambda)\) is infinite when \(\Lambda\) is not positive semi-definite (to make the quadratic function in \(w\) convex).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, for the \(\ell_\infty\)-ball below, the ellipsoid has axes which are not parallel anymore to the coordinate axes).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-262" height="257" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Linfball-1.png" width="271"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We can also consider the total variation penalty of the form \( \Omega(w) = \sum_{i,j} d_{ij} |w_i – w_j|,\) where the \(d_{ij}\)’s are positive weights. It is commonly used to encourage piecewise constant vectors \(w\). The η-trick can be applied to all terms \(|w_i – w_j|\) <a href="https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/sam_reports/reports_final/reports2014/2014-39.pdf">[7]</a>. This leads to algorithms solving Laplacian systems for which particularly efficient randomized methods are available (see, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02353">[8]</a>).</p>



<h2>Extension to spectral norms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">When dealing with a spectral norm on a matrix \(W \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\), that is a norm that depends only on the singular values of \(W\),  then one has a specific representation. For example, for the nuclear norm \(\| W\|_\ast\), which is equal to the sum of singular values of \(W\) and encourages matrices with low-rank: $$\| W\|_\ast = \min_{ \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}}  \frac{1}{2} {\rm tr} \big( W \Lambda^{-1} W^\top \big) + \frac{1}{2} { \rm tr} \Lambda,$$ with the constraint that \(\Lambda\) is symmetric positive semi-definite. This leads to simple least-squares based algorithms for nuclear norm minimization <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3143-multi-task-feature-learning.pdf">[5]</a>.</p>



<h2>Extensions to non-convex penalties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As mentioned above, a necessary condition for a variational representation of a function \(w \mapsto \varphi(w)\) as a minimum of quadratic functions with diagonal Hessians is the concavity in \(w \circ w\) (the vector composed of squares of the components of \(w\)). Other functions beyond norms or squared norms can be considered, such as the following non-convex penalty: $$\frac{1}{\alpha} \| w\|_\alpha^\alpha = \inf_{\eta \in \mathbb{R}_+^d} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \frac{w_j^2}{\eta_j }  + \frac{1}{2\beta } \| \eta \|_\beta^\beta, $$ where for any \(\gamma &gt;0\), \(\| w\|_\gamma^\gamma = \sum_{j=1}^d |w_j|^\gamma\), \(\alpha \in (0,2)\) and \(\beta = \frac{\alpha}{2-\alpha} &gt;0 \). These penalties are commonly used to enhance the sparsity-inducing effect of the \(\ell_1\)-norm or more generally all sparsity-inducing norms: by being non convex penalties (when \(\alpha \in (0,1)\)), they can be more aggressive in setting components of \(w\) to zero (as can be seen below through the “corners” of the corresponding ball being more “pointy”).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The minimizer \(\eta\) above can be obtained in closed form as \(\eta_j = |w_j |^{2-\alpha}\), and thus the same alternating optimization algorithm can be used. Moreover, the geometric interpretation in terms of enclosing ellipsoids for level sets of \(\| w\|_\alpha\) still holds but this is not anymore a convex set. See below for the unit ball of \(\| \cdot \|_{1/2}\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-277" height="247" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/L1onehalf.png" width="261"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to reweighted least-squares algorithms when using those penalties, again based on alternating minimization with respect to \(w\) and \(\eta\) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0575">4</a>, <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/jenatton10a/jenatton10a.pdf">6</a>]. A key difference with the convex case is that the optimization problem is not jointly convex in \((w,\eta)\) anymore, and it typically only converges to a local optimum. Note here that reweighted-\(\ell_1\) algorithms (that use a sequence of weighted \(\ell_1\)-regularized problems) are also commonly used, see <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/resources/pdf/review_sparse_arxiv.pdf">[2, Section 5.3]</a>.</p>



<h2>Beyond regularization penalties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While I focused primarily on regularizers, can we apply this to the loss as well? Using the same recipe, “concavity in the squared arguments”, we get naturally new representations, which can be used in particular for optimization purposes.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A notable one is for the logistic function \(\varphi(u) = \log(1+e^{-u})\) used within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a>, which can be written as \(\varphi(u) = -\frac{u}{2} + \log( e^{u/2} + e^{-u/2})\), with the function \(u \mapsto \log( e^{u/2} + e^{-u/2})\) being convex in \(u^2\) (which can be shown by computing the second-order derivative). This leads to the representation <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/Variational/JaakkolaJordan2000.pdf">[9]</a> $$ \log( e^{u/2} + e^{-u/2}) = \min_{v \in \mathbb{R}}\ \  \log( e^{v/2} + e^{-v/2}) + \frac{ \tanh \frac{v}{2}}{4v} ( u^2 – v^2 ),$$ which is a quadratic variational representation that could be used to optimize the logistic regression objective function (in particular within surrogate function methods commonly used for online dictionary learning, see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/mairal10a/mairal10a.pdf">[10]</a>) or for variational inference <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/Variational/JaakkolaJordan2000.pdf">[9]</a> (note here that the joint convexity in \(u\) and the inverse of the parameter of the quadratic function is gone).</p>



<p class="justify-text">As shown below, the quadratic upper-bound can be contrasted with (a) the second-order Taylor expansion (thus with matching first <em>two</em> derivatives), which is not an upper-bound (and thus may not lead to global convergence when used for optimization, that is, when Newton method is used), and (b) the upper-bound obtained from the uniform bound \(1/4\) on the second-derivative, which is weaker in particular for large values of \(u\) (and corresponds to using the traditional notion of smoothness of the objective function).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-442" height="236" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/logistic_other-1024x586.png" width="414"/>Variational formulation for the logistic function (in red for a single value of \(v\)), compared to other approximations which are tight at the same \(v\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Now, you can go ahead and use the η-trick within your optimization problems. But it goes beyond and it pops out in other areas in machine learning, in particular for multiple kernel learning, super-Gaussian distributions and convex relaxations of combinatorial penalties. These will be the topics of future posts.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I am a big fan of collaborations, even if they <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2014/07/01/collaboration-competition-and-competition-within-collaboration/">come with their own challenges</a>.

<p>The context in which these thoughts came to my mind is Algorithmic Fairness. In this and other areas on the interface between society and computing, true <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/11/01/simons-cluster-on-algorithmic-fairness/">collaboration is vital</a>. Not surprisingly, attending multidisciplinary programs on Algorithm Fairness, is a major part of my professional activities these days. And I love it – I get to learn so much from people and disciplines that have been thinking about fairness for many decades and centuries. In addition, the Humanities are simply splendid. Multidisciplinary collaborations come with even more challenges than other collaborations: the language, tools and perspectives are different. But for exactly the same reasons they can be even more rewarding. Nevertheless, my fear and the reason for this post is that my less experienced TOC colleagues might come out from those interdisciplinary meetings frustrated and might lose confidence in what TOC can contribute. It feels to me that <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PDF/toc-sp2.pdf">old lessons</a> about the value of TOC need to be learned again. There is a lot to be proud of, and holding to this pride would in fact make us better collaborators not worse.</p>
<p>In the context of Algorithmic Fairness, we should definitely acknowledge (as we often do) that science exists within political structures, that algorithms are not objective and that mathematical definitions cannot replace social norms as expressed by policy makers. But let’s not take these as excuses for inaction and let’s not withdraw to the role of spectators. In this era of algorithms, other disciplines need us just as much as we need them .</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Spring semester is over, yay! To celebrate summer, I’ve compiled lecture notes from the graduate course COS 598D, a.k.a. “<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/optimization4machinelearning/home">optimization for machine learning</a>“.</p>
<p>The course is an aftermath of a few lectures and summer school tutorials given in various locations, in which  lectures goal of the course was to present the most useful methods and ideas in a rigorous-but-not-tedious way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for a mathematically-prepared undergraduate student, and/or researcher beginning their endeavor into machine learning.</li>
<li>Focus on the important: we start with stochastic gradient descent for training deep neural networks.</li>
<li>Bring out the main ideas: i.e. projection-free methods, second-order optimization, the three main acceleration techniques, qualitatively discuss the advantages and applicability of each.</li>
<li>*short* proofs, that everyone can follow and extend in their future research. I prefer being off by a constant/log factor from the best known bound with a more insightful proof.</li>
<li>Not loose track of the goal: generalization/regret, rather than final accuracy. This means we talked about online learning, generalization and precision issues in ML.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most recent version can be downloaded here:<br/>

<p>This is still work in progress, please feel free to send me typos/corrections, as well as other topics you’d like to see (on my todos already: lower bounds, quasi-convexity, and the homotopy method).</p>
<p>Note: zero-order/bandit optimization is an obvious topic that’s not address. The reason is purely subjective – it appears as a chapter in <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">this textbook</a> (that also started as lecture notes!).</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>by <a href="http://www.abbyvansoest.com/">Abby van Soest</a> and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690">this paper</a> </em></p>
<p>When humans interact with the environment, we receive a series of signals that indicate the value of our actions. We know that chocolate tastes good, sunburns feel bad, and certain actions generate praise or disapproval from others. Generally speaking, we learn from these signals and adapt our behavior in order to get more positive “rewards” and fewer negative ones.</p>
<p><i>Reinforcement learning</i> (RL) is a sub-field of machine learning that formally models this setting of learning through interaction in a reactive environment. In RL, we have an <b>agent</b> and an <b>environment</b>. The agent observes its position (or “state”) in the environment and takes actions that transition it to a new state. The environment looks at an agent’s state and hands out rewards based on a hidden set of criteria.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="145" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null.png?w=360&amp;h=145" title="" width="360"/></p>
<p><i>Source: <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf">Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction</a>. Sutton &amp; Barto, 2017.</i></p>
<p>Typically, the goal of RL is for the agent to learn behavior that maximizes<i> </i>the total reward it receives from the environment. This methodology has led to some notable successes: machines have learned how to<a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/"> play Atari games</a>, how to <a href="https://sigmoidal.io/alphago-how-it-uses-reinforcement-learning-to-beat-go-masters/">beat human masters</a> of Go, and how to write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224704/ai-machine-learning-language-models-read-write-openai-gpt2">long-form responses</a> to an essay prompt.</p>
<h2>But what can we learn without an external reward signal?</h2>
<p>It seems like a paradoxical question to ask, given that RL is all about rewards. But even though the reward paradigm is fundamentally flexible in many ways, it is also brittle and limits the agent’s ability to learn about its environment. This is due to several reasons. First, a reward signal directs the agents towards a single specific goal that may not generalize. Second, the reward signal may be sparse and uninformative, as we illustrate below.</p>
<p>Imagine that you want a robot to learn to navigate through the following maze.</p>
<p><b>Case 1: Sparse Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 when it exits the maze, and a reward of 0 everywhere else. The agent doesn’t learn anything until it stumbles upon the exit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Clear reward signals are not always available.</p>
<p><b>Case 2: Misleading Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 at the entrance and a reward of +10 at the exit. The agent incorrectly learns to sit at the entrance because it hasn’t explored its environment sufficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Rewards can <i>prevent</i> discovery of the full environment.</p>
<p>These issues are easy to overcome in the small maze on the left. But what about the maze on the right? As the size of the environment grows, it’ll get harder and harder to find the correct solution — the intractability of the problem scales exponentially.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="238" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/image.png?w=244&amp;h=238" title="" width="244"/><img alt="pasted image 0.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pasted-image-0.png?w=1100"/></p>
<p>So what we find is that there is power<i> </i>in being able to learn effectively in the <b>absence</b> of rewards. This intuition is supported by a body of research that shows learning fails when rewards aren’t dense or are <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa09/readings/NgHaradaRussell-shaping-ICML1999.pdf">poorly shaped</a>; and fixing these problems can require substantial engineering effort.</p>
<p>By enabling agents to discover the environment without the requirement of a reward signal, we create a more<b> flexible and generalizable</b> form of reinforcement learning. This framework can be considered a form of “unsupervised” RL. Rather than relying on explicit and inherently limited signals (or “labels”), we can deal with a broad, unlabelled pool of data. Learning from this pool facilitates a more general extraction of knowledge from the environment.</p>
<h2>Our new approach: Maximum Entropy</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690">recent work</a>, we propose finding a policy that maximizes entropy (which we refer to as a MaxEnt policy), or another related and concave function of the distribution. This objective is reward-independent and favors exploration.</p>
<p>In the video below, a two-dimensional cheetah robot learns to run backwards and forwards, move its legs fast and in all different directions, and even do flips. The cheetah doesn’t have access to any external rewards; it only uses signals from the MaxEnt policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="video-player" id="v-ro0BDWO4-1" style="width: 1100px; height: 620px;">
</div>
<p>Entropy is a function of the distribution over states. A high entropy distribution visits all states with near-equal frequency — it’s a <i>uniform</i> distribution. On the other hand, a low entropy distribution is biased toward visiting some states more frequently than others. (In the maze example, a low entropy distribution would result from the agent sitting at the entrance of the maze forever.)</p>
<p><img alt="slAdX3I4FcseBWeJbioHb_g.png" class=" size-full wp-image-129 aligncenter" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/sladx3i4fcsebwejbiohb_g.png?w=1100"/></p>
<p>So given that policy <img alt="\pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\pi"/> creates a distribution <img alt="d_\pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="d_\pi"/> over states, the problem we are hoping to solve is:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%5E%2A+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmax_%7B%5Cpi%7D+%5Ctext%7Bentropy%7D%28d_%5Cpi%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) "/></p>
<p>When we know all the states, actions, and dynamics of a given environment, finding the policy with maximum entropy is a concave optimization problem. This type of problem can be easily and exactly solved by convex programming.</p>
<p>But we very rarely have all that knowledge available to use. In practice, one of several complications usually arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>The states are <b>non-linearly approximated </b>by a neural network or some other function approximator.</li>
<li>The transition dynamics are unknown.</li>
<li>The state space is intractably large. (As an interesting example, the game of Go has more than<b> one googol or <img alt="10^{100}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B100%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="10^{100}"/></b> possible states. That’s more than the number of atoms in the universe, according to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html">this blog</a> from 2016, and definitely more than can fit on a computer.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In such cases, the problem of finding a max-entropy policy becomes non-convex and computationally hard.</p>
<p>So what to do? If we look at many practical RL problems (Atari, OpenAI Gym), we see that there are many known, efficient solvers that can construct an optimal (or nearly-optimal) policy when they are <i>given a reward signal</i>.</p>
<p>We thus consider an <i>oracle model</i>: let’s assume that we have access to one of these solvers, so that we can pass it an explicit reward vector and receive an optimal policy in return. Can we now maximize entropy in a provably efficient way? In other words, is it possible to reduce this high complexity optimization problem to that of “standard” RL?</p>
<p>Our approach does exactly that! It is based on the Frank-Wolfe method. This is a gradient-based optimization algorithm that is particularly suited for oracle-based optimization. Instead of moving in the direction of the steepest decline of the objective function, the Frank-Wolfe method iteratively moves in the direction of the optimal point in the direction of the gradient. This is depicted below (and deserves a separate post…). The Frank-Wolfe method is a projection-free algorithm, see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GIDnw7T-NT4Do3eC0B5kYJlzwOs6nzIO/view">this exposition</a> about its theoretical properties.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="345" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/unnamed-file.png?w=616&amp;h=345" title="" width="616"/></p>
<p>For the exact specification of the algorithm and its performance guarantee, see<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690"> our paper</a>.</p>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>To complement the theory, we also created some experiments to test the MaxEnt algorithm on simulated robotic locomotion tasks (<a href="https://github.com/abbyvansoest/maxent/tree/refactor">open source code available here</a>). We used test environments from <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py">Mujoco</a> and trained MaxEnt experts for various environments.</p>
<p>These are some results from the Humanoid experiment, where the agent is a human-like bipedal robot. The behavior of the MaxEnt agent (blue) is baselined against a random agent (orange), who explores by sampling randomly from the environment. This random approach is often used in practice for epsilon-greedy RL exploration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="332" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null-1.png?w=442&amp;h=332" title="" width="442"/></p>
<p>In this figure, we see that over the course of 25 epochs, the MaxEnt agent progressively increases the total entropy over the state space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="345" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null-2.png?w=460&amp;h=345" title="" width="460"/></p>
<p>Here, we see a visualization of the Humanoid’s coverage of the $xy$-plane, where the shown plane is of size 40-by-40. After one epoch, there is <b>minimal</b> coverage of the area. But by the 5th, 10th, and 15th epoch, we see that the agent has learned to visit all the different states in the plane, obtaining full and nearly uniform coverage of the grid!</p>

(The last symbol is for emphasis — no, we don’t have an MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>! class — yet.)</p>
<p>What is amazing about this result is the formidable gap between the complexity of the verifier and the complexity of the language being verified. We know since the 90s that the use of interaction and randomness can greatly expand the power of polynomial-time verifiers, from NP to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=146609">PSPACE</a> (with a single prover) and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2794945">NEXP</a> (with two provers). As a result of the work of Natarajan and Wright, we now know that yet an additional ingredient, the use of <em>entanglement</em> between the provers, can be leveraged by the verifier — the same verifier as in the previous results, a classical randomized polynomial-time machine — to obtain an exponential increase in its verification power. Randomness and interaction brought us one exponential; entanglement gives us another.</p>
<p>To gain intuition for the result consider first the structure of a classical two-prover one-round interactive proof system for non-deterministic doubly exponential time, with exponential-time verifier. Cutting some corners, such a protocol can be obtained by “scaling up” a standard two-prover protocol for non-deterministic singly exponential time. In the protocol, the verifier would sample a pair of exponential-length questions <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/>, send <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> to each prover, receive answers <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>, and perform an exponential-time computation that verifies some predicate about <img alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}"/>.</p>
<p>How can entanglement help design an <em>exponentially more efficient</em> protocol? At first it may seem like a polynomial-time verifier has no way to even get started: if it can only communicate polynomial-length messages with the provers, how can it leverage their power? And indeed, if the provers are classical, it can’t: it is known that even with a polynomial number of provers, and polynomially many rounds of interaction, a polynomial-time verifier cannot decide any language beyond NEXP.</p>
<p>But the provers in the NW protocol are not classical. They can share entanglement. How can the verifier exploit this to its advantage? The key property that is needed is know as the <em>rigidity</em> of entanglement. In words, rigidity is the idea that by verifying the presence of certain statistical correlations between the provers’ questions and answers the verifier can determine precisely (up to a local change of basis) the quantum state and measurements that the provers must have been using to generate their answers. The most famous example of rigidity is the <em>CHSH game</em>: as already shown by <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/AIHPA_1988__49_2_215_0/">Werner and Summers</a> in 1982, the CHSH game can only be optimally, or even near-optimally, won by measuring a maximally entangled state using two mutually unbiased bases for each player. No other state or measurements will do, unless they trivially imply an EPR pair and mutually unbiased bases (such as a state that is the tensor product of an EPR pair with an additional entangled state).</p>
<p>Rigidity gives the verifier control over the provers’ use of their entanglement. The simplest use of this is for the verifier to force the provers to share a certain number <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> of EPR pairs and measure them to obtain identical uniformly distributed <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-bit strings. Such a test for <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> EPR pairs can be constructed from <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> CHSH games. In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">paper</a> with Natarajan we give a more efficient test that only requires questions and answers of length that is poly-logarithmic in <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>. Interestingly, the test is built on classical machinery — the low-degree test — that plays a central role in the analysis of some classical multi-prover proof systems for NEXP.</p>
<p>At this point we have made an inch of progress: it is possible for a polynomial-time (in <img alt="{n=\log N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D%5Clog+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n=\log N}"/>) verifier to “command” two quantum provers sharing entanglement to share <img alt="{N=2^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3D2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N=2^n}"/> EPR pairs, and measure them in identical bases to obtain identical uniformly random <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-bit strings. What is this useful for? Not much — yet. But here comes the main insight in NW: suppose we could similarly force the provers to generate, not identical uniformly random strings, but a pair of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-bit strings <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> that is distributed as a pair of questions from the verifier in the aforementioned interactive proof system for NEEXP with exponential-time (in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>) verifier. Then we could use a polynomial-time (in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>) verifier to “command” the provers to generate their exponentially-long questions <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> by themselves. The provers would then compute answers <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(A,B)}"/> as in the NEEXP protocol. Finally, they would prove to the verifier, using a polynomial interaction, that <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(A,B)}"/> is a valid pair of answers to the pair of questions <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> — indeed, the latter verification is an NEXP problem, hence can be verified using a protocol with polynomial-time verifier.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy? Yes. But they did it! Of course there are many issues with the brief summary above — for example, how does the verifier even know the questions <img alt="{X,Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%2CY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X,Y}"/> sampled by the provers? The answer is that it doesn’t need to know the entire question; only that it was sampled correctly, and that the quadruple <img alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}"/> satisfies the verification predicate of the exponential-time verifier. This can be verified using a polynomial-time interactive proof.</p>
<p>Diving in, the most interesting insight in the NW construction is what they call “introspection”. What makes multi-prover proof systems powerful is the ability for the verifier to send correlated questions to the provers, in a way such that each prover has only partial information about the other’s question — informally, the verifier plays a variant of prisonner’s dilemma with the provers. In particular, any interesting distribution <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> will have the property that <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> are not fully correlated. For a concrete example think of the “planes-vs-lines” distribution, where <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> is a uniformly random plane and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> a uniformly random line in <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>. The aforementioned test for <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> EPR pairs can be used to force both provers to sample the same uniformly random plane <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>. But how does the verifier ensure that one of the provers “forgets” parts of the plane, to only remember a uniformly random line <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> that is contained in it? NW’s insight is that the information present in a quantum state — such as the prover’s half-EPR pairs — can be “erased” by commanding the prover to perform a measurement in the <em>wrong</em> basis — a basis that is mutually unbiased with the basis used by the other prover to obtain its share of the query. Building on this idea, NW develop a battery of delicate tests that provide the verifier the ability to control precisely what information gets distributed to each prover. This allows a polynomial-time verifier to perfectly simulate the local environment that the exponential-time verifier would have created for the provers in a protocol for NEEXP, thus simulating the latter protocol with exponentially less resources.</p>
<p>One of the aspects of the NW result I like best is that they showed how the “history state barrier” could be overcome. Previous works attempting to establish strong lower bounds on the class MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>, such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12166">paper</a> by Yuen et al., relies on a compression technique that requires the provers to share a history state of the computation performed by a larger protocol. Unfortunately, history states are very non-robust, and as a result such works only succeeded in developing protocols with vanishing completeness-soundness gap. NW entirely bypass the use of history states, and this allows them to maintain a constant gap.</p>
<p>Seven years ago Tsuyoshi Ito and I showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">MIP<img alt="{}^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7D%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{}^\star"/> contains NEXP</a>. At the time, we thought this may be the end of the story — although it seemed challenging, surely someone would eventually prove a matching upper bound. Natarajan and Wright have defeated this expectation by showing that MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/> contains NEEXP. What next? NEEEXP? The halting problem? I hope to make this the topic of a future post.</p></div>
