    <summary>The determinant polynomial $Det_n(\mathbf{x})$ of degree $n$ is the determinant of a $n \times n$ matrix of formal variables. A polynomial $f$ is equivalent to $Det_n$ over a field $\mathbf{F}$ if there exists a $A \in GL(n^2,\mathbf{F})$ such that $f = Det_n(A \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Determinant equivalence test over $\mathbf{F}$ is the following algorithmic task: Given black-box access to a $f \in \mathbf{F}[\mathbf{x}]$, check if $f$ is equivalent to $Det_n$ over $\mathbf{F}$, and if so then output a transformation matrix $A \in GL(n^2,\mathbf{F})$. In Kayal (2012), a randomized polynomial time determinant equivalence test was given over $\mathbf{C}$. But, to our knowledge, the complexity of the problem over finite fields and over rationals was not well understood. 

In this work, we give a randomized $poly(n,\log |\mathbf{F}|)$ time determinant equivalence test over finite fields $\mathbf{F}$ (under mild restrictions on the characteristic and size of $\mathbf{F}$). Over rationals, we give an efficient randomized reduction from factoring square-free integers to determinant equivalence test for quadratic forms (i.e. the $n=2$ case), assuming GRH. This shows that designing a polynomial-time determinant equivalence test over rationals is a challenging task. Nevertheless, we show that determinant equivalence test over rationals is decidable: For bounded $n$, there is a randomized polynomial-time determinant equivalence test over rationals with access to an oracle for integer factoring. Moreover, for any $n$, there is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that takes input black-box access to a rational polynomial $f$ and if $f$ is equivalent to $Det_n$ over rationals then it returns a $A \in GL(n^2,\mathbf{L})$ such that $f = Det_n(A \cdot \mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{L}$ is an extension field of $\mathbf{Q}$ of degree at most $n$. 

The above algorithms over finite fields and over rationals are obtained by giving a polynomial-time randomized reduction from determinant equivalence test to another problem, namely the full matrix algebra isomorphism problem. We also show a reduction in the converse direction which is efficient if $n$ is bounded. These reductions, which hold over any $\mathbf{F}$ (under mild restrictions on the characteristic and size of $\mathbf{F}$), establish a close connection between the complexity of the two problems. This then lead to our results via applications of known results on the full algebra isomorphism problem over finite fields and over $\mathbf{Q}$.</summary>

    <title>Distribution-Sensitive Bounds on Relative Approximations of Geometric Ranges</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1552867200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Tao:Yufei.html">Yufei Tao</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wang:Yu.html">Yu Wang</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06617">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A family $\mathcal{R}$ of ranges and a set $X$ of points together define a
range space $(X, \mathcal{R}|_X)$, where $\mathcal{R}|_X = \{X \cap h \mid h
\in \mathcal{R}\}$. We want to find a structure to estimate the quantity $|X
\cap h|/|X|$ for any range $h \in \mathcal{R}$ with the $(\rho,
\epsilon)$-guarantee: (i) if $|X \cap h|/|X| &gt; \rho$, the estimate must have a
relative error $\epsilon$; (ii) otherwise, the estimate must have an absolute
error $\rho \epsilon$. The objective is to minimize the size of the structure.
Currently, the dominant solution is to compute a relative $(\rho,
\epsilon)$-approximation, which is a subset of $X$ with
$\tilde{O}(\lambda/(\rho \epsilon^2))$ points, where $\lambda$ is the
VC-dimension of $(X, \mathcal{R}|_X)$, and $\tilde{O}$ hides polylog factors.
</p>
<p>This paper shows a more general bound sensitive to the content of $X$. We
give a structure that stores $O(\log (1/\rho))$ integers plus $\tilde{O}(\theta
\cdot (\lambda/\epsilon^2))$ points of $X$, where $\theta$ - called the
disagreement coefficient - measures how much the ranges differ from each other
in their intersections with $X$. The value of $\theta$ is between 1 and
$1/\rho$, such that our space bound is never worse than that of relative
$(\rho, \epsilon)$-approximations, but we improve the latter's $1/\rho$ term
whenever $\theta = o(\frac{1}{\rho \log (1/\rho)})$. We also prove that, in the
worst case, summaries with the $(\rho, 1/2)$-guarantee must consume
$\Omega(\theta)$ words even for $d = 2$ and $\lambda \le 3$.
</p>
<p>We then constrain $\mathcal{R}$ to be the set of halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$
for a constant $d$, and prove the existence of structures with $o(1/(\rho
\epsilon^2))$ size offering $(\rho,\epsilon)$-guarantees, when $X$ is generated
from various stochastic distributions. This is the first formal justification
on why the term $1/\rho$ is not compulsory for "realistic" inputs.

location problem in the external memory model. Our data structure supports
queries in $O(\log_B n(\log\log_B n)^3))$ I/Os and updates in $O(\log_B
n(\log\log_B n)^2))$ amortized I/Os, where $n$ is the number of segments in the

with almost-optimal query cost. For comparison all previously known results for
this problem require $O(\log_B^2 n)$ I/Os to answer queries. Our result almost
matches the best known upper bound in the internal-memory model.

proportionally as many vertices in the subgraph as in the graph. We prove that
the problem of finding a PDS of maximum size is APX-hard on split graphs, and
NP-hard on bipartite graphs. We also show that deciding if a PDS is
inclusion-wise maximal is co-NP-complete on bipartite graphs. Nevertheless, we
present a simple polynomial-time $(2-\frac{2}{\Delta+1})$-approximation
algorithm for the problem, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph.
Finally, we prove that all Hamiltonian cubic graphs (except two) have a PDS of
the maximum possible size which can be found in linear time if a Hamiltonian

and research domain since its inception. Bloom Filter is able to reduce the
space consumption in an order of magnitude. Thus, Bloom Filter is used to keep
information of a very large scale data. There are numerous variants of Bloom
Filters available, however, scalability is a serious dilemma of Bloom Filter
for years. To solve this dilemma, there are also diverse variants of Bloom
Filter. However, the time complexity and space complexity become the key issue
again. In this paper, we present a novel Bloom Filter to address the
scalability issue without compromising the performance, called scaleBF. scaleBF
deploys many 3D Bloom Filter to filter the set of items. In this paper, we
theoretically compare the contemporary Bloom Filter for scalability and scaleBF
outperforms in terms of time complexity.

    <title>A Faster Algorithm Enumerating Relevant Features over Finite Fields</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1552867200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nanashima:Mikito.html">Mikito Nanashima</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06412">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A $k$-junta function is a function which depends on only $k$ coordinates of
the input. For relatively small $k$ w.r.t. the input size $n$, learning
$k$-junta functions is one of fundamental problems both theoretically and
practically in machine learning. For the last two decades, much effort has been
made to design efficient learning algorithms for Boolean junta functions, and
some novel techniques have been developed. However, in real world,
multi-labeled data seem to be obtained in much more often than binary-labeled
one. Thus, it is a natural question whether these techniques can be applied to
more general cases about the alphabet size.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we expand the Fourier detection techniques for the binary
alphabet to any finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and give, roughly speaking, an
$O(n^{0.8k})$-time learning algorithm for $k$-juntas over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Note
that our algorithm is the first non-trivial (i.e., non-brute force) algorithm
for such a class even in the case where $q=3$ and we give an affirmative answer
to the question posed in [MOS04].
</p>
<p>Our algorithm consists of two reductions: (1) from learning juntas to LDME
which is a variant of the learning with errors (LWE) problems introduced by
[Reg05], and (2) from LDME to the light bulb problem (LBP) introduced by
[Val88]. Since the reduced problem (i.e., LBP) is a kind of binary problem
regardless of the alphabet size of the original problem (i.e., learning
juntas), we can directly apply the techniques for the binary case in the
previous work such as in [Val15, KKK18].

undirected graph $G$, a positive integer $r$, and a set $S$ of vertices,
approximates the conductance of $S$ in the $r$-step random walk on $G$ to
within a factor of $1+\epsilon$, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is an arbitrarily small
constant. More generally, our algorithm computes an $\epsilon$-spectral
approximation to the normalized Laplacian of the $r$-step walk.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm combines the derandomized square graph operation (Rozenman and
Vadhan, 2005), which we recently used for solving Laplacian systems in nearly
logarithmic space (Murtagh, Reingold, Sidford, and Vadhan, 2017), with ideas
from (Cheng, Cheng, Liu, Peng, and Teng, 2015), which gave an algorithm that is
time-efficient (while ours is space-efficient) and randomized (while ours is
deterministic) for the case of even $r$ (while ours works for all $r$). Along
the way, we provide some new results that generalize technical machinery and
yield improvements over previous work. First, we obtain a nearly linear-time
randomized algorithm for computing a spectral approximation to the normalized
Laplacian for odd $r$. Second, we define and analyze a generalization of the
derandomized square for irregular graphs and for sparsifying the product of two
distinct graphs. As part of this generalization, we also give a strongly
explicit construction of expander graphs of every size.

from a given matrix $B\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ with $m&gt;n$ such that the
pseudoinverse of the sampled matrix has as small Frobenius or spectral norm as
possible. In this paper, we consider the more general problem of subset
selection for matrices that allows a block is fixed at the beginning. Under
this setting, we provide a deterministic method for selecting a column
sub-matrix from $B$. We also present a bound for both the Frobenius and the
spectral matrix norms of the pseudoinverse of the sampled matrix with showing
that the bound is asymptotically optimal. The main technology for proving this
result is the interlacing families of polynomials which is developed by Marcus,
Spielman and Srivastava. This idea also results in a deterministic greedy
selection algorithm that produces the sub-matrix promised by our result.

and every palindromic substring containing $[s, t]$ which is shorter than
$S[i..j]$ occurs at least twice in $S$. In this paper, we study the problem of
answering $\mathit{SUPS}$ queries on run-length encoded strings. We show how to
preprocess a given run-length encoded string $RLE_{S}$ of size $m$ in $O(m)$
space and $O(m (\log \sigma_{RLE_{S}} + \sqrt{\log m / \log\log m}))$ time so
that all $\mathit{SUPSs}$ for any subsequent query interval can be answered in
$O(\sqrt{\log m / \log\log m} + \alpha)$ time, where $\alpha$ is the number of
outputs, and $\sigma_{RLE_{S}}$ is the number of distinct runs of $RLE_{S}$.

    <title>Mixture Modeling of Global Shape Priors and Autoencoding Local Intensity Priors for Left Atrium Segmentation</title>

addressed by incorporating shape priors to find solutions that are consistent
with known objects. Nonetheless, a single multivariate Gaussian is not an
adequate model in cases with significant nonlinear shape variation or where the
prior distribution is multimodal. Nonparametric density estimation is more
general, but has a ravenous appetite for training samples and poses serious
challenges in optimization, especially in high dimensional spaces. Here, we
propose a maximum-a-posteriori formulation that relies on a generative image
model by incorporating both local intensity and global shape priors. We use
deep autoencoders to capture the complex intensity distribution while avoiding
the careful selection of hand-crafted features. We formulate the shape prior as
a mixture of Gaussians and learn the corresponding parameters in a
high-dimensional shape space rather than pre-projecting onto a low-dimensional
subspace. In segmentation, we treat the identity of the mixture component as a
latent variable and marginalize it within a generalized
expectation-maximization framework. We present a conditional maximization-based
scheme that alternates between a closed-form solution for component-specific
shape parameters that provides a global update-based optimization strategy, and
an intensity-based energy minimization that translates the global notion of a
nonlinear shape prior into a set of local penalties. We demonstrate our
approach on the left atrial segmentation from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, which is
useful in quantifying the atrial geometry in patients with atrial fibrillation.

    <title>Third Poll on P vs NP and related Questions is out now! And the winner is Harambe!</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
I took a poll of the theory community (and others) about P vs NP and related issues in 2002, 2012, and 2019 (sorry its not an arithmetic  sequence --- read the third poll article to see why).  The 2002 and 2012 polls are on the web (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper1.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper2.pdf">here</a> ), and now the third poll is out and its <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper3.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3319627.3319636">here</a> . All three appear in Lane's Complexity Column in SIGACT News.<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper1.pdf"/><br/>
<br/>
I'll give some highlights and thought about the third poll, but for more read the article. Or read all three and see how opinions have changed over time.<br/>
<br/>
0) How many respondents: 100 the first time, and 152 the second time, 124 the third time.<br/>
<br/>
1) P≠NP is at about 80%. When restricted to people who have thought about the problem a lot (my judgement) then it goes to 99%. The strongest P≠NP is by Lance who says<br/>
<br/>
                                People who think P=NP are like people who believe Elvis is alive.<br/>
<br/>
I disagree. I think Elvis is alive and is trying to prove P=NP.<br/>
<br/>
2) When will it be solved? 66% thought it would be solved before 2100, a bit more than in prior years. But also more thought it would never be solved. Some commented that a computer might solve it.  I doubt that, but I do think this poll will be done by a computer in 10 years.<br/>
<br/>
3) Because I used Survey monkey (1) each question got more answers, and (2) most  questions got a forced YES or NO  so less funny comments or room for creative answers. People could still leave comments, and some did.<br/>
<br/>
4) Related to point (3): The last time I did the poll P=BPP was thought by everyone <i>who answered</i> <i>the question</i>. This year far more people answered it and quite a few thought P≠BPP. This may be because Survey monkey had a psychological affect of making people vote even if they didn't really know (people who have thought a lot about P vs NP  all thought P=BPP). Has  there been evidence that P≠BPP that I am unaware of? Or since there has not been that much progress on it maybe they are unequal.  10  years ago I would have thought we would have L=RL by now.<br/>
<br/>
5) The last time I did the poll 10 people thought factoring IS in P and the NSA or the KGB knows that. This time around nobody thought that. Why? Those 10 people have vanished mysteriously.<br/>
<br/>
6) Five people thought P vs NP will be resolved by Harambe. That is more than any person got.<br/>
<br/>
7)  Is this poll worth doing? I would say yes (gee, I have to having done his poll three times) because it is good to have an objective record of subjective opinion. <br/>
<br/>
8) I'll give some of my answers: P≠NP, Elvis is dead, and both will be proven in the year 2525. For more about the future see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yesyhQkYrQM">this</a>.<br/>

    <title>TR19-041 |  Quantum hardness of learning shallow classical circuits | 

	Srinivasan Arunachalam, 

	Alex Bredariol Grilo, 

	Aarthi Sundaram</title>
    <summary>In this paper we study the quantum learnability of constant-depth classical circuits under the uniform distribution and in the distribution-independent framework of PAC learning.  In order to attain our results, we  establish connections between quantum learning and quantum-secure  cryptosystems. We then achieve the following results. 

1) Hardness of learning $AC^0$ and $TC^0$ under the uniform distribution. Our first result concerns the concept class $TC^0$ (resp. $AC^0$), the class of constant depth and polynomial-sized circuits with unbounded fan-in majority gates (resp. AND, OR, NOT gates). We show that if there exists no quantum polynomial time (resp. sub-exponential time) algorithm to solve the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, then there exists no polynomial time quantum learning algorithm for $TC^0$ (resp. $AC^0$) under the uniform distribution (even with access to quantum membership queries). The main technique in this result uses explicit pseudo-random generators that are believed to be quantum-secure to construct concept classes that are hard to learn quantumly under the uniform distribution. 


2) Hardness of learning $TC^0_2$ in the PAC setting. Our second result shows that if there exists no quantum polynomial time algorithm for the LWE problem, then there exists no polynomial time quantum PAC learning algorithm for the class $TC^0_2$, i.e., depth-$2$ $TC^0$ circuits. The main technique in this result is to establish a connection between the quantum security of public-key cryptosystems and the learnability of a concept class that consists of decryption functions of the cryptosystem. 


This gives a strong conditional negative answer to one of the "Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory" raised by Aaronson, who asked if $AC^0$ and $TC^0$ can be PAC-learned in quantum polynomial time.</summary>

<p>
Today, the day before St. Patrick’s Day, we ponder universal riddles of existence. Ken, who will visit me this coming week, insisted on reporting what happened this morning.</p>
<p>
I woke up early, walked alone into our living room, and was amazed to see Neil already here. He was looking out the window at dawn sunlight flooding over St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the many other landmarks we can see from our apartment in midtown Manhattan. </p>
<p>
Spring has at last given an earnest of coming. The scene was transfixing, exhilirating, all the glory of nature except for the green-clad little man puffing his pipe with his back to me.</p>
<p>
“Neil—?”</p>
<p>
He turned and tipped his hat to me but then turned back to the window. I wondered if I had caught him in meditation. I stood back until he turned a second time. He had always visited me late on the evening before St. Patrick’s Day, or the morning of it.</p>
<p>
“You’re here early.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Aye. Top o’ the morning to ye.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Why?”</p>
<p>
He gave me a long stare but warmly, not hostile. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“By the living daylights in ye…”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Then I understood. The Romans have their Ides, the Irish have the 17th, but I got the day in between—when last year I was not here but in an operating room for long hours.</p>
<p>
“Thanks” was all I could say. I had actually come out to look up a mathematical idea for a “part 2” post I’ve been struggling with ever since posting the “part 1” years ago. This pulled me back to math, then to how Neil has always tricked me and I’ve never been able to pin him down. I realized this might be my best opportunity.</p>
<p>
“Neil, may I ask you a Big Question? Not directly personal.”</p>
<p>
He simply said, “Aye.” No tricks yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Question </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I had my chance—something I’ve wanted to ask him for years but not had an opening for.</p>
<p>
“Neil, what can you tell me about <em>female</em> Leprechauns?” </p>
<p>
Neil had mentioned family, cousins, even siblings—I figured they had to come from somewhere. But nothing I’d read mentioned female leprechauns. I braced for silence again, but Neil’s reply was immediate and forthright:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“They comprise the most heralded subset of our people. They are included in everything we do.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“How so?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Our society agreed early on that every female leprechaun should have the highest station. All female leprechauns are sent to the best schools, with personal tutoring reserved in advanced subjects. They are our superpartners in every way.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“How do you treat them?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“If a lady leprechaun applies for a position, she is given full consideration. Whenever a lady leprechaun gives advice, it is harkened to. None of us has ever ‘malesplained’ or demeaned a lady leprechaun in any way.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Are they as short—uh, tall—as you?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Every adult female leprechaun is between one cubit and one-and-a-half in stature, like us menfolk. We don’t have quite the variation of your human species.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“I would surely like to meet one.”</p>
<p>
Neil heaved a sigh. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Ye know the trepidation with us and your womenfolk.” Indeed, I recalled Neil’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/leprechauns-will-find-you/">story</a> of what was evidently his own harrowing encounter with the wife of William Hamilton. “It is symmetrical, I’m afraid. No female leprechaun has ventured into your world.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I had figured that. </p>
<p>
“But can you give me an <em>example</em> of a female leprechaun? Someone who has done something notable.”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Reality </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Neil puffed on his pipe. I knew I had him cornered and moved in.</p>
<p>
“Neil, is everything you just said about female leprechauns <em>true</em>?”</p>
<p>
To my surprise, he answered quickly.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“<em>Aye.</em> As in mathematics, each of my statements was perfectly true.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Oh. Then I realized how empty domains are treated in mathematical logic. I looked at him sharply. </p>
<p>
“Neil, there <a href="https://thefw.com/things-you-didnt-know-about-leprechauns/">are</a> <a href="https://www.circa.com/story/2019/03/15/art-culture/where-are-all-the-female-leprechauns-we-asked-an-expert">no</a> female leprechauns. All of your statements have been vacuous, bull-.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“That’s not right or fair. That which I told ye have been important values of our society from the beginning. Many studies of female leprechauns have established their natures precisely. We have devoted vast resources to the quest for female leprechauns. Readiness—how we would integrate them—this is enshrined in all of our laws. Even your late Senator, <a>Birch</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=O-sOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT275&amp;lpg=PT275&amp;dq=Bayh+Irish+name&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bECfTQqWkJ&amp;sig=ACfU3U2yp53w6HQk_aXp2uT6okbmEG7Y3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtzKG6iIfhAhVuQt8KHdB5DmgQ6AEwDnoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bayh Irish name&amp;f=false">Bayh</a>, was <a href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol48/iss1/4/">informed</a> by us at Notre Dame.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Neil’s sincerity was evident. I still felt bamboozled. He carried on.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Ye have whole brilliant careers studying physical objects that may not exist. The analysis of them is still important in mathematics and other scientific applications. And in mathematics itself—”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I was actually relieved to turn the subject back toward mathematics, as Neil and I usually talked about.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“—your most storied advance of the past quarter century was achieved by ten years’ concerted study of the Frey-Hellegouarch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frey_curve">curve</a>. Which by Fermat’s Last Theorem does not exist.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Existence </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I could not argue with that. This set me pondering. Whether mathematical objects <em>exist</em> in reality defines the debate over Platonism. But what, then, is the reality of <em>nonexistent</em> mathematical objects? </p>
<p>
Nonexistent objects still follow rules and aid deductions about objects that do exist. So, they too exist? Moreover, we often cannot prove that those objects do not exist—for all we know they may be just as real. Polynomial-time algorithms for satisfiability and many other problems—those are bread and butter in theory. I wanted Neil to tell me more about some of them.</p>
<p>
“Neil, have your folk worked on the projective plane of order 10?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“<em>Aye</em>. Not only did we long ago have all the results of this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316573900642">paper</a> on them, our engineers recommended it as the thoroughfare pattern for new towns.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“You have built them?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Indeed—in two new districts around Carlingford back home.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“But they don’t exist.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“By our laws and treaties they exist until your people prove they don’t. Then they have a 50-year sunset. Which <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.39.8684&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">means</a> the towns have 20 years left.<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“That’s sad.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“It’s actually a much better system than the Scots have. Their villages of this type such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadoon">Brigadoon</a> come <a href="https://www.glenlaurel.com/about-us/blog/the-legend-of-brigadoon">back</a> every 100 years just for one day. But Brexit may put paid to our two towns sooner. We are <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/travel/leprechauns-protected-european-law">protected</a> under E.U. law, but those towns are just over the Northern Ireland border.<br/>

<p>
I pondered: what could I ask about computational complexity that Neil could respond to in this kind of zero-knowledge way? But Neil cut in.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“It will be much more fruitful to discuss objects that ye <em>know</em> do not exist—and yet ye <em>use</em> them anyway.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Mathematical Leprechauns </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I thought, which could he mean? I recalled the story we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/01/23/definitions-definitions-do-we-need-them/">told</a> about a student getting his degree for a thesis with many new results on a strong kind of Lipschitz/Hölder function even though an examiner observed that non-constant ones do not exist. Ken heard the same story as an undergraduate, with the detail that it was an undergraduate senior thesis, not PhD. The Dirac delta function? Well, that definitely exists as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function#As_a_measure">measure</a>. I forgot an obvious example until Neil said it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“There is the field with one element: <img alt="{\mathbb{F}_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{F}_1}"/>.”
</font></p></blockquote><font color="green">
<p>
Of course. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/do-we-need-mysticism-in-theory/">posted</a> about it. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“It is an active research subject, especially in the past dozen years. Your Fields medalist Alain Connes has co-written a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.2401v1.pdf">whole</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2926">series</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2024">papers</a> on it. Yuri Manin <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1564">also</a>. Your blog friend Henry Cohn got a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407093">paper</a> on it into the <em>Monthly</em>—think of the youngsters… Edifices are even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0069">being</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00209-009-0638-0.pdf">built</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05831">upon</a> it.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Can you give some less-obvious ones for our readers?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“There is the uniform distribution on the natural numbers. This <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/tr/tr814/tr814.pdf">paper</a> gives variations that do exist, but it makes the need and use of the original concept clear.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken had in fact once finished a lecture on Kolmogorov complexity when short on time by appealing to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“There are fields <i>F</i> whose algebraic closures have degrees 3 and 5 over <i>F</i>. Those are highly useful.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I knew by a <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/galoistheory/artinschreier.pdf">theorem</a> of Emil Artin and Otto Schreier that they cannot exist. But it struck me as natural that they <em>should</em> exist. I wondered how much one would need to tweak the rules of group theory to make them possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“Then there is the free complete lattice on 3 generators.”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Wait—I thought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice#Free_complete_lattices">that</a> could exist if one loosened up set theory. So I asked:</p>
<p>
“Neil, do some of these objects exist in alternative worlds known to leprechauns in which the rules of mathematics are crazy, not like the real world?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“What makes you think ye don’t live in one of those other worlds?”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Before I could react, Neil picked up a solid glass sphere art object that belonged to Kathryn. He pulled out a diamond-encrusted knife and slashed it as green light flashed in every direction until he stopped. Then from his hands he gave me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_paradox">two</a> glass spheres of the same size. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br/>
“For the happy couple—<em>la le Padraig suna ye-uv!</em>”<br/>
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And he was gone.</p>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">The purpose of this post is mostly just to signal-boost Konstantin Kakaes’s article in MIT Technology Review, entitled “No, scientists didn’t just ‘reverse time’ with a quantum computer.” The title pretty much says it all—but if you want more, you should read the piece, which includes the following droll quote from some guy calling himself […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The purpose of this post is mostly just to signal-boost Konstantin Kakaes’s article in MIT <em>Technology Review</em>, entitled <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613123/no-ibm-didnt-just-reverse-time-with-a-quantum-computer/">“No, scientists didn’t just ‘reverse time’ with a quantum computer.”</a>  The title pretty much says it all—but if you want more, you should read the piece, which includes the following droll quote from some guy calling himself “Director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you’re simulating a time-reversible process on your computer, then you can ‘reverse the direction of time’ by simply reversing the direction of your simulation. From a quick look at the paper, I confess that I didn’t understand how this becomes more profound if the simulation is being done on IBM’s quantum computer.</p></blockquote>



<p>Incredibly, the time-reversal claim has now gotten uncritical attention in <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>Discover</em>, <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, my Facebook feed, and elsewhere—hence this blog post, which has basically no content except “the claim to have ‘reversed time,’ by running a simulation backwards, is exactly as true and as earth-shattering as a layperson might think it is.”</p>



<p>If there’s anything interesting here, I suppose it’s just that “scientists use a quantum computer to reverse time” is one of the purest examples I’ve ever seen of a scientific claim that basically amounts to a mind-virus or meme optimized for sharing on social media—discarding all nontrivial “science payload” as irrelevant to its propagation. </p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My 1983 Ph D thesis was on Helly-type theorems which is an exciting part of discrete geometry and, in the last two decades, I have had an ongoing research project with Roy Meshulam on topological Helly-type theorems.

<p>In this post I would like to report on two recent related breakthroughs, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01068">one by Andreas Holmsen and Dong-Gyu Lee</a>, and the other <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00245">by Andreas Holmsen</a>.

<h3>Helly theorem, colorful Helly, and the Fractional Helly Theorem.</h3>
<p>You can find the statements of Helly theorem, Radon theorem, and the colorful Caratheodory theorem in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/sarkarias-proof-of-tverbergs-theorem-1/">this post</a>.  The colorful Helly theorem was first observed by Lovasz. The fractional Helly theorem was first proved by Katchalski and Liu.</p>
<p><strong>The colorful Helly theorem:</strong> Let <img alt="{\cal K}_1, {\cal K}_2, \dots, {\cal K}_{d+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_1%2C+%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_%7Bd%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="{\cal K}_1, {\cal K}_2, \dots, {\cal K}_{d+1}"/> be <img alt="d+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d+1"/> nonempty families of convex sets in <img alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb R^d"/>. If for every choice of a <em>transversal</em> – one set from every family – there is a point in common to all the chosen sets then for one of the families, there is a point in common to all sets in the family.</p>
<p>[Sorry, I got it wrong first, thanks to Shakhar Smorodinsky for alerting me.<del><span style="color: #555555;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">]</span></span></del></p>
<p><strong>The fractional Helly theorem:</strong> For every <img alt="\alpha &gt;0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\alpha &gt;0"/> there is <img alt="\beta &gt;0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\beta &gt;0"/> such that if <img alt="K_1,K_2,\dots, K_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_1%2CK_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+K_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="K_1,K_2,\dots, K_n"/> are <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> convex sets in <img alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb R^d"/> and at least <img alt="\alpha" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\alpha"/> fraction of <img alt="(d+1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28d%2B1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(d+1)"/>-tuples of the sets have a point in common then a fraction of at least <img alt="\beta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\beta"/> of the sets have a point in common.</p>
<p>I should mention that these theorems do not follow combinatorially from Helly’s theorem itself. They manifest deep properties of hypergraphs coming from geometry, and it is an important question to give general abstract properties, combinatorial or topological leading to such properties.</p>
<p>The result of Holmsen and Lee asserts roughly that the fractional Helly property follows combinatorially from Radon’s theorem! Holmsen’s result asserts that  the fractional Helly property follows combinatorially from the colorful Helly theorem!</p>
<h2>Andreas Holmsen Dong-Gyu Lee: Fractional Helly from Radon</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01068">Radon numbers and the fractional Helly theorem</a></p>
<p>Authors: Andreas Holmsen Dong-Gyu Lee</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A basic measure of the combinatorial complexity of a convexity space is its Radon number. In this paper we show a fractional Helly theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number, answering a question of Kalai. As a consequence we also get a weak epsilon-net theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number. This answers a question of Bukh and extends a recent result of Moran and Yehudayoff.</p>

<p class="authors"><span class="search-hit">Author:</span> Andreas F. Holmsen</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>A result due to Gyárfás, Hubenko, and Solymosi (answering a question of Erdös) states that if a graph G on n vertices does not contain <img alt="K_{2,2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7B2%2C2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="K_{2,2}"/> as an induced subgraph yet has at least <img alt="c{{n} \choose {2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%7B%7Bn%7D+%5Cchoose+%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c{{n} \choose {2}}"/> edges, then G has a complete subgraph on at least <img alt="c^2/10n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2%2F10n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c^2/10n"/> vertices. In this paper we suggest a “higher-dimensional” analogue of the notion of an induced <img alt="K_{2,2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7B2%2C2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="K_{2,2}"/> which allows us to generalize their result to k-uniform hypergraphs. Our result also has an interesting consequence in discrete geometry. In particular, it implies that the fractional Helly theorem can be derived as a purely combinatorial consequence of the colorful Helly theorem.</p>

Given d+1 sets of points, or colours, <img alt="S_1,\dots ,S_{d+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2C%5Cdots+%2CS_%7Bd%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S_1,\dots ,S_{d+1}"/> in <img alt="\mathbb R ^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R+%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb R ^d"/>, a colourful simplex is a set <img alt="T\subset \cup _{i=1}^{d+1}S_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%5Csubset+%5Ccup+_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bd%2B1%7DS_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="T\subset \cup _{i=1}^{d+1}S_i"/> such that |T∩Si|≤1, for all i∈{1,…,d+1}.

The construction of weak nets when the Radon number is finite is based on Helly’s property and on metric properties of VC classes. The lower bound on the size of weak nets when the Radon number is large relies on the chromatic number of the Kneser graph.

<p>Let <img alt="A=\{a_1,a_2,\dots, a_n\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%3D%5C%7Ba_1%2Ca_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+a_n%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A=\{a_1,a_2,\dots, a_n\}"/> be a set of points in <img alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb R^d"/>.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here's an old trick that we found useful for proving some tight complexity lower bounds. You are given <em>m</em> coins, each of weight either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em>, and a modern scale that can tell you the total weight of any chosen subset of coins. How many weighings do you need to identify which coin is which? Checking each coin individually uses <em>m</em> weighings, but can you do less?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In any weighing, we try some unknown number of weight-<em>a</em> coins between 0 and <em>m</em>, so this results in one of <em>m</em> + 1 possible values, giving us at most log(<em>m</em> + 1) bits of information. In total we need m bits of information to identify each coin, so clearly we will need at least Ω(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) weighings.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It turns out that this many is in fact enough, and this generalizes to various other settings with less restricted weights. This is the basis for two of our recent results: a tight complexity lower bound for Integer Linear Programming with few constraints and for multicoloring (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_coloring#Definitions">b-fold coloring</a>), assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. The trick allows us to use constraints that check the value of some number between 0 and <em>m</em> to indeed extract about log(<em>m</em>) bits of new information from each, in a way that is general enough to check <em>m</em> clauses of a 3-CNF-SAT instance using only <em>O</em>(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) constraints.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Detecting matrices</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One way to rephrase this coin-weighing problem is as follows: the unknown coin weights are described by a (column) vector <em>x</em> in {<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>}<sup><em>m</em></sup>. A subset of coins is described by a characteristic (row) vector <em>v</em> in {0,1}<sup><em>m</em></sup> and the resulting value of the weighing is the dot product <em>v</em> <strong>·</strong> <em>x</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For a number of weighings <em>k</em>, the row vectors form a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with <em>k</em> rows and <em>m</em> columns, while the obtained values are simply the <em>k</em>-element vector <em>M x</em>. The condition that these values are enough to identify each entry of <em>x</em> is formalized as follows:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For all <em>m</em>, there is a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with k=<em>O</em>(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows and <em>m</em> columns<br/>
such that for any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in {<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>}<sup><em>m</em></sup>, x ≠ y implies <em>M x</em> ≠ <em>M y</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is called a <em>detecting matrix</em>. In other words, instead of checking x = y entry by entry, it suffices to compare the k entries of M x and M y. (An equivalent definition is to require that the kernel of <em>M</em> is trivial on {-1,0,1}<sup><em>m</em></sup>, since we could instead compare (<em>x</em> - <em>y</em>)/(<em>a</em> - <em>b</em>) with zero). A generalization for <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in {0, 1, …, <em>d</em> - 1}<sup><em>m</em></sup> was first proved by <a href="https://doi.org/10.4153/CMB-1965-034-2">(Lindström 1965)</a> (in fact he proves the constant hidden behind <em>O</em> is 2 log<sub>2</sub>(<em>d</em>) and cannot be improved, for any <em>d</em>), giving a deterministic, poly-time construction. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.162.2327">(Bshouty 2009)</a> gives a more direct and general construction using Fourier analysis. However, a random matrix can be shown to be detecting with fairly elementary methods.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Integer Linear Programming</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In ILP we are given a matrix <em>A</em> with <em>n</em> columns and <em>m</em> rows, a vector <em>b</em> with <em>m</em> entries, and we ask for a vector <em>x</em> with <em>n</em> non-negative integer entries such that <em>A x</em> = <em>b</em>. So each of the <em>m</em> rows is a linear equality to be satisfied. What is the complexity for small <em>m</em>?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We start with an instance <em>A x</em> = <em>b</em> encoding a suitable 3-CNF-SAT instance of size <em>O</em>(<em>m</em>) in a straightforward way, using only {0,1,2,3} entries in <em>A</em> and <em>b</em>. Instead of checking each row individually, we use detecting matrices to check them in bunches, reducing our problem to an equivalent instance <em>M A x</em> = <em>M b</em>. The matrix <em>M A </em>of the new instance has only O(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows (at the cost of having larger entries in <em>M b</em>). With some tinkering, this simple reduction shows that, assuming ETH, ILP with <em>m</em> constraints cannot be solved in time 2<sup><em>o</em>(<em>m</em> log <em>m</em>)</sup>, even when the matrix has only 0-1 entries and <em>b</em> has poly(<em>m</em>) entries. This matches a recent (surprisingly simple and clever!) 2<sup><em>O</em>(<em>m</em> log <em>m</em>)</sup> algorithm by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3175322">Eisenbrand and Weismantel (SODA 2018)</a>.</p>

<p>One caveat when applying detecting matrices is that we do not know any bound on one side, <em>A x</em>, except that it is a non-negative integer vector. Fortunately, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s004530010033">(Grebinsky &amp; Kucherov 2000)</a> showed that a random 0-1 matrix satisfies the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For all <em>d</em>,<em>m</em>, there is a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with k=<em>O</em>(<em>m</em> <em>log</em> <em>d</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows and <em>m</em> columns<br/>
such that for any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in ℕ<sup><em>m</em></sup> with ‖<em>y</em>‖<sub>1</sub> ≤ <em>d</em> <em>m</em>, x ≠ y implies <em>M x</em> ≠ <em>M y</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here no upper bound on <em>x</em> is needed, because a single row in <em>M</em> full of ones is enough to guarantee that the sum of entries is the same: ‖<em>x</em>‖<sub>1</sub> = ‖<em>y</em>‖<sub>1</sub>. However, it remains an open problem to find a deterministic construction (we work around this by giving a somewhat weaker construction). See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01296.pdf">the full paper (STACS 2019)</a> for details (with Dušan Knop and Michał Pilipczuk). The reduction for <em>multicoloring</em> is quite different and more problem-specific, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03432">the full paper (ESA 2017)</a> for definitions (with Marthe Bonamy, Łukasz Kowalik, Michał Pilipczuk and Arkadiusz Socała).</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Semidefinite programming is a powerful tool in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the random hyperplane rounding method of Goemans and Williamson has been extensively studied for more than two decades, resulting in various extensions to the original technique and beautiful algorithms for a wide range of applications. Despite the fact that this approach yields tight approximation guarantees for some problems, like Max Cut, for many others, like Max Sat, Max DiCut, and constraint satisfaction problems with global constraints, the tight approximation ratio is still unknown. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that very few techniques for rounding semi-definite relaxations are known.</p>
<p>In this work, we present a new general and simple method for rounding semi-definite programs, based on Brownian motion. Our approach is inspired by recent results in algorithmic discrepancy theory. We develop and present tools for analyzing our new rounding algorithms, utilizing mathematical machinery from the theory of Brownian motion, complex analysis, and partial differential equations. Focusing on constraint satisfaction problems, we apply our method to several classical problems, including Max Cut, Max 2-Sat, and Max DiCut, and derive new algorithms that are competitive with the best known results. We further show that our algorithms can be used, together with the Sum of Squares hierarchy, to approximate constraint satisfaction problems subject to multiple global cardinality constraints.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the president of the United States uses "complexity" in a tweet, I can't leave it alone.<br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are....</div>

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1105471621672960000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 12, 2019</a></blockquote>
I got my MIT degree in Applied Mathematics so I don't count, but I know plenty of MIT computer scientists and the one undeniable truth is that I don't want any of them flying my plane.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with the Donald that a complex environment can often lead to confusion, especially in an emergency. HCI matters.<br/>
<br/>
But that's where it stops. Better technology in the plane and on the ground, combined with better procedures have all but eliminated deadly major commercial airplane crashes in the US and quite rare in the world at large. I'll call that more than a "little gain". I remember the "old and simpler" days where we had deadly airline crashes every few months. No thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I've had great discussions with some of the aerospace engineering professors at Georgia Tech. The amount of effort to get the "front-of-the-plane" software right via formal methods and rigorous testings has become harder to engineer than the plane itself. The "back-of-the-plane" software that controls the video screens and WiFi gets less attention. I can live with safety over movies.<br/>
<br/>
When technology makes things much safer, whether it be planes or self-driving cars, the rare accidents become far more noticeable. while we should use these opportunities to learn and make things safer, the rare accidents help us realize just how much more safer technology can make us.<br/></div>

    <title>Planar graphs needing many lines</title>
    <summary>As I said in my previous post my two SoCG papers both involved trying and failing to prove something else, and writing down what I could prove instead. For the one that appears today, “Cubic planar graphs that cannot be drawn on few lines” (arXiv:1903.05256), that something else was Open Problem 16.14 of my book, which can be rephrased as: does there exist a family of planar graphs that cannot be drawn planarly with all vertices on a constant number of convex curves?</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As I said in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/counting-polygon-triangulations.html">my previous post</a> my two SoCG papers both
involved trying and failing to prove something else, and writing down
what I could prove instead. For the one that appears today, “Cubic
planar graphs that cannot be drawn on few lines” (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05256">arXiv:1903.05256</a>),
that something else was Open Problem 16.14 of my book, which can be
rephrased as: does there exist a family of planar graphs that cannot be
drawn planarly with all vertices on a constant number of convex curves?</p>

<p>Instead I expand on something that was already known, the existence of
planar graphs that cannot be drawn with all vertices on a constant
number of lines.</p>

<p>There were two previously known methods for constructing such graphs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_network">planar
3-tree</a>. This
is a planar graph formed by recursively subdividing triangles into three
smaller triangles. If the vertices are drawn on some family of lines,
the line through the subdivision point must miss one of the three
smaller triangles, so by induction you can be forced to use a
non-constant number of lines. But the bound you get is only logarithmic.<sup id="fnref:book"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/13/planar-graphs-needing.html#fn:book">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Planar 3-tree" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/planar-3-tree.svg"/></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a maximal planar graph whose dual graph has no long paths.
In a maximal planar graph, any line through many vertices can be
translated into a path through many dual vertices. So if there is no
long dual path there must be many lines. This gives a polynomial lower
bound on the number of lines, but with a tiny exponent.<sup id="fnref:dual"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/13/planar-graphs-needing.html#fn:dual">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The new paper finds a third method:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a graph that has many disjoint collections of many nested cycles.
Drawing a big set of nested cycles on a small
number of lines necessarily uses up one of the crossing points of the lines.
So if there are more nests than crossing points, one of them will have
to use many lines.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Graph with many disjoint collections of many nested cycles" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/spiderwebs.svg"/></p>

<p>This leads to stronger polynomial bounds, but also (more importantly I
think) wider families of planar graphs that need non-constant numbers of
lines. For instance, it works for series-parallel graphs of maximum
degree three, which are far from being maximal planar. And even though
every tree can be drawn with its vertices on two lines, adding a single
vertex to a tree can produce a graph that requires a non-constant number
of lines.</p>

    <title>Counting polygon triangulations is hard</title>
    <summary>In some sense both of my accepted papers at SoCG are about a situation where I really wanted to prove something else, wasn’t able to, and wrote up what I could prove instead. The one whose preprint appears today, “Counting polygon triangulations is hard” (arXiv:1903.04737), proves that it’s -complete to count the triangulations of a polygon with holes.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In some sense both of my accepted papers at SoCG are about a situation where I really wanted to prove something else, wasn’t able to, and wrote up what I could prove instead. The one whose preprint appears today, “Counting polygon triangulations is hard” (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04737">arXiv:1903.04737</a>), proves that it’s -complete to count the triangulations of a polygon with holes.</p>

<p>It’s easy to prove that it’s -hard to count maximum non-crossing subsets of line segment arrangements: the intersections graphs of line segments include all the planar graphs, so this follows immediately from the -completeness of maximum independent sets in planar graphs. The gadgets in my paper (drawn below) turn a single line segment into a part of a polygon for which many triangulations use diagonals in approximately the same position as the line segment, and there are few other triangulations. By using these gadgets, one could easily construct a polygon in which most of the triangulations correspond to maximum non-crossing subsets, showing that it’s also -hard to count triangulations. But this is unsatisfactory because it’s the wrong kind of completeness. For counting problems, we want -completeness, not just -hardness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Gadgets for proving hardness of polygon triangulation" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/tricount-gadgets.svg"/></p>

<p>The reason the outline above isn’t already a -completeness proof is that we need to control the rest of the triangulation better. It’s not enough for most triangulations to come from maximum non-crossing subsets. We need each maximum non-crossing subset of line segments to contribute exactly the same number of triangulations (or at least a predictable and controlled number) so that we can recover the number of maximum non-crossing subsets from the number of triangulations. The gadgets control the parts of the triangulation near each segment of the non-crossing subsets, but we also need to control the parts of the triangulation that are not near those segments. Achieving this took much of the work in my new paper. There are two main ideas: First, we use special arrangements with the property that, when you close off the gadgets of a maximum non-crossing subset, the remaining parts of the polygon form pieces of predictable shapes for which we can count the triangulations. In these arrangements, there are two colors of segments, red and blue; each blue segment is crossed by two red segments, and each red segment is crossed in the order blue-red-blue. So we need a new counting reduction from graph independent sets that produces arrangements of this type. And second, we decompose the total number of maximum non-crossing subsets into a sum of smaller numbers, of subsets that have a given number of red segments. Subsets with the same number of red segments leads to the same numbers of triangulations, allowing the terms in the sum to be recovered from the number of triangulations.</p>

<p>A secondary goal was to do this all using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_counting_reduction">polynomial-time counting reduction</a> rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction">Turing reductions</a> that are more commonly used for -completeness. One cannot use an even stronger notion of reduction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsimonious_reduction">parsimonious reductions</a>, to reduce  problems that might have zero solutions to a problem like triangulation that always has at least one. But to me, counting reductions are more closely analogous to the many-one reductions used for -completeness. We can use them, so we should use them. So the reductions in the paper are polynomial-time counting reductions, but more work would be needed to prove that the starting graph problem I used (counting independent sets in regular planar graphs) is complete for those reductions.</p>

<p>Surprisingly to me, this appears to be the first published proof of a -completeness result in two-dimensional computational geometry. And although some 2d geometric structures have been proven -hard to construct (and therefore -hard to count) it seems to be the first hardness proof of any kind for counting 2d structures that can be constructed rather than counted in polynomial time. But as I said at the top of this post, it’s not what I really wanted to prove. I was hoping to prove hardness for counting non-crossing structures on point sets, such as simple polygons, triangulations, non-crossing matchings, or pointed pseudotriangulations. The polygon question was suggested to me by Sara Billey when I visited her last April, in connection with a different problem we were working on (and still haven’t published). And counting the triangulations of a point set would fit the theme of my recent book, because this count is a numerical parameter that depends only on the order type of the points and mostly behaves monotonically under point deletion (exception: delete the center point of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx">quincunx</a>). Instead I had to settle for polygon triangulations. But maybe another paper can take this line of research one step farther, to counting problems on points.</p>

    <summary>A graph $G$ has an \emph{$S$-factor} if there exists a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that for all $v \in V: \deg_F(v) \in S$.
The simplest example of such factor is a $1$-factor, which corresponds to a perfect matching in a graph. In this paper we study the computational complexity of finding $S$-factors in regular graphs.
Our techniques combine some classical as well as recent tools from graph theory.</summary>

    <summary>We provide new upper bounds on the complexity of the s-t-connectivity problem in planar graphs, thereby providing additional evidence that this problem is not complete for NL. This also yields a new upper bound on the complexity of computing edit distance. Building on these techniques, we provide new upper bounds on the complexity of several other computational problems on planar graphs. All of these problems are shown to be solvable in logarithmic time on a concurrent-read exclusive-write (CREW) PRAM. The new upper bounds are provided by making use of a known characterization of CREW algorithms in terms of "unambiguous" AC$^1$ circuits. This seems to be the first occasion where this characterization has been used in order to provide new upper bounds on natural problems.</summary>

    <title>Richard Karp: His influence and how to honor him</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When I first saw the definition of NP-Complete I first thought<i> if there are NP-complete problems I suspect they are contrived. </i>When I saw the proof that  SAT is NP-complete I thought <i>okay, so there is one natural problem  NP-complete by a trick of encoding, but I suspect there aren't any more.</i>  I then read Karp's article that had 22 NP-complete problems. I thought <i>okay, there are 22, but I suspect there are no more. </i>No I didn't think that. But the point is that Cook and Karp together birthed modern complexity theory by introduction NP-completeness and showing that there are MANY natural problems that are NP-complete.<br/>
<br/>
How many people has Richard Karp inspired? I don't know but I suspect it's a  cardinal between countable and the reals so it may depend on your model of set theory. Later in this post I will present Samir Khuller's story of how Richard Karp inspired him.<br/>
<br/>
How to honor him?  The Simons inst. is currently welcoming contributions to the Richard M Karp Fund, which honors the scientific contributions of Founding Director Dick Karp. The fund will provide vital support for the mission and activities of the Simons institute. They have a deadline of Pi-Day. You can go <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/support/donate">here</a> to contribute and/or <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/goldwasserkarp.txt">here</a> for a letter from Shafi Goldwasser, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Umesh Vazirani about the fund.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY, Samir's story:<br/>
<br/>
<div>
<b>Mentoring and Influence via a Train Journey...</b></div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Almost to the day, 33 years ago I was running from my dorm room to catch an unreliable bus to the train station as I headed home for a mid-semester break.  On the way,I  stopped by the mailroom, and not knowing where to put the CACM that had just arrived,  stuffed it into the side of my bag and in the process, dropping my   notebook in the process. On the train, when I looked for my  notebook to go over  some material I realized it was missing! All I had was a CACM and a very long train ride. Skimming through the journal, I found Karp’s Turing Award article “Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness“. I  started reading this article, and was riveted! It was one of those life changing moments for me, when my immediate future became clear - I wanted to study Theoretical Computer Science and specifically the complexity of combinatorial problems. Without ever having met Dick Karp, he changed my life forever.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I met Dick long after he influenced me via his Turing Award Lecture and it was a real privilege to have had the opportunity to interview him via a fireside chat at Simons. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DT_UeJwps">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I am delighted about the fund Bill mentions above as the money that goes to it will help inspire others as Karp inspired me.</div>

Bill Gasarch and Clyde Kruskal are colleagues in Computer Science at the University of Maryland. They have just seen the publication of their <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/11261">book</a> <em>Problems With a Point</em>.</p>
<p>
Today Dick and I congratulate them on the book and give a brief overview of it.<br/>
<span id="more-15674"/></p>
<p>
The tandem of Bill and Clyde were <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/theorems-are-forever-a-great-one-from-1492/">featured</a> before on this blog in connection with a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.138.6154">series</a> of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/3apsurvey.pdf">papers</a> with James Glenn on sets of numbers that have no arithmetical progressions of length 3. </p>
<p>
Can a “series” have only two members? We could add a third <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11821069_13">paper</a> to the series, but it is by Glenn and Bill with Richard Beigel rather than Clyde and is on the different topic of multi-party communication complexity. But Clyde gets into the act since it is the topic of Chapter 19 of the book. That chapter analyzes a game form of problems that go back to a 1983 <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/multiparty-vdw.pdf">paper</a> by Dick with Ashok Chandra and Merrick Furst. Does this mean Dick should get some royalties? Note that this last link is to Bill’s website. And ‘vdw’ in this link seems to refer to van der Waerden’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waerden's_theorem">theorem</a>, which is a pillar of both Ramsey theory and number theory, which in turn receive much attention in the book.</p>
<p>
My last paragraph flits through divergent questions but they are representative of things that we working mathematical computing theorists think about every day—and of various kinds of content in the book. Of course, Bill partners on Lance Fortnow’s prominent <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/">blog</a> and so has shared all kinds of these musings. The book, which incorporates numerous posts by Bill but is not a “blog book” <em>per-se</em>, furnishes contexts for them. Let’s look at the book.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Book </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The book has three main parts, titled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stories With a Point. <p/>
</li><li>
Problems With a Point. <p/>
</li><li>
Theorems With a Point.
</li></ul>
<p>
All the chapters except three are prefaced with a section titled “Point”—or “The Point” or “Points”—after one sentence on prior knowledge needed, which often reads, “None.”</p>
<p>
The first part begins with a chapter titled, “When Terms From Math are Used By Civilians,” one of several with social discussion. The second is about how human aspects of sports upset statistical regularities one might expect to see. For example, many more baseball hitters have had season batting averages of .300 than .299 or .301, evidently because .300 is a “goal number” everyone strives to meet. There are numerous things in the book I didn’t know. </p>
<p>
The next chapter largely reproduces this record-long <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/07/disproofing-myth-that-many-early.html">post</a> on the blog but adds much extra commentary. Then there are chapters on what makes a mathematical function worth defining, on how mathematical objects are named, on Bill’s visit to a “Gathering for [Martin] Gardner” <a href="http://www.gathering4gardner.org/">conference</a>, on coloring the plane, two on imagined applications of Ramsey Theory to medieval history, and one on the methodological and social impact of having theorems that represent barriers to ways of trying to prove other theorems. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Chapter Ten </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This last chapter of Part I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/04/lets-prove-something-instead-of-proving.html">draws</a> on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/04/but-seriously-now-folks-what-do-you.html">several</a> of Bill’s <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/03/other-fields-of-math-dont-prove-barrier.html">posts</a>. It goes most to the heart of what we all in computational complexity grapple with daily and benefits from having more context: As we just mused in this blog’s 10-year anniversary <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/18/have-ten-years-brought-us-closer/">post</a>, the major questions in complexity are not only as open as when we started, but as open as when the field started 50-plus years ago. There has barely been any discernible direct progress, and this is not only a concern for entering students but a retardant on everyone—about which we’ve given <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/lets-mention-foundations/">exhortation</a>.</p>
<p>
There are instead <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/barriers-to-pnp-proofs/">barrier</a> theorems saying <em>why</em> the main questions will not be resolvable by the very techniques that were used to build the field. Of three broad categories of barriers, “oracle results” de-fang all the methods typically taught in intro graduate complexity courses. Those methods meter computations at inputs and outputs but not how they “progress” inside toward a solution. Oracle languages supply blasts of external information that either make progress trivially quick or allow conditioning the terms of the complexity-class relation under analysis to information in the oracle that is tailored to obfuscate. Oracles of the former kind usually collapse complexity classes together, such as <img alt="{A =}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A =}"/> any polynomial-space complete language making <img alt="{\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5EA+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5EA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A}"/>, whereas oracles <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> of the latter kind drive them apart (so <img alt="{\mathsf{P}^B \neq \mathsf{NP}^B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5EB+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5EB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}^B \neq \mathsf{NP}^B}"/>) but often for reasons that frustrate as much as enlighten. When contemplating a new complexity class relation it is incumbent to frame a “relativized” version of it and see if some oracles can make it true and others false. Such oracle constructions were initially easy to come by—“fast food” for research—but their ultimate besideness-of-the-point is reflected in this early <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/i-hate-oracle-results/">post</a> by Dick.</p>
<p>
Next after oracles is the “Natural Proofs” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof">barrier</a>, which basically cuts against all the techniques taught in advanced graduate complexity courses unless they can somehow be weirdly narrow or intensely complex in their conceptual framing. The attitude on those is captured by the title of another early <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/whos-afraid-of-natural-proofs/">post</a> by Dick titled, “Who’s Afraid of Natural Proofs?” The third barrier is <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/algstoc.pdf">algebrization</a>, which cuts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Results_about_difficulty_of_proof">against</a> efforts to escape from oracles. </p>
<p>
Amid all this environment of obstruction, what of consequence can we prove? Well, the chapter on this has by far the highest concentration of Bill’s trademark all-capital letters and exclamation points. The initial “Point” section is titled, “Rant.” (The chapter also includes a page on the attempts to prove Euclid’s parallel postulate, which might be called the original “problem with a point.”)</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Part II </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Much of Part II involves the kind of problems that were used or considered for high-school mathematics competitions. By definition those are not research problems but they often point toward frontiers by representing accessible cases of them. The appealing ones blend equal parts research relevance, amusement value, and reward of technical command. Often they require mathematical “street smarts” and a repertoire of useful tricks and proof patterns. Practicing researchers will find this aspect of the book most valuable. The problems are mainly on the number-theory side of recreational mathematics, plus geometric and coloring problems. Egyptian fractions, prime-factor puzzles, sums over digits, summation formulas, and of course Ramsey theory all make their appearance. Here is one problem I mention partly to correct a small content error, where the correction seems to make the problem more interesting. Say that <img alt="{C(n,m)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28n%2Cm%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(n,m)}"/> holds if there are integers <img alt="{n_1,\dots,n_m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cn_m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n_1,\dots,n_m}"/> such that </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  n_1 + \cdots + n_m = n \qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{1}{n_1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n_m} = 1.

"/></p>
<p>A general principle discovered by Joseph Sylvester gives cases such as <img alt="{C(1861,5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%281861%2C5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(1861,5)}"/> being witnessed by </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  1861 = 2 + 3 + 7 + 43 + 1806 \qquad\text{and}\qquad 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{43} + \frac{1}{1806}.

"/></p>
<p>How can it and related ideas be extended to other cases? The particular problem is given <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> to find <img alt="{m_n =}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_n =}"/> the least <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> such that <img alt="{C(n,m)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28n%2Cm%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(n,m)}"/> holds—and to find a witnessing sum. The error is an assertion that <img alt="{m_n \leq n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n+%5Cleq+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_n \leq n}"/> “by writing <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> as a sum of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>‘s,” but then the reciprocals add up to <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> not <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. So is there any bound on <img alt="{m_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_n}"/>? That is rather fun to think about. </p>
<p>
This problem’s chapter is made from a short <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/12/is-this-problem-too-hard-for-hs-math.html">post</a> with an enormous comments section.  There is also a chapter on the boundary between a fair problem and a “trick question” that much extends an April Fool’s post on the blog.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Part III </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Part III continues the nature of the problem content with emphasis on the worths of proofs of theorems. One illustration involving perfect numbers and sums of cubes notes that the proof loses value because it also applies to certain non-perfect numbers. Two things <em>en-passant</em>: First, Lemma 21.1 in this chapter needs qualification that <img alt="{a,b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a,b}"/> are relatively prime and <img alt="{x+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x+1}"/> is prime. Second, this prompts me to note <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/09/">via</a> Gil Kalai the discovery by Tim Browning that the number 33 is a sum of three cubes: </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  33 = 8,\!866,\!128,\!975,\!287,\!528^3 + (-8,\!778,\!405,\!442,\!862,\!239)^3 + (-2,\!736,\!111,\!468,\!807,\!040)^3. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++33+%3D+8%2C%5C%21866%2C%5C%21128%2C%5C%21975%2C%5C%21287%2C%5C%21528%5E3+%2B+%28-8%2C%5C%21778%2C%5C%21405%2C%5C%21442%2C%5C%21862%2C%5C%21239%29%5E3+%2B+%28-2%2C%5C%21736%2C%5C%21111%2C%5C%21468%2C%5C%21807%2C%5C%21040%29%5E3.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  33 = 8,\!866,\!128,\!975,\!287,\!528^3 + (-8,\!778,\!405,\!442,\!862,\!239)^3 + (-2,\!736,\!111,\!468,\!807,\!040)^3. "/></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Gil points to a Quora <a href="https://affinemess.quora.com/HOLY-CRAP-33-IS-THE-SUM-OF-THREE-CUBES">post</a> by Alon Amit. There is only the bare equation on Browning’s <a href="http://pub.ist.ac.at/~tbrownin/">homepage</a>, and nothing about his methods or how much he used computer search is known. The theme of proofs by computer runs through several chapters of Bill and Clyde’s book. It is also <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4133">current</a> on Scott Aaronson’s blog—we would be remiss if we did not mention Scott in this post—and more widely.</p>
<p>
The penultimate chapter covers the beautiful theory of rectangle-free colorings of grids. We mentioned Bill’s involvement with this Ramsey-style problem in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/how-deep-is-your-coloring/">post</a> on what happened to be this blog’s third anniversary. We connected it to Kolmogorov complexity, which together with uncomputability is the subject of the last chapter. This and other chapters I’ve mentioned exemplify how the research ambit connects traditional mathematics with the terms and concerns of computing theory. How to work in this ambit may be the greatest value of the book for students. In all I found the book light, lighthearted, and enlightening.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The big open problem with the book is how it might help gear us up to tackle the big open problems.</p>

    <title>TR19-038 |  Statistical Difference Beyond the Polarizing Regime | 

	Itay Berman, 

	Akshay Degwekar, 

	Ron D. Rothblum, 

	Prashant Nalini Vasudevan</title>
    <summary>The polarization lemma for statistical distance ($\mathrm{SD}$), due to Sahai and Vadhan (JACM, 2003), is an efficient transformation taking as input a pair of circuits $(C_0,C_1)$ and an integer $k$ and outputting a new pair of circuits $(D_0,D_1)$ such that if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1)\geq\alpha$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \geq 1-2^{-k}$ and if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1) \leq \beta$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \leq 2^{-k}$. The polarization lemma is known to hold for any constant values $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$, but extending the lemma to the regime in which $\alpha^2 \leq \beta &lt; \alpha$ has remained elusive. The focus of this work is in studying the latter regime of parameters. Our main results are:

1. Polarization lemmas for different notions of distance, such as Triangular Discrimination ($\mathrm{TD}$) and Jensen-Shannon Divergence ($\mathrm{JS}$), which enable polarization for some problems where the statistical distance satisfies $\alpha^2 &lt; \beta &lt; \alpha$. We also derive a polarization lemma for statistical distance with any inverse-polynomially small gap between $\alpha^2$ and $\beta$ (rather than a constant).

2. The average-case hardness of the statistical difference problem (i.e., determining whether the statistical distance between two given circuits is at least $\alpha$ or at most $\beta$), for any values of $\beta &lt; \alpha$, implies the existence of one-way functions. Such a result was previously only known for $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$.

3. A (direct) constant-round interactive proof for estimating the statistical distance between any two distributions (up to any inverse polynomial error) given circuits that generate them.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Via <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4133">Scott</a>, John Horgan wrote a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">blog post</a> following on his 1993 Scientific American article <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">The Death of Proof</a>. The article talked about computer-generated proofs, experimental mathematics and even mentioned some of our work on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/103418.103428">transparent proofs</a> (basically time-efficient probabilistically checkable proofs). I got (sarcastically I think) accused of killing mathematics after that article but of course we had traditional proofs about probabilistically check proofs. Andrew Wiles got a sidebar titled "A Splendid Anachronism?" for merely solving the most famous open problem in all of mathematics. Somehow traditional mathematical proofs survived the article.<div>

Meanwhile in CACM, Moshe Vardi writes <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/3/234913-lost-in-math/fulltext">Lost in Math?</a> </div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
TCS is surely blessed with mathematical beauty. As a graduate student a long time ago, it was mathematical beauty that attracted me to TCS, and continued to lead my research for many years. I find computational complexity theory (or complexity theory, for short), with its theorems (for example, the time-hierarchy and space-hierarchy theorems) and its open questions (for example, P vs NP), to be hauntingly beautiful. Beauty, yes; but what about truth?</blockquote>
Here here on the beauty of complexity. So what about truth? I cover much of this in my <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/9/38904-the-status-of-the-p-versus-np-problem/fulltext">P v NP survey</a>. In short the P v NP captures the most critical aspects of what is efficiently computable but it is not the endpoint. Nevertheless P v NP captures both truth and beauty and that's why the problem has so captivated and guided me throughout my research career.</div>
