given an $\eta$, is allowed to choose an arbitrary $\eta$-fraction of the
training samples and arbitrarily perturb their protected attributes. The
motivation comes from settings in which protected attributes can be incorrect
due to strategic misreporting, malicious actors, or errors in imputation; and
prior approaches that make stochastic or independence assumptions on errors may
not satisfy their guarantees in this adversarial setting. Our main contribution
is an optimization framework to learn fair classifiers in this adversarial
setting that comes with provable guarantees on accuracy and fairness. Our
framework works with multiple and non-binary protected attributes, is designed
for the large class of linear-fractional fairness metrics, and can also handle
perturbations besides protected attributes. We prove near-tightness of our
framework's guarantees for natural hypothesis classes: no algorithm can have
significantly better accuracy and any algorithm with better fairness must have
lower accuracy. Empirically, we evaluate the classifiers produced by our
framework for statistical rate on real-world and synthetic datasets for a
family of adversaries.

pairwise dissimilarities between $n$ objects, and the goal is to find a {\em
circular order} of the objects in a manner that is consistent with their
dissimilarity. This problem is a generalization of the classical {\em linear
seriation} problem where the goal is to find a {\em linear order}, and for
which optimal ${\cal O}(n^2)$ algorithms are known. Our contributions can be
summarized as follows. First, we introduce {\em circular Robinson matrices} as
the natural class of dissimilarity matrices for the circular seriation problem.
Second, for the case of {\em strict circular Robinson dissimilarity matrices}
we provide an optimal ${\cal O}(n^2)$ algorithm for the circular seriation
problem. Finally, we propose a statistical model to analyze the well-posedness
of the circular seriation problem for large $n$. In particular, we establish
${\cal O}(\log(n)/n)$ rates on the distance between any circular ordering found
by solving the circular seriation problem to the underlying order of the model,
in the Kendall-tau metric.

    <title>Graph Balancing with Orientation Costs</title>

Graph Balancing problem in the presence of orientation costs: given an
undirected multi-graph G = (V,E) equipped with edge weights and orientation
costs on the edges, the goal is to find an orientation of the edges that
minimizes both the maximum weight of edges oriented toward any vertex
(makespan) and total orientation cost. We present a general framework for
minimizing makespan in the presence of costs that allows us to: (1) achieve
bicriteria approximations for the Graph Balancing problem that capture known
previous results (Shmoys-Tardos [Math. Progrm. 93], Ebenlendr-Krc\'al- Sgall
[Algorithmica 14], and Wang-Sitters [Inf. Process. Lett. 16]); and (2) achieve
bicriteria approximations for extensions of the Graph Balancing problem that
admit hyperedges and unrelated weights. Our framework is based on a remarkably
simple rounding of a strengthened linear relaxation. We complement the above by
presenting bicriteria lower bounds with respect to the linear programming
relaxations we use that show that a loss in the total orientation cost is
required if one aims for an approximation better than 2 in the makespan.

    <title>Classical algorithms and quantum limitations for maximum cut on high-girth graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1623542400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Barak:Boaz.html">Boaz Barak</a>, Kunal Marwaha <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05900">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the performance of local quantum algorithms such as the Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for the maximum cut problem, and
their relationship to that of classical algorithms.
</p>
<p>(1) We prove that every (quantum or classical) one-local algorithm achieves
on $D$-regular graphs of girth $&gt; 5$ a maximum cut of at most $1/2 +
C/\sqrt{D}$ for $C=1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.7071$. This is the first such result
showing that one-local algorithms achieve a value bounded away from the true
optimum for random graphs, which is $1/2 + P_*/\sqrt{D} + o(1/\sqrt{D})$ for
$P_* \approx 0.7632$. (2) We show that there is a classical $k$-local algorithm
that achieves a value of $1/2 + C/\sqrt{D} - O(1/\sqrt{k})$ for $D$-regular
graphs of girth $&gt; 2k+1$, where $C = 2/\pi \approx 0.6366$. This is an
algorithmic version of the existential bound of Lyons and is related to the
algorithm of Aizenman, Lebowitz, and Ruelle (ALR) for the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. This bound is better than that achieved by the
one-local and two-local versions of QAOA on high-girth graphs. (3) Through
computational experiments, we give evidence that the ALR algorithm achieves
better performance than constant-locality QAOA for random $D$-regular graphs,
as well as other natural instances, including graphs that do have short cycles.
</p>
<p>Our experimental work suggests that it could be possible to extend beyond our
theoretical constraints. This points at the tantalizing possibility that
$O(1)$-local quantum maximum-cut algorithms might be *pointwise dominated* by
polynomial-time classical algorithms, in the sense that there is a classical
algorithm outputting cuts of equal or better quality *on every possible
instance*. This is in contrast to the evidence that polynomial-time algorithms
cannot simulate the probability distributions induced by local quantum
algorithms.

$\{x_i\}_{i\in N}$ of elements of a compact subset $X$ of $R^d$ whose prefixes
$X_n=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$, for all orders $n$, have good space-filling properties
as measured by the dispersion (covering radius) criterion. Our ultimate aim is
the definition of incremental algorithms that generate sequences $X_n$ with
small optimality gap, i.e., with a small increase in the maximum distance
between points of $X$ and the elements of $X_n$ with respect to the optimal
solution $X_n^\star$. The paper is a first step in this direction, presenting
incremental design algorithms with proven optimality bound for one-parameter
families of criteria based on coverings and spacings that both converge to
dispersion for large values of their parameter. The examples presented show
that the covering-based method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors,
including coffee-house, suggesting that it inherits from its guaranteed 50\%
optimality gap.

studied in the last decade. Recent work has shown that many such problems may
be viewed as special cases of the authorization policy existence problem
(APEP), which returns an authorization policy if one exists and 'No' otherwise.
A solution may not exist because of the restrictions imposed by the base
authorization relation and constraints that form part of the input to APEP.
However, in many practical settings it would be more useful to obtain a 'least
bad' policy than just a 'No', where 'least bad' is characterized by some
numerical value associated with the policy indicating the extent to which the
policy violates the base authorization relation and constraints. Accordingly,
we introduce the Valued APEP, which returns an authorization policy of minimum
weight, where the (non-negative) weight is determined by the constraints
violated by the returned solution (and is 0 if all constraints are satisfied).
We then establish a number of results concerning the parameterized complexity
of Valued APEP. We prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable if the
set of constraints satisfies two restrictions, but is intractable if only one
of these restrictions holds. (Most constraints known to be of practical use
satisfy these restrictions.) We introduce the notion of a user profile for a
weighted constraint, which enables us to prove a powerful result, a corollary
of which improves on known complexity results for APEP. Finally, we consider
Valued APEP when restricted to particular sub-classes of constraints and show
that instances of such problems can be reduced to the Valued WSP, enabling us
to exploit known algorithms to solve these particular instances.

topic in Graph Drawing. Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the
number of bends on the edges. A key ingredient for bend minimization algorithms
is the existence of an orthogonal representation that describes such drawings
combinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges around each vertex
and the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any kind of geometric
information such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths.
</p>
<p>We generalize this idea to ortho-radial representations of ortho-radial
drawings, which are embeddings into an ortho-radial grid, whose gridlines are
concentric circles around the origin and straight-line spokes emanating from
the origin but excluding the origin itself. Unlike the orthogonal case, there
exist ortho-radial representations that do not admit a corresponding drawing,
for example so-called strictly monotone cycles. An ortho-radial drawing is
called valid if it does not contain a strictly monotone cycle. Our first result
is that an ortho-radial representation admits a corresponding drawing if and
only if it is valid. Previously such a characterization was only known for
ortho-radial drawings of paths, cycles, and theta graphs, and in the special
case of rectangular drawings of cubic graphs, where the contour of each face is
required to be a rectangle. Further, we give a quadratic-time algorithm that
tests for an ortho-radial representation whether it is valid, and we show how
to draw a valid ortho-radial representation in the same running time.
</p>
<p>Altogether, this reduces the problem of computing a minimum-bend ortho-radial
drawing to the task of computing a valid ortho-radial representation with the
minimum number of bends, and hence establishes an ortho-radial analogue of the
topology-shape-metrics framework for planar orthogonal drawings by Tamassia.

    <title>An Instance-optimal Algorithm for Bichromatic Rectangular Visibility</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Cardinal:Jean.html">Jean Cardinal</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Dallant:Justin.html">Justin Dallant</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/i/Iacono:John.html">John Iacono</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05638">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Afshani, Barbay and Chan (2017) introduced the notion of instance-optimal
algorithm in the order-oblivious setting. An algorithm A is instance-optimal in
the order-oblivious setting for a certain class of algorithms A* if the
following hold:
</p>
<p>- A takes as input a sequence of objects from some domain;
</p>
<p>- for any instance $\sigma$ and any algorithm A' in A*, the runtime of A on
$\sigma$ is at most a constant factor removed from the runtime of A' on the
worst possible permutation of $\sigma$. If we identify permutations of a
sequence as representing the same instance, this essentially states that A is
optimal on every possible input (and not only in the worst case).
</p>
<p>We design instance-optimal algorithms for the problem of reporting, given a
bichromatic set of points in the plane S, all pairs consisting of points of
different color which span an empty axis-aligned rectangle (or reporting all
points which appear in such a pair). This problem has applications for
training-set reduction in nearest-neighbour classifiers. It is also related to
the problem consisting of finding the decision boundaries of a euclidean
nearest-neighbour classifier, for which Bremner et al. (2005) gave an optimal
output-sensitive algorithm.
</p>
<p>By showing the existence of an instance-optimal algorithm in the
order-oblivious setting for this problem we push the methods of Afshani et al.
closer to their limits by adapting and extending them to a setting which
exhibits highly non-local features. Previous problems for which
instance-optimal algorithms were proven to exist were based solely on local
relationships between points in a set.

algorithm on edge-weighted graphs. We define an algorithmic framework for
hierarchical agglomerative graph clustering that provides the first efficient
$\tilde{O}(m)$ time exact algorithms for classic linkage measures, such as
complete- and WPGMA-linkage, as well as other measures. Furthermore, for
average-linkage, arguably the most popular variant of HAC, we provide an
algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{m})$ time. For this variant, this is
the first exact algorithm that runs in subquadratic time, as long as
$m=n^{2-\epsilon}$ for some constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$. We complement this result
with a simple $\epsilon$-close approximation algorithm for average-linkage in
our framework that runs in $\tilde{O}(m)$ time. As an application of our
algorithms, we consider clustering points in a metric space by first using
$k$-NN to generate a graph from the point set, and then running our algorithms
on the resulting weighted graph. We validate the performance of our algorithms
on publicly available datasets, and show that our approach can speed up
clustering of point datasets by a factor of 20.7--76.5x.

matching. Prior to our work, the best competitive ratio was $0.5086$ due to
Fahrbach, Huang, Tao, and Zadimoghaddam (FOCS 2020). They achieved their
breakthrough result by developing a subroutine called \emph{online correlated
selection} (OCS) which takes as input a sequence of pairs and selects one item
from each pair. Importantly, the selections the OCS makes are negatively
correlated.
</p>
<p>We achieve our result by defining \emph{multiway} OCSes which receive
arbitrarily many elements at each step, rather than just two. In addition to
better competitive ratios, our formulation allows for a simpler reduction from
edge-weighted online bipartite matching to OCSes. While Fahrbach et al. used a
factor-revealing linear program to optimize the competitive ratio, our analysis
directly connects the competitive ratio to the parameters of the multiway OCS.
Finally, we show that the formulation of Farhbach et al. can achieve a
competitive ratio of at most $0.5239$, confirming that multiway OCSes are
strictly more powerful.

graphs that runs in $m^{1+o(1)}$ time, answering an open question of Karger
from the 1990s. To obtain our result, we de-randomize the construction of the
\emph{skeleton} graph in Karger's near-linear time mincut algorithm, which is
its only randomized component. In particular, we partially de-randomize the
well-known Benczur-Karger graph sparsification technique by random sampling,
which we accomplish by the method of pessimistic estimators. Our main technical
component is designing an efficient pessimistic estimator to capture the cuts
of a graph, which involves harnessing the expander decomposition framework
introduced in recent work by Goranci et al. (SODA 2021). As a side-effect, we
obtain a structural representation of all approximate mincuts in a graph, which
may have future applications.

multi-step Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with a leapfrog integrator, when
applied to well-conditioned distributions. Our main result is a nearly-tight
lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(\kappa d)$ on the mixing time of MALA from
an exponentially warm start, matching a line of algorithmic results up to
logarithmic factors and answering an open question of Chewi et. al. We also
show that a polynomial dependence on dimension is necessary for the relaxation
time of HMC under any number of leapfrog steps, and bound the gains achievable
by changing the step count. Our HMC analysis draws upon a novel connection
between leapfrog integration and Chebyshev polynomials, which may be of
independent interest.

movement or interaction, has been used to reveal the urban mobility and
human-land interaction pattern. As an important spatial analysis approach, the
clustering methods of point events have been extended to OD flows to identify
the dominant trends and spatial structures of urban mobility. However, the
existing methods for OD flow cluster-detecting are limited both in specific
spatial scale and the uncertain result due to different parameters setting,
which is difficult for complicated OD flows clustering under spatial
heterogeneity. To address these limitations, in this paper, we proposed a novel
OD flows cluster-detecting method based on the OPTICS algorithm which can
identify OD flow clusters with various aggregation scales. The method can
adaptively determine parameter value from the dataset without prior knowledge
and artificial intervention. Experiments indicated that our method outperformed
three state-of-the-art methods with more accurate and complete of clusters and
less noise. As a case study, our method is applied to identify the potential
routes for public transport service settings by detecting OD flow clusters
within urban travel data.

fair variants of it have recently received significant attention. In this work
we introduce a novel definition of fairness for clustering problems.
Specifically, in our model each point $j$ has a set of other points
$\mathcal{S}_j$ that it perceives as similar to itself, and it feels that it is
fairly treated, if the quality of service it receives in the solution is
$\alpha$-close to that of the points in $\mathcal{S}_j$. We begin our study by
answering questions regarding the structure of the problem, namely for what
values of $\alpha$ the problem is well-defined, and what the behavior of the
Price of Fairness (PoF) for it is. For the well-defined region of $\alpha$, we
provide efficient and easily implementable approximation algorithms for the
$k$-center objective, which in certain cases also enjoy bounded PoF guarantees.
We finally complement our analysis by an extensive suite of experiments that
validates the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

<h1 id="the-chip-firing-antimatroid">The chip-firing antimatroid</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip-firing_game">Chip-firing games</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model">sandpile models</a>, are systems described by a graph, with markers of some kind such as coins on its vertices. The graph may possibly be directed, although in the simplest examples it is undirected, and it may be infinite. Each vertex may have arbitrarily many coins on it. But, if a vertex has at least as many coins as it has outgoing edges, we can “fire” the vertex, moving one coin to each neighbor. This repeats until no more such events are possible. Doing this on an infinite square grid with an initial state that piles many coins on a single vertex leads to pretty fractals; here’s a detail of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sandpile_on_infinite_grid,_3e7_grains.png">the result of starting with 30 million coins</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Detail of abelian sandpile model on square grid with 3x10^7 starting coins, extracted from CC-BY-SA image https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sandpile_on_infinite_grid,_3e7_grains.png by colt_browning" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/sandpile-30M-detail.png" width="80%"/></p>

<p>However, we’ll be looking at this sort of system on one-dimensional infinite graphs, where their behavior is not quite as complicated.</p>

<p>Chip-firing, on any graph and any placement of coins for which it terminates, forms an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroid</a>.<sup id="fnref:bls"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/carrying-chip-firing.html#fn:bls" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:k"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/carrying-chip-firing.html#fn:k" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> A vertex \(v\) can fire for the \(i\)th time, as long as it has already fired \(i-1\) times and a total of \(i\cdot\deg(v)\) coins have reached it. Once these conditions are met, they remain true until \(v\) fires. This idea, that once the item \((v,i)\) becomes available to be added to the sequence of firings it remains available until it is added, is the defining principle of an antimatroid. From it one can prove that, if any firing sequence terminates in a stable configuration, then all sequences terminate, they all fire the same vertices the same numbers of times, and they all end in the same stable configuration.</p>

<h1 id="binary-carrying-as-chip-firing">Binary carrying as chip-firing</h1>

<p>A binary representation of a number \(x\) is just a set of distinct powers of two, summing to \(x\). If you add two binary numbers \(x\) and \(y\), you can combine their sets into a single multiset; carrying can be thought of as a systematic method of getting rid of the duplicate powers of two in this multiset. Whenever you have two equal powers of two in a multiset, whose sum you are trying to represent, you can merge them with the fusion rule</p>

\[2^i+2^i \Rightarrow 2^{i+1}.\]

<p>This can be thought of as a chip-firing game on a graph where there is a vertex for every power of two, an edge to the next larger power of two, and an edge to a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_bucket">bit bucket</a>” vertex with no outgoing edges (which cannot be fired). Each instantiation of the fusion rule fires vertex \(2^i\), moving one coin to \(2^{i+1}\) and one to the bit bucket.</p>

<p>This is exactly what we are doing when we carry a term in binary addition: taking two powers of two from a column of the addition problem and fusing them into a single power of two in the next column. We can also think of this physically, using a one-dimensional array of cells with poker chips or coins on them, with a coin on cell \(i\) representing the number \(2^i\). The fusion rule takes two coins from any cell and replaces them by a single coin in the next cell. In binary addition of pairs of numbers, there are at most three coins per cell (the two that started out there and one carry), but you could use the same fusion rule for addition of more than two numbers, using an array of cells that can each contain a large pile of coins.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Five stacks of coins. Image Money-2180330 1920.jpg on Wikimedia commons, uploaded by Stella Vogt from pixabay free images, described as &quot;probably free&quot; but tagged with a CC-BY-SA license." src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/stacks-of-coins.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" width="80%"/></p>

<p>Carrying the coin analogy further, we might imagine that the coins have values that are powers of two, and that we are making change by replacing pairs of small coins by a single larger coin of equal value.</p>

<p>Conventional binary arithmetic does these fusion steps in a systematic order, from low-order bits of the binary representation (smaller powers of two) to higher-order bits (larger powers of two). It’s that systematic order, together with the observation that each pile has at most three coins, that makes this method suitable for a finite state machine. But actually, you could apply the fusion rule in any order, and it would work equally well. Each step reduces the number of coins by one, so you can never do more steps than your starting number of coins. We can only halt when we reach the binary representation of the sum, which is uniquely determined, so this process is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(abstract_rewriting)">confluent</a>: every sequence of choices leads to the same eventual outcome. In this case, confluence can also be seen from the antimatroid property of chip-firing games.</p>

<p>This observation about reducing the number of powers of two gives an immediate proof of a fact about binary representations that you may not have known: the binary representation of \(x+y\) has at most as many nonzero bits as there are in \(x\) and \(y\) separately.</p>

<h1 id="chip-firing-for-fibonacci-numbers">Chip-firing for Fibonacci numbers</h1>

<p>Now, instead of coins with power-of-two values, let’s suppose that they have Fibonacci numbers as their values, representing any multiset of Fibonacci numbers. We can still combine pairs of Fibonacci numbers by a fusion rule, that now applies when we have two coins in adjacent piles:</p>

\[F_i + F_{i+1} \Rightarrow F_{i+2}.\]

<p>But in order to get the Zeckendorf representation of the sum of the multiset, we also need to deal with pairs of coins that have the same value, because repeated copies of the same Fibonacci number are not allowed in the Zeckendorf representation. We can accomplish this by a “fission” rule, that steps backwards according to the fusion rule in order to take a bigger step forwards:</p>

\[F_i+F_i \Rightarrow F_{i-2}+F_{i-1}+F_i\Rightarrow F_{i-2}+F_{i+1}.\]

<p>This makes sense even when \(F_i\) is \(1\) or \(2\): for \(F_i=1\), the \(F_{i-2}\) term is zero and can be dropped from the sum, and for \(F_i=2\) it equals one, a Fibonacci number. So as special cases of this rule we have \(1+1\Rightarrow 2\) and \(2+2\Rightarrow 1+3\).</p>

<p>Several issues complicate the analysis of this replacement system. First, although fission by itself is a chip-firing rule on an infinite graph with outdegree two, fission and fusion together make a more complicated system that is not an antimatroid, so different orderings of choosing what to do may lead to different numbers of steps. Second, the fission rule changes the piles of coins both to the left and to the right of the pile to which it applies, making it harder to find a consistent ordering in which to apply these rules. And third, fission preserves the number of coins rather than reducing them, making both the eventual termination of the system and the analysis of how many steps it takes less obvious. But assuming it does terminate, it can only terminate at the Zeckendorf representation, which is unique. So termination implies confluence.</p>

<h1 id="fission-without-fusion">Fission without fusion</h1>

<p>First let’s see what happens if we just use the fission rule, forgetting about the fusion rule. Because fission by itself is a chip-firing rule, any initial state has an invariant number of firings and an invariant final state, regardless of the order of operations. For an initial state with \(n\) copies of \(F_i\), the final state gives us an expansion of \(F_i\) into a sum of \(n\) distinct Fibonacci numbers:</p>

\[F_i = F_i\]

\[2\,F_i = F_{i-2}+F_{i+1}\]

\[3\,F_i=F_{i-2}+F_i+F_{i+1}\]

\[4\,F_i=F_{i-4}+F_{i-3}+F_i+F_{i+2}\]

\[\vdots\]

<p>The indexes appearing in these identities can be summarized in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Triangles_of_numbers">triangle of numbers</a>:</p>

\[\begin{array}{ccccccc}
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;\ 1\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;\ 1\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;\ 2\ &amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;\ 2\ &amp;&amp;\\
&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;\ 2\ &amp;\\
-6&amp;&amp;-5&amp;&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;-1&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;\ 3\ \\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
\end{array}\]

<p>The largest number in each row grows only logarithmically with \(n\), because of the way the values of the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially as a function of their index. The fission rule cannot create gaps of three or more empty cells,
so consecutive numbers in a row differ by at most three, implying that the smallest number in each row is greater than \(-3n\). Because of this linear bound on how far fission can move the coins, we get a quadratic bound on the total number of firing events: each firing decreases the total distance of the coins from cell \(-3n\). This total distance starts at \(3n^2\) and remains positive, so there can  be at most \(3n^2\) firings. In computational experiments up to \(n=10000\) the actual number of firings never exceeded \(n^2\) and appeared to be growing as \(n^2\bigl(1-o(1)\bigr)\). This is a big contrast from the behavior of the similar-looking chip-firing rule on a line of cells that replaces pairs of coins by a coin one cell to the left and a coin one cell to the right, which (with \(n\) chips starting in a pile on one cell) produces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_pyramidal_number">square pyramidal number</a> of firings, cubic in \(n\).</p>

<p>For initial coins that are not all in one big pile, it remains impossible for fission to produce new long gaps, and we can decompose the sequence of cells into subsequences of linear length separated by gaps too long to be crossed. The same analysis of total distance of coins from the starts of sequences of cells shows that, regardless of starting state, and even if we also allow fusion rules, we get an \(O(n^2)\) bound on the total number of steps. In particular, this system always terminates.</p>

<h1 id="taking-few-steps">Taking few steps</h1>

<p>Fortunately, we don’t have to take quadratic time to simplify sums of Fibonacci numbers into their Zeckendorf representations using these rules. The problem with the previous analysis was that we were doing too much fission before we did any fusion. Suppose we sidestep that with the following prioritization:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If any fusion step would put a coin into a pile that is currently empty, do it.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, perform a fission step at the pile with the largest possible index.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any fusion steps are possible, there must be at least one (for instance, the one with the largest index) that is prioritized. To analyze these prioritized steps, define \(N\) to be the current number of coins, and \(M\) to be the number of coins that are at or below a pile with two or more coins on it. The key insight is that whenever a step moves a coin to a pile with a larger index, it cannot form a new larger-index multi-coin pile, so both \(M\) and \(N\) are non-decreasing. They can stay the same only for a fission step at a pile of three or more coins, but in that case the next step must be a fusion. \(M\) and \(N\) are both \(\le n\), and their sum decreases at least once for every two steps, so the total number of steps is \(\le 4n\). Thus, this prioritized chip-firing method can reduce any sum of Fibonacci numbers to its Zeckendorf representation in a linear number of steps. It’s also not difficult to implement so that it takes linear time.</p>

<h1 id="zeckendorf-arithmetic">Zeckendorf arithmetic</h1>

<p>Anyway, now that we have a way of simplifying sums of Fibonacci numbers to their Zeckendorf form, let’s use it for arithmetic on Zeckendorf representations, without the need to reduce them to simpler forms.</p>

<p>First, addition. This is very easy: Add the two Zeckendorf representations as multisets (producing piles of coins that might be adjacent, or might have two coins in them) and then simplify. The result is a linear time for adding two Zeckendorf representations, as was already known. But because it isn’t based on finite state machines, it can also handle more than two coins, for instance by adding multiple numbers at once rather than having to reduce the problem to multiple pairwise additions. As with binary arithmetic, the chip-firing method gives a quick proof of a non-obvious fact: the Zeckendorf representation of \(x+y\) has at most as many nonzero terms as there are in \(x\) and \(y\) put together.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to use this technique (or really, any linear-time Zeckendorf addition algorithm) as part of a long multiplication algorithm for Zeckendorf representations. To multiply two numbers \(x\) and \(y\), both given by their Zeckendorf representations, first perform a sequence of additions to compute the representations of the numbers \(F_i\cdot x\), each computed as \((F_{i-1}\cdot x)+(F_{i-2}\cdot x)\) in a single addition from earlier numbers in the sequence. Then pick out the subset of these representations for which \(F_i\) belongs to the Zeckendorf representation of \(y\), and add them together. (Or interleave the computation of \(F_i\cdot x\) and the sum of these representations, to save space.) The total time for \(\ell\)-bit inputs is \(O(\ell^2)\), as it is for the usual long multiplication algorithm. I’m using the different variable \(\ell\), because the time here is a function of all the bits in the input Zeckendorf representation, rather than just the number of nonzero bits.</p>

<p>You can convert a binary number to Zeckendorf with the same idea, computing the sequence of powers of two and then picking out and adding together the subset of these powers used in the binary representation of the input. In the other direction, you can convert a Zeckendorf representation to binary by computing the Fibonacci sequence in binary, picking out the terms from the given Zeckendorf representation, and adding them. Both directions of conversion take time \(O(\ell^2)\). A recent paper by Sergeev shows how to do these conversions much more efficient, only logarithmically slower than binary-number multiplication.<sup id="fnref:s"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/carrying-chip-firing.html#fn:s" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Based on Sergeev’s results it would also be much more efficient (in theory at least, if not necessarily in practice) to multiply Zeckendorf representations by converting to binary, multiplying in binary, and converting back.</p>

<p>As the article I linked at the start hints, the direct algorithms described here are a bit unsatisfactory from the point of view of circuit complexity: the circuit size is ok but the circuit depth is much larger than it would be for binary arithmetic. I’m not convinced that this is a serious deficiency, because we’re not likely to build computers that use this arithmetic at the circuit level. Any algorithms like this are more likely to be used only in specialized situations where Zeckendorf arithmetic is relevant, like the analysis of certain combinatorial games.</p>

<h1>Causality</h1>



<p>We may have heard that <strong>“correlation does not imply causation”</strong>. How can we mathematically represent this statement, and furthermore differentiate the two rigorously?</p>



<p>Roughly speaking, <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are correlated if <img alt="P(B=b|A=a)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28B%3Db%7CA%3Da%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is different for different values of <img alt="a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. To represent causation, we change the second part of the formula: <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> causes <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if <em>intervening</em> to change <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to some value <img alt="a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> changes the probability of <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. That is,</p>



<p><img alt="Pr(B=b|\text{ do }A\leftarrow a)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Pr%28B%3Db%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DA%5Cleftarrow+a%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>depends on <img alt="a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<h2>Example of Causality</h2>



<p>Suppose we have the random variables <img alt="X,W,H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2CW%2CH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (taken over choice of a random person), which represent e<strong>X</strong>ercising, being over<strong>W</strong>eight and having <strong>H</strong>eart disease, respectively. We put forth the following (hypothetical! this is not medical advice!) scenarios for their relationships:</p>



<p><strong>Scenario 1.</strong> <img alt="X\sim Bern(1/2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Csim+Bern%281%2F2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Now <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the overweight indicator, follows the causal relation:</p>



<p><img alt="W \sim \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } X = 1\\ Bern(1/2) &amp; \text{if } X=0\end{cases}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W+%5Csim+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X+%3D+1%5C%5C+Bern%281%2F2%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X%3D0%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>and the heart disease indicator <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> follows the same rule</p>



<p><img alt="H \sim \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } X = 1\\ Bern(1/2) &amp; \text{if } X=0\end{cases}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%5Csim+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X+%3D+1%5C%5C+Bern%281%2F2%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X%3D0%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>So, in this scenario, exercise prevents heart disease and being overweight, while if we don’t exercise, we may be overweight or suffer from heart disease with probability 1/2 independently..</p>



<p><strong>Scenario 2.</strong> <img alt="W\sim Bern(1/4)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%5Csim+Bern%281%2F4%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p><img alt="X\sim \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } W= 1\\ Bern(2/3) &amp; \text{if } W=0 \end{cases}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Csim+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+W%3D+1%5C%5C+Bern%282%2F3%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+W%3D0+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>and <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> still depends on <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the same rule in the previous scenario. So, in this scenario, people are naturally prone to being overweight with probability 1/4, and being overweight makes you less likely to exercise, rather than the causal relation being in the other way around. As before, exercise prevents heart disease, and someone who did not exercise will get heart disease with probability 1/2.</p>



<p>We find that in scenario 1, <img alt="P(W=1|X=0)=1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7CX%3D0%29%3D1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In scenario 2,</p>



<p><img alt="P(W=1|X=0)=\frac{P(W=1)P(X=0|W=1)}{P(X=0)}=\frac{\frac14\cdot 1}{\frac14+\frac34\frac13}=\frac12." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7CX%3D0%29%3D%5Cfrac%7BP%28W%3D1%29P%28X%3D0%7CW%3D1%29%7D%7BP%28X%3D0%29%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cfrac14%5Ccdot+1%7D%7B%5Cfrac14%2B%5Cfrac34%5Cfrac13%7D%3D%5Cfrac12.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>In fact, as this table shows, the probabilities for all combinations of <img alt="X,W,H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2CW%2CH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are identical in the two scenarios!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/HGYQ4eh.png"/></figure>



<p>Now, consider the intervention of setting <img alt="X=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, i.e. stop exercising. That is, we change the generating model for <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be <img alt="X:=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3A%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In scenario 1, <img alt="P(W=1|\text{ do }X=0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DX%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is still <img alt="1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In scenario 2, <img alt="X=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> tells us nothing about <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> now so we get <img alt="P(W=1|\text{ do }X=0)=1/4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DX%3D0%29%3D1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Now that we added in an intervention, the two scenarios are different!</p>



<p>This is an example of why <strong>correlations are not causations</strong>: while the conditional probabilities <img alt="\Pr( W=1 |X=0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr%28+W%3D1+%7CX%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> identical in the two scenarios, the causal probabilities are diffent <img alt="P(W=1|\text{ do }X=0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DX%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/LGEGtvR.png"/></figure>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color" style="color: #a30000;">NOTE:</span></strong> Working out this example,  and understanding <strong>(a)</strong> why the two scenarios induce identical probabilities, and in particular all conditional probabilities are identical and <strong>(b)</strong> why the causal probabilities differ from the conditional probabilities in Scenario 2, is a great way to get intuition for causality and its pitfalls.</p>



<h2>Causal Probabilities and confounders</h2>



<p>Consider Scenario 1, where the causal structure is as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/FJlQyaO.png"/></figure>



<p>Looking at the table above, we see that the unconditional probability <img alt="P(H=1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3D1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> equals <img alt="1/4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Since in this scenario, there is no causal relation between being overweight and suffering from heat disease, the causal probability  <img alt="P(H=1 | \text{ do } W \leftarrow 0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3D1+%7C+%5Ctext%7B+do+%7D+W+%5Cleftarrow+0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>  is also equal to  <img alt="1/4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>However, we can calculate the conditional probability from the table and see that <img alt="P(H=1|W=0)=1/6" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3D1%7CW%3D0%29%3D1%2F6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.<br/>That means that even though in this scenario, there is no causal relation between being overweight and getting heart disease, conditioning on not being overweight reduces the probability of getting heart disease.<br/>Once again we see here a <strong>gap</strong> between the <strong>conditional </strong>and <strong>causal</strong> probabilities.</p>



<p>The reason is for this gap is that there is a <strong>counfounding variable</strong>, namely <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that is a common cause of both <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <img alt="H,W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%2CW&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are <em>confounded</em> if there are values <img alt="h,w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h%2Cw&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that</p>



<p><img alt="P(H=h|\text{ do }W=w)\neq P(H=h|W=e)," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3Dh%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DW%3Dw%29%5Cneq+P%28H%3Dh%7CW%3De%29%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>To fix the effect of a confounder, we condition on <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. It also allows us to find the probability of an intervention. The general <strong>deconfounding formula</strong> is</p>



<p><img alt="P(H=h|\text{ do }W=w)=\sum_x P(H=h|W=w, X=x) P(X=x)\;\;" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3Dh%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DW%3Dw%29%3D%5Csum_x+P%28H%3Dh%7CW%3Dw%2C+X%3Dx%29+P%28X%3Dx%29%5C%3B%5C%3B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>   (★),</p>



<p>where <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> ranges over all the immediate causes of <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>Contrast this with the formula for computing the conditional probability which is</p>



<p><img alt="P(H=h | W=w) = \sum_x P(H=h | W=w, X=x) P(X=x | W=w)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3Dh+%7C+W%3Dw%29+%3D+%5Csum_x+P%28H%3Dh+%7C+W%3Dw%2C+X%3Dx%29+P%28X%3Dx+%7C+W%3Dw%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Using the deconfounding formula (★) requires <strong>(a)</strong> knowing the causal graph, and <strong>(b)</strong> observing the confounders. If we get this wrong and control for the wrong confounders we can get the causal probabilities wrong, as demonstrated by the following example.</p>



<p><br/>One way to describe causality theory is that it aims to clarify the situations under which <strong>correlation does in fact equal causation</strong> (i.e., the <strong>conditional probabilities are equal to the causal probabilities</strong>), and how (by appropriately controlling for confounders) we can get to such a situation.</p>



<p><strong>Example (two diseases)</strong> Consider the diagram below where there are two diseases <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that each occurs independently with probability <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We assume each will send you to the hospital (variable <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) and those are the only reason to arrive at the hospital.</p>



<p>If you control for <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (i.e look at only people who went to the hospital), we find that the probabilities are now correlated: A priori the probability is <img alt="p/(2p-p^2)\approx 1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2F%282p-p%5E2%29%5Capprox+1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and conditioned on <img alt="X=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the probability is <img alt="p^2/p=p &lt;1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5E2%2Fp%3Dp+%3C1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>

<p>This relates to the joke “the probability of having 2 bombs on a plane is very low, so if I bring a bomb then it is very unlikely that there will be another bomb.”</p>



<p>In general, the causal graph can look as one of the following shapes:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ARygORn.png"/></figure>



<p>If <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a fork then controlling for <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can tease out the causal relation. If <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a mediator or collider then controlling for <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can actually make things worse. –&gt;</p>



<p><strong>Backdoor paths:</strong> If <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are two random variables, we say that there is a “backdoor path” from <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if there is direct ancestor <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that is connected in the undirected version of the causal graph in a path not going through <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/n45KXt9.png"/></figure>



<p>We can show the following theorem:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> If there is no backdoor path then <img alt="P(Y=y | \text{ do } X \leftarrow X) = P(Y=y|X=x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28Y%3Dy+%7C+%5Ctext%7B+do+%7D+X+%5Cleftarrow+X%29+%3D+P%28Y%3Dy%7CX%3Dx%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Here is a “proof by picture”:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/UAC2lWE.png"/></figure>



<p>If there isn’t a backdoor path, we sort the graph in topological order, so that all the events that happen before <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are not connected to <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> except through <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. So we can first generate all the variables <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that result in <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then the probability distribution of the events <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> between <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> only depends on the value <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and so similarly <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is generated from some probability distribution that only depends on <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<h2>Experimental Design</h2>



<p>When we design experiments, we often want to estimate <em>causal effects</em>, and to do so we try to make sure we eliminate backdoor paths.<br/>Consider the example of a COVID vaccine trial.<br/>We let <img alt="V=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be the event that a trial participant obtained a vaccine, and <img alt="C=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be the event that the participant was infected with COVID.<br/>We want to figure out <img alt="P(C=1|\text{ do }V=1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28C%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DV%3D1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.<br/>However, there is a “backdoor path”.<br/>You will not get the vaccine if you don’t participate in the trial (which we denote by <img alt="V=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), but particpating in the trial could change your behavior and hence have a causal effect on <img alt="C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>To fix this we can cut the backdoor path using a placebo: it cuts the backward path by removing the confounding variable of participation, since it ensure that (conditioning on <img alt="P=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), <img alt="V" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is now an independent variable from any behavioral changes that might impact <img alt="C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/TfH4Bzn.png"/></figure>



<h2>Conditioning</h2>



<p>In general, how does conditioning on some variable <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> affect correlations? It may introduce correlations in events that occur before <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, but cuts any path that depends on <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Qk5p0s7.png"/></p>



<h2>Average Treatment Effect and Propensity Score</h2>



<p>Suppose we have some treatment variable <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that we don’t get to control (e.g. in a natural experiment). Let <img alt="Y_t = Y| \text{ do } T=t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_t+%3D+Y%7C+%5Ctext%7B+do+%7D+T%3Dt&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> , and we hope to estimate <img alt="E(Y_1)-E(Y_0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28Y_1%29-E%28Y_0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> which is known as the the <strong>treatment effect</strong>.<br/>However, we worry that some underlying variable <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (e.g. healthy lifestyle) can affect both <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>The <em>propensity score</em>, defined as <img alt="e(z)=E(T|Z=z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%28z%29%3DE%28T%7CZ%3Dz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, allows us to calculate <img alt="E(Y|\text{ do T}=1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28Y%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+T%7D%3D1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We claim that as long as <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a valid confounder (for which the formula (★) holds)</p>



<p><img alt="E(Y|\text{ do T}=1)=E(YT/e(Z))." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28Y%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+T%7D%3D1%29%3DE%28YT%2Fe%28Z%29%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>The proof is obtained by expanding out the claim, see below</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/gyKYlZn.png"/></figure>



<p>Intuitively, knowing the probability that different groups of people get treatment allows us to make <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> independent from <img alt="(Y_0,Y_1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28Y_0%2CY_1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and calculate the treatment effect.</p>



<p><strong>Calculating treatment effect using ML.</strong> Suppose that the treatment effect is <img alt="\tau" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="Y=\psi(Z)+\tau T+\text{ noise}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%3D%5Cpsi%28Z%29%2B%5Ctau+T%2B%5Ctext%7B+noise%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Now, if we learn a model <img alt="f(z)\approx E(Y|Z=z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28z%29%5Capprox+E%28Y%7CZ%3Dz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then</p>



<p><img alt="Y-f(z)\approx \tau(T-e(z))." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y-f%28z%29%5Capprox+%5Ctau%28T-e%28z%29%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Since both <img alt="Y-f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y-f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="T-e(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T-e%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are calculable, we only need to do a linear regression.</p>



<h2>Instrumental Variables</h2>



<p>When we cannot observe the counfounding variable, we can still sometimes use <em>instrumental variables</em> to estimate a causal effect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/XHo3Q5e.png"/></figure>



<p>Assume a linear model <img alt="Y=\tau T+f(W)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%3D%5Ctau+T%2Bf%28W%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the stuff we don’t observe. If <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is some variable that satisfies <img alt="Cov(Z,f(W))=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Cov%28Z%2Cf%28W%29%29%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then</p>



<p><img alt="\tau=\frac{Cov(Z,Y)}{Cov(Z,T)}," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%3D%5Cfrac%7BCov%28Z%2CY%29%7D%7BCov%28Z%2CT%29%7D%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>which is the ratio between two observable quantities.</p>



<h1>Fairness</h1>



<p>We focus on fairness in classification problems, rather than fairness in learning generative models or representation (which also have their own issues, see in particular <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">this paper</a> by Bender, Gebru, McMillan-Major, and “Shmitchell”).</p>



<p>In the public image, AI has been perceived to be very successful for some tasks, and some people might hope that it is more “objective” or “impartial” than human decisions which are known to be <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873">fraught with bias</a>). However, there are some works suggesting this might not be the case:</p>



<ul><li>Usage in prediciting recidivism for bail decisions. For example in ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">Angwin, Larson, Mattu, and Kirchner</a> showed that 44.9% of African Americans who didn’t reoffend were labeled higher risk, whereas only 23.5% of white defendants who didn’t reoffend were labeled as such.</li><li>Machine vision can sometimes work better on some segments of population than others. For example, <a href="http://gendershades.org/">Buolamwini and Gebrue</a> showed that some “gender classifiers” achieve 99.7% accuracy on white men but only 65.3% accuracy (not much better than coin toss) on black women.</li><li><a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x">Lum and Isaac</a> gave an example of a “positive feedback loop” in predictive policing in Oakland, CA. While drug use is fairly uniform across the city, the arrests are centered on particular neighborhood (that have more minority residents). In predictive policing, more police would be sent out to the places where arrests occured, hence only exercabating this disparate treatment.</li></ul>



<p>Drug use in Oakland:<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/nrH0dEy.png"/></p>



<p>Drug arrests in Oakland:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/hIvgmEK.png"/></figure>



<p>While algorithms can sometimes also help, the populations they help might not be distributed equally. For example, see this table from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10511482.2002.9521447">Gates, Perry and Zorn</a>. A more accurate underwriting model (that can better predict the default probability) enables a lender to use a more agressive risk cut off and so end up lending to more people.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/xxms8Jk.png"/></figure>



<p>However, this is true within each subpopulation too, so it may be that if the model is less accurate in a certain subpopulation, then a profit-maximizing lender will unfairly offer fewer loans to this subpopulation.</p>



<h2>Formalizing Unfairness</h2>



<p>In the case of employment discrimination in the U.S., we have the following components:</p>



<ul><li>Protected class<ul><li>categories such as race, sex, nationality, citizenship, veteran status, etc.</li></ul></li><li>An unfairness metric, measuring either:<ul><li>disparate treatment</li><li>disparate impact.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Employers are not allowed to discriminate across protected classes when hiring. The unfairness metric gives us a way to measure if there is discrimination with respected to a protected class. In particular, disparate impacts across different protected classes is often <em>necessary</em> but <em>not sufficient</em> evidence of discrimination.</p>



<h2>Algorithms for Fairness: an Example</h2>



<p>To see why algorithms, which at first glance seem agnostic to group membership, may exhibit disparate treatment or impact, we consider the following <a href="https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/">Google visualization by Wattenberg, Viégas, and Hardt</a>.</p>



<p>Consider a blue population and an orange population for which there is no difference in the probability of a member of either population paying back the loan, but for which our model has different accuracies—in particular, the model is more accurate on the orange population. This is described by the plot below, in which the scores correspond to the model’s prediction of the probability of paying back the loan and opaque circles correspond to those who actually do not pay back the loan, whereas filled in circles correspond to those who do.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/BEy6yqi.png"/></figure>



<p>Suppose we are in charge of making a lending decision given the model prediction.<br/>A scenario in which we give everyone a loan would be fair, but would be bad us —we would go bankrupt!</p>



<p>Profit when giving everyone a loan:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/1uCdp2Q.png"/></figure>



<p>If we wanted to <strong>maximize profit</strong>, we would, however, give more loans to the orange population (since we’re more sure about which members of the orange population would actually pay back their loans) by setting a lower threshold (in terms of the score given by our algorithm) above which we give out loans.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Njtg1FU.png"/></figure>



<p>This maximizes profit but is blatantly unfair. We are treating the identical blue and orange groups differently, just because our model is more accurate on one than the other, and we also have disparate impact on the two groups. A non-defaulting applicant would be 78% likely to get a loan if they are a member of the orange group, but only 60% likely to get a loan if they are a member of the orange group.</p>



<p>This “profit maximization” is likely the end result of any sufficiently complex lending algorithm in the absence of a fairness intervention. Even if the algorithm does not explicitly rely on the group membership attribute, by simply optimizing it to maximize profit, it may well pick up on attributes that are correlated with group membership.</p>



<p>Suppose on the other hand that we wanted to mandate “equal treatment” in the sense of keeping the same thresholds for the blue and orange group. The result would be the following:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/c13O4Ly.png"/></figure>



<p>In this case, since the threshold are identical, the algorithm will be <strong>calibrated</strong>. 79% of the decisions we make will be the correct ones, for both the blue and orange population. So, from our point of view, the algorithm is fair and treats the blue and orange populations identically. However, from the point of view of the applicants, this is not the case. If you are a blue applicant that will pay your loan, you have 81% chance of getting a loan, but if you are an orange customer you only have 60% of getting it. This demonstrates that defining fairness is quite delicate. In particular the above “color blind” algorithm is still arguable unfair.</p>



<p>This difference between the point of view of the lender and lendee also arose in the recidivism case mentioned above. From the point of view of the defendant that would not recidivate, the algorithm was more likely to label them as “high risk” if they were Black than if they were white. From the point of view of the decision maker, the algorithm was calibrated, and if anything it was a bit more likely that a white defendant labeled high risk would not recidivate than a Black defendant. See (slightly rounded and simplified) data below</p>

<p/>



<p>If we wanted to achieve demographic parity (both populations get same total number of loans) or equal opportunity (true positive rate same for both) then we can do so, but again using different thresholds for each group:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/uMHsFPz.png"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/pAnbY6m.png"/></figure>



<h2>Fico Scores and Different Types of Fairness</h2>



<p>While the above was a hypothetical scenario, a real life example was shown by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02413">Hardt, Price and Srebro</a> using credit (also known as FICO) scores, as described by the plot below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/S8H0gjj.png"/></figure>



<p>For a single threshold, around 75% of Asian candidates will get loans, whereas only around 20% of Black candidates will get loans. To ensure that all groups get loans at the same rate, we would need to set the thresholds differently. In order to equalize opportunity, we’d also need to initialize the thresholds differently as well.</p>



<p>We see that we have different notions of what it means to be <em>fair</em> and that each of these different notions result in different algorithms.</p>



<h2>Fairness and Causality</h2>



<p>Berkeley graduate admissions in 1973 had the following statistics:</p>



<ul><li>44% male applicants admitted, 35% female applicants admitted;</li><li>However, female acceptance rate was higher at the <em>department level</em>, for most departments.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/MizH3NY.png"/></figure>



<p>This paradox is commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Simpson’s Paradox</a>.</p>



<p>A “fair” causal model for this scenario might be as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/sVG4l7l.png"/></figure>



<p>In the above, perhaps gender has a causal impact on the choice of department to which the applicant applies. However, a fair application process would, conditional on the department, be independent of gender of the applicant.</p>



<p>However, not all models that follow this causal structure are necessarily <em>fair</em>. In the case Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 1971, the court ruled that decision-making under the following causal model was <em>unfair</em>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/9f6iEKH.png"/></figure>



<p>While the model appears to be fair, since the job offer is conditionall independent of race, given the diploma, the court ruled that the job did not actually require a high school diploma. Hence, using the diploma as a factor in hiring decisions was really just a proxy for race, resulting in essentially purposeful unfair discrimination based on race. This creation of proxies is referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a>.</p>



<h1>Bottom Line</h1>



<p>We cannot come up with universal fairness criteria. The notion of fairness itself is based on assumptions about:</p>



<ul><li>representation of data</li><li>relationships to unmeasured inputs and outcomes</li><li>causal relation of inputs, predictions, outcomes.</li></ul>



<p>Fairness depends on what we choose to measure to observe, in both inputs and outputs, and how we choose to act upon them. In particular, we have the following causal structure, wherein measure inputs, decision-making, and measured outcomes all play a role in affecting the real-world and function together in a feedback cycle:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/LcW07id.png"/></figure>



<p>A more comprehensive illustration is given in this paper of <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/4/251365-the-impossibility-of-fairness/fulltext">Friedler, Scheidegger, and Venkatasubramanian</a>:</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I just heard that Benny Chor died this morning. Chor did very important work on computational biology and distributed algorithms, but I (and probably many of my readers) know him primarily for his work on cryptography, for his work on randomness extraction and for introducing the notion of private information retrieval.</p>



<p>I only met him once, at the event for <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2017/04/20/fests/">Oded Goldreich’s 60th birthday</a>. On the occasion, he gave a talk on the Chor-Goldreich paper, which introduced the problem of randomness extraction from independent sources, and which introduced min-entropy as the right parameter by which to quantify the randomness content of random sources. He did so using the original slides used for the FOCS 1985 talk.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_6726.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3735" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_6726.jpg?w=768"/></a></figure>



<p>I took a picture during the talk, which I posted online, and later he sent me an email asking for the original. Sadly, this was the totality of our correspondence. I heard that besides being a brilliant and generous researchers, he was a very playful, likeable and nice person. My thoughts are with his family and his friends.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The other night Dana and I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ">“The Internet’s Own Boy,”</a> the 2014 documentary about the life and work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>, which I’d somehow missed when it came out.  Swartz, for anyone who doesn’t remember, was the child prodigy who helped create RSS and Reddit, who then became a campaigner for an open Internet, who was arrested for using a laptop in an MIT supply closet to download millions of journal articles and threatened with decades in prison, and who then committed suicide at age 26.  I regret that I never knew Swartz, though he did once send me a fan email about <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>.</p>



<p>Say whatever you want about the tactical wisdom or the legality of Swartz’s actions; it seems inarguable to me that he was <em>morally</em> correct, that certain categories of information (e.g. legal opinions and taxpayer-funded scientific papers) need to be made freely available, and that sooner or later our civilization will catch up to Swartz and regard his position as completely obvious.  The beautifully-made documentary filled me with rage and guilt not only that the world had failed Swartz, but that I personally had failed him.</p>



<p>At the time of Swartz’s arrest, prosecution, and suicide, I was an MIT CS professor who’d previously <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/journal.html">written</a> in strong support of open access to scientific literature, and who had the platform of this blog.  Had I understood what was going on with Swartz—had I <em>taken the time to find out</em> what was going on—I could have been in a good position to help organize a grassroots campaign to pressure the MIT administration to urge prosecutors to drop the case (like JSTOR had already done), which could plausibly have made a difference.  As it was, I was preoccupied in those years with BosonSampling, getting married, etc., I didn’t bother to learn whether anything was being done or <em>could</em> be done about the Aaron Swartz matter, and then before I knew it, Swartz had joined Alan Turing in computer science’s pantheon of lost geniuses.</p>



<p>But maybe there was something deeper to my inaction.  If I’d strongly defended the substance of what Swartz had done, it would’ve raised the question: <em>why wasn’t I doing the same?</em>  Why was I merely complaining about paywalled journals from the comfort of my professor’s office, rather than putting my own freedom on the line like Swartz was?  It was as though I <em>had</em> to put some psychological distance between myself and the situation, in order to justify my life choices to myself.</p>



<p>Even though I see the error in that way of “thinking,” it keeps recurring, keeps causing me to make choices that I feel guilt or at least regret about later.  In February 2020, there were a few smart people saying that a new viral pneumonia from Wuhan was about to upend life on earth, but the people around me certainly weren’t <em>acting</em> that way, and <em>I</em> wasn’t acting that way either … and so, “for the sake of internal consistency,” I didn’t spend much time thinking about it or investigating it.  After all, if the fears of a global pandemic had a good chance of being true, I should be dropping everything else and panicking, shouldn’t I?  But I <em>wasn’t</em> dropping everything else and panicking … so how could the fears be true?</p>



<p>Then I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695">publicly repented</a>, and resolved not to make such an error again.  And now, 15 months later, I realize that I <em>have</em> made such an error again.</p>



<p>All throughout the pandemic, I’d ask my friends, privately, why the hypothesis that the virus had accidentally leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology wasn’t being taken far more seriously, given what seemed like a shockingly strong <em>prima facie</em> case.  But I didn’t discuss the lab leak scenario on this blog, except once in passing.  I could <em>say</em> I didn’t discuss it because I’m not a virologist and I had nothing new to contribute.  But I worry that I also didn’t discuss it because it seemed incompatible with my self-conception as a cautious scientist who’s skeptical of lurid coverups and conspiracies—and because I’d already spent my “weirdness capital” on other issues, and didn’t relish the prospect of being sneered at on social media yet again.  Instead I simply waited for discussion of the lab leak hypothesis to become “safe” and “respectable,” as today it finally has, thanks to writers who were more courageous than I was.  I became, basically, another sheep in one of the conformist herds that we rightly despise when we read about them in history.</p>



<p>(For all that, it’s still plausible to me that the virus had a natural origin after all.  What’s become clear is simply that, <em>even if so</em>, the failure to take the possibility of a lab escape more seriously back when the trail of evidence was fresher will stand as a major intellectual scandal of our time.)</p>



<p>Sometimes people are wracked with guilt, but over completely different things than the world <em>wants</em> them to be wracked with guilt over.  This was one of the great lessons that I learned from reading Richard Rhodes’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1451677618">The Making of the Atomic Bomb</a></em>.  Many of the Manhattan Project physicists felt lifelong guilt, <em>not</em> that they’d participated in building the bomb, but only that they hadn’t <em>finished</em> the bomb by 1943, when it could have ended the war in Europe and the Holocaust.</p>



<p>On a much smaller scale, I suppose some readers would still like me to feel guilt about comment 171, or some of the other stuff I wrote about nerds, dating, and feminism … or if not that, then maybe about my defense of a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, or of standardized tests and accelerated math programs, or maybe my vehement condemnation of Trump and his failed insurrection.  Or any of the dozens of other times when I stood up and said something I actually believed, or when I recounted my experiences as accurately as I could.  The truth is, though, I don’t.</p>



<p>Looking back—which, now that I’m 40, I confess is an increasingly large fraction of my time—the pattern seems consistent.  I feel guilty, not for having stood up for what I strongly believed in, but for having <em>failed</em> to do so.  This suggests that, if I want fewer regrets, then I should click “Publish” on more potentially controversial posts!  I don’t know how to force myself to do that, but maybe this post itself is a step.</p></div>

    <title>The Future of Faculty Hiring</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Faculty hiring in computer science is a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/12/fixing-academic-job-market.html">process long due for an overhaul</a>. The pandemic certainly changed some of the dynamics moving most of the interviews online and saving a ton of money and time. Will this be the start of a fresh approach to recruiting?</p><p>A typical search in the past few years had some schools flying in 30-40 candidates, typically costing over a $1000 each and a full-time job for a staff member during the search. We'd justify the expense as small compared to the millions we'd invest in a faculty member throughout their career, but it is generally the largest discretionary expense for a CS department. It also gives advantages to rich departments over others.</p><p>During the pandemic all those interviews moved online and worked reasonably well at virtually no additional cost. Also no need to scrounge around to find faculty willing to skip family meals to have dinner with the candidates. And if a faculty had a conflict with a candidate on the interview day, they could schedule on a different day. There really is no reason to have all the meetings on the same day.</p><p>With the pandemic mostly behind us, will we go back to in-person interviews moving forward. I suspect the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/whiffing-the-airport-interview/">airport interview</a>, where you fly out 20 or so candidates to have hour long interviews in a hotel near an airport with a search committee for an administrative position, will be the first to go completely virtual. </p><p>Even for regular faculty interviews, there will be great pressure to reduce the number of in-person visits, perhaps to just the top candidates, or just the ones who have offers--make the "second visit" the only visit. Richer departments may find the expense worthwhile to make a bigger impression on the candidates and that will only expand the advantage of wealthier universities.</p><p>Times like this are the perfect opportunity for CS leadership to come in and give some sanity to the hiring process but I'm not holding my breath.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-080 |  Hardness vs Randomness, Revised: Uniform, Non-Black-Box, and Instance-Wise | 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Roei Tell</title>
    <summary>We propose a new approach to the hardness-to-randomness framework and to the promise-BPP=promise-P conjecture. Classical results rely on non-uniform hardness assumptions to construct derandomization algorithms that work in the worst-case, or rely on uniform hardness assumptions to construct derandomization algorithms that work only in the average-case. In both types of results, the derandomization algorithm is ``black-box'' and uses the standard PRG approach. In this work we present results that closely relate **new and natural uniform hardness assumptions** to **worst-case derandomization** of promise-BPP, where the algorithms underlying the latter derandomization are **non-black-box**.

In our main result, we show that promise-BPP=promise-P if the following holds: There exists a multi-output function computable by logspace-uniform circuits of polynomial size and depth $n^2$ that cannot be computed by uniform probabilistic algorithms in time $n^c$, for some universal constant $c&gt;1$, on **almost all inputs**. The required failure on ``almost all inputs'' is stronger than the standard requirement of failing on one input of each length; however, the same assumption without the depth restriction on $f$ is **necessary** for the conclusion. This suggests a potential equivalence between worst-case derandomization of promise-BPP of any form (i.e., not necessarily by a black-box algorithm) and the existence of efficiently computable functions that are hard for probabilistic algorithms on almost all inputs.

In our second result, we introduce a new and uniform hardness-to-randomness tradeoff for the setting of **superfast average-case derandomization**; prior to this work, superfast average-case derandomization was known only under non-uniform hardness assumptions. In an extreme instantiation of our new tradeoff, under appealing uniform hardness assumptions, we show that for every polynomial $T(n)$ and constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ it holds that $BPTIME[T]\subseteq heur-DTIME[T\cdot n^{\epsilon}]$, where the ``heur'' prefix means that no polynomial-time algorithm can find, with non-negligible probability, an input on which the deterministic simulation errs.

Technically, our approach is to design **targeted PRGs and HSGs**, as introduced by Goldreich (LNCS, 2011). The targeted PRGs/HSGs ``produce randomness from the input'', as suggested by Goldreich and Wigderson (RANDOM 2002); and their analysis relies on non-black-box versions of the reconstruction procedure of Impagliazzo and Wigderson (FOCS 1998). Our main reconstruction procedure crucially relies on the ideas underlying the proof system of Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum (J. ACM 2015).</summary>

    <title>TR21-079 |  The zero-rate threshold for adversarial bit-deletions is less than 1/2 | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Xiaoyu He, 

	Ray Li</title>
    <summary>We prove that there exists an absolute constant $\delta&gt;0$ such any binary code $C\subset\{0,1\}^N$ tolerating $(1/2-\delta)N$ adversarial deletions must satisfy $|C|\le 2^{\poly\log N}$ and thus have rate asymptotically approaching $0$. This is the first constant fraction improvement over the trivial bound that codes tolerating $N/2$ adversarial deletions must have rate going to $0$ asymptotically.  Equivalently, we show that there exists absolute constants $A$ and $\delta&gt;0$ such that any set $C\subset\{0,1\}^N$ of $2^{\log^A N}$ binary strings must contain two strings $c$ and $c'$ whose longest common subsequence has length at least $(1/2+\delta)N$. As an immediate corollary, we show that $q$-ary codes tolerating a fraction $1-(1+2\delta)/q$ of adversarial deletions must also have rate approaching $0$.
 
Our techniques include string regularity arguments and a structural lemma that classifies binary strings by their oscillation patterns.  Leveraging these tools, we find in any large code two strings with similar oscillation patterns, which is exploited to find a long common subsequence.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>After 16 months without lecturing to an audience in my same location, I gave yesterday two lectures at the Technion in front of a live audience (and some additional audience in remote locations). The main lecture was in <a href="https://comsoc2021.net.technion.ac.il/">COMSOC 2021,</a> an international conference on computational social choice,  and earlier I gave a guest lecture in Roy Meshulam’s class about simple polytopes. I also met many friends. </p>
<p><a href="https://reshef.net.technion.ac.il/">Reshef Meir</a> who organized (with Bill Zwicker) COMSOC 2021 wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="color: #993366;"><em>Hi all, </em></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #993366;"><em>today was beyond expectations – the first feeling of a real actual conference after almost a year and a half!  We had about 40 people attending, viewing posters, and listening to talks. I truly hope this will return to be a common scene and that we can all meet face to face soon.</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div> </div>
<p>In my COMSOC lecture I talked about some earlier ideas and results in my work on social choice, starting with my paper with Ariel Rubinstein and Rani Spiegler on rationalizing individual choice by multiple rationals, and my subsequent attempt to use learnability as a tool for understanding choices of economic agents. This led to interesting questions on social choice <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/06/02/social-choice-preview/">that are discussed in this 2009 post.</a></p>
<p>In Roy’s course I explained <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-vectors of polytopes and the Dehn-Sommerville relations based on counting outdegrees of the graph of the polytope when we direct its edges based on a generic abstract objective function. I moved on to present a proof of Blind-Mani’s theorem that the graph of the polytope determines the full combinatorics. This proof is probably the one proof I presented the most and it is given in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/01/16/telling-a-simple-polytope-from-its-graph/">this 2009 post</a>.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We hope you are all staying safe. With massive vaccination programs across the globe we hope you and your loved ones are getting back to what used to be normal. With that out of the way, let us circle back to Property Testing. This month was less sleepy as compared to the two preceding months and we saw six papers in total (two of them explore problems in quantum property testing). Without further ado, let us take a deeper dive.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>GSF-locality is not sufficient for proximity-oblivious testing</strong>, by Isolde Adler, Noleen Kohler, Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08490">arXiv</a>) The notion of proximity oblivious testers was made explicit in the seminal work of Goldreich and Ron in 2009 [GR09]. A proximity oblivious tester for a graph property is a constant query tester that rejects a graph with probability that monotonically increases with distance to the property. (<strong>Edit</strong>: <em>Correction</em>) A property is called proximity oblivious testable (or PO testable) if it has a one sided proximity oblivious tester. [GR09] gave a characterization of which properties \(\Pi\) are PO testable in the bounded degree model <em>if and only if</em> it is a “local” property of some kind which satisfies a certain non propagation condition. [GR09] conjectured that all such “local” properties satisfy this non propagation condition. This paper refutes the above conjecture from [GR09].</p>



<p/>



<p>Coming up next. More action on triangle freeness.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Triangle Freeness in the General Model in Graphs with Arboricity \(O(\sqrt n)\)</strong>, by Reut Levi (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04809">arXiv</a>) PTReview readers are likely to be aware that triangle freeness has been a rich source of problems for developing new sublinear time algorithms. This paper considers the classic problem of testing triangle freeness in general graphs. In the dense case, algorithms with running time depending only on \(\varepsilon\) are known thanks to the work of Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich and Szegedy. In the bounded degree case, Goldreich and Ron gave testers with query complexity \(O(1/\varepsilon)\). This paper explores the problem in general graph case and proves an upper bound of \(O(\Gamma/d_{avg} + \Gamma)\) where \(\Gamma\) is the arboricity of the graph. The author also shows that this upperbound is tight for graphs with arboricity at most \(O(\sqrt n)\). Curiously enough, the algorithm does not take arboricity of the graph as an input and yet \(\Gamma\) (the arboricity) shows up in the upper and lower bounds.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Testing Dynamic Environments: Back to Basics</strong>, by Yonatan Nakar and Dana Ron (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00759">arXiv</a>) Goldreich and Ron introduced the problem of testing “dynamic environments” in 2014. Here is the setup for this problem. You are given an environment that evolves according to a local rule.  Your goal is to query some of the states in the system at some point of time and determine if the system is evolving according to some fixed rule or is far from it. In this paper, the authors consider environments defined by elementary cellular automata which evolve according to threshold rules as one of the first steps towards understanding what makes a dynamic environment tested efficiently.  The main result proves the following: if your local rules satisfy some <em>conditions</em>, you can use a meta algorithm with query complexity \(poly(1/\varepsilon)\) which is non adaptive and has one sided error. And all the threshold rules indeed satisfy these <em>conditions</em> which means they can be tested efficiently. </p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Identity testing under label mismatch</strong>, by Clement Canonne and Karl Wimmer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01856">arXiv</a>) This paper considers a classic problem distribution testing with the following twist. Let \(q\) denote a distribution supported on \([n]\). You are given access to samples from another distribution \(p\) where \(p  = q \circ \pi\) where \(\pi\) is some unknown permutation. Thus, I relabel the data and I give you access to samples from the relabeled dataset. Under this promise, note that identity testing becomes a trivial problem if \(q\) is known to be uniform over \([n]\). The authors develop algorithms for testing and tolerant testing of distributions under this additional promise of \(p\) being a permutation of some known distribution \(q\). The main result shows as exponential gap between the sample complexity of testing and tolerant testing under this promise. In particular, identity testing under the promise of permutation has sample complexity \(\Theta(\log^2 n)\) whereas tolerant identity testing under this promise has sample complexity \(\Theta(n^{1-o(1)})\).</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Testing symmetry on quantum computers</strong>, by Margarite L. LaBorde and Mark M. Wilde (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12758">arXiv</a>) This paper develops algorithms which test symmetries of a quantum states and changes generated by quantum circuits. These tests additionally also quantify how symmetric these states (or channels) are. For testing what are called “Bose states” the paper presents efficient algorithms. The tests for other kinds of symmetry presented in the paper rely on some aid from a quantum prover.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Quantum proofs of proximity</strong>, by Marcel Dall’Agnol, Tom Gur, Subhayan Roy Moulik, Justin Thaler (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/068/">ECCC</a>) The sublinear time (quantum) computation model has been gathering momentum steadily over the past several years. This paper seeks to understand the power of \({\sf QMA}\) proofs of proximity for property testing (recall \({\sf QMA}\) is the quantum analogue of \({\sf NP}\)). On the algorithmic front, the paper develops sufficient conditions for properties to admit efficient \({\sf QMA}\) proofs of proximity. On the complexity front, the paper demonstrates a property which admits  an efficient \({\sf QMA}\) proof but does not admit a \({\sf MA}\) or an interactive proof of proximity.</p></div>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">I now have a feature article up at Quanta magazine, entitled “What Makes Quantum Computing So Hard To Explain?” I.e., why do journalists, investors, etc. so consistently get central points wrong, even after the subject has been in public consciousness for more than 25 years?

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I now have a feature article up at <em>Quanta</em> magazine, entitled <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-quantum-computing-so-hard-to-explain-20210608/">“What Makes Quantum Computing So Hard To Explain?”</a>  I.e., why do journalists, investors, etc. so consistently get central points wrong, even after the subject has been in public consciousness for more than 25 years?  Perhaps unsurprisingly, I found it hard to discuss that meta-level question, as <em>Quanta</em>‘s editors asked me to do, without also engaging in the object-level task of actually explaining QC.  For regular <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers, there will be nothing new here, but I’m happy with how the piece turned out.</p>



<p>Accompanying the <em>Quanta</em> piece is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHoEjvuPoB8&amp;t=6s">10-minute YouTube explainer on quantum computing</a>, which (besides snazzy graphics) features interviews with me, John Preskill, and Dorit Aharonov.</p>



<p>On a different note, my colleague <a href="https://www.markwilde.com/">Mark Wilde</a> has recorded a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mark-m-wilde/quantum-computer">punk-rock song about BosonSampling</a>.  I can honestly report that it’s some of the finest boson-themed music I’ve heard in years.  It includes the following lyrics:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Quantum computer, Ain’t no loser<br/>Quantum computer, Quantum computer</p><p>People out on the streets<br/>They don’t know what it is<br/>They think it finds the cliques<br/>Or finds graph colorings<br/>But it don’t solve anything<br/>Said it don’t solve anything<br/>Bosonic slot machine<br/>My lil’ photonic dream</p></blockquote>



<p>Speaking of BosonSampling, A. S. Popova and A. N. Rubtsov, of the Skolkovo Institute in Moscow, have a new preprint entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01445">Cracking the Quantum Advantage threshold for Gaussian Boson Sampling</a>.  In it, they claim to give an efficient classical algorithm to simulate noisy GBS experiments, like the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5159">one six months ago</a> from USTC in China.  I’m still unsure how well this scales from 30-40 photons up to 50-70 photons; which imperfections of the USTC experiment are primarily being taken advantage of (photon losses?); and how this relates to the earlier proposed classical algorithms for simulating noisy BosonSampling, like the one by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3093">Kalai and Kindler</a>.  Anyone with any insight is welcome to share!</p>



<p>OK, one last announcement: the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, in Berkeley, has a new online lecture series called <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/institute-launches-breakthroughs-lecture-series">“Breakthroughs,”</a> which many readers of this blog might want to check out.</p></div>

    <title>Machine Learning for Algorithms Workshop (July 13-14)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We're having an online workshop on "Machine Learning for Algorithms" on July 13-14, with a great group of speakers.  Announcement below, link at <a href="https://fodsi.us/ml4a.html">https://fodsi.us/ml4a.html</a>, free registration (but please register in advance)!</p><div class="gmail_default" style="font-size: small;">In recent years there has been increasing interest in using machine learning to improve the performance of classical algorithms in computer science, by fine-tuning their behavior to adapt to the properties of the input distribution. This "data-driven" or "learning-based" approach to algorithm design has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of some of the most widely used algorithms. For example, they have been used to design better data structures, online algorithms, streaming and sketching algorithms, market mechanisms and algorithms for combinatorial optimization, similarity search and inverse problems.  This virtual workshop will feature talks from experts at the forefront of this exciting area.<br/><br/>The workshop is organized by Foundations of Data Science Institute (FODSI), a project supported by the NSF TRIPODS program (see fodsi.us).

    <title>TR21-078 |  A direct product theorem for quantum communication complexity with applications to device-independent QKD | 

	Rahul  Jain, 

	Srijita Kundu</title>
    <summary>We give a direct product theorem for the entanglement-assisted interactive quantum communication complexity of an $l$-player predicate $V$. In particular we show that for a distribution $p$ that is product across the input sets of the $l$ players, the success probability of any entanglement-assisted quantum communication protocol for computing $n$ copies of $V$, whose communication is $o(\log(\mathrm{eff}^*(V,p))\cdot n)$, goes down exponentially in $n$. Here $\mathrm{eff}^*(V, p)$ is a distributional version of the quantum efficiency or partition bound introduced by Laplante, Lerays and Roland (2014), which is a lower bound on the distributional quantum communication complexity of computing a single copy of $V$ with respect to $p$.
  As an application of our result, we show that it is possible to do device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) without the assumption that devices do not leak any information after inputs are provided to them. We analyze the DIQKD protocol given by Jain, Miller and Shi (2017), and show that when the protocol is carried out with devices that are compatible with $n$ copies of the Magic Square game, it is possible to extract $\Omega(n)$ bits of key from it, even in the presence of $O(n)$ bits of leakage. Our security proof is parallel, i.e., the honest parties can enter all their inputs into their devices at once, and works for a leakage model that is arbitrarily interactive, i.e., the devices of the honest parties Alice and Bob can exchange information with each other and with the eavesdropper Eve in any number of rounds, as long as the total number of bits or qubits communicated is bounded.</summary>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">latest paper</a>, in collaboration with Microsoft Research, we introduce
3DB: an extendable, unified framework for debugging and analyzing vision models
using photorealistic simulation. We’re releasing 3DB as a package, accompanied
by extensive API documentation, guides, and demos.</i></p>

<p><em>Note: You are now viewing the Javascript-free/lightweight version of this
post—to see the full version (with interactive plots, diagrams, and models!),

<p>Identifying failure modes and biases in vision models is a rapidly
emerging challenge in machine learning. In high-stakes
applications, simply deploying models and collecting failures that arise in
the wild is often difficult, expensive, and irresponsible. To this end, a
recent line of work in vision focuses on identifying model failure
modes via in-depth analyses of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02779">image transformations</a> and 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261">corruptions</a>, <a href="https://objectnet.dev">object orientations</a>,
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">backgrounds</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231v2">shape-texture conflicts</a>. These studies 
(and other similarly important ones) reveal a variety of patterns of
performance degradation in vision models. Still, performing each such study
requires time, developing (often complex)
toolingFor <a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">our study of image backgrounds</a>, for example, we used a
combination of bounding boxes and classical computer vision tools to crop out
image backgrounds. We then had to manually filter out the images for which
the tools failed. Even for the images where the toolkit succeeded, there
remained inevitable cropping artifacts., and a willingness to settle for less than perfect simulations of each
potential failure mode. Our question is: can we support reliable discovery of model failures in a systematic,
automated, and unified way?</p>

<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 0;">
A sampling of the analyses enabled by 3DB.
</div>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">latest paper</a>, we try to make progress on this question and propose
3DB, a platform for automatically identifying and analyzing the failure modes
of computer vision models using 3D rendering. 3DB aims to allow users to go
from a testable, robustness-based hypothesis to concrete, photorealistic
experimental evidence with minimal time and effort.</p>

<p>The platform revolves around the modular workflow pictured below. First,
users specify a set of 3D objects and environments, as well as a set of 3D
(or 2D) transformations called controls that determine the space of
admissible object-environment configurations. 3DB then renders a myriad of
admissible scenes and feeds them through the user’s computer vision model of
choice. The user can finally stratify, aggregate, or otherwise analyze the
results either by reading the outputted JSON, or through the pre-packaged
dashboard.</p>

<p><img alt="An illustration of the 3DB workflow." class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/workflow.png"/></p>

<p>3DB easily adapts to a variety of use cases: in particular, users can
modify and swap out any part of this pipeline (e.g., the renderer, the
logger, the model type, or the controls) for their own custom-written
components, without needing to modify any of the 3DB codebase. We’ve compiled <a href="https://3db.github.io/3db/">guides</a>,
extensive <a href="https://3db.github.io/3db/api_doc.html">API documentation</a>, and a
<a href="https://github.com/3db/demo">full demo</a> showing how 3DB streamlines model debugging.</p>

<p><strong>In fact, this blog post will double as another demo! We’ll present the (short) code
necessary to reproduce every plot in the post below using 3DB. You can download 
the aggregated code for this blog post <a href="https://github.com/3db/blog_demo">here</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="using-3db">Using 3DB</h2>

<p>Prior works have already used 3D rendering (to great effect) to study biases
of machine learning models, including pose and context-based biases. Our goal
is not to propose a specific 3D-rendering based analysis, but
rather to provide an easy-to-use, highly extendable framework that unifies
prior analyses (both 3D and 2D) while enabling users to (a) conduct a host of
new analyses with the same ease and with realistic results; and (b)
effortlessly <em>compose</em> different factors of variation to understand their
interplay.</p>

<p>We’ll dedicate the rest of this post to illustrating how one
might actually use 3DB in practice, focusing on a single example 3D
model3DB works with any 3D model, and we refer the reader to 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">our paper</a> for more examples and details.:</p>

<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    The 3D mug model that we'll be using throughout this post.
</div>

<p>In what follows, we will walk through example applications of 3DB to discover biases of
ML models (some previously documented, others not). For the sake of brevity,
we’ll highlight just a few of these (re-)discoveries—to see more, check out
the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">paper</a>. We’ll then demonstrate that the discoveries of 3DB
transfer pretty reliably to the real world!</p>

<p>Our experiments will all operate on an ImageNet-pretrained
ResNet-18The classifier has a ~70% validation-set
accuracy. that has 42% accuracy on images from the
“coffee mug” ImageNet subclass. While we only study classification in this blog post,
3DB also supports object detection and can be easily extended to support other
image-based tasks, such as semantic segmentation, too.</p>

<h2 id="image-background-sensitivity">Image Background Sensitivity</h2>

<p>In one of our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">previous posts</a>,
we continued a long line of prior work (see, e.g.,
<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00171412/file/ZhangMarszalekLazebnikSchmid-IJCV07-ClassificationStudy.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06596">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08731">here</a>, etc.) showing that models can be
over-reliant on image backgrounds, and demonstrated that they are easily
broken by adversarially chosen backgrounds. To accomplish this, our prior
analysis used classical computer vision tools to separate foregrounds from
backgrounds, then pasted foregrounds from one image onto backgrounds from
another. This process was slow and required extensive quality control to
ensure that backgrounds and foregrounds were being extracted properly—and
even when they were, a few artifacts remained:</p>

        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/1.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;"/>
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/2.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;"/>

</div>

<p>3DB lets us reproduce these findings effortlessly and without introducing
such artifacts. To demonstrate this, we use 3DB to render our mug 3D model on
hundreds of HDRI backgrounds, resulting in images such as:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 15px; overflow: hidden;">
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/background-renders/1.png" style="float: right; width: 20%;"/>

        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/background-renders/10.png" style="float: right; width: 20%;"/>
    
</div>

<p>We then analyze the performance of a pretrained ResNet-18Recall that this model
obtains 42% accuracy on the corresponding "coffee mug" ImageNet class subset.on these images. We
find that the performance of the classifier varies significantly across
backgrounds, and that accuracy correlates with a crude measure of
“background simplicity” (the JPEG compressed size of the image—with smaller size corresponding to being more simple).</p>

images rendered by 3DB while varying the complexity of the rendering backgrounds

</div>

<p><strong>A note on compositionality</strong>: An important part of 3DB that we don’t discuss here is compositionality, i.e., the ability to put together multiple controls and study their joint effect. For example, in our paper we studied how a model’s prediction vary with various zoom levels and backgrounds of an object. We found that the optimal zoom level varies a lot by background.</p>

<h2 id="texture-bias">Texture Bias</h2>
<p>Another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231v2">recent study</a> of neural network biases showed that in
contrast to humans, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) rely more on texture
to recognize objects than on shape. The example below typifies this
phenomenon—a cat with an elephant texture is recognized as a cat by humans,
but as an elephant by CNNs:</p>

<p><img alt="Cue-conflict images introduced by Geirhos et al." src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/cue_conflict.png"/></p>
<div class="caption">
An example of the cue-conflict images introduced by Geirhos et al. Combining the
elephant texture with the cat shape results in a mixed image on which CNNs
consistently predict with the texture signal.
</div>

<p>This example and others like it (dubbed ‘cue-conflict’ images) provide a
striking illustration of the contrast between human and CNN-based
classification mechanisms. Still, just as in the case of image backgrounds,
creating such images typically necessitates time, technical skill,
quality control, and/or introduction of unwanted artifacts (for example, in the above figure,
ideally we would modify only the texture of the cat without altering the background).</p>

<p>However, using 3DB we can easily collect photorealistic empirical evidence of
texture bias. Without modifying the internal 3DB codebase at all,
one can write a <a href="https://github.com/3db/3db/blob/main/threedb/controls/blender/material.py">custom control</a> that modifies the texture of
objects in the scene while keeping the rest intact. With this custom control
in placeIn fact, the texture-swapping control for this experiment is now 
pre-packaged with 3DB, since we already wrote it ourselves!, one can simply 
randomize the texture of the mug across various
backgrounds, poses and camera parameters before stratifying results:</p>

<p><img alt="Chungus" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/texture_swap_histograms.png"/></p>

<p>The performance of the pretrained model on mugs (and other objects)
deteriorates severely upon replacing the mug’s texture with a “wrong” one,
providing clear corroborating evidence of the texture bias! We noticed in our
experiments that for some textures (e.g., zebra), the coffee mug was
consistently misclassified as the corresponding animal, whereas for others
(e.g., crocodile), the mug is misclassified as either a related class (e.g.,
turtle or other reptile), or as an unrelated object (e.g., a trash can).</p>

<p>Beyond general hypotheses about model biases, 3DB allows us to test vision
systems on a more fine-grained level. In the case of our running mug example,
for instance, we can use the platform to understand which specific parts of
its 3D mesh correlate with classifier accuracy. Specifically, below we
generate (and classify) scenes with random mug positions, rotations, and
backgrounds. Since 3DB stores texture-coordinate information for each
rendering, we can reconstruct a three-dimensional heatmap that encodes, for
each point on the surface of the mug, the classifier’s accuracy conditioned
on that point being visible:</p>

<p>Now that we have hypotheses regarding model performance, we can test them! Inspecting
the ImageNet validation set, we found that our classifier indeed (a) struggles on coffee mugs when the
handle is not showing (providing a feasible explanation for (1), since the side
opposite the handle is only visible when the handle itself isn’t), and (b)
performs worse at higher camera angles (providing a plausible explanation for
(2)). We want to focus, however, on the third phenomenon,
i.e., that the classifier performs quite poorly whenever the inside of the
mug is visible. Why could this be the case? We can use 3DB to gain insight into the
phenomenon. Specifically, we want to test the following hypothesis: when
classifying mugs, does our ImageNet model rely on the exact liquid inside the
cup?</p>

<p>We investigate this hypothesis by writing a custom control that fills
our mug with various liquids (more precisely, a parameterized mixture of
water, milk, and coffee):</p>

<p><img alt="Examples of the mugs rendered in this experiment" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_samples.png"/></p>
<div class="caption">
Our running example mug, filled with different parameterized liquids: 100% water
(top left), 100% coffee (top right), 100% milk (bottom right), and a coffee-milk
mixture (bottom left)
</div>

<p>In contrast to the last experiment (where we varied the orientation of the
mug), we render scenes containing the mug in a fixed set of poses that reveal
the contents—just as in the last experiment, however, we still vary
background and mug location. We visualize the results below—each cell in
the heatmap corresponds to a fixed mixture of coffee, water, and milk (i.e.,
the labeled corners are 100% coffee, 100% milk, and 100% water, and the other
cells are linear interpolations of these ratios) and the color of the cell
encodes the relative accuracy of the classifier when the mug is filled with
that liquid:</p>

<!-- <img src="/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_simplex.png" 
    class="bigimg" alt="A diagram illustrating how ImageNet classifiers are
    sensitive to the liquid inside of the rendered mug." /> -->

<p><img alt="" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_simplex.png"/></p>

<div class="caption">
Measuring the relative effect of the liquid mixture in the mug on model
predictions. Each cell represents a specific liquid mixture, and the color of
the cell represents the tendency of the model (averaged over random viewpoints
and relative to the other cells) to predict "cup"/"pill bottle," "bucket," or
"mug."
</div>

<p>It turns out that mug content indeed highly impacts classification:
our model is much less likely to correctly classify a mug that doesn’t contain coffee!
This is just one example of how 3DB can help in proving or disproving hypotheses
about model behavior.</p>

<h2 id="from-simulation-to-reality">From Simulation to Reality</h2>

<p>So far, we’ve used 3DB to discover ML models’ various failure modes and biases
via photorealistic rendering. To what extent though do the insights
gleaned from simulated 3DB experiments actually “transfer” to the physical
world?</p>

<p>To test such transferability, we began by creating a 3D model of a physical room we
had access to. We also collected eight different 3D models with closely matching
physical world counterparts—including the mug analyzed above. Next, we used 3DB to find correctly and incorrectly classified
configurations (pose, orientation, location) of these eight objects inside that
room. Finally, we replicated these poses (to
the best of our abilities) in the physical room, and took photos with a
cellphone camera:</p>

<p><img alt="Samples from our physical-world experiment." class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/real_life_exp_samples.png"/></p>

<div class="caption">
Examples of simulated scenes (top) and their re-created counterparts (bottom)
from our physical-world experiment.
</div>

<p>We classified these photos with the same vision model as before and measured
how often the simulated classifier correctness matched correctness on the
real photographs. We observed an ~85% match! So the failure
modes identified by 3DB are not merely simulation artifacts, and can indeed arise in
the real world.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>3DB is a flexible, easy-to-use, and extensible framework for
identifying model failure modes, uncovering biases, and testing fine-grained
hypotheses about model behavior. We hope it will prove to be a useful tool
for debugging vision models.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-object-detection-web-dashboard-and-more">Bonus: Object Detection, Web Dashboard, and more!</h2>

<p>We’ll wrap up by highlighting some additional capabilities of 3DB that we didn’t
get to demonstrate in this blog post:</p>

<h3 id="3dboard-a-web-interface-for-exploring-results">3DBoard: a web interface for exploring results</h3>

<p>In all of the code examples above, we showed how to analyze the results of a 3DB
experiment by loading the output into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pandas</code> dataframe. For additional
convenience, however, 3DB also comes with a web-based dashboard for exploring
experimental results. The following command suffices to visualize the texture swaps experiment from earlier:</p>

<pre style="padding: 0; margin: 0;"><code class="bash">
python -m threedboard results_texture/ --port 3000

<p>Navigating to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YOUR_IP:3000</code> should lead you to a page that looks like this:</p>

<h3 id="object-detection-and-other-tasks">Object detection and other tasks</h3>

<p>In this blog post, we focused on using 3DB to analyze image classification
models. However, the library also supports object detection out-of-the-box, and
can easily be extended to support a variety of image-based tasks (e.g.,
segmentation or regression-based tasks). For example, below we provide a simple
end-to-end object detection example:</p>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">latest paper</a>, in collaboration with Microsoft Research, we introduce
3DB: an extendable, unified framework for debugging and analyzing vision models
using photorealistic simulation. We’re releasing 3DB as a package, accompanied
by extensive API documentation, guides, and demos.</i></p>

<p><em>Note: this post contains some interactive plots and 3D models that use
JavaScript: click <a href="https://gradientscience.org/3db-light/">here</a> for a JS-free version of this post.</em></p>

<p>Identifying failure modes and biases in vision models is a rapidly
emerging challenge in machine learning. In high-stakes
applications, simply deploying models and collecting failures that arise in
the wild is often difficult, expensive, and irresponsible. To this end, a
recent line of work in vision focuses on identifying model failure
modes via in-depth analyses of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02779">image transformations</a> and 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261">corruptions</a>, <a href="https://objectnet.dev">object orientations</a>,
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">backgrounds</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231v2">shape-texture conflicts</a>. These studies 
(and other similarly important ones) reveal a variety of patterns of
performance degradation in vision models. Still, performing each such study
requires time, developing (often complex)
toolingFor <a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">our study of image backgrounds</a>, for example, we used a
combination of bounding boxes and classical computer vision tools to crop out
image backgrounds. We then had to manually filter out the images for which
the tools failed. Even for the images where the toolkit succeeded, there
remained inevitable cropping artifacts., and a willingness to settle for less than perfect simulations of each
potential failure mode. Our question is: can we support reliable discovery of model failures in a systematic,
automated, and unified way?</p>

<h2 id="3db-a-rendering-based-debugging-platform">3DB: A Rendering-based Debugging Platform</h2>

<p><img alt="A sampling of the analyses enabled by 3DB." class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/3db_headline.png"/></p>
<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 0;">
A sampling of the analyses enabled by 3DB.
</div>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">latest paper</a>, we try to make progress on this question and propose
3DB, a platform for automatically identifying and analyzing the failure modes
of computer vision models using 3D rendering. 3DB aims to allow users to go
from a testable, robustness-based hypothesis to concrete, photorealistic
experimental evidence with minimal time and effort.</p>

<p>The platform revolves around the modular workflow pictured below. First,
users specify a set of 3D objects and environments, as well as a set of 3D
(or 2D) transformations called controls that determine the space of
admissible object-environment configurations. 3DB then renders a myriad of
admissible scenes and feeds them through the user’s computer vision model of
choice. The user can finally stratify, aggregate, or otherwise analyze the
results either by reading the outputted JSON, or through the pre-packaged
dashboard.</p>

<p><img alt="An illustration of the 3DB workflow." class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/workflow.png"/></p>

<p>3DB easily adapts to a variety of use cases: in particular, users can
modify and swap out any part of this pipeline (e.g., the renderer, the
logger, the model type, or the controls) for their own custom-written
components, without needing to modify any of the 3DB codebase. We’ve compiled <a href="https://3db.github.io/3db/">guides</a>,
extensive <a href="https://3db.github.io/3db/api_doc.html">API documentation</a>, and a
<a href="https://github.com/3db/demo">full demo</a> showing how 3DB streamlines model debugging.</p>

<p><strong>In fact, this blog post will double as another demo! We’ll present the (short) code
necessary to reproduce every plot in the post below using 3DB. You can download 
the aggregated code for this blog post <a href="https://github.com/3db/blog_demo">here</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="using-3db">Using 3DB</h2>

<p>Prior works have already used 3D rendering (to great effect) to study biases
of machine learning models, including pose and context-based biases. Our goal
is not to propose a specific 3D-rendering based analysis, but
rather to provide an easy-to-use, highly extendable framework that unifies
prior analyses (both 3D and 2D) while enabling users to (a) conduct a host of
new analyses with the same ease and with realistic results; and (b)

<p>We’ll dedicate the rest of this post to illustrating how one
might actually use 3DB in practice, focusing on a single example 3D
model3DB works with any 3D model, and we refer the reader to 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">our paper</a> for more examples and details.:</p>

</div>

<p>In what follows, we will walk through example applications of 3DB to discover biases of
ML models (some previously documented, others not). For the sake of brevity,
we’ll highlight just a few of these (re-)discoveries—to see more, check out
the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">paper</a>. We’ll then demonstrate that the discoveries of 3DB
transfer pretty reliably to the real world!</p>

<p>Our experiments will all operate on an ImageNet-pretrained
ResNet-18The classifier has a ~70% validation-set
accuracy. that has 42% accuracy on images from the
“coffee mug” ImageNet subclass. While we only study classification in this blog post,
3DB also supports object detection and can be easily extended to support other
image-based tasks, such as semantic segmentation, too.</p>

<h2 id="image-background-sensitivity">Image Background Sensitivity</h2>

<p>In one of our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">previous posts</a>,
we continued a long line of prior work (see, e.g.,
<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00171412/file/ZhangMarszalekLazebnikSchmid-IJCV07-ClassificationStudy.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06596">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08731">here</a>, etc.) showing that models can be
over-reliant on image backgrounds, and demonstrated that they are easily
broken by adversarially chosen backgrounds. To accomplish this, our prior
analysis used classical computer vision tools to separate foregrounds from
backgrounds, then pasted foregrounds from one image onto backgrounds from
another. This process was slow and required extensive quality control to
ensure that backgrounds and foregrounds were being extracted properly—and
even when they were, a few artifacts remained:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 15px; overflow: hidden; text-align: center;">
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/1.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;"/>
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/2.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;"/>

        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/6.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;"/>
    
</div>

<p>3DB lets us reproduce these findings effortlessly and without introducing
such artifacts. To demonstrate this, we use 3DB to render our mug 3D model on
hundreds of HDRI backgrounds, resulting in images such as:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 15px; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>We then analyze the performance of a pretrained ResNet-18Recall that this model
obtains 42% accuracy on the corresponding "coffee mug" ImageNet class subset.on these images. We
find that the performance of the classifier varies significantly across
backgrounds, and that accuracy correlates with a crude measure of
“background simplicity” (the JPEG compressed size of the image—with smaller size corresponding to being more simple).</p>

<p><strong>A note on compositionality</strong>: An important part of 3DB that we don’t discuss here is compositionality, i.e., the ability to put together multiple controls and study their joint effect. For example, in our paper we studied how a model’s prediction vary with various zoom levels and backgrounds of an object. We found that the optimal zoom level varies a lot by background.</p>

<h2 id="texture-bias">Texture Bias</h2>
<p>Another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231v2">recent study</a> of neural network biases showed that in
contrast to humans, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) rely more on texture
to recognize objects than on shape. The example below typifies this
phenomenon—a cat with an elephant texture is recognized as a cat by humans,
but as an elephant by CNNs:</p>

<p><img alt="Cue-conflict images introduced by Geirhos et al." src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/cue_conflict.png"/></p>
<div class="caption">
An example of the cue-conflict images introduced by Geirhos et al. Combining the
elephant texture with the cat shape results in a mixed image on which CNNs
consistently predict with the texture signal.
</div>

<p>This example and others like it (dubbed ‘cue-conflict’ images) provide a
striking illustration of the contrast between human and CNN-based
classification mechanisms. Still, just as in the case of image backgrounds,
creating such images typically necessitates time, technical skill,
quality control, and/or introduction of unwanted artifacts (for example, in the above figure,
ideally we would modify only the texture of the cat without altering the background).</p>

<p>However, using 3DB we can easily collect photorealistic empirical evidence of
texture bias. Without modifying the internal 3DB codebase at all,
one can write a <a href="https://github.com/3db/3db/blob/main/threedb/controls/blender/material.py">custom control</a> that modifies the texture of
objects in the scene while keeping the rest intact. With this custom control
in placeIn fact, the texture-swapping control for this experiment is now 
pre-packaged with 3DB, since we already wrote it ourselves!, one can simply 
randomize the texture of the mug across various
backgrounds, poses and camera parameters before stratifying results:</p>

<p>The performance of the pretrained model on mugs (and other objects)
deteriorates severely upon replacing the mug’s texture with a “wrong” one,
providing clear corroborating evidence of the texture bias! We noticed in our
experiments that for some textures (e.g., zebra), the coffee mug was
consistently misclassified as the corresponding animal, whereas for others
(e.g., crocodile), the mug is misclassified as either a related class (e.g.,
turtle or other reptile), or as an unrelated object (e.g., a trash can).</p>

<h2 id="part-of-object-attribution">Part-of-Object Attribution</h2>

<p>Beyond general hypotheses about model biases, 3DB allows us to test vision
systems on a more fine-grained level. In the case of our running mug example,
for instance, we can use the platform to understand which specific parts of
its 3D mesh correlate with classifier accuracy. Specifically, below we
generate (and classify) scenes with random mug positions, rotations, and
backgrounds. Since 3DB stores texture-coordinate information for each
rendering, we can reconstruct a three-dimensional heatmap that encodes, for
each point on the surface of the mug, the classifier’s accuracy conditioned
on that point being visible:</p>

<p>Now that we have hypotheses regarding model performance, we can test them! Inspecting
the ImageNet validation set, we found that our classifier indeed (a) struggles on coffee mugs when the
handle is not showing (providing a feasible explanation for (1), since the side
opposite the handle is only visible when the handle itself isn’t), and (b)
performs worse at higher camera angles (providing a plausible explanation for
(2)). We want to focus, however, on the third phenomenon,
i.e., that the classifier performs quite poorly whenever the inside of the
mug is visible. Why could this be the case? We can use 3DB to gain insight into the
phenomenon. Specifically, we want to test the following hypothesis: when
classifying mugs, does our ImageNet model rely on the exact liquid inside the
cup?</p>

<p>We investigate this hypothesis by writing a custom control that fills
our mug with various liquids (more precisely, a parameterized mixture of
water, milk, and coffee):</p>

<p><img alt="Examples of the mugs rendered in this experiment" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_samples.png"/></p>
<div class="caption">
Our running example mug, filled with different parameterized liquids: 100% water
(top left), 100% coffee (top right), 100% milk (bottom right), and a coffee-milk
mixture (bottom left)
</div>

<p>In contrast to the last experiment (where we varied the orientation of the
mug), we render scenes containing the mug in a fixed set of poses that reveal
the contents—just as in the last experiment, however, we still vary
background and mug location. We visualize the results below—each cell in
the heatmap corresponds to a fixed mixture of coffee, water, and milk (i.e.,
the labeled corners are 100% coffee, 100% milk, and 100% water, and the other
cells are linear interpolations of these ratios) and the color of the cell
encodes the relative accuracy of the classifier when the mug is filled with
that liquid:</p>

<!-- <img src="/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_simplex.png" 
    class="bigimg" alt="A diagram illustrating how ImageNet classifiers are
    sensitive to the liquid inside of the rendered mug." /> -->

<p><img alt="" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_simplex.png"/></p>

<div class="caption">
Measuring the relative effect of the liquid mixture in the mug on model
predictions. Each cell represents a specific liquid mixture, and the color of
the cell represents the tendency of the model (averaged over random viewpoints
and relative to the other cells) to predict "cup"/"pill bottle," "bucket," or
"mug."
</div>

<p>It turns out that mug content indeed highly impacts classification:
our model is much less likely to correctly classify a mug that doesn’t contain coffee!
This is just one example of how 3DB can help in proving or disproving hypotheses
about model behavior.</p>

<h2 id="from-simulation-to-reality">From Simulation to Reality</h2>

<p>So far, we’ve used 3DB to discover ML models’ various failure modes and biases
via photorealistic rendering. To what extent though do the insights
gleaned from simulated 3DB experiments actually “transfer” to the physical
world?</p>

<p>To test such transferability, we began by creating a 3D model of a physical room we
had access to. We also collected eight different 3D models with closely matching
physical world counterparts—including the mug analyzed above. Next, we used 3DB to find correctly and incorrectly classified
configurations (pose, orientation, location) of these eight objects inside that
room. Finally, we replicated these poses (to
the best of our abilities) in the physical room, and took photos with a
cellphone camera:</p>

<p><img alt="Samples from our physical-world experiment." class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/real_life_exp_samples.png"/></p>

<div class="caption">
Examples of simulated scenes (top) and their re-created counterparts (bottom)
from our physical-world experiment.
</div>

<p>We classified these photos with the same vision model as before and measured
how often the simulated classifier correctness matched correctness on the
real photographs. We observed an ~85% match! So the failure
modes identified by 3DB are not merely simulation artifacts, and can indeed arise in
the real world.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>3DB is a flexible, easy-to-use, and extensible framework for
identifying model failure modes, uncovering biases, and testing fine-grained
hypotheses about model behavior. We hope it will prove to be a useful tool
for debugging vision models.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-object-detection-web-dashboard-and-more">Bonus: Object Detection, Web Dashboard, and more!</h2>

<p>We’ll wrap up by highlighting some additional capabilities of 3DB that we didn’t
get to demonstrate in this blog post:</p>

<h3 id="3dboard-a-web-interface-for-exploring-results">3DBoard: a web interface for exploring results</h3>

<p>In all of the code examples above, we showed how to analyze the results of a 3DB
experiment by loading the output into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pandas</code> dataframe. For additional
convenience, however, 3DB also comes with a web-based dashboard for exploring
experimental results. The following command suffices to visualize the texture swaps experiment from earlier:</p>

<pre style="padding: 0; margin: 0;"><code class="bash">
python -m threedboard results_texture/ --port 3000

</code>
</pre>

<p>Navigating to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YOUR_IP:3000</code> should lead you to a page that looks like this:</p>

<p><img alt="Dashboard screenshot" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/dashboard_screenshot.png"/></p>

<h3 id="object-detection-and-other-tasks">Object detection and other tasks</h3>

<p>In this blog post, we focused on using 3DB to analyze image classification
models. However, the library also supports object detection out-of-the-box, and
can easily be extended to support a variety of image-based tasks (e.g.,
segmentation or regression-based tasks). For example, below we provide a simple
end-to-end object detection example:</p>

The paper <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascuV10">PV10</a>]</span> with Pǎtraşcu shows that <img alt="r\ge m/w^{O(q)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5Cge+m%2Fw%5E%7BO%28q%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and this was recently shown to be tight by Yu <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/conf/stoc/Yu19">Yu19</a>]</span> (building on the breakthrough data structure <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascu08Succincter">Pǎt08</a>]</span> which motivated the lower bound and is not far from it).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   As is common in data-structure lower bounds, the proof in <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascuV10">PV10</a>]</span> is an <em>encoding argument</em>. In the recently posted paper, an alternative proof is presented which avoids the encoding argument and is perhaps more in line with other proofs in complexity lower bounds. Of course, <em>everything</em> is an encoding argument, and <em>nothing </em>is an encoding argument, and this post won’t draw a line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The new proof establishes an <em>intrinsic property</em> of efficient data structures, whereas typical proofs including <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascuV10">PV10</a>]</span> are somewhat tailored to the problem at hand. The property is called the <em>separator</em> and is a main technical contribution of the work. At the high level the separator shows that in any efficient data structure you can restrict the input space a little so that many queries are nearly <em>pairwise independent</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Also, the new proof rules out a stronger object: a <em>sampler</em> (<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/is-nature-a-low-complexity-sampler/">see previous post here</a> on sampling lower bounds). Specifically, the distribution Rank<img alt="(U)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28U%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="U" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the uniform distribution cannot be sampled, not even slightly close, by an efficient cell-probe algorithm. This implies the data-structure result, and it can be informally interpreted as saying that the “reason” why the lower bound holds is not that the data is compressed, but rather that one can’t generate the type of dependencies occurring in Rank via an efficient cell-probe algorithm, regardless of what the input is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Building on this machinery, one can prove several results about sampling, like showing that cell-probe samplers are strictly weaker than AC0 samplers. While doing this, it occurred to me that one gets a corollary for data structures which I had not seen in the literature. The corollary is a <em>probe hierarchy</em>, showing that some problem can be solved with zero redundancy (<img alt="r=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) with <img alt="O(q)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28q%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> probes, while it requires almost linear <img alt="r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> probes. For example I don’t know of a result yielding this for small <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such as <img alt="q=O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%3DO%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; I would appreciate a reference. (As mentioned in the                                                                                                                                                        paper, the sampling viewpoint is not essential and just like for Rank one can prove the data-structure corollaries directly. Personally, and obviously, I find the sampling viewpoint useful.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   One of my favorite open problems in the area still is: can a uniform distribution over <img alt="[m]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bm%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be approximately sampled by an efficient cell-probe algorithm? I can’t even rule out samplers making <em>two </em>probes!</p>

Mary Kay Farley, my dear wife’s mom, and Dorothy Lipton, my mom, have unfortunately both passed away. Kathryn and I miss them greatly. Both women shared keen mathematical skills, a fascination with the game of baseball and a commitment to living a well-ordered life.  </p>
<p>
Today is <b>not</b> Mother’s Day. We still hope all mothers everywhere are enjoying their day.</p>
<p>
We will take this time to thank all of you out there. We missed doing so last month, but the pandemic has distended time anyway. What we are hearing now are stories of mothers and children and grandchildren finally being able to think of seeing each other in person rather than via video.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Another Kind of Parentage </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This has blended with musings on our recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/26/congrats-avi-and-laci-on-the-abel-prize/">post</a> in which I (Dick) noted that Dorit Aharonov is an academic grandchild of mine, in that Avi Wigderson co-supervised her doctoral thesis and I supervised Avi’s. </p>
<p>
Years ago we featured on Father’s Day a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/06/19/who's-your-doktorvater/">post</a> with the title “Who’s Your <em>Doktorvater</em>?”—which was a play on the <a href="https://bosoxinjection.com/2014/09/24/ten-years-gone-pedro-martinez-calls-yankees-daddy/">expression</a> “who’s your daddy?” Now it is high time to note that there are many “doctor mothers”—as Dorit has herself <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=102209">become</a>. </p>
<p>
One difference from human genealogy is that most often there is only one “doctor parent.” My <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=86340&amp;fChrono=1">advisor</a>, David Parnas, has two: Alan Perlis and Everard Williams. From Perlis it is a straight shot back to Siméon Poisson, whose 1800 dissertation was co-advised by Joseph Lagrange and Pierre Laplace. For Lagrange there is a strange <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=17864">note</a> of Leonhard Euler as a virtual advisor, but the real one is Giovanni Beccaria—who has no listed parent. Going through Laplace also dead-ends. But selecting Euler includes a chain that ends in the 1100s with Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharaf_al-Din_al-Tusi#Mathematics">improved</a> the complexity of approximately solving cubic equations.</p>
<p>
I appear not to have any female ancestors in my doctoral genealogy. I have two female PhD graduates, one of whom is a <em>Doktormutter</em>. Ken’s first female doctoral student, co-advised, had a successful thesis defense last week; he has another nearing the ABD stage. But I have known quite a few other “doctor mothers” personally. Today, Ken and I thought to recognize them.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Doctor Moms I Know </h2><p/>

Here are some that I have had the honor to know. They are in a certain order—do you see what it is? I give only the surname on purpose—click the second name and note its URL for a singular reflection of this.</p>

The last gives us an all-female tree, not just one branch, of people we know. Besides Anna Gilbert, another of Ingrid Daubechies’s students, who herself has <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=92059">advisees</a>, is Cynthia Rudin of Duke, whom Ken knew and taught while she was an undergraduate at Buffalo.</p>
<p>
There are others I could mention who went into research labs where there are different relationships besides PhD advising. They include Irene Greif, Tal Rabin, Lynn Conway, and Jean Sammet. I could include Jamie Morgenstern, whom we recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/10/making-algorithms-fair/">featured</a> and who his <a href="https://jamiemorgenstern.com/">advising</a> her first students at the University of Washington—do they have to be “born” yet to count you as a <em>Doktormutter</em>? I’ve left others out—apologies for that—but the ones I’ve listed make a nice <img alt="{4 \times 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> collage:</p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> My Upbringing </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Of these, the one with the most formative impact on me was Helena Rasiowa. I learned advanced logic from her when I was an undergraduate. </p>
<p>
Here is a tribute to <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/fitting/bookspapers/pdf/papers/Rasiowa.pdf">her</a> by Melvin Fitting: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I once heard Dana Scott criticize her <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Metamathematics-Helena-SIKORSKI-RASIOWA/dp/B005JGKZXW">book</a>, <em>The Mathematics of Metamathematics</em> with Roman Sikorski, because, while it took an algebraic approach to logic, it did not carry the work further and consider set theory. If it had, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)">forcing</a> would have been discovered years earlier than it was. This is not, at heart, a criticism, but a tribute. The building of mathematics always goes on. Foundations, firmly laid, enable later construction, and the foundations laid by that book were powerfully firm. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken also points to logic as a formative influence—though from men at Oxford.  Both of us were attracted to Gödel-type undecidability issues in complexity theory in the early 1980s.  The nexus of logic and algebra has been important to us in different ways, Ken more with finite automata and descriptive complexity.  Courses in logic gave both of us a habit of framing problems along formal lines.</p>
