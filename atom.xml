    <summary>Prediction algorithms assign numbers to individuals that are popularly understood as individual ``probabilities''---what is the probability of 5-year survival after cancer diagnosis?---and which increasingly form the basis for life-altering decisions. Drawing on an understanding of computational indistinguishability developed in complexity theory and cryptography, we introduce Outcome Indistinguishability. Predictors that are Outcome Indistinguishable yield a generative model for outcomes that cannot be efficiently refuted on the basis of the real-life observations produced by Nature.

We investigate a hierarchy of Outcome Indistinguishability definitions, whose stringency increases with the degree to which distinguishers may access the predictor in question. Our findings reveal that Outcome Indistinguishability behaves qualitatively differently than previously studied notions of indistinguishability. First, we provide constructions at all levels of the hierarchy. Then, leveraging recently-developed machinery for proving average-case fine-grained hardness, we obtain lower bounds on the complexity of the more stringent forms of Outcome Indistinguishability. This hardness result provides the first scientific grounds for the political argument that, when inspecting algorithmic risk prediction instruments, auditors should be granted oracle access to the algorithm, not simply historical predictions.</summary>

<p>A few things:</p>



<ol><li>Friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~minilek/">Jelani Nelson</a> asked me to advertise an important <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeubLuaICwNvHfHto7nBDw_gwkrqKdo-_Fjyz7XZONJ0tJRoA/viewform">questionnaire for theoretical computer scientists</a>, about what the future of STOC and FOCS should look like (for example, should they become all virtual?).  It only takes 2 or 3 minutes to fill out (I just did).<br/></li><li>Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy5fvwdw8x4">podcast</a> that I recently did with UT Austin undergraduate Dwarkesh Patel.  (As usual, I recommend 2x speed to compensate for my verbal tics.)<br/></li><li>Feel free to use the comments on this post to talk about recent progress in quantum computing or computational complexity!  Like, I dunno, a <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09495.pdf">(sub)exponential black-box speedup for the adiabatic algorithm</a>, or <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12277.pdf">anti-concentration for log-depth random quantum circuits</a>, or an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10908.pdf">improved shadow tomography procedure</a>, or a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03185.pdf">quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations</a>, or a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09093">barrier to proving strong 3-party parallel repetition</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11514.pdf">equivalence of one-way functions and time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10837">turning any hard-on-average NP problem into one that’s guaranteed to have solutions</a>.<br/></li><li>It’s funny how quantum computing, P vs. NP, and so forth can come to feel like just an utterly mundane day job, not something anyone outside a small circle could possibly want to talk about while the fate of civilization hangs in the balance.  Sometimes it takes my readers to remind me that not only are these topics what brought most of you here in the first place, they’re also awesome!  So, I’ll mark that down as one more thing to be thankful for.</li></ol>

<p/>



<p>A task force has been convened by CATCS to investigate possible<br/>approaches to modifying aspects of the TCS community, especially our<br/>publishing culture, to enhance connections with other areas of CS and<br/>be as welcoming as possible to a broad range of contributions within<br/>theory. This committee will collect and synthesize feedback from the<br/>community via the questionnaire on <a href="https://tinyurl.com/tcs-connections" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/tcs-connections</a> then make suggestions. <br/><br/>Since adjusting conference formats may help with this, we would like to get<br/>a general idea of community opinion on format choices. If you have<br/>some opinions you would like to share, please use this form. Though<br/>the questions below focus primarily on FOCS/STOC, we are welcome to<br/>receiving any and all suggestions that would make the TCS community as<br/>broad and well-connected to other areas of TCS as possible (see the<br/>last question of the survey).</p>



<p>Task force members:<br/>Ken Clarkson (IBM Research)<br/>Sandy Irani (UC Irvine)<br/>Bobby Kleinberg (Cornell)<br/>Adam Klivans (UT Austin)<br/>Ravi Kumar (Google)<br/>Jelani Nelson (UC Berkeley)<br/>Yuval Rabani (Hebrew University)</p></div>

<p>On November, 2020  we had a very nice open problem session in our weekly combinatorics seminar at HUJI.  So I thought to have a series of posts to describe you the problems presented there.  This is the first post in the series. Later I will add a link to the zoom recording of the session, and to a writeup of all the problems.</p>
<p>While talking on open problems let me mention that in connection with the <a href="http://umn.edu/~shopkins/OPAC">OPAC 2020 conference</a> (now delayed to May 2021),  a <a href="https://realopacblog.wordpress.com/">community blog</a> to discuss open problems in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>algebraic combinatorics</strong></span> was created. Everybody is invited to check out the problems posted there, to subscribe, and to contribute their own problems. And, of course, to solve the problems! The list of problems so far is impressive.</p>
<h2>Nati’s problem</h2>
<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Given a 2-manifold <img alt="M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="M"/> what is the the number of 2-faces for a 2-dimensional simplicial complex S on n vertices that guarantee that S contains a triangulation of M?</p>
<p>The case that <img alt="M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="M"/> is a triangulation of a two dimensional sphere goes back to a theorem of Brown, Erdos and Sos. They proved that the answer is <img alt="Cn^{5/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Cn%5E%7B5%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="Cn^{5/2}"/>. Nati proved that the lower bound applies for every 2-manifold <img alt="M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="M"/>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> Given a k-complex S, how many facets can a  k-complex on n vertices have if it contains no topological copy of S? (Topological copy = homeomorphic image)</p>
<p>Nati mentioned some further background and <strong>recent progress</strong> regarding these problems and I will mention them in a separate post.</p>
<h2>“High dimensional combinatorics”</h2>
<p>Problems 1 and 2 are parts of “Linial’s programme” of studying systematically “high dimensional combinatorics”.  Here are links to a few papers, slides of talks and videotaped talks. Among the highlights of this theory are the study, starting with a paper by Linial and Roy Meshulam of the Erdos-Renyi model for simplicial complexes (which is closely related to high dimensional expanders), the study of high dimensional permutations, and high dimensional tournaments.</p>

variables $v_1,\dots, v_n$ such that each constraint depends on at most $k$
variables and such that each variable assumes values in an alphabet of size at
most $[q]$. Suppose that each constraint shares variables with at most $\Delta$
constraints and that each constraint is violated with probability at most $p$
(under the product measure on its variables). We show that for $k, q = O(1)$,
there is a deterministic, polynomial time algorithm to approximately count the
number of satisfying assignments and a randomized, polynomial time algorithm to
sample from approximately the uniform distribution on satisfying assignments,
provided that \[C\cdot q^{3}\cdot k \cdot p \cdot \Delta^{7} &lt; 1, \quad
\text{where }C \text{ is an absolute constant.}\] Previously, a result of this
form was known essentially only in the special case when each constraint is
violated by exactly one assignment to its variables.

<p>For the special case of $k$-CNF formulas, the term $\Delta^{7}$ improves the
previously best known $\Delta^{60}$ for deterministic algorithms [Moitra,
J.ACM, 2019] and $\Delta^{13}$ for randomized algorithms [Feng et al., arXiv,
2020]. For the special case of properly $q$-coloring $k$-uniform hypergraphs,
the term $\Delta^{7}$ improves the previously best known $\Delta^{14}$ for
deterministic algorithms [Guo et al., SICOMP, 2019] and $\Delta^{9}$ for
randomized algorithms [Feng et al., arXiv, 2020].

min-sum clustering with or without outliers. The algorithm is allowed to
exclude an arbitrarily small constant fraction of the points. For instance, we
show how to compute a solution that clusters 98\% of the input data points and
pays no more than a constant factor times the optimal solution that clusters
99\% of the input data points. More generally, we give the following bicriteria
approximation: For any $\eps &gt; 0$, for any instance with $n$ input points and
for any positive integer $n'\le n$, we compute in polynomial time a clustering
of at least $(1-\eps) n'$ points of cost at most a constant factor greater than
the optimal cost of clustering $n'$ points. The approximation guarantee grows
with $\frac{1}{\eps}$. Our results apply to instances of points in real space
endowed with squared Euclidean distance, as well as to points in a metric
space, where the number of clusters, and also the dimension if relevant, is
arbitrary (part of the input, not an absolute constant).

framework and give experimental results. Our algorithms run in $O(km)$ time,
where $k$ is the number of paths and $m$ is the number of edges of the graph,
and provide better upper bounds than the original path based framework: e.g.,
the height of the resulting drawings is equal to the length of the longest path
of $G$, instead of $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Additionally, we
extend this framework, by bundling and drawing all the edges of the DAG in $O(m
+ n \log n)$ time, using minimum extra width per path. We also provide some
comparison to a well known hierarchical drawing framework, widely known as the
Sugiyama framework, as a proof of concept. The experimental results show that
our algorithms produce drawings that are better in area and number of bends,
but worse for crossings in sparse graphs. Hence, our technique offers an
interesting alternative for drawing hierarchical graphs. Finally, we present an
$O(m + k \log k)$ time algorithm that computes a specific order of the paths in
order to reduce the total edge length and number of crossings and bends.

    <title>Applying the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz to the Graph Matching Problem</title>

attention due to its ability to solve discrete optimization problems on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices in a manner that is amenable to
derivation of worst-case guarantees. We design a technique in this framework to
tackle a few problems over maximal matchings in graphs. Even though maximum
matching is polynomial-time solvable, most counting and sampling versions are
#P-hard.
</p>
<p>We design a few algorithms that generates superpositions over matchings
allowing us to sample from them. In particular, we get a superposition over all
possible matchings when given the empty state as input and a superposition over
all maximal matchings when given the W -states as input.
</p>
<p>Our main result is that the expected size of the matchings corresponding to
the output states of our QAOA+ algorithm when ran on a 2-regular graph is
greater than the expected matching size obtained from a uniform distribution
over all matchings. This algorithm uses a W -state as input and we prove that
this input state is better compared to using the empty matching as the input
state.

problem under Gaussian images distribution. They show that it suffices to use
$O(n_{\mathsf{priv}}^{k_{\mathsf{priv}} - 2/(k_{\mathsf{priv}} + 1)})$ samples

<p>Under the current setup for the InstaHide challenge of mixing two private

    <title>Selectable Heaps and Optimal Lazy Search Trees</title>

queues can be generalized to the extraction of the $k$ smallest elements in
$O(k \log(n/k))$ time, where we define $\log(x)$ as $\max(\log_2(x), 1)$. We
first show heap-ordered tree selection (Kaplan et al., SOSA '19) can be applied
on the heap-ordered trees of the classic Fibonacci heap to support the
extraction in $O(k \log(n/k))$ amortized time. We then show selection is
possible in a priority queue with optimal worst-case guarantees by applying
heap-ordered tree selection on Brodal queues (SODA '96), supporting the
operation in $O(k \log(n/k))$ worst-case time. Via a reduction from the
multiple selection problem, $\Omega(k \log(n/k))$ time is necessary if
insertion is supported in $o(\log n)$ time.
</p>
<p>We then apply the result to lazy search trees (Sandlund &amp; Wild, FOCS '20),
creating a new interval data structure based on selectable heaps. This gives
optimal $O(B+n)$ time lazy search tree performance, lowering insertion
complexity into a gap $\Delta_i$ to $O(\log(n/|\Delta_i|))$ time. An $O(1)$
time merge operation is also made possible when used as a priority queue, among
other situations. If Brodal queues are used, runtimes of the lazy search tree
can be made worst-case in the general case of two-sided gaps. The presented
data structure makes fundamental use of soft heaps (Chazelle, J. ACM '00),
biased search trees, and efficient priority queues, approaching the
theoretically-best data structure for ordered data.

when the expression (1) is unconstrained; (2) has a specified pattern of
parentheses and operators (and only the numbers need to be assigned to blanks);

a "rational function framework" which proves equivalence of these problems for

predictions that go beyond worst-case bounds on the algorithm performance. By
refining existing models, our model ensures predictions are formally learnable
and instance robust. Learnability guarantees that predictions can be
efficiently constructed from past data. Instance robustness formally ensures a
prediction is robust to modest changes in the problem input. Further, the
robustness model ensures two different predictions can be objectively compared,
addressing a shortcoming in prior models. This paper establishes the existence
of predictions which satisfy these properties. The paper considers online
algorithms with predictions for a network flow allocation problem and the
restricted assignment makespan minimization problem. For both problems, three
key properties are established: existence of useful predictions that give near
optimal solutions, robustness of these predictions to errors that smoothly
degrade as the underlying problem instance changes, and we prove high quality
predictions can be learned from a small sample of prior instances.

    <title>An Estimator for Matching Size in Low Arboricity Graphs with Two Applications</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1606262400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jowhari:Hossein.html">Hossein Jowhari</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11706">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, we present a new simple degree-based estimator for the size of
maximum matching in bounded arboricity graphs. When the arboricity of the graph
is bounded by $\alpha$, the estimator gives a $\alpha+2$ factor approximation
of the matching size. For planar graphs, we show the estimator does better and
returns a $3.5$ approximation of the matching size.
</p>
<p>Using this estimator, we get new results for approximating the matching size
of planar graphs in the streaming and distributed models of computation. In
particular, in the vertex-arrival streams, we get a randomized
$O(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\eps^2}\log n)$ space algorithm for approximating the
matching size within $(3.5+\eps)$ factor in a planar graph on $n$ vertices.
Similarly, we get a simultaneous protocol in the vertex-partition model for
approximating the matching size within $(3.5+\eps)$ factor using
$O(\frac{n^{2/3}}{\eps^2}\log n)$ communication from each player.
</p>
<p>In comparison with the previous estimators, the estimator in this paper does
not need to know the arboricity of the input graph and improves the
approximation factor for the case of planar graphs.

    <title>Computing Feasible Trajectories for an Articulated Probe in Three Dimensions</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1606262400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Daescu:Ovidiu.html">Ovidiu Daescu</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Teo:Ka_Yaw.html">Ka Yaw Teo</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11685">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Consider an input consisting of a set of $n$ disjoint triangular obstacles in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ and a target point $t$ in the free space, all enclosed by a
large sphere $S$ of radius $R$ centered at $t$. An articulated probe is modeled
as two line segments $ab$ and $bc$ connected at point $b$. The length of $ab$
can be equal to or greater than $R$, while $bc$ is of a given length $r \leq
R$. The probe is initially located outside $S$, assuming an unarticulated
configuration, in which $ab$ and $bc$ are collinear and $b \in ac$. The goal is
to find a feasible (obstacle-avoiding) probe trajectory to reach $t$, with the
condition that the probe is constrained by the following sequence of moves -- a
straight-line insertion of the unarticulated probe into $S$, possibly followed
by a rotation of $bc$ at $b$ for at most $\pi/2$ radians, so that $c$ coincides
with $t$.
</p>
<p>We prove that if there exists a feasible probe trajectory, then a set of
extremal feasible trajectories must be present. Through careful case analysis,
we show that these extremal trajectories can be represented by $O(n^4)$
combinatorial events. We present a solution approach that enumerates and
verifies these combinatorial events for feasibility in overall
$O(n^{4+\epsilon})$ time using $O(n^{4+\epsilon})$ space, for any constant
$\epsilon &gt; 0$. The enumeration algorithm is highly parallel, considering that
each combinatorial event can be generated and verified for feasibility
independently of the others. In the process of deriving our solution, we design
the first data structure for addressing a special instance of circular sector
emptiness queries among polyhedral obstacles in three dimensional space, and
provide a simplified data structure for the corresponding emptiness query
problem in two dimensions.

    <title>Characterization and Computation of Feasible Trajectories for an Articulated Probe with a Variable-Length End Segment</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Daescu:Ovidiu.html">Ovidiu Daescu</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Teo:Ka_Yaw.html">Ka Yaw Teo</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11672">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>An articulated probe is modeled in the plane as two line segments, $ab$ and
$bc$, joined at $b$, with $ab$ being very long, and $bc$ of some small length
$r$. We investigate a trajectory planning problem involving the articulated
two-segment probe where the length $r$ of $bc$ can be customized. Consider a
set $P$ of simple polygonal obstacles with a total of $n$ vertices, a target
point $t$ located in the free space such that $t$ cannot see to infinity, and a
circle $S$ centered at $t$ enclosing $P$. The probe initially resides outside
$S$, with $ab$ and $bc$ being collinear, and is restricted to the following
sequence of moves: a straight line insertion of $abc$ into $S$ followed by a
rotation of $bc$ around $b$. The goal is to compute a feasible
obstacle-avoiding trajectory for the probe so that, after the sequence of
moves, $c$ coincides with $t$.
</p>
<p>We prove that, for $n$ line segment obstacles, the smallest length $r$ for
which there exists a feasible probe trajectory can be found in
$O(n^{2+\epsilon})$ time using $O(n^{2+\epsilon})$ space, for any constant
$\epsilon &gt; 0$. Furthermore, we prove that all values $r$ for which a feasible
probe trajectory exists form $O(n^2)$ intervals, and can be computed in
$O(n^{5/2})$ time using $O(n^{2+\epsilon})$ space. We also show that, for a
given $r$, the feasible trajectory space of the articulated probe can be
characterized by a simple arrangement of complexity $O(n^2)$, which can be
constructed in $O(n^2)$ time. To obtain our solutions, we design efficient data
structures for a number of interesting variants of geometric intersection and
emptiness query problems.

    <title>Recognizing Proper Tree-Graphs</title>

Hartmann</a>, Dušan Knop <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11670">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We investigate the parameterized complexity of the recognition problem for
the proper $H$-graphs. The $H$-graphs are the intersection graphs of connected
subgraphs of a subdivision of a multigraph $H$, and the properness means that
the containment relationship between the representations of the vertices is
forbidden. The class of $H$-graphs was introduced as a natural (parameterized)
generalization of interval and circular-arc graphs by Bir\'o, Hujter, and Tuza
in 1992, and the proper $H$-graphs were introduced by Chaplick et al. in WADS
2019 as a generalization of proper interval and circular-arc graphs. For these
graph classes, $H$ may be seen as a structural parameter reflecting the
distance of a graph to a (proper) interval graph, and as such gained attention
as a structural parameter in the design of efficient algorithms. We show the
following results.
</p>
<p>- For a tree $T$ with $t$ nodes, it can be decided in $ 2^{\mathcal{O}(t^2
\log t)} \cdot n^3 $ time, whether an $n$-vertex graph $ G $ is a proper $ T
$-graph. For yes-instances, our algorithm outputs a proper $T$-representation.
This proves that the recognition problem for proper $H$-graphs, where $H$
required to be a tree, is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the
size of $T$. Previously only NP-completeness was known.
</p>
<p>- Contrasting to the first result, we prove that if $H$ is not constrained to
be a tree, then the recognition problem becomes much harder. Namely, we show
that there is a multigraph $H$ with 4 vertices and 5 edges such that it is
NP-complete to decide whether $G$ is a proper $H$-graph.

We are encouraged to “teach the debate” and that if only paid attention, we will see that their Tweet, declaration, or arxiv paper contains an irrefutable proof of their assertions.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/26/ted-cruz-invokes-galileo-to-defend-his-climate-skepticism-and-historians-arent-happy/">words of Ted Cruz</a>, <em>“They brand you a heretic. Today, the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers. It used to be [that] it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier”</em>. </p>



<p>Of course by Galileo’s time it was well known that the earth was spherical, and Magellan circumnavigated the earth more than 40 years before Galileo was born. But putting aside Cruz’s confusion of flat earth and geocentrism, the story of heliocentric theory is not one  of an outsider railing against the scientific mainstream. Galileo himself was a chaired professor of mathematics at the University of Padua, and later philosopher and mathematician to the grand duke of Tuscany. He was very much part of the scientific establishment of his time. Moreover, though Galileo did provide important evidence for heliocentrism, he was not the only one doing so. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/galileo-kepler-iya/">Kepler</a> found a heliocentric model with elliptical orbits that actually made correct predictions, and, though it took a decade or so, Kepler’s book eventually became the standard textbook for astronomy.</p>



<p>My point in this post is not to rehash the history of heliocentrism or Galileo but rather to call out a misconception which, to use Sean Carrol’s phrasing, amounts to valorization of puzzle-solving over wisdom.</p>

<p>It is tempting to think that an argument, regardless whether it comes from an expert or a random person on Twitter, can be presented in a self-contained way and judged on its merits. However, this is not how things work in any interesting setting. Even in the case of a purported P vs NP proof, there is background knowledge on computational complexity without which it would be hard to spot holes in the argument. This is doubly so for any claim involving empirical facts, whether it’s about elections, infections, climate etc. It is not possible to evaluate such claims without context, and to get this context you need to turn to the experts that have studied the topic.</p>



<p>I have written before in <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/04/04/in-defense-of-expertise/">defense of expertise</a> (see also <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/04/09/experts-shmexperts/">here</a>) but Carroll puts it very well. Another way to say it is that the operational interpretation of the common refrain</p>



<p><em>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence </em></p>



<p>is</p>



<p><em>Treat claims conforming to conventional wisdom with charity, and claims disputing it with skepticism.</em></p>



<p>(There is a question of how to define “conventional wisdom” but interestingly there is usually agreement in practice by both sides. Most “deniers” of various sorts are proud of going against conventional wisdom, but don’t acknowledge that this means they are more likely to be wrong.)</p>



<p>As an example, even if someone has expertise in analytic number theory, and so presumably has plenty of so-called “puzzle-solving intelligence”, that doesn’t mean that they can evaluate <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/11/22/williams-math-professor-investigating-voter-fraud-in-pennsylvania-finds-no-evidence/">a statistical claim</a> on election fraud and their analysis should be considered <a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/elections/federal-election-commission-chairman-trump-campaign-bringing-legitimate">evidence</a> (apparently at this point the number theorist himself  <a href="https://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/local/williams-prof-disavows-own-finding-of-mishandled-gop-ballots/article_9cfd4228-2e03-11eb-b2ac-bb9c8b2bfa7f.html">agrees</a>). We can try to read and debunk what they wrote, or we can assume that if there was evidence for large-scale fraud, then the president of the United States and his well-funded campaign would have managed to find actual statisticians and experts on election to make the case.</p>



<p>There can be debate if Trump’s attempt to overthrow the election should be considered as dangerous or merely absurd, but the constant attacks on the very notions of truth, science, and expertise are causing far-reaching harm. </p>

<p/>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> we are organizing a new mentorship program for women in machine learning. Please consider applying as a mentor, mentee, or both at <a href="https://www.wiml-t.org/mentoring-program">https://www.wiml-t.org/mentoring-program</a>. </p>



<h1>What is WIML-T?</h1>



<p><a href="https://wimlworkshop.org/">Women in machine learning </a>(or WiML for short) was established more than ten years ago, and its main goals are to <strong>1.</strong> Increase the number of women in machine learning <strong>2.</strong> Help women in machine learning succeed professionally <strong>3. </strong>Increase the impact of women in machine learning in the community. Towards this goal, they create different opportunities for women to showcase their work. Chief among them is the annual Women in Machine Learning (WiML) Workshop, typically co-located with NeurIPS, which presents women’s cutting-edge research. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.wiml-t.org/home">Women in machine learning theory</a> (or WiML-T for short) shares the same goals as WiML but focuses on the smaller learning theory community. The vision of WiML-T is to give visibility and legitimacy to under-represented groups in learning theory, to create stronger bonds within the community and beyond, and to provide support and advice. As part of this vision, we have decided to facilitate a mentoring program that will connect women and non-binary researchers who are newer to learning theory with more experienced mentors.  </p>



<h1>Why mentorship?</h1>



<p>Mentoring programs have been shown to greatly help underrepresented communities develop [1]. More resources on mentoring can be found on the website of Stanford’s Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab and on <a href="http://www.wiml-t.org">our website</a>. Mentoring creates strong bonds of trust within the community, it helps mentees find career advice and connections, and it helps mentors grow their leadership skills while keeping in touch with the newcomers of the community.  We hope that creating a world-wide program will also help reduce inequality between less privileged areas and the most famous institutions. Indeed, it is a well-known fact that the more competitive a career path, the less diverse it is, due in part to network effects from which under-represented groups are excluded. We believe that uniting individuals from these groups (i.e. women, non-binary people, persons of color and other minorities) will help reduce these effects and contribute to finding solutions to the community’s problems. </p>



<p><strong>Why be a mentor?  </strong></p>



<p>Remember the beginning of your research journey, with all the difficulties, uncertainties, and unanswered questions? This is your chance to give all the advice you wish you got, and make an impact on a future colleague. As a mentor you will be a role model and help the young generation of researchers in learning theory. You will help them develop and enhance their careers by giving them the support they need. Need more reasons to mentor? It will grow your leadership skills, self-confidence, communication skills, and you will feel happier after you help others. </p>



<p><strong>Who can be a mentor?</strong> </p>



<p>Nearly everyone who has some experience in academia or industry can be a mentor. It can be interesting for an undergrad student to receive advice from senior PhD students or postdocs who have recently had to reflect about career decisions and can share knowledge about their work environment. We indeed expect the most senior researchers to apply as mentors, but we would also like to encourage PhDs and postdocs to consider mentoring (while possibly having a mentor as well!).    </p>



<p><strong>Can men mentor? </strong></p>



<p>We thank everyone who wants to help the community!  </p>



<p>We will prioritize women mentors as they can give their unique perspective, BUT, we acknowledge that there might be a limited number of mentors. To mitigate this issue, we will be happy to pair male mentors provided the mentee agrees.</p>



<p><strong>Why be a mentee?</strong>   </p>



<p>Having a mentor is one of the best ways to get external career advice, to get some feedback from someone with a possibly similar background. Managing to find one’s way into academia or science is not easy. It can be even harder for under-represented groups who may lack role models within their institution, or who may not connect with common advice that implicitly assumes or relies on some class privilege. Having a mentor can help you navigate professional and personal issues that men may not always have. It is also a way to get connected to other members of the community, or have second opinions on research strategies.   </p>



<h1>Timeline</h1>



<ul><li>The program launched on October 29 2020 and will run on a continuous basis.</li><li>We will start with pairings of mentors and mentees in December 2020. This process can take a few months.  </li><li>Frequency of the meetings: totally depends on the mentor and mentee.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on <strong>Friday, Dec 04</strong>th at <strong>10:00 AM Pacific Time</strong> (13:00 Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC, 23:30 Indian Time).  <strong>Adam Smith</strong> from <strong>Boston University</strong> will speak about “<strong>When is Memorization of Irrelevant Training Data Necessary for High-Accuracy Learning?</strong>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Modern machine learning models are complex, and frequently encode surprising amounts of information about individual inputs. In extreme cases, complex models appear to memorize entire input examples, including seemingly irrelevant information (social security numbers from text, for example). In this paper, we aim to understand whether this sort of memorization is necessary for accurate learning. We describe natural prediction problems in which every sufficiently accurate training algorithm must encode, in the prediction model, essentially all the information about a large subset of its training examples. This remains true even when the examples are high-dimensional and have entropy much higher than the sample size, and even when most of that information is ultimately irrelevant to the task at hand. Further, our results do not depend on the training algorithm or the class of models used for learning.</p>



<p>Our problems are simple and fairly natural variants of the next-symbol prediction and the cluster labeling tasks. These tasks can be seen as abstractions of image- and text-related prediction problems. To establish our results, we reduce from a family of one-way communication problems for which we prove new information complexity lower bounds.</p>

    <title>TR20-175 |  Fourier conjectures, correlation bounds, and Majority | 

	Emanuele Viola</title>
    <summary>Recently several conjectures were made regarding the Fourier spectrum of low-degree polynomials. We show that these conjectures imply new correlation bounds for functions related to Majority. Then we prove several new results on correlation bounds which aim to, but don't, resolve the conjectures. In particular, we prove several new results on Majority which are of independent interest and complement Smolensky's classic result.</summary>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">For the past month, I’ve been reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to my 7-year-old daughter Lily. Is she too young for it?

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>For the past month, I’ve been reading <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> to my 7-year-old daughter Lily.  Is she too young for it?  Is there a danger that she’ll slip up and say the n-word in school?  I guess so, maybe.  But I found it worthwhile just for the understanding that lit up her face when she realized what it meant that Huck would help Jim escape slavery even though Huck really, genuinely believed that he’d burn in hell for it.</p>



<p><em>Huck Finn</em> has been one of my favorite books since I was just slightly older than Lily.  It’s the greatest statement by one of history’s greatest writers about human stupidity and gullibility and evil and greed, but also about the power of seeing what’s right in front of your nose to counteract those forces.  (It’s also a go-to source for details of 19<sup>th</sup>-century river navigation.)  It rocks.</p>



<p>The other day, after we finished a chapter, I asked Lily whether she thought that injustice against Black people in America ended with the abolition of slavery.  No, she replied.  I asked: how much longer did it continue for?  She said she didn’t know.  So I said: if I told you that once, people in charge of an American election tried to throw away millions of votes that came from places where Black people lived—supposedly because some numbers didn’t exactly add up, except they didn’t care about similar numbers not adding up in places where White people lived—how long ago would she guess that happened?  100 years ago?  50 years?  She didn’t know.  So I showed her the news from the last hour.</p>



<p>These past few weeks, my comment queue has filled with missives, most of which I’ve declined to publish, about the giant conspiracy involving George Soros and Venezuela and dead people, which fabricated the overwhelmingly Democratic votes from overwhelmingly Democratic cities like Philadelphia and Milwaukee and Detroit (though for some reason, they weren’t <em>quite</em> as overwhelmingly Democratic as in other recent elections), while for some reason declining to help Democrats in downballot races.  Always, these commenters confidently insist, <em>I’m</em> the Pravda-reading brainwashed dupe, <em>I’m</em> the unreasonable one, if I don’t accept this.</p>



<p>This is the literal meaning of “gaslighting”: the intentional construction of an alternate reality so insistently as to make the sane doubt their sanity.  It occurred to me: <em>Huck Finn</em> could be read as an extended fable about gaslighting.  The Grangerfords make their deadly feud with the Shepherdsons seem normal and natural.  The fraudulent King and Duke make Huck salute them as royalty.  Tom convinces Huck that the former’s harebrained schemes for freeing Jim are just the way it’s done, and Huck is an idiot for preferring the simplistic approach of just freeing him.  And of course, the entire culture gaslights Huck that good is evil and evil is good.  Huck doesn’t fight the gaslighting as hard as we’d like him to, but he develops as a character to the extent he does.</p>



<p>Today, the Confederacy—which, as we’ve learned the past five years, never died, and is as alive and angry now as it was in Twain’s time—is trying to win by gaslighting what it couldn’t win at Antietam and Gettysburg and Vicksburg.  It’s betting that if it just insists, adamantly enough, that someone who lost an election by hundreds of thousands of votes spread across multiple states actually won the election, then it can bend the universe to its will.</p>



<p>Glued to the news, listening to Giuliani and McEnany and so on, reading the Trump campaign’s legal briefs, I keep asking myself one question: <em>do they actually believe this shit?</em>  Some of the only insight I got about that question came from a <a href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/reflections-on-the-late-election">long piece</a> by Curtis Yarvin a.k.a. Mencius Moldbug, who’s been called one of the leading thinkers of neoreaction and who sometimes responds to this blog.  Esoterically, Yarvin says that he actually <em>prefers</em> a Biden victory, but only because Trump has proven himself unworthy by submitting himself to nerdy electoral rules rather than simply seizing power.  (If that’s not <em>quite</em> what Yarvin meant—well, I’m about as competent to render his irony-soaked meanings in plain language as I’d be to render Heidegger or Judith Butler!)</p>



<p>As for whether the election was “fraudulent,” here’s Yarvin’s key passage:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The fundamental purpose of a democratic election is to test the strength of the sides in a civil conflict, without anyone actually getting hurt. The majority wins because the strongest side would win … But this guess is much better if it actually measures humans who are both willing and able to walk down the street and show up. Anyone who cannot show up at the booth is unlikely to show up for the civil war. This is one of many reasons that an in-person election is a more <em>accurate</em> election. (If voters could be qualified by <em>physique</em>, it would be even more accurate) … My sense is that in many urban communities, voting by proxy in some sense is the norm. The people whose names are on the ballots really exist; and almost all of them actually did support China Joe. Or at least, preferred him. The extent to which they perform any tangible political action, including physically going to the booth, is very low; so is their engagement with the political system. They do not watch much CNN. The demand for records of their engagement is very high, because each such datum cancels out some huge, heavily-armed redneck with a bass boat. This is why, in the data, these cities look politics-obsessed, but photos of the polling places look empty. Most votes from these communities are in some sense “organized” … Whether or not such a design constitutes “fraud” is the judge’s <em>de gustibus</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Did you catch that?  Somehow, Yarvin manages to insinuate that votes for Biden are plausibly fraudulent and plausibly shouldn’t count—at least <em>if</em> they were cast by mail, in “many urban communities” (which ones?), during a pandemic—even as Yarvin glaincingly acknowledges that the votes in question actually exist and are actually associated with Biden-preferring legal voters.  This is gaslighting in pure, abstract form, unalloyed with the laughable claims about Hugo Chávez or Dominion Voting Systems.</p>



<p>What I find terrifying about gaslighting is that it’s so <em>effective</em>.  In response to this post, I’ll again get long, erudite comments making the case that up is down, turkeys are mammals, and Trump won in a landslide.  And simply to <em>read</em> and <em>understand</em> those comments, some part of me will need to entertain the idea that they might be right.  Much like with Bigfoot theories, this will be purely a function of the effort the writers put in, not of any merit to the thesis.</p>



<p>And there’s a second thing I find terrifying about gaslighting.  Namely:<strong> it turns me into an ally of the SneerClubbers.</strong>  Like them, I feel barely any space left for rational discussion or argument.  Like them, I find it difficult to think of an appropriate response to Trumpian conspiracy theorists except to ridicule them, shame them as racists, and try to mute their influence.  Notably, public shaming (“[t]he Trump stain, the stain of racism that you, William Hartmann and Monica Palmer, have covered yourself in, is going to follow you throughout history”) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebGOe2zHbLc">seems to have actually worked last week</a> to get the Wayne County Board of Canvassers to back down and certify the votes from Detroit.  So why not try more of it?</p>



<p>Of course, even if I agree with the wokeists that there’s a line beyond which rational discussion can’t reach, I radically disagree with them about the line’s <em>whereabouts</em>.  Here, for example, I try to draw mine generously enough to include any Republicans willing to stand up, however feebly, against the Trump cult, whereas the wokeists draw their line so narrowly as to exclude most <em>Democrats</em> (!).</p>



<p>There’s a more fundamental difference as well: the wokeists define their worldview in opposition to the patriarchy, the white male power structure, or whatever else is preventing utopia.  I, taking inspiration from Huck, define my moral worldview in opposition to gaslighting itself, whatever its source, and in favor of acknowledging obvious realities (<em>especially</em> realities about any harm we might be causing others).  Thus, it’s not just that I see no tension between opposing the excesses of the woke and opposing Trump’s attempted <em>putsch</em>—rather, it’s that my opposition to both comes from exactly the same source.  It’s a source that, at least in me, often runs dry of courage, but I’ve found <em>Huck Finn</em> to be helpful in replenishing it, and for that I’m grateful.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Endnote:</span></strong> There are, of course, many <em>actual</em> security problems with the way we vote in the US, and there are computer scientists who’ve studied those problems for decades, rather than suddenly getting selectively interested in November 2020.  If you’re interested, see <a href="https://josephhall.org/papers/Experts-Statement-on-the-US-2020-General-Election-16NOV2020-1057.pdf">this letter</a> (“Scientists say no credible evidence of computer fraud in the 2020 election outcome, but policymakers must work with experts to improve confidence”), which was signed by 59 of the leading figures in computer security, including Ron Rivest, Bruce Schneier, Hovav Shacham, Dan Wallach, Ed Felten, David Dill, and my childhood best friend Alex Halderman.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> I just noticed <a href="https://twitter.com/seanmcarroll/status/1330573317627998208">this Twitter thread</a> by friend-of-the-blog Sean Carroll, which says a lot of what I was trying to say here.</p></div>

    <title>Fun with birthdays, inspired by Nov 20</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> On Nov 20, 2020  the Google Doodle was of Benoit Mandelbrot for his 96th birthday. Why have a Doodle on his 96th bday? Anyway, the Doodle is <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/benoit-mandelbrots-96th-birthday">here</a>.  </p><p>On Nov 20, 2020 I read that Joe Biden turned 78. Why no Google Doodle of him? Maybe when he's 96. </p><p>This got me thinking of who else might have a Nov 20 birthday. I found the following (`found' is not quite right as I will explain later).</p><p>In order of age. </p><p>Benoit Mandelbrot: Dead at 85, would have been 96</p><p>Bobby Kennedy: Dead at 43, would have been 95.</p><p>Sergei Novikov: 82 years old. (Won Fields Medal in 1970 and did work on Solitons)</p><p>Dick Smothers: 80 years old (Tommy Smothers is not his twin, Tommy  is 3 years older) </p><p>Joe Biden, 78 years old (in most crowds he would be an old-timer, but in this crowd he is the baby of the bunch- though there is a reason for that as you will see later)</p><p>There are more Nov 20 famous people (famous to someone- I have not heard of most of them) <a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/november20.html">here</a></p><p>Some thoughts on all of this trivia</p><p>1) I keep a list of famous (to me) people over 80 (though if I look someone up who is not quite 80 I may put him on the list anyway, as is the case for Biden and Trump) so if they die I won't be one of those people saying `<i>I thought they were already dead</i>'.  I then began putting people on it who were  already dead so I could find matching bdays. Hence it was easy to find Nov 20 birthdays of people over 80, and one under. </p><p>2) Mandelbrot is more famous than Novikov since Mandelbrot has those pretty pictures. This is not a criticism of his work. Is it possible to make people who do hard and abstract math more in the public eye? Probably not. </p><p>3) There is an awesome song about the Mandelbrot set (though some of the comments on the you tube video say its the Julia Set, but HEY- if they have math in a song, I am happy and don't get too fussy about how accurate it is- though I would understand if Julia fans are annoyed). The song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIlwFpz9s_I">here</a>. It has 464 likes and 41 dislikes. That always puzzled me- why does it have <i>any</i> dislikes? I've seen really awesome songs still have some dislikes. Well, as Rick Nelson sings in Garden Party (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAHR7_VZdRw">here</a>) ,<i>you</i> <i>can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself.</i> He got 25,000 likes and 702 dislikes. An awesome ratio, but why are there any dislikes? </p><p>4) I don't think Novikov will have a song about his work anytime soon.</p><p>5) Joe Biden has had some novelty songs about him in the past, and will do have more in the future once he is the Whitehouse.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This post is a follow-up on some somewhat off-hand comments that I made <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/">earlier</a> regarding the notion of truth in a “proof-based” discipline such as pure mathematics or theoretical computer science. Since the former is easier to circumscribe and also has a larger literature available on it, for the purposes of the post I will discuss my emerging take on truth in mathematics; what I say applies to TCS as well. (I wasn’t able to find satisfactory writings on the practice of computer science, even more broadly interpreted than just “theory”; any pointers on this are very welcome.) I obviously don’t claim any originality here; I suspect that to some the points I make might be interesting while to others they could feel passé–in the latter case, please help me make progress in the comments!</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/circle.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1273" height="272" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/circle.jpg?w=762" width="261"/></a>A <em>circle</em> is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the figure equal one another. (Euclid, Elements, Book I, Definition 15.)</figure></div>



<p>The question is more interesting than it may seem. First, let’s set aside the Platonician answer that mathematics is about proving statements that apply to abstract objects. None of this makes sense: there is no such thing as an abstract object (What is an “abstract circle?” Euclid’s <em>definition</em> of an abstract circle exists, but that definition has nothing abstract; it is plain English—or well, Greek, which is no better). Neither is there anything fundamentally “true” about the statements that mathematicians make about these objects. This last point is made clear in Voevodsky’s retelling of the story that brought him to start his research program on univalent foundations: see in particular the paragraph starting with “The primary challenge that needed to be addressed” <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2014/voevodsky-origins">here</a>. While a subset of mathematicians has been carefully examining the logical foundations of mathematics and pursuing a program of formalizing these foundations with the goal of automating verification, two facts are historically evident: (1) this formalization has always come <em>after</em> the fact, i.e. first the theorem is proven, and second only is there some attempt at modifying the format of the “proof” so as to reach some abstract “higher standard”; (2) what the higher standard exactly is is a moving target. In other words, mathematicians do whatever it is that they do <em>first</em>, and only <em>after</em> that does some subset of them look back on what has been done and make an attempt to reformulate it in a way that seems more “rigorous” by the standards of the day. And even once this process has been completed (or rather, iterated over a few times), no absolute truth has been obtained; merely, one has gained higher confidence that some set of formal rules can be applied in a certain order to derive one statement for another. In summary, the logical answer “I define as true any statement that can be derived by said rules starting from said axioms” will not satisfy us. (My point is not to criticize this enterprise; only to point that this is not what mathematics is about. I don’t expect any mathematician would disagree.)</p>



<p>Once this point has been cleared we have opened up the possibility for a much richer interpretation of what mathematics is about, what it is that mathematicians do, and what is so special about the role played by the notion of truth in this enterprise.</p>



<h2>The Greeks</h2>



<p>Mathematicians have been around since Greek antiquity. I highly recommend the wonderful book <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511543296">The Shaping of Deduction in Greek Mathematics</a> by Reviel Netz, a historian at Stanford. The book provides a fantastic historical introduction to the birth of modern mathematics, as practiced in the Western world. In this book Netz gives a detailed account of the practice of Greek mathematics that is based on a sometimes almost comical literal reading of the original texts. Netz is not a mathematician, and he takes the Greek writings at face value, without preconceptions as to any deeper meaning, mathematical or otherwise. To see how fantastic an enterprise this might be I highly recommend taking the time to read through a few paragraphs of Euclid’s elements, see e.g. <a href="https://www.claymath.org/library/historical/euclid/index.html">here</a>. (I wasn’t able to find an online version that has clear figures; Netz’ book contains many reproductions and he spends a great deal of time examining their significance as a companion to the text.) Wait, and they called this a <em>proof</em>? </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/phil-2017-0007_05.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1276" height="241" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/phil-2017-0007_05.jpg?w=1024" width="320"/></a>Netz places a particular emphasis on the role of lettered diagrams such as this one in Greek mathematicians’ proofs. This one is taken from Apollonius, as reproduced in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/phil-2017-0007">this book</a>.</figure></div>



<p>What I find most amazing about Netz’ work is that his book makes it absolutely clear that what Greek mathematics did is invent a very special world, with its own set of rules and specifications as to how things should be presented, what counts as valid and what does not, etc; most importantly this set of rules and specifications is absolutely <em>arbitrary</em>. There is nothing <em>universally</em> true about any of the statements made in Euclid’s book ; what there is however, and which is just as important, is a form of <em>self-consistent</em>, <em>self-perpetuating</em> consistency. This is the Greek mathematician’s most important discovery, and most enduring legacy: a system of thought, based on the use of formal rules, such that users of that system of thought can easily and unequivocally agree on the same statements. Netz contrasts this with the political discourse that the Greeks were so famously fond of; while in rhetoric endless arguments can be made in favor or against any given statement, in mathematics once an argument has been made there is no discussing it; either the argument is correct and accepted by all or it is flawed and all will agree on the presence of a flaw. By saying that mathematics does not establish universal truths we do not take away any of the strength of its evident success as a system of thought. </p>



<p>I insist that in the previous sentence by “mathematics” I mean “Greek mathematics.” There is nothing universal about the formal “proof system” used by the Greeks, and in fact that system is arguably quite different from the one used today (contrast a proof in Euclid’s Elements from one in e.g. Kerodon (see figure below); clearly either school would reject the other’s papers!). There is nothing absolutely perfect or even fool-proof about it either; when I write that “either the argument is correct or it is flawed” I do not dismiss the existence of a substantial grey zone in which there might be, and generally is, discussion. (Netz in his presentation makes it plainly obvious that Greek proofs had many “gaps” and that completely arbitrary choices are made as to what is valid and what is not.) The point is that this grey zone is by orders of magnitude smaller than in other disciplines, and this is what makes mathematics special.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/diagram.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1278" height="118" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/diagram.jpg?w=943" width="470"/></a>A lettered diagram taken from the proof of Lemma 3.5.3.11 in <a href="https://kerodon.net/">Kerodon</a>.</figure></div>



<p>Greek mathematics has its limitations. In particular, it seems like they were not able to expand their explorations much beyond geometry; possibly because they did not have a formal way of re-using proofs. Indeed, only propositions from Euclid’s elements were part of the general corpus of “truths” that could be used without justification; any other proof could only appeal to either a statement from the Elements or a statement proved within the same text (as opposed to a statement made by another mathematician). The current system has a much higher level of re-usability, allowing it to much deeper. It is possible that current attempt at formalization will provide yet another layer to this by enabling re-using statements without the mathematician herself even being cognizant of the statement that is being re-used (e.g. the proof assistant would figure out that there is some theorem somewhere that could be useful). </p>



<h2>The moderns</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/qkd.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1280" height="420" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/qkd.jpg?w=831" width="382"/></a>A lettered diagram taken from the proof of security of quantum key distribution in Renner’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0512258">Ph.D. thesis</a>.</figure></div>



<p>Once one has taken this somewhat distanced look at the practice of Greek mathematicians it becomes clear that there is no reason for contemporary practice to escape similar distanciation. As arbitrary as the rules that govern the former might seem now, just as arbitrary our own rules will seem later. The observation prompts us to re-evaluate the notion of proof and truth as follows: <em>The goal of the mathematical proof is to convince the mathematician; a statement is true whenever the mathematician is convinced.</em> I emphasize that the mathematician in this sentence is a human being, not a machine. <br/><br/>Propositions in Euclid’s elements are true because Euclid’s text convinced all other Greek mathematicians that they were true; the same hold of Voevodsky’s univalent foundations. To speak about my personal experience, the point was carried home vividly about a decade ago at the end of an entire afternoon spent sitting by the sea nearby Marseille in the South of France together with an illustrious French operator algebraist. For the whole afternoon I had been trying to explain, of all things, the Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality formulated as a nonlocal game—an elementary construction on which half of my research is based (see <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/tsirelsons-bound/">this post</a> for example, although we  certainly didn’t get that far). To no avail! Alice, Bob, games, the mathematician would have none of it. How could it be so hard? The message I was trying to carry across is bread and butter to quantum information theorists; moreover the language of functional analysis was not foreign to me either and so I believed I ought to have more than it should take to make the explanations clear; in my mind I had a clear theorem, together with an airtight proof, to communicate. Not so: I ended the afternoon defeated, and the point hammered in: as much as we may think that our language is formal, our reasoning rational, our goals clear, as soon as we step out of our self-referential cocoon we have to face the evidence: not so; there is nothing clear, formal, self-evident, in the mathematical truths we take as such. (If you’re not convinced yet, look at the pictures.)</p>



<p>After having read through the viewpoint of a historian on Greek mathematics, it is interesting to come back to the present and read up on the modern mathematician’s own account of their practice. Having delighted in Hardy’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology">A Mathematician’s Apology</a> in my student years I was naturally attracted to Harris’ explicitly referential book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691154237/mathematics-without-apologies">Mathematics Without Apologies</a>. The book aims to provide a personal answer to precisely the same question as Netz’ (“What do pure mathematicians do, and why do they do it?”—first line on back cover), with the essential difference that Harris’ book is written by a contemporary mathematician about the practice of modern mathematics. The perspective taken is thus very different: Harris does not waste a drop of ink to examine the material products of modern mathematics (e.g. printed articles), which naturally from his point of view do not have the least interest besides their mathematical significance; nor does he question the formal system that enables mathematics (he does discuss foundation issues, but these are themselves part of the formal system). </p>



<p>Harris delights in telling us stories about the practice of mathematics from the inside: the way one acquires prestige (he calls it “charisma”), how mathematicians perceive when a mathematical statement is interesting, what drives a mathematician to work on one problem or another, the influence of large research programs such as the Langlands program, etc. Just as Netz, Harris agrees that the proof itself, while an important product of the mathematician’s practice, is not a goal in itself. The goal is to introduce new objects, find relations between them, and build structures that support this exploration (Harris quotes extensively from Grothendieck, a builder of structures if there is any). Crucially the mathematician’s goal is not at all to find <em>truth</em>: her goal is to find <em>beauty</em>. Harris (un-apologetically!) defends the mathematician’s position as playing a privileged and essential role in our (Western) society: mathematics is the rare, if not unique, discipline where thought is valued <em>for itself</em>: not for its consequences or potential applications, nor even for some kind of universal validity or truth that it might reach — for itself, the sheer beauty of it. No apologies. While one might think that the arts are in a similar position, Harris points out that in contemporary discussions about art the notion of beauty has all but disappeared; instead, one talks of society, ecology, politics—all of this is good and important, but it is not about beauty. Mathematics is about exploring the beauty of human thought. This exploration is carried out within the very special, narrow and arbitrary corner that mathematical practice has delineated for itself since the Greeks got us started. And yet does not matter that it is narrow and arbitrary; what matters is that it is purely and uniquely human.</p>



<p>I don’t have a conclusion to give to this post. I suppose it is the kind of digression that one is naturally inclined to make while on <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/announcing-a-short-course-in-paris/">sabbatical</a>. (I was delighted to see Harris reference his time at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris extensively and spend multiple pages gossiping about Ed Frenkel, then a holder of the same FSMP chair I am now occupying.) Certainly it helps to gain a sense of what it is that one is doing. While these explorations destroyed a number of simple comforting myths about what it is that I do every day, in the end I find the void that lies beneath the surface much more appealing; I feel privileged and comforted in my desire to make use of that privilege.</p>



<h2>Post-scriptum</h2>



<p>In addition to the two books referenced in the post there are a couple articles that I found helpful. I am listing them here because I found such writings non-trivial to come by, and so they might be helpful to anyone interested in the topic. I welcome additional references. </p>



<ul><li>Barton, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11858-999-0009-7">Ethnomathematics and Philosophy</a>. This is Barton’s Ph.D. thesis, in which he studies the social emergence of mathematics not as inevitable, but as cultural, yet without negating what is so special about it. .</li><li>Wallet and Neuwirth, <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01943079/">Enquete sur les modes d’existence des etres mathematiques</a> (unfortunately in French only it seems). The authors build on Netz’ work and others to examine the notion of mathematical proof within Latour’s framework of “modes of existence,” which Latour mostly applied to experimental sciences. </li></ul></div>

<p>Milan has been suffering as much or more than other European and American big cities for the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. I have seen Milan in its normal condition for a few months from September 2019 to February 2020, and it is a beautiful cosmopolitan city, with an active cultural and social life, and with beautiful surroundings. Like San Francisco, it is smaller than one would expect it to be and very walkable (no hills!). Bocconi is situated in a semi-central area, about twenty minute walk from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Cathedral">Duomo</a>.</p>



<p>I have received a large European grant that, besides paying for these postdoc positions, has a budget for senior visitors and for organizing two workshops over the duration of the grant. In particular, I was planning a workshop to be held last May in a villa on Lake Como. All such plans have been on hold, but Fall 2021 should be around the time that the global pandemic emergency ends, and I am planning for a lot of exciting scientific activity at Bocconi in the academic year 2021-22 and beyond.</p>



<p>I am looking for candidates with an established body of work on topics related to my research agenda, such as pseudorandomness and combinatorial constructions; spectral graph theory; worst-case and average-case analysis of  semidefinite programming relaxation of combinatorial optimization problems.</p>

We show that any streaming algorithm for solving this problem with large constant advantage (over the uniform distribution) must use <img alt="\Omega(\log n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\Omega(\log n)"/> bits of space. Previously, it was known that computing the majority on every input with a constant probability takes <img alt="\Omega(\log n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\Omega(\log n)"/> space. We extend our lower bound to proving tight lower bounds for solving multiple, randomly interleaved copies of the coin problem, as well as for solving the OR of multiple copies of a variant of the coin problem. Our proofs involve new measures of information complexity that are well-suited for data streams.<br/><br/>We use these lower bounds to obtain a number of new results for data streams. In each case there is an underlying <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/>-dimensional vector <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="x"/> with additive updates to its coordinates given in a stream of length <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="m"/>. The input streams arising from our coin lower bound have nice distributional properties, and consequently for many problems for which we only had lower bounds in general turnstile streams, we now obtain the same lower bounds in more natural models, such as the bounded deletion model, in which <img alt="\|x\|_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Cx%5C%7C_2&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\|x\|_2"/> never drops by a constant fraction of what it was earlier, or in the random order model, in which the updates are ordered randomly. <br/><br/>Based on joint work with Mark Braverman and David P. Woodruff.</p></div>

<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>Consider the following problems:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>P3:</strong></span> What is the maximum density of a set A in <img alt="(\mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z)^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathbb+Z%2F3%5Cmathbb+Z%29%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(\mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z)^n"/> without a 3-term AP? (AP=arithmetic progression.)</p>
<p>This is the celebrated Cap Set problem and we <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/05/15/mind-boggling-following-the-work-of-croot-lev-and-pach-jordan-ellenberg-settled-the-cap-set-problem/">reported here</a> in 2016 the breakthrough results by Croot-Lev-Pach-Ellenberg-Gijswijt (CLPEG) asserting that <img alt="|A| \le 2.755..^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CA%7C+%5Cle+2.755..%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="|A| \le 2.755..^n"/>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">P4:</span></strong> What is the maximum density of a set A in  <img alt="(\mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z)^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathbb+Z%2F4%5Cmathbb+Z%29%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(\mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z)^n"/> without a 4-term AP?</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>P5:</strong></span> What is the maximum density of a set A in  <img alt="(\mathbb Z/5\mathbb Z)^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathbb+Z%2F5%5Cmathbb+Z%29%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(\mathbb Z/5\mathbb Z)^n"/> without a 5-term AP?</p>
<p>Moving from 3 term AP to 4 term AP represents a major leap for such problems. In some cases moving from 4 to 5 also represents a major leap. Usually the techniques that work for <img alt="k=5" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k=5"/> continue to work for <img alt="k&gt;5" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3E5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k&gt;5"/>, that is, I am not aware of cases where moving from 5 to 6 also represent a major leap. In other words, we do not have reasons to think, so far,  that progress on P6 (below) will be considerably harder than progress on P5.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">P6:</span></strong> What is the maximum density of a set A in <img alt="(\mathbb Z/6\mathbb Z)^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathbb+Z%2F6%5Cmathbb+Z%29%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(\mathbb Z/6\mathbb Z)^n"/> without a 6-term AP?</p>
<p>And, of course, we can move on to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>P7, P8, P9,….</strong> </span>,</p>
<p>It is known that the density of a set <img alt="A \subset (\mathbb Z_m)^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Csubset+%28%5Cmathbb+Z_m%29%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="A \subset (\mathbb Z_m)^n"/> without <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="m"/>-term AP for  every fixed m goes to zero with n. This was proved by  Furstenberg and Katznelson using ergodic theoretical tools. Following the CLPEG breakthrough we can certainly believe that the density that guarantees m-term AP in <img alt="\mathbb Z_m^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z_m%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb Z_m^n"/> for every fixed m is exponentially small in n. I vaguely remember that the best known bounds for P4 are polylogarithmically small with n and were achieved by Green and Tao using tools from Gowers’ work on 4AP-free sets over the integers.</p>
<h3>A little more before we move on</h3>
<p>To have some general notation let <img alt="r_k(\mathbb Z_m^n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_k%28%5Cmathbb+Z_m%5En%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="r_k(\mathbb Z_m^n)"/> denote the maximal size of a set <img alt="A \subset \mathbb Z_m^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Csubset+%5Cmathbb+Z_m%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="A \subset \mathbb Z_m^n"/> with no <em>k</em> distinct elements in arithmetic progression. It is reasonable to believe that <img alt="r_m(\mathbb Z_m^n) \le \delta_m^n m^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_m%28%5Cmathbb+Z_m%5En%29+%5Cle+%5Cdelta_m%5En+m%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="r_m(\mathbb Z_m^n) \le \delta_m^n m^n"/> for some <img alt="\delta_m &lt; 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_m+%3C+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\delta_m &lt; 1"/>, that is that sets in <img alt="\mathbb Z_m^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z_m%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb Z_m^n"/> avoiding <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="m"/> terms AP are exponentially small. To be more precise let</p>
<p><img alt="\delta_m= \frac {1}{m} \lim r_k(\mathbb Z_m^n)^{1/n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_m%3D+%5Cfrac+%7B1%7D%7Bm%7D+%5Clim+r_k%28%5Cmathbb+Z_m%5En%29%5E%7B1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\delta_m= \frac {1}{m} \lim r_k(\mathbb Z_m^n)^{1/n}"/></p>
<p>We can believe that the limits exist,  that <img alt="\delta_m&lt;1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_m%3C1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\delta_m&lt;1"/>, and we may also guess (wildly but safely) that they satisfy <img alt="{\delta_3} &lt; {\delta_4} &lt; {\delta_5} \cdots&#xA0; " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta_3%7D+%3C+%7B%5Cdelta_4%7D+%3C+%7B%5Cdelta_5%7D+%5Ccdots%C2%A0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\delta_3} &lt; {\delta_4} &lt; {\delta_5} \cdots&#xA0; "/>.</p>
<p>These problems, as well as the analogous problems over the integers, (Roth’s and Szemeredi’s theorems and later developments), and the related density Hales Jewett problem,  form a  holy grail of additive combinatorics and they attracted a lot of attention also on this blog.</p>

<p>Let’s move on to the new result by Péter Pál Pach and Richárd Palincza</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">The</span> <span style="color: #ffffff;">absolutely stunning</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">result by Péter Pál Pach and Richárd Palincza</span></h2>
<p><span id="more-20419"/></p>
<p>As we already mentioned, so far we do not have reasons to expect that proving density results for 6-terms AP in <img alt="\mathbb Z_6^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z_6%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb Z_6^n"/> (or <img alt="\mathbb Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb Z"/>) will be much harder than the question over <img alt="\mathbb Z_5^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z_5%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb Z_5^n"/>. <strong>However</strong>, what Pach and Palincza proved is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>:  sets avoiding 6-term arithmetic progressions in <img alt="\mathbb Z_6^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+Z_6%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb Z_6^n"/> have size at most <img alt="5.709^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5.709%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="5.709^n"/>.</p>
<p>The big surprise is that the problem P6 over integers modulo six is <strong>much easier</strong> than P4 and P5. The proof is based on a simple combinatorial reasoning showing that</p>
<p><img alt="r_6(\mathbb Z_6^n) \le 2^{n+1} \sqrt {3^nr_3(\mathbb Z_3^n).}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_6%28%5Cmathbb+Z_6%5En%29+%5Cle+2%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D+%5Csqrt+%7B3%5Enr_3%28%5Cmathbb+Z_3%5En%29.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="r_6(\mathbb Z_6^n) \le 2^{n+1} \sqrt {3^nr_3(\mathbb Z_3^n).}"/></p>

Out of this activity grew the New Zealand Mathematics Research Institute, which he co-founded and then led from the mid-1990s to this year.</p></blockquote><p>I had the pleasure of teaching in one of those summer schools in January 2000 in Kaikoura on the South Island. In between the whale watching, mountain hiking, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/09/jogging-on-trips.html">jogging</a>, gorging on mussels, and Maori ceremonies, the NZMRI summer school <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Aspects_of_Complexity/XlB_JTR0sV8C">Aspects of Complexity</a> had short courses to a mix of students and researchers in complexity and logic. I gave some <a href="https://lance.fortnow.com/papers/files/kaikoura.pdf">lectures</a> on Kolmogorov complexity that preceded a study of algorithmic randomness in the logic community. Other speakers included Eric Allender on basic complexity, Felipe Cucker on real computation, Mike Fellows on parameterized complexity, and Dominic Welsh on counting complexity. </p><p>It took me 36 hours door-to-door to get to Kaikoura but definitely worth it. Thanks to Vaughan Jones, for his research, his polynomial and creating a summer school that gave me that one perfect week in New Zealand.</p></div>

<p>As explained in Boaz’s previous posts <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2018/02/20/research-masters/">[1]</a> <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/07/02/crowdsourcing-masters-program/">[2]</a>, the PhD admission process can be challenging for students who discover their passion for Theory of Computer Science late in their undergraduate studies. Discovering TCS earlier is especially challenging for students who aren’t exposed to CS in high school, and this bias aggravates the diversity issues we have in our community. Masters programs are one way to mitigate this issue.<br/>On a personal note, one of us (Aviad), worked half-time during undergraduate and would not have been in academia today -let alone TCS of all subjects- if it weren’t for the awesome TCS masters program at Tel-Aviv University.</p>



<p><br/>But where would you go (or send your students) to do a masters in TCS?A little over a year ago, we were discussing how useful it would be to have a unified resource that can help students choose. We decided that we should create one! Months passed, and right before we ran out of excuses to procrastinate, Boaz made this <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/07/02/crowdsourcing-masters-program/">post</a> crowdsourcing information on TCS masters programs.<br/>After some more procrastination, we eventually did send a lot of emails and tried to clean and organize the information to the best of our ability. Thanks to everyone who contributed! You can find the latest version <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/masters/masters.html">here</a>. (Short url: <a href="http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters">http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters</a>)</p>



<p>Now you should share it with your brightest students!</p>



<p><br/>This is also meant to be a live project. Please email aviad [at] <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cs.stanford.edu</a> if you have more new information or find any inaccuracies.</p>

<em>Crazy ideas meet crazed audience</em><br/>
<font color="#000000"/></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/19/traveling-salesman-problem-meets-complexity-theory/flood/" rel="attachment wp-att-17793"><img alt="" class="alignright  wp-image-17751" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/flood.jpg?w=144" width="144"/></a></p>
<p>
Merrill Flood was a mathematician who publicized the Traveling salesman problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_M._Flood">TSP</a> back in the 1940s.  </p>
<p>He says that he found the problem while: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\dots}"/> I was struggling with the problem in connecting with a school-bus routing study in New Jersey. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Today I thought we might look at the TSP from a viewpoint of complexity theory.</p>
<p>
First, we note that the origins of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">TSP</a> are unclear. In 1832 it was mentioned in a handbook for traveling salesmen in Germany and Switzerland. William Hamilton talked about the related problem later named for him: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> On finding a circuit through all points of graph. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Karl Menger, in the 1930s, defined the TSP, and considered the obvious brute-force algorithm, and observed the non-optimality of the nearest neighbor heuristic. We have annotated Wikipedia’s optimal-tour example to show (in blue) one case where a node is not connected to either of its two nearest neighbors in the tour and another where a mutual nearest-neighbor edge is not used in the optimal tour (the latter is a slight fib as-is but can be nudged, we believe): </p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/19/traveling-salesman-problem-meets-complexity-theory/tspwikimod/" rel="attachment wp-att-17815"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17815" height="287" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/tspwikimod-1.png?w=300&amp;h=287" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Modern Times–Practice </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The TSP is now well known to be NP-complete thanks to Dick Karp’s brilliant work in the 1970s. Flood would be happy to hear—we believe—that there is now a computer program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde_TSP_Solver">Concorde</a> that can solve TSP with many cites and get a nearly optimal solution. The authors of this program are: David Applegate, Robert Bixby, Vasek Chvatal, and William Cook. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Concorde has been applied to problems of gene mapping, protein function prediction, vehicle routing, conversion of bitmap images to continuous line drawings, scheduling ship movements for seismic surveys, and in studying the scaling properties of combinatorial optimization problems. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Modern Times–Theory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Concorde’s solutions are guaranteed to be within 2-3% of optimal and have worked for problems with tens of thousand cities or more. A lot more than Flood considered. </p>
<p>
So why are we interested in the TSP still? A good question. </p>
<p>
The answer is not simple. In spite of the problem’s NP-completeness and widespread belief that P<img alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{&lt;}"/>NP we still do not know for sure. Could there be an algorithm that always solves TSP in polynomial time? We do not know. </p>
<p>
We also as complexity theorists want provable algorithms, want exact algorithms, or at least approximate algorithms with provable bounds. These are lacking. This is why we were excited by the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/10/26/a-vast-and-tiny-breakthrough/">recent</a> result of a tiny improvement to the <img alt="{1.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1.5}"/> bound on TSP by Anna Karlin, Nathan Klein, and Shayan Oveis Gharan. </p>
<p>
Maybe we are crazy to be excited over a microscopic shaving off from <img alt="{1.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1.5}"/>.  But their result comes with new ideas, and since we don’t believe that <img alt="{1.5 - \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5+-+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1.5 - \epsilon}"/> is Nature’s final answer, those ideas should yield further advances.  What we are really crazy over is new ideas, and that prompts us to attempt to find another in the rest of this post.  What complexity theorists do have more of than when Ken and I started is receptacles for new ideas, and we try for one in resource-bounded communication complexity.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Alice and Bob </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In this spirit of craziness let’s take a complexity viewpoint of TSP. Let’s visit Alice and Bob. By the way I always have thought the invention of them by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in their 1978 RSA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob">paper</a> was important. This idea has probably helped improve exposition more than any other single idea. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> They Meet the TSP </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
So suppose that Alice and Bob are presented with a <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> city TSP. Further suppose that Alice can solve the TSP, but Bob like the rest of us cannot. An issue is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Can Alice send a succinct message to Bob that allows him to find an optimal tour in polynomial time? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Without the word “succinct” there would be the simple answer of sending Bob her optimal tour. We will discuss a modest improvement: she can send half as many bits to Bob as it takes to describe the optimal tour. We suspect the following is known, but it suggests a possible interesting direction.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1 (Main)</b> <em> Alice can send Bob a message of <img alt="{\frac{n}{2} \lceil \log_{2}n \rceil}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7B2%7D+%5Clceil+%5Clog_%7B2%7Dn+%5Crceil%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\frac{n}{2} \lceil \log_{2}n \rceil}"/> bits, so that he can get an optimal TSP tour in polynomial time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This theorem holds for general TSP: it can be asymmetric and need not satisfy the triangle inequality. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Proof </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
<em>Proof:</em>  Let’s assume that <img alt="{n=2m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D2m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n=2m}"/>; the argument is the essentially same if <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> is odd. </p>
<p>
Alice will first solve the TSP exactly. Assume she finds an optimal tour that visits the cities in order 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}, x_{1}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B1%7D%2C+x_%7B2%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_%7Bn%7D%2C+x_%7B1%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}, x_{1}. "/></p>
<p>To simply the notation let <img alt="{d(i,j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{d(i,j)}"/> be the distance from <img alt="{x_{i}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x_{i}}"/> to <img alt="{x_{j}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7Bj%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x_{j}}"/>. Then let Alice send Bob the odd cities in order 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{3}, \dots, x_{2m-1}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B1%7D%2C+x_%7B3%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_%7B2m-1%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{3}, \dots, x_{2m-1}. "/></p>
<p>This message has the right length in bits of <img alt="{\frac{n}{2} \lceil \log_{2}n \rceil}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7B2%7D+%5Clceil+%5Clog_%7B2%7Dn+%5Crceil%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\frac{n}{2} \lceil \log_{2}n \rceil}"/>.</p>
<p>
Bob receives this message and creates the following bipartite graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>: The left vertices are the cities 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{2}, x_{4}, \dots, x_{2m}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B2%7D%2C+x_%7B4%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_%7B2m%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{2}, x_{4}, \dots, x_{2m}. "/></p>
<p>The right vertices are 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{3}, \dots, x_{2m-1}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B1%7D%2C+x_%7B3%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_%7B2m-1%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{3}, \dots, x_{2m-1}. "/></p>
<p>
<img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> has edges connecting every left vertex to every right vertex; i.e., <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> is the complete bipartite graph.</p>
<p>
The first idea is that any perfect matching in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> extends uniquely to a tour, because Bob knows the order of the odd vertices in Alice’s tour.  That is, if <img alt="{(2k+1,2l)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282k%2B1%2C2l%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{(2k+1,2l)}"/> is an edge in the tour, then Bob knows that the next edge goes to node <img alt="{2k+3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2k%2B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2k+3}"/> (modulo <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>).</p>
<p>
The second idea—which is a caveat—is that an optimal matching under the graph’s original distance function might not produce Alice’s tour.  For this to be true, it would need to be the case that for every optimal tour, either one of the two perfect matchings it induces would need to be an optimal matching for the tour’s odd and even vertices.  An example where this fails is shown at lower left in our diagram above: The green edge is part of the optimal odd-even matching but is not in Alice’s optimal tour.</p>
<p>
The trick is to change the distance function to include the edge that Bob must add to the tour.  That is, we give the edge <img alt="{(2k+1,2l)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282k%2B1%2C2l%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{(2k+1,2l)}"/> the cost 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  d(2k+1,2l) + d(2l,2k+3). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++d%282k%2B1%2C2l%29+%2B+d%282l%2C2k%2B3%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  d(2k+1,2l) + d(2l,2k+3). "/></p>
<p>Note<img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> has edges connecting every left vertex to every right vertex; i.e., <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> is the complete bipartite graph.</p>
<p>
Bob then finds a minimum cost matching for the graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>. This can be done in polynomial time. We claim the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The matching 		<p/>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{2k+2} \rightarrow x_{2k+1}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B2k%2B2%7D+%5Crightarrow+x_%7B2k%2B1%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{2k+2} \rightarrow x_{2k+1}, "/></p>
<p>has the cost of the original TSP tour. </p>
</li><li>
Every minimum complete matching of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> yields a tour for the original TSP with the same cost as the matching.
</li></ol>
<p>These claims imply that Bob can solve the TSP in polynomial time.</p>
<p>
We note that (1) follows from the definition of the graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> and its costs. In order to see (2) let <img alt="{2\pi(k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%28k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2\pi(k)}"/> match to <img alt="{2k+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2k%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2k+1}"/>. This means that there are edges 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  2k+1 \rightarrow 2\pi(k) \rightarrow 2k+3, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2k%2B1+%5Crightarrow+2%5Cpi%28k%29+%5Crightarrow+2k%2B3%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  2k+1 \rightarrow 2\pi(k) \rightarrow 2k+3, "/></p>
<p>for all <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/>. This is clearly a tour, since <img alt="{\pi(k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%28k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\pi(k)}"/> is a permutation by the definition of matching. 	 <img alt="\Box" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\Box"/></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The fact that Alice can send only half of the tour to Bob suggests: can we avoid having Alice solve the TSP in order to compute her message? This is the direction we are interested in. If she could do that it would improve some known complexity bounds on TSP. A possible idea is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Replace having Alice solve the <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> city TSP exactly. Instead have her solve some randomly selected subproblem exactly, and then use the above method to add in the remaining cities. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Can this work?</p>
<p>
We have not found something like this when searching on TSP and communication complexity, but would not be surprised if the matching idea, caveat, and trick have been noticed and remarked on before.</p></font></font></div>

    <title>TR20-174 |  Isoperimetric Inequalities for Real-Valued Functions with Applications to Monotonicity Testing | 

	Hadley Black, 

	Iden Kalemaj, 

	Sofya Raskhodnikova</title>
    <summary>We generalize the celebrated isoperimetric inequality of Khot, Minzer, and Safra (SICOMP 2018) for Boolean functions to the case of real-valued functions $f \colon \{0,1\}^d\to\mathbb{R}$. Our main tool in the proof of the generalized inequality is a new Boolean decomposition that represents every real-valued function $f$ over an arbitrary partially ordered domain as a collection of Boolean functions over the same domain, roughly capturing the distance of $f$ to monotonicity and the structure of violations of $f$ to monotonicity.

We apply our generalized isoperimetric inequality to improve algorithms for testing monotonicity and approximating the distance to monotonicity for real-valued functions. Our tester for monotonicity has query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\min(r \sqrt{d},d))$, where $r$ is the size of the image of the input function. (The best previously known tester, by Chakrabarty and Seshadhri (STOC 2013), makes $O(d)$ queries.) Our tester is nonadaptive and has 1-sided error. We show a matching lower bound for nonadaptive, 1-sided error testers for monotonicity. We also show that the distance to monotonicity of real-valued functions that are $\alpha$-far from monotone can be approximated nonadaptively within a factor of $O(\sqrt{d\log d})$ with query complexity polynomial in  $1/\alpha$ and the dimension $d$. This query complexity is known to be nearly optimal for nonadaptive algorithms even for the special case of Boolean functions. (The best previously known distance approximation algorithm for real-valued functions, by Fattal and Ron (TALG 2010) achieves $O(d\log r)$-approximation.)</summary>

    <title>TR20-173 |  Block Rigidity: Strong Multiplayer Parallel Repetition implies Super-Linear Lower Bounds for Turing Machines | 

	Kunal Mittal, 

	Ran Raz</title>
    <summary>We prove that a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for a special case of multiplayer (multiprover) games implies super-linear lower bounds for multi-tape Turing machines with advice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first connection between parallel repetition and lower bounds for time complexity and the first major potential implication of a parallel repetition theorem with more than two players.

Along the way to proving this result, we define and initiate a study of block rigidity, extending Valiant's notion of rigidity [Val77]. While rigidity was originally defined for matrices, or, equivalently, for (multi-output) linear functions, we extend and study both rigidity and block rigidity for general (multi-output) functions. Using techniques of Paul, Pippenger, Szemer{\'{e}}di and Trotter [PPST83], we show that a block-rigid function cannot be computed by multi-tape Turing machines that run in linear (or slightly super-linear) time, even in the non-uniform setting, where the machine gets an arbitrary advice tape.

We then describe a class of multiplayer games, such that, a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for that class of games implies an explicit block-rigid function. The games in that class have the following property that may be of independent interest: for every random string for the verifier (which, in particular, determines the vector of queries to the players), there is a unique correct answer for each of the players, and the verifier accepts if and only if all answers are correct. We refer to such games as independent games. The theorem that we need is that parallel repetition reduces the value of games in this class from $v$ to $v^{\Omega(n)}$, where $n$ is the number of repetitions.

As another application of block rigidity, we show conditional size-depth tradeoffs for boolean circuits, where the gates compute arbitrary functions over large sets.</summary>
