cutting a polygon into small-size pieces, using the chords of the polygon.
Several versions are considered, depending on the definition of the "size" of a
piece. In particular, we consider the area, the diameter, and the radius of the
largest inscribed circle as a measure of the size of a piece. We also consider
different objectives, either minimizing the maximum size of a piece for a given
number of chords, or minimizing the number of chords that achieve a given size
threshold for the pieces. We give hardness results for polygons with holes and
approximation algorithms for multiple variants of the problem.

of $G$ is an edge whose removal breaks all $s$-$t$ paths of $G$. Similarly, an
$s$-$t$ articulation point of $G$ is a node whose removal breaks all $s$-$t$
paths of $G$. Computing the sequence of all $s$-$t$ bridges of $G$ (as well as
the $s$-$t$ articulation points) is a basic graph problem, solvable in linear
time using the classical min-cut algorithm.
</p>
<p>When dealing with cuts of unit size ($s$-$t$ bridges) this algorithm can be
simplified to a single graph traversal from $s$ to $t$ avoiding an arbitrary
$s$-$t$ path, which is interrupted at the $s$-$t$ bridges. Further, the
corresponding proof is also simplified making it independent of the theory of
network flows.

task in graph-based data clustering. Here, complementing classic work where the
clusters shall be cliques, we focus on clusters that shall be 2-clubs, that is,
subgraphs of diameter two. This naturally leads to the two NP-hard problems
2-Club Cluster Editing (the allowed editing operations are edge insertion and
edge deletion) and 2-Club Cluster Vertex Deletion (the allowed editing
operations are vertex deletions). Answering an open question from the
literature, we show that 2-Club Cluster Editing is W[2]-hard with respect to
the number of edge modifications, thus contrasting the fixed-parameter
tractability result for the classic Cluster Editing problem (considering
cliques instead of 2-clubs). Then focusing on 2-Club Cluster Vertex Deletion,
which is easily seen to be fixed-parameter tractable, we show that under
standard complexity-theoretic assumptions it does not have a polynomial-size
problem kernel when parameterized by the number of vertex deletions.
Nevertheless, we develop several effective data reduction and pruning rules,
resulting in a competitive solver, clearly outperforming a standard CPLEX
solver in most instances of an established biological test data set.

distributions has recently been studied by Andoni, Malkin and Nosatzki
(ICALP'19). In this problem, two players each receive $t$ samples from one
distribution over $[n]$, and the goal is to decide whether their two
distributions are equal, or are $\epsilon$-far apart in the $l_1$-distance. In
the present paper we show that the quantum communication complexity of this
problem is $\tilde{O}(n/(t\epsilon^2))$ qubits when the distributions have low
$l_2$-norm, which gives a quadratic improvement over the classical
communication complexity obtained by Andoni, Malkin and Nosatzki. We also
obtain a matching lower bound by using the pattern matrix method. Let us stress
that the samples received by each of the parties are classical, and it is only
communication between them that is quantum. Our results thus give one setting
where quantum protocols overcome classical protocols for a testing problem with
purely classical samples.

of the ferromagnetic Ising model in the Lee-Yang circle of zeros given by
$|\lambda|=1$, where $\lambda$ is the external field of the model.
</p>
<p>Complex-valued parameters for the Ising model are relevant for quantum
circuit computations and phase transitions in statistical physics, but have
also been key in the recent deterministic approximation scheme for all
$|\lambda|\neq 1$ by Liu, Sinclair, and Srivastava. Here, we focus on the
unresolved complexity picture on the unit circle, and on the tantalising
question of what happens in the circular arc around $\lambda=1$, where on one
hand the classical algorithm of Jerrum and Sinclair gives a randomised
approximation scheme on the real axis suggesting tractability, and on the other
hand the presence of Lee-Yang zeros alludes to computational hardness.
</p>
<p>Our main result establishes a sharp computational transition at the point
$\lambda=1$; in fact, our techniques apply more generally to the whole unit
circle $|\lambda|=1$. We show #P-hardness for approximating the partition
function on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ when $b$, the edge-interaction
parameter, is in the interval $(0,\frac{\Delta-2}{\Delta}]$ and $\lambda$ is a
non-real on the unit circle. This result contrasts with known approximation
algorithms when $|\lambda|\neq 1$ or $b\in (\frac{\Delta-2}{\Delta},1)$, and
shows that the Lee-Yang circle of zeros is computationally intractable, even on
bounded-degree graphs.

$k&gt;0$ burnt vertices, and at each subsequent step, burns the neighbors of the
currently burnt vertices, as well as $k$ other unburnt vertices. The
\emph{$k$-burning number} of $G$ is the minimum number of steps $b_k(G)$ such
that all the vertices can be burned within $b_k(G)$ steps. Note that the last
step may have smaller than $k$ unburnt vertices available, where all of them
are burned. The $1$-burning number coincides with the well-known burning number
problem, which was proposed to model the spread of social contagion. The
generalization to $k$-burning number allows us to examine different worst-case
contagion scenarios by varying the spread factor $k$.
</p>
<p>In this paper we prove that computing $k$-burning number is APX-hard, for any
fixed constant $k$. We then give an $O((n+m)\log n)$-time 3-approximation
algorithm for computing $k$-burning number, for any $k\ge 1$, where $n$ and $m$
are the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Finally, we show that even

intersections of $n$ halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This generic task connects
to fundamental machine learning problems, such as training a perceptron and
learning a $\phi$-separable dichotomy. We investigate the average teaching
complexity of the task, i.e., the minimal number of samples (halfspace queries)
required by a teacher to help a version-space learner in locating a randomly
selected target. As our main result, we show that the average-case teaching
complexity is $\Theta(d)$, which is in sharp contrast to the worst-case
teaching complexity of $\Theta(n)$. If instead, we consider the average-case
learning complexity, the bounds have a dependency on $n$ as $\Theta(n)$ for
i.i.d. queries and $\Theta(d \log(n))$ for actively chosen queries by the
learner. Our proof techniques are based on novel insights from computational
geometry, which allow us to count the number of convex polytopes and faces in a
Euclidean space depending on the arrangement of halfspaces. Our insights allow
us to establish a tight bound on the average-case complexity for
$\phi$-separable dichotomies, which generalizes the known $\mathcal{O}(d)$
bound on the average number of "extreme patterns" in the classical
computational geometry literature (Cover, 1965).

theoretical approach for multiplying two $N$ by $N$ matrices that integrates
threshold gate logic with conventional fast matrix multiplication algorithms,
that perform $O(N^\omega)$ arithmetic operations for a positive constant
$\omega &lt; 3$. Our approach converts such a fast matrix multiplication algorithm
into a constant-depth threshold circuit with approximately $O(N^\omega)$ gates.
Prior to our work, it was not known whether the $\Theta(N^3)$-gate barrier for
matrix multiplication was surmountable by constant-depth threshold circuits.

<p>Dense matrix multiplication is a core operation in convolutional neural
network training. Performing this work on a neural architecture instead of
off-loading it to a GPU may be an appealing option.

    <title>Sorting with integer offsets</title>
    <summary>Here’s a cute exercise for the next time you’re teaching radix sorting in an algorithms class:</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Here’s a cute exercise for the next time you’re teaching radix sorting in an algorithms class:</p>

<p>Suppose you’re given as input a set of real numbers , and an integer parameter . Describe an algorithm for sorting the  numbers  in time . You can assume that standard arithmetic operations on real numbers (including comparisons and rounding down to an integer) take constant time per operation.</p>

<p>Models of computation that mix constant-time real arithmetic and rounding operations can be problematic, as by building up and then rounding numbers with unlimited precision you can access a level of computational power beyond what actual computers can do, but I don’t think that’s a concern here. If someone wants to use bit-packing tricks to implement a crazy but fast sorting algorithm in this model, they’re beyond the level of this exercise.</p>

<p>The same method (which I’m not going to describe, to preserve its value as an exercise) more generally allows you to take as input pairs  and sort the numbers  in time  where . But it relies heavily on the fact that you’re adding integers to the ’s. For a problem that can’t be handled in this way, consider instead sorting the numbers  where we multiply instead of adding. Or, if you prefer to view this as a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_%2B_Y_sorting"> sorting</a> problem, take logs in your favorite base and sort the numbers . It’s not at all obvious to me whether this can be done in the same  time bound.</p>

<p>The motivation for looking at all this is <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/47120/95">a question about how to implement the greedy set cover quickly</a>. You can find the unweighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem#Greedy_algorithm">greedy set cover</a> in linear time (linear in the sum of the sizes of the input sets; this is an exercise in CLRS), and you can approximate the weighted greedy set cover very accurately in linear time using similar ideas. If you could sort  quickly you could use the sorted order to compute the weighted greedy set cover exactly in the same time as the sorting algorithm. Which is totally useless because the greedy cover is already an approximation, so a fast and accurate approximation to the greedy cover is good enough. But I think the question of sorting  is interesting despite its uselessness in this application.</p></div>

    <title>Sparse Convex Optimization via Adaptively Regularized Hard Thresholding</title>

under a sparsity constraint $s\leq s^*\gamma$, where $s^*$ is the target number
of non-zero entries in a feasible solution (sparsity) and $\gamma\geq 1$ is an
approximation factor. There has been a lot of work to analyze the sparsity
guarantees of various algorithms (LASSO, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP),
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT)) in terms of the Restricted Condition Number
$\kappa$. The best known algorithms guarantee to find an approximate solution
of value $f(x^*)+\epsilon$ with the sparsity bound of $\gamma =
O\left(\kappa\min\left\{\log \frac{f(x^0)-f(x^*)}{\epsilon},
\kappa\right\}\right)$, where $x^*$ is the target solution. We present a new
Adaptively Regularized Hard Thresholding (ARHT) algorithm that makes
significant progress on this problem by bringing the bound down to
$\gamma=O(\kappa)$, which has been shown to be tight for a general class of
algorithms including LASSO, OMP, and IHT. This is achieved without significant
sacrifice in the runtime efficiency compared to the fastest known algorithms.
We also provide a new analysis of OMP with Replacement (OMPR) for general $f$,
under the condition $s &gt; s^* \frac{\kappa^2}{4}$, which yields Compressed
Sensing bounds under the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). When compared to
other Compressed Sensing approaches, it has the advantage of providing a strong
tradeoff between the RIP condition and the solution sparsity, while working for
any general function $f$ that meets the RIP condition.

    <title>Augmenting the Algebraic Connectivity of Graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1593302400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Bogdan-Adrian Manghiuc, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Peng:Pan.html">Pan Peng</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sun:He.html">He Sun</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14449">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>For any undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $E_W$ of candidate edges with
$E\cap E_W=\emptyset$, the $(k,\gamma)$-spectral augmentability problem is to
find a set $F$ of $k$ edges from $E_W$ with appropriate weighting, such that
the algebraic connectivity of the resulting graph $H=(V,E\cup F)$ is least
$\gamma$. Because of a tight connection between the algebraic connectivity and
many other graph parameters, including the graph's conductance and the mixing
time of random walks in a graph, maximising the resulting graph's algebraic
connectivity by adding a small number of edges has been studied over the past
15 years.
</p>
<p>In this work we present an approximate and efficient algorithm for the
$(k,\gamma)$-spectral augmentability problem, and our algorithm runs in
almost-linear time under a wide regime of parameters. Our main algorithm is
based on the following two novel techniques developed in the paper, which might
have applications beyond the $(k,\gamma)$-spectral augmentability problem.
</p>
<p>(1) We present a fast algorithm for solving a feasibility version of an SDP
for the algebraic connectivity maximisation problem from [GB06]. Our algorithm
is based on the classic primal-dual framework for solving SDP, which in turn
uses the multiplicative weight update algorithm. We present a novel approach of
unifying SDP constraints of different matrix and vector variables and give a
good separation oracle accordingly.
</p>
<p>(2) We present an efficient algorithm for the subgraph sparsification
problem, and for a wide range of parameters our algorithm runs in almost-linear
time, in contrast to the previously best known algorithm running in at least
$\Omega(n^2mk)$ time [KMST10]. Our analysis shows how the randomised BSS
framework can be generalised in the setting of subgraph sparsification, and how
the potential functions can be applied to approximately keep track of different
subspaces.

    <title>Approximation Algorithms for Clustering with Dynamic Points</title>

$n$ points in a metric space, by segmenting them into $k$ categories or
clusters, each cluster represented concisely by a single point in the metric
space. Two notable examples are the $k$-center/$k$-supplier problem and the
$k$-median problem. In practical applications of clustering, the data set may
evolve over time, reflecting an evolution of the underlying clustering model.
In this paper, we initiate the study of a dynamic version of clustering
problems that aims to capture these considerations. In this version there are
$T$ time steps, and in each time step $t\in\{1,2,\dots,T\}$, the set of clients
needed to be clustered may change, and we can move the $k$ facilities between
time steps. More specifically, we study two concrete problems in this
framework: the Dynamic Ordered $k$-Median and the Dynamic $k$-Supplier problem.
We first consider the Dynamic Ordered $k$-Median problem, where the objective
is to minimize the weighted sum of ordered distances over all time steps, plus
the total cost of moving the facilities between time steps. We present one
constant-factor approximation algorithm for $T=2$ and another approximation
algorithm for fixed $T \geq 3$. Then we consider the Dynamic $k$-Supplier
problem, where the objective is to minimize the maximum distance from any
client to its facility, subject to the constraint that between time steps the
maximum distance moved by any facility is no more than a given threshold. When
the number of time steps $T$ is 2, we present a simple constant factor
approximation algorithm and a bi-criteria constant factor approximation
algorithm for the outlier version, where some of the clients can be discarded.
We also show that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem with any factor for
$T \geq 3$.

    <title>New Approximations and Hardness Results for Submodular Partitioning Problems</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1593302400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Santiago:Richard.html">Richard Santiago</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14312">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the following class of submodular k-multiway partitioning
problems: (Sub-$k$-MP) $\min \sum_{i=1}^k f(S_i): S_1 \uplus S_2 \uplus \cdots
\uplus S_k = V \mbox{ and } S_i \neq \emptyset \mbox{ for all }i\in [k]$. Here
$f$ is a non-negative submodular function, and $\uplus$ denotes the union of
disjoint sets. Hence the goal is to partition $V$ into $k$ non-empty sets
$S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^k f(S_i)$ is minimized. These
problems were introduced by Zhao et al. partly motivated by applications to
network reliability analysis, VLSI design, hypergraph cut, and other
partitioning problems.
</p>
<p>In this work we revisit this class of problems and shed some light onto their
hardness of approximation in the value oracle model. We provide new
unconditional hardness results for Sub-$k$-MP in the special settings where the
function $f$ is either monotone or symmetric. For symmetric functions we show
that given any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, any algorithm achieving a $(2 -
\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many queries in the value
oracle model. For monotone objectives we show that given any $\epsilon &gt; 0$,
any algorithm achieving a $(4/3 - \epsilon)$-approximation requires
exponentially many queries in the value oracle model.
</p>
<p>We then extend Sub-$k$-MP to a larger class of partitioning problems, where
the functions $f_i(S_i)$ can now be all different, and there is a more general
partitioning constraint $ S_1 \uplus S_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus S_k \in
\mathcal{F}$ for some family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^V$ of feasible sets. We
provide a black box reduction that allows us to leverage several existing
results from the literature; leading to new approximations for this class of
problems.

<p>We investigate the problem of determining, given two spanning trees $T_1,T_2$

</p>
<p>First we show that determining if there exists a transformation from $T_1$ to

<p>We then prove that determining if there exists a transformation from $T_1$ to

bipartite or planar graphs. We complete this result by showing that the problem
becomes polynomial for cographs, interval graphs and when $k=n-2$.

the use of a so-called overlay arrangement [Har-Peled&amp;Raichel, Discrete Comput.

$O(n\log^2 n)$ as a practical bound on the runtime. Our algorithm can be

triangular. A rectilinear dual or an orthogonal floor plan (OFP) of G is
obtained by partitioning a rectangle into \mid V \mid rectilinear regions
(modules) where two modules are adjacent if and only if there is an edge
between the corresponding vertices in G. In this paper, a linear-time algorithm
is presented for constructing an OFP for a given G such that the obtained OFP
has B_{min} bends, where a bend in a concave corner in an OFP. Further, it has
been proved that at least B_{min} bends are required to construct an OFP for G,
where \rho - 2 \leq B_{min} \leq \rho + 1 and \rho is the sum of the number of
leaves of the containment tree of G and the number of K_4 (4-vertex complete
graph) in G.

We
consider the problem of adding a new edge to $P$ so that the radius of the
resulting graph is minimized, where any center is constrained to be one of the
vertices of $P$. Previously, the "continuous" version of the problem where a
center may be a point in the interior of an edge of the graph was studied and a
linear-time algorithm was known. Our "discrete" version of the problem has not
been studied before. We present a linear-time algorithm for the problem.

Specifically, we
look for a constructive method to connect any two points in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The
construction must be {\em consistent} (that is, satisfy the natural extension
of the Euclidean axioms) while resembling them as much as possible. Previous
work has shown asymptotically tight results in two dimensions with $\Theta(\log
N)$ error, where resemblance between segments is measured with the Hausdorff
distance, and $N$ is the $L_1$ distance between the two points. This
construction was considered tight because of a $\Omega(\log N)$ lower bound
that applies to any consistent construction in $\mathbb{Z}^2$.
</p>
<p>In this paper we observe that the lower bound does not directly extend to
higher dimensions. We give an alternative argument showing that any consistent
construction in $d$ dimensions must have $\Omega(\log^{1/(d-1)} N)$ error. We
tie the error of a consistent construction in high dimensions to the error of
similar {\em weak} constructions in two dimensions (constructions for which
some points need not satisfy all the axioms). This not only opens the
possibility for having constructions with $o(\log N)$ error in high dimensions,
but also opens up an interesting line of research in the tradeoff between the
number of axiom violations and the error of the construction. In order to show
our lower bound, we also consider a colored variation of the concept of
discrepancy of a set of points that we find of independent interest.

without overlap in a string. This algorithm is based on the Hunt-Szymanski
algorithm, therefore its performance improves if the string is not self
similar. This occurs naturally on strings over large alphabets. Our algorithm
relies on new results for data structures that support dynamic longest
increasing sub-sequences. In the process we also obtain improved algorithms for
the decremental string comparison problem.

$\boldsymbol{u}^{\mathrm{T}}\boldsymbol{M}\boldsymbol{v}$ over a fixed field
$\mathbb{F}$ for a specified pair of vectors $\boldsymbol{u},\boldsymbol{v} \in
\mathbb{F}^n$. To motivate these queries, we observe that they generalize many
previously studied models, such as independent set queries, cut queries, and
standard graph queries. They also specialize the recently studied matrix-vector
query model. Our work is exploratory and broad, and we provide new upper and
lower bounds for a wide variety of problems, spanning linear algebra,
statistics, and graphs. Many of our results are nearly tight, and we use
diverse techniques from linear algebra, randomized algorithms, and
communication complexity.

<h2>Rani Sharim’s two-player variants of John Conway’s game-of-life</h2>
<p><a href="https://ranisharim.github.io/game_of_life_2_players/">Here is a web-page</a> by a student in my “Game Theory” course where you can play several two-players variants of John Conway’s game-of-life.  (A couple of variants were considered before.

<h2>How to catch lies with statistics, a 2006  presentation by Maya Bar-Hillel</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19929" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png?w=640"/></a></p>
<p>Maya Bar-Hillel (left) and Ester Samuel-Cahn</p>
<p>Here is an interesting 2006 <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/ester.ppt">power point presentation entitled <strong><em>How to detect lies with statistics</em></strong> by Maya Bar-Hillel.</a>  This was a talk given by Maya at the <a href="http://www.esterconference.huji.ac.il/">conference</a> honoring Prof. Ester Samuel- Cahn , Jerusalem, December 18-20, 2006, and it described a planned research project of Maya Bar-Hillel with Yossi Rinott, David Budescu and myself. At the end we did not pursue it, mainly because each of us was involved in various other projects (but also because we were skeptical about some aspects of it.)  Ester Samuel-Cahn (1933-2015) was a famous Israeli statistician. (Here is a <a href="http://www.sci-princess.info/archives/291">post by Yosi Levy in Hebrew</a> about the conference and about Ester.)</p>
<p>The lecture starts with “Last year, <em>Statistical Science</em> celebrated 50 years for `How to Lie with Statistics’ the book [by Durell Huff] whose title inspired this talk.”</p>
<p>And here are a few other quotes from Maya’s presentation</p>
<p>“We are not sure a general toolkit for detecting lies with statistics can be developed. Perhaps that explains why none yet exists.  We have shown just a collection of anecdotes. But they can be classified and categorized. Some do seem generalizeable, at least to some extent.”</p>
<p>and the conclusion</p>
<blockquote><p>A famous quip by Fred Mosteller: “It is easy to lie with statistics, but easier to lie without them.”</p>
<p>Likewise, we should say:  “It is possible to detect (some) lies with statistics, but easier to detect them with other means”.</p></blockquote>
<h2>New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems</h2>
<p>Peter Keevash, Alexey Pokrovskiy, Benny Sudakov, and Liana Yepremyan’s paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00526">New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems,</a> describes remarkable progress very old questions regarding transversals in Latin square.</p>
<h2>Topological Tverberg news</h2>
<p>I came across a very interesting paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05251">The topological Tverberg problem beyond <span class="search-hit mathjax">prime</span> powers</a> by Florian Frick and Pablo Soberón with new bounds and a new method for topological Tverberg theorem in the non prime-power case.</p>
<h2>Jeager’s conjecture refuted</h2>
<p>A year ago I came across <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2114324995342352&amp;set=a.507523926022475&amp;type=3&amp;theater">this cool facebook post</a> by Rupei Xu</p>
<blockquote><p>OMG! Just learned that Jaeger’s conjecture is false for every t&gt;=3. An interesting consequence of it is that a specific version of Goddyn’s conjecture on thin spanning trees is false, which shows some negative evidence that the thin spanning tree approaches may fail to lead to a constant factor approximation algorithm for ATSP!</p></blockquote>
<h2>A cool rainbow post <a href="http://matroidunion.org/?p=2541">Short rainbow cycles in graphs and matroids</a> by Tony Huynh</h2>
<h2>More on the game of life</h2>
<p>Let me mention two problems I posted 6-7 years ago about Conway’s game of life. <a class="question-hyperlink" href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/132402/conways-game-of-life-for-random-initial-position">Conway’s game of life for random initial position</a> and <a class="question-hyperlink" href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/17914/does-a-noisy-version-of-conways-game-of-life-support-universal-computation">Does a noisy version of Conway’s game of life support universal computation?</a></p>

    <title>Writing Code for a Paper :  A Note to Students</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This post both relates to some of the stuff I'll be presenting at Friday's STOC workshop on Algorithms with Predictions, but is also for future students in my classes, who sometimes wonder why I have them write code on theory material.  (Somehow this might be a theme for a lecture in my grad class next semester, so maybe these are a first attempt at notes for the lecture.  Comments  and  suggestions welcome.)<br/><br/>Some of the work I'm doing is looking at how queueing systems perform with various sorts of predictions on the times the jobs take.  This particular work I'm doing on my own.  (While most of my research has been and is with collaborators, and it's one of the things I enjoy about computer science -- we're a very collaborative field!, which seems to surprise many people -- I still sometimes like to do research projects on my own.  I've looked at queueing systems since my PhD thesis, and it's a bit outside the research interest of most of my collaborator pool, and it's "fun" sometimes to do my own thing.  The reason why "fun" is in quotes is described below.)  <br/><br/>Often in my work in queueing I'm looking at mean-field limits (meant to model infinite systems of queues, which provides a good approximation for large finite systems under reasonable assumptions), where I can derive families of differential equations describing the system behavior.  I can also simulate the large finite system directly, and make sure the results match.  I generally do this for all of these types of papers.<br/><br/>Now the numbers I get from simulating the system directly and from simulating the differential equations should match (say within 1% or so).  If they don't, something is wrong.  In an effort to avoid wrongness, I won't consider the paper ready for outside consumption until I get a match.  Unfortunately, there are three ways things can go wrong.<br/><br/>1.  My simulation code for the queueing system might have bugs.<br/>2.  My code to evaluate the differential equations might have bugs.<br/>3.  My equations themselves might have bugs.<br/><br/>And I find there are two main categories of bugs.  Sometimes the bugs are simple/standard coding mistakes -- I'm off by 1 on an index, or I cut and paste and forget to change an i++ to a j++ in one my double loops, or I type x instead of a y.  Usually it's pretty easy to find these things, although I've had times where a hidden typo took hours to find.  But sometimes the bug is a thinking mistake -- I've forgotten a subcase and so my equations aren't complete (and so my code evaluating the equations won't give the right answer), or I've not handled a subcase correctly in my simulation.  That type usually takes longer. <br/><br/>Usually, the first time through, most all of these types of bugs happen -- my math is off, I've typed some stuff wrong, it can all happen.  And then, like coders everywhere, I go through and fix it.  And it's painful.  Sometimes everything goes right, a quick check or two and everything works.  For more complicated stuff, it's more time figuring out what went wrong than setting up the code to begin with.  And being the personality type to not let things sit, that can mean late nights figuring out what went wrong.<br/><br/>For my talk this week, there was one last problem I wanted to include, which meant finally taking the model and writing the equations and code.  I didn't even need it for the talk, but it's also the last bit before I put a paper draft on arxiv, so taking advantage of a deadline, I figured now was the time.  Which means the last 2 days, I've spent many hours (and a late night) trying to remove the disagreements.<br/><br/>On the plus side, when everything finally works, it's a wonderful feeling.  And it always makes me feel better when I have worked to verify my math this way;  this time, what kept me up well past midnight and took several hours to track down was actually a boundary case I had left out of the equations.  (I had looked at the equations over and over again without noticing I had left out the subcase;  I had to step through numbers from the differential equations one time step at a time to track down what was missing, and then the numbers told me what I had done wrong.)<br/><br/>On the down side, it's work, and debugging is never particularly fun.<br/><br/>For students out there, maybe I'm just explaining that I understand the pain that I am putting you through.  You may wonder why I have you do simulations that take a few hours if you do them well, but days if you don't think through the best approach.  But using programming and theory together can be powerful;  it's helped me countless times in my research.<br/><br/>(Related: on theory and experiments that <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191184-theory-without-experiments/fulltext">I've written on before</a>, along with <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191183-experiments-as-research-validation/fulltext">a viewpoint by Jeffrey Ullman</a>.)<br/><br/><br/></div>

    <title>TR20-096 |  On the asymptotic complexity of sorting | 

	Igor Sergeev</title>
    <summary>We investigate the number of pairwise comparisons sufficient to sort $n$ elements chosen from a linearly ordered set. This number is shown to be $\log_2(n!) + o(n)$ thus improving over the previously known upper bounds of the form $\log_2(n!) + \Theta(n)$. The new bound is achieved by the proposed group insertion sorting algorithm.</summary>

    <title>TR20-095 |  On Basing Auxiliary-Input Cryptography on NP-hardness via Nonadaptive Black-Box Reductions | 

	Mikito Nanashima</title>
    <summary>A black-box (BB) reduction is a central proof technique in theoretical computer science. However, the limitations on BB reductions have been revealed for several decades, and the series of previous work gives strong evidence that we should avoid a nonadaptive BB reduction to base cryptography on NP-hardness (e.g., Akavia et al., 2006). Then should we also give up such a familiar proof technique even for an intermediate step towards cryptography?

In this paper, we continue to explore the capability of nonadaptive BB reductions and extend our knowledge on such a central technique out of the current (worst-to-average) framework. In particular, we investigate the attempt to base weaker cryptographic notions allowed to take auxiliary-input via nonadaptive BB reductions. As a result, we prove the following theorems: (1) if we base an auxiliary-input pseudorandom generator (AIPRG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses; (2) if we base an auxiliary-input one-way function (AIOWF) or auxiliary-input hitting set generator (AIHSG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then an (i.o.-)one-way function also exists based on NP-hardness (via an adaptive BB reduction).

The first result gives new evidence that nonadaptive BB reductions are insufficient to base AIPRG. The second result also yields a weaker but still surprising consequence of nonadaptive BB reductions, that is, a one-way function based on NP-hardness. In fact, the second result is interpreted as the following two opposite ways. Pessimistically, it shows that basing AIOWF or AIHSG via nonadaptive BB reductions is harder than constructing a one-way function based on NP-hardness, which can be regarded as a negative result. Note that AIHSG is a weak primitive implied even by the hardness of learning; thus, this pessimistic view gives conceptually stronger limitations than the currently known limitations on nonadaptive BB reductions. Optimistically, our result gives a new hope: a breakthrough construction of auxiliary-input primitives might also be useful to construct standard cryptographic primitives. This optimistic view enhances the significance of further investigation on constructing auxiliary-input or other intermediate cryptographic primitives instead of standard cryptographic primitives.</summary>

    <title>An equilibrium in nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>While there has been incredible progress in convex and nonconvex minimization, a multitude of problems in ML today are in need of efficient algorithms to solve min-max optimization problems. 
 Unlike minimization, where algorithms can always be shown to converge to some local minimum, there is no notion of a local equilibrium in min-max optimization that exists for general nonconvex-nonconcave functions.
    In two recent papers, we give  two notions of local equilibria that are guaranteed to exist and efficient algorithms to compute them.
In this post we present the key ideas behind a second-order notion of local min-max equilibrium from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> and in the next we will talk about a different notion along with the algorithm and show its implications to GANs from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12376">this paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="min-max-optimization">Min-max optimization</h2>

<p>Min-max optimization of an objective function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$</p>



<p>is a powerful framework in optimization, economics, and ML as it allows one to model learning in the presence of multiple agents with competing objectives.
In ML applications, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">GANs</a> and <a href="https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org">adversarial robustness</a>, the min-max objective function may be nonconvex-nonconcave.
We know that min-max optimization is at least as hard as minimization, hence, we cannot hope to find a globally optimal solution to min-max problems for general functions.</p>

<h2 id="approximate-local-minima-for-minimization">Approximate local minima for minimization</h2>

<p>Let us first revisit the special case of minimization, where there is a natural notion of an approximate second-order local minimum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$x$ is a second-order $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ if
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now suppose we just wanted to minimize a function $\mathcal{L}$, and we start from any point which is <em>not</em> at an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}$.
Then we can always find a direction to travel in along which either $\mathcal{L}$ decreases rapidly, or the second derivative of $\mathcal{L}$ is large.
 By searching in such a direction we can easily find a new point which has a smaller value of $\mathcal{L}$ using only local information about the gradient and Hessian of $\mathcal{L}$.
 This means that we can keep decreasing $\mathcal{L}$ until we reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum (see <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Boris_Polyak2/publication/220589612_Cubic_regularization_of_Newton_method_and_its_global_performance/links/09e4150dd2f0320879000000/Cubic-regularization-of-Newton-method-and-its-global-performance.pdf">Nesterov and Polyak</a>,  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3055399.3055464">here</a>,  <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Ge15.pdf">here</a>,  and also an earlier <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2016/03/22/saddlepoints">blog post</a> for how to do this with only access to gradients of $\mathcal{L}$).
 If $\mathcal{L}$ is Lipschitz smooth and bounded, we will reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum in polynomial time from any starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an analogous definition with similar properties for min-max optimization?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="problems-with-current-local-optimality-notions">Problems with current local optimality notions</h2>
<p>There has been much recent work on extending theoretical results in nonconvex minimization to min-max optimization (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00331">here</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9430-efficient-algorithms-for-smooth-minimax-optimization">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02629.pdf">here</a>,  <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9631-solving-a-class-of-non-convex-min-max-games-using-iterative-first-order-methods.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07512">here</a>.
One way to extend the notion of local minimum to the min-max setting is to seek a solution point called a “local saddle”–a point $(x,y)$ where 1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x, \cdot)$ and 2) $x$ is a local minimum for $f(\cdot, y).$</p>

<p>For instance,
 this is used  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00838.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10461.pdf">here</a>, and <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/adolphs19a.html">here</a>.
But, there are very simple examples of two-dimensional bounded functions where a local saddle does not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, consider $f(x,y) = sin(x+y)$ from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">here</a>. Check that none of the points on this function are simultaneously a local minimum for $x$ and local maximum for $y$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that no local saddle exists may be surprising, since an $\varepsilon$-global solution to a min-max optimization problem <em>is</em> guaranteed to exist as long as the objective function is uniformly bounded.
Roughly, this is because, in a global min-max setting, the max-player is empowered to globally maximize the function $f(x,\cdot)$, and the min-player is empowered to minimize the “global max” function $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$.</p>

<p>The ability to compute the global max  allows the min-player to  predict the max-player’s response.
If $x$ is a global minimum of $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$, the min-player is aware of this fact and will have no incentive to update $x$.
On the other hand, if the min-player can only simulate the max-player’s updates locally (as in local saddle),
then the min-player may try to update her strategy even when it leads to a net increase in $f$.
This can happen because the min-player is not powerful enough to accurately simulate the max-player’s response. (See  a  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">related notion</a> of local optimality with similar issues due to vanishingly small updates.)</p>

<p>The fact that players who can only make local predictions are
unable to predict their opponents’ responses can lead to convergence problems in many popular algorithms such as<br/>
gradient descent ascent (GDA). This non-convergence behavior can occur if the function has no local saddle point (e.g. the function $sin(x+y)$  mentioned above), and can even happen on some functions, like $f(x,y) = xy$ which do have a local saddle point.</p>

<br/>
<b>Figure 1.</b> GDA spirals off to infinity from almost every starting point on the objective function $f(x,y) = xy$.

<h2 id="greedy-max-a-computationally-tractable-alternative-to-global-max">Greedy max: a computationally tractable alternative to global max</h2>

<p>To allow for a more stable min-player, and a more stable notion of local optimality, we would like to empower the min-player to more effectively simulate the max-player’s response. 
While the notion of global min-max does exactly this by having the min-player compute the global max function $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, computing the global maximum may be intractable.</p>

<p>Instead, we replace the global max function $\max_y (f(\cdot ,y))$ with a computationally tractable alternative. 
Towards this end, we restrict the max-player’s response, and the min-player’s simulation of this response, to updates which can be computed using any algorithm from a class of second-order optimization algorithms.
More specifically, we restrict the max-player to updating $y$ by traveling along continuous paths which start at the current value of $y$ and along which either $f$ is increasing or the second derivative of $f$ is positive.  We refer to such paths as greedy paths since they model a class of second-order “greedy” optimization algorithms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy path:</strong> A unit-speed path $\varphi:[0,\tau] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is greedy if $f$ is non-decreasing over this path, and for every $t\in[0,\tau]$
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roughly speaking, when restricted to updates obtained from greedy paths, the max-player will always be able to reach a point which is an approximate local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$, although there may not be a greedy path which leads the max-player to a global maximum.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<br/>
 <b>Figure 2.</b> <i>Left:</i> The light-colored region $\Omega$ is reachable from the initial point $A$ by a greedy path; the dark region is not reachable. <i>Right:</i> There is always a greedy path from any point $A$ to a local maximum ($B$), but a global maximum ($C$) may not be reachable by any greedy path.
</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To define an alternative to $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, we consider the local maximum point with the largest value of $f(x,\cdot)$ attainable from a given starting point $y$ by any greedy path.
We refer to the value of $f$ at this point as the <em>greedy max function</em>, and denote this value by $g(x,y)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy max function:</strong> 
    $g(x,y) = \max_{z \in \Omega} f(x,z),$
where $\Omega$ is points reachable from $y$ by greedy path.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="our-greedy-min-max-equilibrium">Our greedy min-max equilibrium</h2>
<p>We use the greedy max function to define a new second-order notion of local optimality for min-max optimization, which we refer to as a greedy min-max equilibrium.
Roughly speaking, we say that $(x,y)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if 
1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$ (and hence the endpoint of a greedy path), and 
2) if $x$ is a local minimum of the greedy max function $g(\cdot,y)$.</p>

<p>In other words, $x$ is a local minimum of $\max_y f(\cdot, y)$ under the constraint that the maximum is computed only over the set of greedy paths starting at $y$.
Unfortunately, even if $f$ is smooth, the greedy max function may not be differentiable with respect to $x$ and may even be discontinuous.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2_grid_t.png" width="400"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2g_grid_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 3.</b> <i>Left:</i> If we change $x$ from one value $x$ to a very close value $\hat{x}$, the largest value of $f$ reachable by greedy path undergoes a discontinuous change.  <i>Right:</i>  This means the greedy max function $g(x,y)$ is discontinuous in $x$.</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>This creates a problem, since the definition of $\varepsilon$-local minimum only applies to smooth functions.</p>

<p>To solve this problem we would ideally like to smooth $g$ by convolution with a Gaussian.
Unfortunately, convolution can cause the local minima of a function to “shift”– a point which is a local minimum for $g$ may no longer be a local minimum for the convolved version of $g$ (to see why, try convolving the function $f(x) = x - 3x I(x\leq 0) + I(x \leq 0)$ with a Gaussian $N(0,\sigma^2)$ for any $\sigma&gt;0$).
To avoid this, we instead consider a “truncated” version of $g$, and then convolve this function in the $x$ variable with a Gaussian to obtain our smoothed version of $g$.</p>

<p>This allows us to define a notion of greedy min-max equilibrium.  We say that a point $(x^\star, y^\star)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if $y^\star$ is an approximate local maximum of $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, and $x^\star$ is an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of this smoothed version of $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Greedy min-max equilibrium:</b>
$(x^{\star}, y^{\star})$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if

 
where $S(x,y):= \mathrm{smooth}_x(\mathrm{truncate}(g(x, y))$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any point which is a local saddle point (talked about earlier) also satisifeis our equilibrium conditions. The converse, however, cannot be true as a local saddle point may not always exist. Further, for compactly supported convex-concave functions a point is a greedy min-max equilibrium (in an appropriate sense) if and only if it is a global min-max point. (See Section 7 and Appendix A respectively in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">our paper</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="greedy-min-max-equilibria-always-exist-and-can-be-found-efficiently">Greedy min-max equilibria always exist! (And can be found efficiently)</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> we show: A greedy min-max equilibrium is always guaranteed to exist provided that $f$ is uniformly bounded with Lipschitz Hessian. We do so by providing an algorithm which converges to a greedy min-max equilibrium, and, moreover, we show that it is able to do this in polynomial time from any initial point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Main theorem:</b> Suppose that we are given access to a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and to its gradient and Hessian.  And suppose that $f$ is unformly bounded by $b&gt;0$ and has $L$-Lipschitz Hessian.
Then given any initial point, our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-greedy min-max equilibrium $(x^\star,y^\star)$ of $f$ in $\mathrm{poly}(b, L, d, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of difficulties that our algorithm and proof must overcome:
One difficulty in designing an algorithm is that the greedy max function may be discontinuous. 
To find an approximate local minimum of a discontinuous function, our algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo hill climbing algorithm with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0408007">zeroth-order optimization version</a> of stochastic gradient descent.
Another difficulty is that, while one can easily compute a greedy path from any starting point, there may be many different greedy paths which end up at different local maxima.
Searching for the greedy path which leads to the local maximum point with the largest value of $f$ may be infeasible.
In other words the greedy max function $g$ may be intractable to compute.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/greedy_paths_no_axes_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 4.</b>There are many different greedy paths that start at the same point $A$.  They can end up at different local maxima ($B$, $D$), with different values of $f$.  In many cases it may be intractable to search over all these paths to compute the greedy max function.
 </div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To get around this problem, rather than computing the exact value of $g(x,y)$, we instead compute a lower bound $h(x,y)$ for the greedy max function. Since we are able to obtain this lower bound by computing only a <em>single</em> greedy path, it is much easier to compute than greedy max function.</p>

<p>In our paper, we prove that if 1) $x^\star$ is an approximate local minimum for the this lower bound $h(\cdot, y^\star)$, and  2) $y^\star$ is a an approximate local maximum for $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, then $x^\star$ is also an approximate local minimum for the greedy max $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.
This allows us to design an algorithm which obtains a greedy min-max point by minimizing the computationally tractable lower bound $h$, instead of the greedy max function which may be intractable to compute.</p>

<h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude</h2>

<p>In this post we have shown how to extend a notion of second-order equilibrium for minimization to min-max optimization which is guaranteed to exist for any function which is bounded and Lipschitz, with Lipschitz gradient and Hessian.
We have also shown that our algorithm is able to find this equilibrium in  polynomial time from any initial point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our results do not require any additional assumptions such as convexity, monotonicity, or sufficient bilinearity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an upcoming blog post we will show how one can use some of the ideas from here to obtain a new min-max optimization algorithm with applications to stably training GANs.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-094 |  Is it possible to improve Yao’s XOR lemma using reductions that exploit the efficiency of their oracle? | 

	Ronen Shaltiel</title>
    <summary>Yao's XOR lemma states that for every function $f:\set{0,1}^k \ar \set{0,1}$, if $f$ has hardness $2/3$ for $P/poly$ (meaning that for every circuit $C$ in $P/poly$, $\Pr[C(X)=f(X)] \le 2/3$ on a uniform input $X$), then the task of computing $f(X_1) \oplus \ldots \oplus f(X_t)$ for sufficiently large $t$ has hardness $\half +\epsilon$ for $P/poly$.

Known proofs of this lemma cannot achieve $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k^{\omega(1)}}$, and even for $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k}$, we do not know how to replace
$P/poly$ by AC$^0[\textsc{parity}]$ (the class of constant depth circuits with the gates $\set{\textsc{and,or,not,parity}}$ of unbounded fan-in).

Recently, Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola (FOCS 2018) (building on a sequence of earlier works) showed that these limitations cannot be circumvented by \emph{black-box reductions}. Namely, by reductions $\Red^{(\cdot)}$ that given oracle access to a function $D$ that violates the conclusion of Yao's XOR lemma, implement a circuit that violates the assumption of Yao's XOR lemma.

There are a few known reductions in the related literature on worst-case to average case reductions that are \emph{non-black box}. Specifically, the reductions of Gutfreund, Shaltiel and Ta Shma (Computational Complexity 2007) and  Hirahara (FOCS 2018)) are ``class reductions'' that are only guaranteed to succeed when given oracle access to an oracle $D$ from some efficient class of algorithms. These works seem to circumvent some black-box impossibility results.

In this paper we extend the previous limitations of Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola to class reductions, giving evidence that class reductions cannot yield the desired improvements in Yao's XOR lemma.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first limitation on reductions for hardness amplification that applies to class reductions.

Our technique imitates the previous lower bounds for black-box reductions, replacing the inefficient oracle used in that proof, with an efficient one that is based on limited independence, and developing tools to deal with the technical difficulties that arise following this replacement.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (6/24):</span></strong> For further thoughts and context about this unfolding saga, see <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/06/slate-star-codex-must-remain-anonymous/">this excellent piece by Tom Chivers</a> (author of <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em>, so far the only book about the rationalist community, one that I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4361">reviewed here</a>).</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>This morning, like many others, I woke up to the terrible news that Scott Alexander—the man I call “the greatest Scott A. of the Internet”—has <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">deleted SlateStarCodex in its entirety</a>.  The reason, Scott explains, is that the <em>New York Times</em> was planning to run an article about SSC.  Even though the article was going to be <em>positive</em>, NYT decided that by policy, it would need to include Scott’s real surname (Alexander is his middle name).  Scott felt that revealing his name to the world would endanger himself and his psychiatry patients.  Taking down his entire blog was the only recourse that he saw.</p>



<p>The NYT writer, Cade Metz, was someone who I’d previously known and trusted from his reporting on Google’s quantum supremacy experiment.  So in recent weeks, I’d spent a couple hours on the phone with Cade, answering his questions about the rationality community, the history of my interactions with it, and why I thought SlateStarCodex spoke to so many readers.  Alas, when word got around the rationality community that Cade was writing a story, a huge panic arose that he was planning on some sort of <em>Gawker</em>-style hit piece or takedown.  Trying to tamp down the fire, I told Scott Alexander and others that I knew Cade, his intentions were good, he was only trying to understand the community, and everyone should help him by talking to him openly.</p>



<p>In a year of historic ironies, here’s another one: that it was the decent, reasonable, and well-meaning Cade Metz, rather than any of the SneerClubbers or Twitter-gangsters who despised Scott Alexander for sharing his honest thoughts on hot-button issues, who finally achieved the latter’s dark dream of exiling Scott from the public sphere.</p>



<p>The recent news had already been bad enough: Trump’s “temporary suspension” of J1 and H1B visas (which will deal a body blow to American universities this year, and to all the foreign scientists who planned to work at them), on top of the civil unrest, on top of the economic collapse, on top of the now-resurgent coronavirus.  But with no more SlateStarCodex, now I <em>really</em> feel like my world is coming to an end.</p>



<p>I’ve considered SSC to be the best blog on the Internet since not long after discovering it five years ago.  Of course my judgment is colored by one of the most notorious posts in SSC’s history (“Untitled”) being a ferocious defense of me, when thousands were attacking me and it felt like my life was finished.  But that’s merely what brought me there in the first place.  I stayed because of Scott’s insights about everything else, and because of the humor and humanity and craftsmanship of his prose.  Since then I had the privilege to become friends with Scott, not only virtually but in real life, and to meet dozens of others in the SSC community, in its Bay Area epicenter and elsewhere.</p>



<p>In my view, for SSC to be <em>permanently</em> deleted would be an intellectual loss on the scale of, let’s say, John Stuart Mill or Mark Twain burning their collected works.  That might sound like hyperbole, but not (I don’t think) to the tens of thousands who read Scott’s essays and fiction, particularly during their 2013-2016 heyday, and who went from casual enjoyment to growing admiration to the gradual recognition that they were experiencing, “live,” the works that future generations of teachers will assign their students when they cover the early twenty-first century.  The one thing that mitigates this tragedy is the hope that it will yet be reversed (and, of course, the fact that backups still exist in the bowels of the Internet).</p>



<p>When I discovered Scott Alexander in early 2015, the one issue that gave me pause was his strange insistence on maintaining pseudonymity, even as he was already then becoming more and more of a public figure.  In effect, Scott was trying to erect a firewall between his Internet persona and his personal and professional identities, and was <em>relying on the entire world’s goodwill</em> not to breach that firewall.  I thought to myself, “this can’t <em>possibly</em> last!  Scott simply writes too well to evade mainstream notice forever—and once he’s on the world’s radar, he’ll need to make a choice, about who he is and whether he’s ready to own his gifts to posterity under his real name.”  In retrospect, what astonishes me is that Scott has been able to maintain the “double life” for as long as he has!</p>



<p>In his takedown notice, Scott writes that it’s considered vitally important in psychiatry for patients to know almost nothing about their doctors, beyond their names and their areas of expertise.  That caused me to wonder: OK, but doesn’t the world already have enough psychiatrists who are ciphers to their patients?  Would it be so terrible to have one psychiatrist with a clear public persona—possibly even one who patients sought out <em>because</em> of his public persona, because his writings gave evidence that he’d have sympathy or insight about their conditions?  To become a psychiatrist, does one really need to take a lifelong vow of boringness—a vow never to do or say anything notable enough that one would be “outed” to one’s patients?  What would Freud, or Jung, or any of the other famous therapist-intellectuals of times past have thought about such a vow?</p>



<p>Scott also mentions that he’s gotten death threats, and harassing calls to his workplace, from people who hate him because of his blog (and who found his real name by sleuthing).  I wish I knew a solution to that.  For what it’s worth, my blogging has <em>also</em> earned me a death threat, and threats to sue me, and accusatory letters to the president of my university—although in my case, the worst threats came neither from Jew-hating neo-Nazis nor from nerd-bashing SJWs, but from crackpots enraged that I wouldn’t use my blog to credit their proof of P≠NP or their refutation of quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>When I started <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> back in 2005, I remember thinking: this is it.  From now on, the only secrets I’ll have in life will be ephemeral and inconsequential ones.  From this day on, every student in my class, every prospective employer, every woman who I ask on a date (I wasn’t married yet), can know whatever they want to know about my political sympathies, my deepest fears and insecurities, any of it, with a five-second Google search.  Am I ready for that?  I decided that I was—partly just because I‘ve never had the mental space to maintain multiple partitioned identities <em>anyway</em>, to remember what each one is or isn’t allowed to know and say!  I won’t pretend that this is the right decision for everyone, but it was my decision, and I stuck with it, and it wasn’t always easy but I’m still here and so evidently are you.</p>



<p>I’d be <em>overjoyed</em> if Scott Alexander were someday to reach a place in his life where he felt comfortable deciding similarly.  That way, not only could he enjoy the full acclaim that he’s earned for what he’s given to the world, but (much more importantly) his tens of thousands of fans would be able to continue benefitting from his insights.</p>



<p>For now, though, the brute fact is that Scott is obviously <em>not</em> comfortable making that choice.  That being so, it seems to me that, if the NYT was able to respect the pseudonymity of Banksy and many others who it’s reported on in the past, when revealing their real names would serve no public interest, then it should also be able to respect Scott Alexander’s pseudonymity.  Especially now that Scott has sent the most credible signal imaginable of how much he values that pseudonymity, a signal that astonished even me.  The world does not exist only to serve its rare geniuses, but surely it can make such trivial concessions to them.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-093 |  Reduction From Non-Unique Games To Boolean Unique Games | 

	Dana Moshkovitz, 

	Ronen Eldan</title>
    <summary>We reduce the problem of proving a "Boolean Unique Games Conjecture" (with gap $1-\delta$ vs. $1-C\delta$, for any $C&gt; 1$, and sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$) to the problem of proving a PCP Theorem for a certain non-unique game.
In a previous work, Khot and Moshkovitz suggested an inefficient candidate reduction (i.e., without a proof of soundness). 
The current work is the first to provide an efficient reduction along with a proof of soundness. 
The non-unique game we reduce from is similar to non-unique games for which PCP theorems are known.
Our proof relies on a new concentration theorem for functions in Gaussian space that are restricted to a random hyperplane. We bound the typical Euclidean distance between the low degree part of the restriction of the function to the hyperplane and the restriction to the hyperplane of the low degree part of the function.</summary>
