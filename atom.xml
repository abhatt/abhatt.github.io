    <title>TR22-084 |  Characterizing Derandomization Through Hardness of Levin-Kolmogorov Complexity | 

	Yanyi Liu, 

	Rafael Pass</title>
    <summary>A central open problem in complexity theory concerns the question of whether all efficient randomized algorithms can be simulated by efficient deterministic algorithms. We consider this problem in the context of promise problems (i.e,. the $\prBPP$ v.s. $\prP$ problem) and show that for all sufficiently large constants $c$, the following are \emph{equivalent}:
\BI
\item $\prBPP=\prP$.
\item For every $\BPTIME(n^c)$ algorithm $M$, and every sufficiently large $z \in \{0,1\}^n$, there exists some $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ such that $M$ fails to decide whether $Kt(x \mid z)$ is ``very large'' ($\geq n-1$) or ``very small'' ($\leq O(\log
n)$).
\EI
where $Kt(x \mid z$) denotes the Levin-Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ conditioned on $z$.

As far as we are aware, this yields the first full \emph{characterization} of when $\prBPP = \prP$ through the hardness of some class of problems. Previous hardness assumptions used for derandomization only provide a one-sided implication.</summary>

    <title>TR22-083 |  Hardness of Maximum Likelihood Learning of DPPs | 

	Elena Grigorescu, 

	Brendan Juba, 

	Karl  Wimmer, 

	Ning Xie</title>
    <summary>Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are a widely used probabilistic model for negatively correlated sets. DPPs have been successfully employed in Machine Learning applications to select a diverse, yet representative subset of data. In these applications, the parameters of the DPP need to be fitted to match the data; typically, we seek a set of parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data. The algorithms used for this task to date either optimize over a limited family of DPPs, 
or use local improvement heuristics that do not provide theoretical guarantees of optimality.
   
It is natural to ask if there exist efficient algorithms for finding a maximum likelihood DPP model for a given data set. In seminal work on DPPs in Machine Learning, Kulesza conjectured in his PhD Thesis (2011) that the problem is NP-complete. 
The lack of a formal proof  prompted Brunel, Moitra, Rigollet and Urschel (COLT 2017) to conjecture that, 
in opposition to Kulesza's conjecture, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a maximum-likelihood DPP. They also presented some preliminary evidence supporting their conjecture.
   
In this work we prove Kulesza's conjecture. In fact, we prove the following stronger hardness of approximation result: even computing a $\left(1-O(\frac{1}{\log^9{N}})\right)$-approximation to the maximum log-likelihood of a DPP on a ground set of $N$ elements is NP-complete. At the same time, we also obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a nontrivial worst-case approximation 
to the optimal log-likelihood: the approximation factor is $\frac{1}{(1+o(1))\log{m}}$ unconditionally (for data sets that consist of $m$ subsets), and can be improved to $1-\frac{1+o(1)}{\log N}$ if all $N$ elements appear in a $O(1/N)$-fraction of the subsets.
   
In terms of techniques, we reduce approximating the maximum log-likelihood of DPPs on a data set to 
solving a gap instance of a ``vector coloring" problem on a  hypergraph. Such a hypergraph is built on a bounded-degree graph construction of Bogdanov, Obata and Trevisan (FOCS 2002), and is further enhanced by the strong  expanders of  Alon and Capalbo (FOCS 2007) to serve our purposes.</summary>

with machine-learned predictions. In the classical problem, there is a stream
of requests released over time along the real line. The goal is to minimize the
makespan of the algorithm. We distinguish between the open variant and the
closed one, in which we additionally require the algorithm to return to the
origin after serving all requests. The state of the art is a $1.64$-competitive
algorithm and a $2.04$-competitive algorithm for the closed and open variants,
respectively \cite{Bjelde:1.64}. In both cases, a tight lower bound is known
\cite{Ausiello:1.75, Bjelde:1.64}.
</p>
<p>In both variants, our primary prediction model involves predicted positions
of the requests. We introduce algorithms that (i) obtain a tight 1.5
competitive ratio for the closed variant and a 1.66 competitive ratio for the
open variant in the case of perfect predictions, (ii) are robust against
unbounded prediction error, and (iii) are smooth, i.e., their performance
degrades gracefully as the prediction error increases.
</p>
<p>Moreover, we further investigate the learning-augmented setting in the open
variant by additionally considering a prediction for the last request served by
the optimal offline algorithm. Our algorithm for this enhanced setting obtains
a 1.33 competitive ratio with perfect predictions while also being smooth and
robust, beating the lower bound of 1.44 we show for our original prediction
setting for the open variant. Also, we provide a lower bound of 1.25 for this
enhanced setting.

feedback vertex set number) at most logarithmic in the number of vertices,
which is sharp already for $k=2$. As a consequence, most of the central
NP-complete problems (such as Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Vertex Cover,
Minimum Dominating Set, Minimum Coloring) can be solved in polynomial time in
these graphs, and in particular deciding the $O_k$-freeness of sparse graphs is
polytime.

vertex set of a graph such that every piece induces a connected subgraph. For
the case where we want to have partitions with linearly many pieces of bounded
size, we obtain approximate sampling algorithms based on Glauber dynamics which
are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the bandwidth of $G$, with
simple-exponential dependence on the bandwidth. For example, for rectangles of
constant or logarithmic width this gives polynomial-time sampling algorithms.
More generally, this gives sub-exponential algorithms for bounded-degree graphs
without large expander subgraphs (for example, we obtain $O(2^{\sqrt n})$ time
algorithms for square grids).
</p>
<p>In the case where we instead want partitions with a small number of pieces of
linear size, we show that Glauber dynamics can have exponential mixing time,
even just for the case of 2 pieces, and even for 2-connected subgraphs of the
grid with bounded bandwidth.

2018] in the context of Data Compression and it represents a set of positions
of a finite word in which all of its factors can be "attracted". The smallest
size $\gamma^*$ of a string attractor for a finite word is a lower bound for
several repetitiveness measures associated with the most common compression
schemes, including BWT-based and LZ-based compressors. The combinatorial
properties of the measure $\gamma^*$ have been studied in [Mantaci et al.,
2021]. Very recently, a complexity measure, called string attractor profile
function, has been introduced for infinite words, by evaluating $\gamma^*$ on
each prefix. Such a measure has been studied for automatic sequences and
linearly recurrent infinite words [Schaeffer and Shallit, 2021]. In this paper,
we study the relationship between such a complexity measure and other
well-known combinatorial notions related to repetitiveness in the context of
infinite words, such as the factor complexity and the recurrence. Furthermore,
we introduce new string attractor-based complexity measures, in which the
structure and the distribution of positions in a string attractor of the
prefixes of infinite words are considered. We show that such measures provide a
finer classification of some infinite families of words.

nineties and has seen a resurgence of interest with the positive resolution of
their conjecture on directed reachability in DynFO DKMSZ18. Since then many
natural problems related to reachability and matching have been placed in DynFO
and related classes DMVZ18,DKMTVZ20,DTV21. In this work, we place some dynamic
problems from group theory in DynFO.
</p>
<p>In particular, suppose we are given an arbitrary multiplication table over n
elements representing an unstructured binary operation (representing a
structure called a magma). Suppose the table evolves through a change in one of
its n^2 entries in one step. For a set S of magma elements which also changes
one element at a time, we can maintain enough auxiliary information so that
when the magma is a group, we are able to answer the Cayley Group Membership
(CGM) problem for S and a target t (i.e. "Is t a product of elements from S? ")
using an FO query at every step. This places the dynamic CGM problem (for
groups) when the ambient magma is specified via a table in DynFO. In contrast,
for the table setting, statically CGM was known to be in the class Logspace
BarringtonM06. Building on the dynamic CGM result, we can maintain the
isomorphism of of two magmas, whenever both are Abelian groups, in DynFO.
</p>
<p>Our techniques include a way to maintain the powers of the elements of a
magma in DynFO using left associative parenthesisation, the notion of cube
independence to cube generate a subgroup generated by a set, a way to maintain
maximal cube independent sequences in a magma along with some group theoretic
machinery available from McKenzieCook. The notion of cube independent sequences
is new as far as we know and may be of independent interest. These techniques
are very different from the ones employed in Dynamic Complexity so far.

CertSDP, for solving a special class of semidefinite programs (SDPs) to high
accuracy. The class of SDPs that we consider, the exact QMP-like SDPs, is
characterized by low-rank solutions, a priori knowledge of the restriction of
the SDP solution to a small subspace, and standard regularity assumptions such
as strict complementarity. Crucially, we show how to use a certificate of
strict complementarity to construct a low-dimensional strongly convex minimax
problem whose optimizer coincides with a factorization of the SDP optimizer.
From an algorithmic standpoint, we show how to construct the necessary
certificate and how to solve the minimax problem efficiently. We accompany our
theoretical results with preliminary numerical experiments suggesting that
CertSDP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on large
sparse exact QMP-like SDPs.

    <title>The Quantum and Classical Streaming Complexity of Quantum and Classical Max-Cut</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kallaugher:John.html">John Kallaugher</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Parekh:Ojas.html">Ojas Parekh</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00213">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We investigate the space complexity of two graph streaming problems: Max-Cut
and its quantum analogue, Quantum Max-Cut. Previous work by Kapralov and
Krachun [STOC `19] resolved the classical complexity of the \emph{classical}
problem, showing that any $(2 - \varepsilon)$-approximation requires
$\Omega(n)$ space (a $2$-approximation is trivial with $\textrm{O}(\log n)$
space). We generalize both of these qualifiers, demonstrating $\Omega(n)$ space
lower bounds for $(2 - \varepsilon)$-approximating Max-Cut and Quantum Max-Cut,
even if the algorithm is allowed to maintain a quantum state. As the trivial
approximation algorithm for Quantum Max-Cut only gives a $4$-approximation, we
show tightness with an algorithm that returns a $(2 +
\varepsilon)$-approximation to the Quantum Max-Cut value of a graph in
$\textrm{O}(\log n)$ space. Our work resolves the quantum and classical
approximability of quantum and classical Max-Cut using $\textrm{o}(n)$ space.
</p>
<p>We prove our lower bounds through the techniques of Boolean Fourier analysis.
We give the first application of these methods to sequential one-way quantum
communication, in which each player receives a quantum message from the
previous player, and can then perform arbitrary quantum operations on it before
sending it to the next. To this end, we show how Fourier-analytic techniques
may be used to understand the application of a quantum channel.

The number of operations performed is bounded by a fixed power of $n$,

into "stages" in such a way that the operands of the operations in a given
stage are either matrix entries or the results of operations in earlier stages,
and the number of stages is bounded by a fixed power of the logarithm of $n$,
specifically $O\big((\log n)^2\big)$.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>When the <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a> wave washed over the world some months ago, I played along like everybody else, once a day collecting my rows of gray and gold and green letters. But my main interest was not in testing my linguistic intuitions; I wanted to write a computer program to solve the puzzle. Could I create something that would play a stronger game than I do? It’s now clear the answer to that question is yes, but I can’t say whether it’s because I’m such a hotshot programmer or such a mediocre Wordler.</p>
<p>I hasten to add that my motivation in this project is not to cheat. Josh Wardle, the creator of Wordle, took all the fun out of cheating by making it way too easy. Anybody can post impressive results like this one:</p>
<p><img alt="Image of the five green squares Wordle shows when you guess the word on the first try." border="0" class="centered" height="56" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wordle-share-image1.png" width="136"/></p>
<p class="undent">That lonely row of green squares indicates that you’ve solved the puzzle with a single brilliant guess. The Wordle app calls that performance an act of “Genius,” but if it happens more than once every few years, your friends may suspect another explanation.</p>
<p>The software I’ve written will not solve today’s puzzle for you. You can’t run the program unless you already know the answer. Thus the program won’t tell you, in advance, how to play; but it may tell you, retrospectively, how you <em>should have</em> played.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The aim in Wordle is to identify a hidden five-letter word. When you make a guess, the Wordle app gives you feedback by coloring the letter tiles. A green tile indicates that you have put the right letter in the right place. The rules are not quite as simple as they seem, as I’ll explain below.Gold means the letter is present in the target word, but not where you put it. Letters absent from the target word are marked with a gray tile.</p>
<p>Figure 1.<img alt="Example game of Wordle, showing the initial blank grid and four guesses: CRATE, BUILT, LIMIT, and finally LIGHT, which is the target word." border="0" class="alignleft" height="184" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/example_game_crop.png" width="640"/></p>
<p class="indent">The sequence of grids above records the progress of a game I played several weeks ago. The initial state of the puzzle is a blank grid with space for six words of five letters each. My first guess, CRATE <em>(far left)</em>, revealed that the letter T is present in the target word, but not in the fourth position; the other letters, CRAE, are absent. I then played BUILT and learned where the T goes, and that the letters I and L are also present. The third guess, LIMIT, got three letters in their correct positions, which was enough information to rule out all but one possibility. The four green tiles in row four confirm that LIGHT is the target word.</p>
<p>The official Wordle app gives you six chances to guess the Wordle-of-the-day. If you fill the grid with six wrong answers, the game ends and the app reveals the word you failed to find.</p>
<p>It’s important to bear in mind that Wordle is played in a closed universe. The word lists used throughout this essay come from the original version of the game published by Josh Wardle at <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/">powerlanguage.co.uk</a>. In February, when the game moved to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/">nytimes.com</a>, about two dozen words were shuffled around or removed. <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_1">Note 1</a> has further discussion of the word lists and the <em>Times</em>‘s revisions.The target words are drawn from a list of 2,315 possibilities, which are meant to be words familiar to anyone with a broad English vocabulary. All of these target words are also valid guess words. An additional 10,657 words are acceptable as guesses but will never appear as the Wordle-of-the-day. Many of these latter words are quite obscure, familiar only to the most serious Scrabble players. I call them the arcana.</p>
<p>Both of the word lists are downloaded to your web browser whenever you play the game, and you can examine or copy them by peeking at the JavaScript source code with your browser’s developer tools.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Conceptually, a Wordle-playing program conducts a dialogue between two compu­tational agents: the Umpire and the Player. The Umpire knows the target word, and responds to submitted guess words in much the same way the Wordle app does. It marks each of the five letters in the guess as either <em>correct</em>, <em>present</em>, or <em>absent</em>, corresponding to the Wordle color codes of green, gold, and gray.</p>
<p>The Player component of the program does <em>not</em> know the target word, but it has access to the lists of common and arcane words. On each turn, the Player selects a word from one of these lists, submits it to the Umpire, and receives feedback classifying each of the letters as <em>correct</em>, <em>present</em>, or <em>absent</em>. This infor­mation can then be used to help choose the next guess word. The guessing process continues until the Player identifies the target word or exhausts its six turns.</p>
<p>Here’s a version of such a program. Type in a start word and a target word, then press <em>Go</em>. Briefly displayed in gray letters are the words the program evaluates as possible next guesses. The most promising candidate is then submitted to the Umpire and displayed with the green-gold-gray color code.</p>
<p>Program 1.
</p>
<p class="undent">Feel free to play with the buttons below the grid. The “<code>?</code>” button will pop up a brief explanation. If you’d like to peek behind the curtain, the source code for the project is available <a href="https://github.com/bit-player/thewordler">on GitHub</a>. Also, a <a href="http://bit-player.org/extras/wordler/">standalone version</a> of the program may be more convenient if you’re reading on a small screen.</p>
<p>This program is surely not the best possible Wordler, but it’s pretty good. Most puzzle instances are solved in three or four guesses. Failures to finish within six guesses are uncommon if you choose a sensible starting word. The algorithms behind Program 1 will be the main subject of this essay, but before diving into them I would like to consider some simpler approaches to playing the game.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When I first set out to write a Wordler program, I chose the easiest scheme I could think of. At the start of a new game, the Player chooses a word at random from the list of 2,315 potential target words. (The arcana will not be needed in this program.) After submitting this randomly chosen word as a first guess, the Player takes the Umpire’s feedback report and uses it to sift through the list of potential targets, retaining those words that are still viable candidates and setting aside all those that conflict in some way with the feedback. The Player then selects another word at random from among the surviving candidates, and repeats the process. On each round, the list of candidates shrinks further.</p>
<p>The winnowing of the candidate list is the heart of the algorithm. Suppose the first guess word is COULD, and the Umpire’s evaluation is equivalent to this Wordle markup: <img alt="COULD colored gray, gold, gray, green, gray" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/COULD-with-coloring.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>. You can now go through the list of candidate words and discard all those that have a letter other than L in the fourth position. You can also eliminate all words that include any instance of the letters C, U, or D.  The gold letter O rules out all words in two disjoint classes: those that <em>don’t</em> have an O anywhere in their spelling, and those that <em>do</em> have an O in the second position. After this winnowing process, only seven words remain as viable candidates.</p>
<p>One aspect of these rules often trips me up when I’m playing. Wordle is not Wheel of Fortune: The response to a guess word might reveal that the target word has an L, but it doesn’t necessarily show you <em>all</em> the Ls. If you play COULD and get the feedback displayed above, you should not assume that the green L in the fourth position is the <em>only</em> L. The target word could be ATOLL, HELLO, KNOLL, or TROLL. (When both the guess and the target words have multiple copies of the same letter, the rules get even trickier. If you want to know the gory details, see <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_2">Note 2</a>.)</p>
<p>The list-winnowing process is highly effective. Even with a randomly chosen starter word, the first guess typically eliminates more than 90 percent of the target words, leaving only about 220 viable candidates, on average. In subsequent rounds the shrinkage is not as rapid, but it’s usually enough to identify a unique solution within the allotted six guesses.</p>
<p>I wrote the random Wordler as a kind of warmup exercise, and I didn’t expect much in the way of performance. Plucking words willy-nilly from the set of all viable candidates doesn’t sound like the shrewdest strategy. However, it works surprisingly well. The graph below shows the result of running the program on each of the 2,315 target words, with the experiment repeated 10,000 times to reduce statistical noise.</p>
<p>Figure 2.Guess criterion: random<br/>Guess pool: remaining target words<br/>Start word: randomly chosen<img alt="Bar chart showing the results of running the WordleRandomly algorithm 1,000 times on the data set of 2,315 target words." border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/graphWordleRandomly_1000.svg" width=""/></p>
<p class="undent">The average number of guesses needed to find the solution is 4.11, and only 2 percent of the trials end in failure (requiring seven or more guesses).</p>
<p>Incidentally, this result is quite robust, in the sense that the outcome doesn’t depend at all on the composition of the words on the target list. If you replace the official Wordle list with 2,315 strings of random letters, the graph looks the same.</p>
<p>The surprising strength of a random player might be taken as a sign that Wordle isn’t really a very hard game. If you are guided by a single, simple rule—play any word that hasn’t already been excluded by feedback from prior guesses—you will win most games. From another point of view the news is not so cheering: If a totally mindless strategy can often solve the puzzle in four moves, you may have to work really hard to do substantially better.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Still another lesson might be drawn from the success of the random player: The computer’s complete ignorance of English word patterns is not a major handicap and might even be an advantage. A human player’s judgment is biased by ingrained knowledge of differences in word frequency. If I see the partial solution BE _ _ _, I’m likely to think first of common words such as BEGIN and BENCH, rather than the rarer BELLE and BEZEL. In the Wordle list of potential targets, however, each of these words occurs with exactly the same frequency, namely 1/2315. A policy favoring common words over rare ones is not helpful in this game.</p>
<p>But a case can be made for a slightly different strategy, based on a preference not for common words but for common letters. A guess word made up of high-frequency letters should elicit more information than a guess consisting of rare letters. By definition, the high-frequency letters are more likely to be present in the target word. Even when they are absent, that fact becomes valuable know­ledge. If you make JIFFY your first guess and thereby learn that the target word does not contain a J, you eliminate 27 candidates out of 2,315. Playing EDICT and learning that the target has no E rules out 1,056 words.</p>
<p>The table below records the number of occurrences of each letter from A to Z in all the Wordle target words, broken down according to position within the word. For example, A is the first letter of 141 target words, and Z is the last letter of four words.</p>
<p>Figure 3.<img alt="Table of letter frequencies by position in the data set of target words." border="0" class="centered" height="182" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/table-of-letter-frequencies.png" width="640"/></p>
<p class="undent">The same information is conveyed in the heatmap below, where lighter colors indicate more common letters.</p>
<p>Figure 4.<img alt="Heat map representing letter frequencies as a range of colors from deep purple (lowest frequencies) through bright yellow (highest frequencies." border="0" class="alignleft" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/letterFreqHeatmapcrop.svg" width="640"/></p>
<p class="indent">These data form the basis of another Wordle-playing algorithm. Given a list of candidate words, we compute the sum of each candidate’s letter frequencies, and select the word with the highest score. For example, the word SKUNK gets 366 points for the initial S, then 10 points for the K in the second position, and so on through the rest of the letters for an aggregate score of 366 + 10 + 165 + 182 + 113 = 836. SKUNK would win over KOALA, which has a score of 832, but lose to PIGGY (851).</p>
<p>Testing the letter-frequency algorithm against all 2,315 target words yields this distribution of results:</p>

<p class="undent">The mean number of guesses is 3.83, noticeably better than the random-choice average of 4.11. The failure rate—words that aren’t guessed within six turns—is pushed down to 1.1 percent (28 out of 2,315).</p>
<p>There’s surely room for improvement in the letter-frequency algorithm. One weakness is that it treats the five positions in each word as independent variables, whereas in reality there are strong correlations between each letter and its neighbors. For example, the groups CH, SH, TH, and WH are common in English words, and Q is constantly clinging to U. Other pairs such as FH and LH are almost never seen. These attractions and repulsions between letters play a major role in human approaches to solving the Wordle puzzle (or at least they do in <em>my</em> approach). The letter-frequency program could be revised to take advantage of such knowledge, perhaps by tabulating the frequencies of bigrams (two-letter combinations). I have not attempted anything along these lines. Other ideas hijacked my attention.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Like other guessing games, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows">Bulls and Cows</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf">Mastermind</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_questions">Twenty Questions</a>, Wordle is all about acquiring the information needed to unmask a hidden answer. Thus if you’re looking for guidance on playing the game, an obvious place to turn is the body of knowledge known as information theory, formulated 75 years ago by Claude Shannon.</p>
<p>Shannon’s most important contribution (in my opinion) was to establish that information is a quantifiable, measurable substance. The unit of measure is the <em>bit</em>, defined as the amount of information needed to distinguish between two equally likely outcomes. If you flip a fair coin and learn that it came up heads, you have acquired one bit of information.</p>
<p>This scheme is easy to apply to the game of Twenty Questions, where the questions are required to have just two possible answers—yes or no. If each answer conveys one bit of information, 20 questions yield 20 bits, which is enough to distinguish one item among \(2^{20} \approx 1\) million equally likely possibilties. In general, if a collection of things has \(N\) members, then the quantity of information needed to distinguish one of its members is the base-2 logarithm of \(N\), written \(\log_2 N\).</p>
<p>In Wordle we ask no more than six questions, but answers are not just yes or no. Each guess word is a query submitted to the Umpire, who answers by coloring the letter tiles. There are more than two possible answers; in fact, there are 243 of them. As a result, a Wordle guess has the potential to yield much more than one bit of information. But there’s also the possibility of getting <em>less</em> than one bit.</p>
<p>Where does that curious number 243 come from? In the Umpire’s response to a guess, each letter is assigned one of three colors, and there are five letters in all. Hence the set of all possible responses has \(3^5 = 243\) members. Here they are, in all their poly­chrome glory:</p>
<p>Figure 6.<img alt="Tableau of color codes" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tableau_of_color_codes1.svg" width="900"/></p>
<p class="indent">These color codes represent every feedback message you could ever possibly receive when playing Wordle. (And then some! The five codes outlined in pink can never occur. <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_2">Note 2</a> explains why.) Each color pattern can be represented as a five-digit numeral in ternary (base-3) notation, with the digit 0 signifying <em>gray</em> or <em>absent</em>, 1 indicating <em>gold</em> or <em>present</em>, and 2 corresponding to <em>green</em> or <em>correct</em>. Because these are five-digit numbers, I’ve taken to calling them Zip codes. The all-gray 00000 code at the upper left appears in the Wordle grid when your guess has no letters in common with the target word. A solid-green 22222, at the bottom right, marks the successful conclusion of a game. In the middle of the grid is the all-gold 11111, which is reserved for “deranged anagrams”: Also OCEAN CANOE, REGAL GLARE, and NIGHT THING.pairs of words composed of the same letters but all in different positions, such as BOWEL and ELBOW, or BRUTE and TUBER.</p>
<p>When you play a guess word in Wordle, you can’t know in advance which of the 243 Zip codes you’ll receive as feedback, but you can know the spectrum of possibilities for that particular word. Program 2, <a href="https://github.com/bit-player/wordlespectrum.git">Source code</a> on GitHub.below, displays the spectrum graphically. When you enter a five-letter guess word, the program will pair it with each of the 2,315 target words and show how many of the pairings fall into each of the Zip-code categories.</p>
<p>Program 2.
</p>
<p>Each of the slender bars that grow from the baseline of the chart represents a single Zip-code, from all-gray at the far left, through all-gold in the middle, and on to all-green at the extreme right. The coloring of the bars interpolates between gray, gold, and green, based on the number of tiles with the corresponding color, but ignoring the position of those tiles within the word. Thus codes such as <img alt="01122 Zip code" border="0" height="16" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/01122-Zip-code.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 0.0px;" width="85"/> and <img alt="21021 Zip code" border="0" height="16" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/21021-Zip-code.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 0.0px;" width="85"/> get the same color in the bar chart.The height of each bar indicates (on a loga­rithmic scale) how often the guess receives the corresponding color code. If you hover the mouse pointer over a bar, the five letters in the tiles at the top of the display will be colored accordingly. (The meaning of the notations that appear in the “Statistics” box will be explained below.)</p>
<p>The pattern of short and tall bars in Program 2 is something like an atomic spectrum for Wordle queries. Each guess word generates a unique pattern. A word like MOMMY or JIFFY yields a sparse distribution, with a few very tall bars and wide empty spaces between them. The sparsest of all is QAJAQ (a word on the arcane list that seems to be a variant spelling of KAYAK): All but 18 of the 243 Zip codes are empty. Words such as SLATE, CRANE, TRACE, and RAISE, on the other hand, produce a dense array of shorter bars, like a lush carpet of grass, where most of the categories are occupied by at least one target word.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Can these spectra help us solve Wordle puzzles? Indeed they can! The guiding principle is simple: Choose a guess word that has a “flat” spectrum, distributing the target words uniformly across the 243 Zip codes. The ideal is to divide the set of candidate words into 243 equal-size subsets. Then, when the Umpire’s feedback singles out one of these categories for further attention, the selected Zip code is sure to have relatively few occupants, making it easier to determine which of those occupants is the target word. In this way we maximize the expected information gain from each guess.</p>
<p>This advice to spread the target words broadly and thinly across the space of Zip codes may seem obvious and in no need of further justification. If you feel that way, read on. Those who need persuading (as I did) should consult <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_3">Note 3</a>. </p>
<p>The ideal of distributing words with perfect uniformity across the Wordle spectrum is, lamentably, unattainable. None of the 12,972 available query words achieves this goal. The spectra all have lumps and bumps and bare spots. The best we can do is choose the guess that comes closest to the ideal. But how are we to gauge this kind of closeness? What mathematical criterion should we adopt to compare those thousands of spiky spectra?</p>
<p>Information theory again waves its hand to volunteer an answer, promising to measure the number of bits of information one can expect to gain from any given Wordle spectrum. The tool for this task is an equation that appeared in Shannon’s 1948 paper “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.” I have taken some liberties with the form of the equation, adapting it to the peculiarities of the Wordle problem and also trying to make its meaning more transparent. For the mathematical details see <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_4">Note 4</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the equation in my preferred format:</p>
<p>\[H_w = \sum_{\substack{i = 1\\n_i \ne 0}}^{242} \frac{n_i}{m} (\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i) .\]</p>
<p class="undent">\(H_w\), the quantity we are computing, is the amount of information we can expect to acquire by playing word \(w\) as our next guess. According to an <a href="http://www.eoht.info/page/Neumann-Shannon%20anecdote">oft-told tale</a>, Shannon adopted the term <em>entropy</em> at the suggestion of John von Neumann, who pointed out that “no one knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.” The letter \(H\) (which might be a Greek Eta) was introduced by Ludwig Boltzmann.Shannon named this quantity <em>entropy</em>, in analogy with the measure of disorder in physics. A Wordle spectrum has higher entropy when the target words are more broadly dispersed among the Zip codes.</p>
<p>On the righthand side of the equation we sum contributions from all the occupied Zip codes in \(w\)’s Wordle spectrum. The index \(i\) on the summation symbol \(\Sigma\) runs from 0 to 242 (which is 00000 to 22222 in ternary notation), enumerating all the Zip codes in the spectrum. The variable \(n_i\) is the number of target words assigned to Zip code \(i\), and \(m\) is the total number of target words included in the spectrum. At the start of the game, \(m = 2{,}315\), but after each guess it gets smaller.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the expression in parentheses. Here \(\log_2 m\) is the amount of information—the number of bits—needed to distinguish the target word among all \(m\) candidates. Likewise \(\log_2 n_i\) is the number of bits needed to pick out a single word from among the \(n_i\) words in Zip code \(i\). The difference between these quantities, \(\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i\), is the amount of information we gain if Zip code \(i\) turns out to be the correct choice—if it harbors the target word and is therefore selected by the Umpire. </p>
<p>Perhaps a numerical example will help make all this clearer. If \(m = 64\), we have \(\log_2 m = 6\): It would take 6 bits of information to single out the target among all 64 candidates. If the target is found in Zip code \(i\) and \(n_i = 4\), we still need \(\log_2 4 = 2\) bits of information to pin down its identity. Thus in going from \(m = 64\) to \(n_i = 4\) we have gained \(6 - 2 = 4\) bits of information.</p>
<p>So much for what we stand to gain if the target turns out to live in Zip code \(i\). We also have to consider the probability of that event. Intuitively, if there are more words allocated to a Zip code, the target word is more likely to be among them. The probability is simply \(n_i / m\), the fraction of all \(m\) words that land in code \(i\). Hence \(n_i / m\) and \(\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i\) act in opposition. Piling more words into Zip code \(i\) increases the probability of finding the target there, but it also increases the difficulty of isolating the target among the \(n_i\) candidates.</p>
<p>Each Zip code makes a contribution to the total expected information gain; the contribution of Zip code \(i\) is equal to the product of \(n_i / m\) and \(\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i\). Summing the contributions coming from all 243 categories yields \(H_w\), the amount of information we can expect to gain from playing word \(w\).</p>
<p>In case you find programming code more digestible than either equations or words, here is a JavaScript function for computing \(H_w\). The argument <code>spectrum</code> is an array of 243 numbers representing counts of words assigned to all the Zip codes.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>function entropy(spectrum) {
  const nzspectrum = spectrum.filter(x =&gt; x &gt; 0);
  const m = sum(spectrum);
  let H = 0;
  for (let n of spectrum) {
    H += n/m * (log2(m) - log2(n));
  }
  return H;
}
</code></pre>
<p class="undent">In Program 2, this code calculates the entropy value labeled \(H\) in the Statistics panel. The same function is invoked in Program 1 when the “Maximize entropy” algorithm is selected.</p>
<p>Before leaving this topic behind, it’s worth pausing to consider a few special cases. If \(n_i = 1\) (<em>i.e.</em>, there’s just a single word in Zip code \(i\)), then \(\log_2 n_i = 0\), and the information gain is simply \(\log_2 m\); we have acquired all the information we need to solve the puzzle. This result makes sense: If we have narrowed the choice down to a single word, it has to be the target. Now suppose  \(n_i = m\), meaning that all the candidate words have congregated in a single Zip code. Then we have \(\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i = 0\), and we gain nothing by choosing word \(w\). We had \(m\) candidates before the guess, and we still have \(m\) candidates afterward.</p>
<p>What if \(n_i = 0\)—that is, Zip code \(i\) is empty? The base-2 logarithm is defined by the equation \(2^{\lambda} = N\), where \(\lambda\) is the logarithm of \(N\). But there is no number \(\lambda\) such that \(2^{\lambda} = 0\).That’s trouble, because the logarithm of 0 is undefined, and attempting to calculate it in a computer program will raise an error signal. In the entropy equation the subscript \(n_i \ne 0\) excludes all empty Zip codes from the summation. In the JavaScript function the expression <code>spectrum.filter(x =&gt; x &gt; 0)</code> does the same thing. This exclusion does no harm because if \(n_i\) is zero, then \(n_i / m\) is also zero, meaning there’s no chance that category \(i\) holds the winner. (If a Zip code has no words at all, it can’t have the winning word.)</p>
<p>\(H_w\) attains its maximum value when all the \(n_i\) are equal. As mentioned above, there’s no word \(w\) that achieves this ideal, but we can certainly calculate how many bits such a word would produce if it did exist. In the case of a first guess, each \(n_i\) must equal \(2315 / 243 \approx 9.5\), and the total information gain is \(\log_2 2315 - \log_2 9.5 \approx 7.9\) bits. This is an upper bound for a Wordle first guess; it’s the most we could possibly get out of the process, even if we were allowed to play any arbitrary string of five letters as a guess. As we’ll see below, no real guess gains as much as six bits.</p>
<hr/>
<p>These mathematical tools of information theory suggest a simple recipe for a Wordle-playing computer program. At any stage of the game the word to play is the one that elicits the most information about the target. We can estimate the information yield of each potential guess by computing its Wordle spectrum and applying the \(H_w\) equation to the resulting sequence of numbers. That’s what the JavaScript code below does.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>function maxentropy(guesswordlist, targetwordlist) {
	maxH = 0
	bestguessword = ""
	for (g in guesswordlist) {      // outer loop
		spectrum = []
		for t in targetwordlist {   // inner loop
			zipcode = score(g, t)
			spectrum(zipcode) += 1
		}
		H = entropy(spectrum)
		if (H &gt; maxH) {
			maxH = H
			bestguessword = g
		}
	}
	return bestguessword
}</code></pre>
<p class="undent">In this function the outer loop visits all the guess words; then for each of these words the inner loop sifts through all the potential target words, constructing a spectrum. When the spectrum for guess word <code>g</code> is complete, the <code>entropy</code> procedure computes the information <code>H</code> to be gained by playing word <code>w</code>. The <code>maxH</code> and <code>bestguessword</code> variables keep track of the best results seen so far, and ultimately <code>bestguessword</code> is returned as the result of the function.</p>
<p>This procedure can be applied at any stage of the Wordling process, from the first guess to the last. When choosing the first guess—the word to be entered in the blank grid at the start of the game—all 2,315 common words are equally likely potential targets. We also have 12,972 guess words to consider, drawn from both the common and arcane lists. Calculating the information gain for each such starter word reveals that the highest score goes to SOARE, at 5.886 bits. (SOARE is apparently either a variant spelling of SORREL, a reddish-brown color, or an obsolete British term for a young hawk.) ROATE, a variant of ROTE, and RAISE are not far behind.  At the bottom of the list is the notorious QAJAQ, providing just 1.892 bits of information.</p>
<p>Adopting SOARE as a starter word, we can then play complete games of Wordle with this algorithm, recording the number of guesses required to find all 2,315 target words. The result is a substantial improvement over the random and the letter-frequency methods.</p>
<p>Figure 7.Guess criterion: maximize entropy<br/>Guess pool: common and arcane<br/>Start word: SOARE<img alt="MaxH performance soare" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/maxH_performance_soare.svg" width=""/></p>
<p>The average number of guesses per game is down to about 3.5, and almost 96 percent of all games are won in either three or four guesses. Only one target word requires six guesses, and there are no lost games, requiring seven or more guesses. As a device for Wordling, Shannon’s information theory is quite a success!</p>
<hr/>
<p>Shannon’s entropy equation was explicitly designed for the function it performs here—finding the distribution with maximum entropy. But if we consider the task more broadly as looking for the most widely dispersed and most nearly uniform distribution, other approaches come to mind. For example, a statistician might suggest variance or standard deviation as an alternative to Shannon entropy. The standard deviation is defined as:</p>
<p>\[\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_i (n_i - \mu)^2}{N}},\]</p>
<p class="undent">where \(\mu\) is the average of the \(n_i\) values and \(N\) is the number of values. In other words, we are measuring how far the individual elements of the spectrum differ from the average value. If the target words were distributed uniformly across all the Zip codes, every \(n_i\) would be equal to \(\mu\), and the standard deviation \(\sigma\) would be zero. A large \(\sigma\) indicates that many \(n_i\) differ greatly from the mean; some Zip codes must be densely populated and others empty or nearly so. Our goal is to find the guess word whose spectrum has the smallest possible standard deviation.</p>
<p>In the Wordling program, it’s an easy matter to substitute minimum standard deviation for maximum entropy as the criterion for choosing guess words. The JavaScript code looks like this:In this case we <em>don’t</em> exclude empty Zip codes. Doing so would badly skew the results. A spectrum with all words crowded into a single Zip code would have \(\sigma = 0\), making it seem the most—rather than the least—desirable configuration.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>function stddev(spectrum) {
  const mu = sum(spectrum) / 243;
  const diffs = spectrum.map(x =&gt; x - mu);
  const variance = sum(diffs.map(x =&gt; x * x)) / 243;
  return Math.sqrt(variance);
}</code></pre>
<p> In Program 1, you can see the standard deviation algorithm in action by selecting the button labeled “Minimum std dev.” In Program 2, standard deviation values are labeled \(\sigma\) in the Statistics panel.</p>
<p>Testing the algorithm with all possible combinations of a starting word and a target word reveals that the smallest standard deviation is 22.02, and this figure is attained only by the spectrum of the word ROATE. Not far behind are RAISE, RAILE, and SOARE. At the bottom of the list, the worst choice by this criterion is IMMIX, with \(\sigma = 95.5\).</p>
<p>Using ROATE as the steady starter word, I ran a full set of complete games, surveying the standard-deviation program’s performance across all 2,315 target words. I was surprised at the outcome. Although the chart looks somewhat different—more 4s, fewer 3s—the average number of guesses came within a whisker of equalling the max-entropy result: 3.54 vs. 3.53. Of particular note, there are fewer words requiring five guesses, and a few more are solved with just two guesses.</p>
<p>Figure 8.Guess criterion: minimize standard deviation<br/>Guess pool: common and arcane<br/>Start word: ROATE<img alt="Bar chart showing the percent of Wordle puzzles solved in n guesses, for n=1 through n=7+, using minimum standard deviation to choose guesses." border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/minStdDevLong_roate.svg" width=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Why was I surprised by the strength of the standard-deviation algorithm? Well, as I said, Shannon’s \(H\) equation is a tool designed specifically for this job. Its mathematical underpinnings assert that no other rule can extract information with greater efficiency. That property seems like it ought to promise superior performance in Wordle. Standard deviation, on the other hand, is adapted to problems that take a different form. In particular, it is meant to measure dispersion in distributions with a normal or Gaussian shape. There’s no obvious reason to expect Wordle spectra to follow the normal law. Nevertheless, the \(\sigma\) rule is just as successful in choosing winners.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Following up on this hint that the max-entropy algorithm is not the only Wordle wiz, I was inspired to try a rule even simpler than standard deviation. In this algorithm, which I call “max scatter,” we choose the guess word whose spectrum has the largest number of occupied Zip codes. In other words, we count the bars that sprout up in Program 2, but we ignore their height. In the Statistics panel of Program 2, the max-scatter results are designated by the letter \(\chi\) (Greek chi), which I chose by analogy with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function">indicator function of set theory</a>. In Program 1, choose “Maximize scatter” to Wordle this way.</p>
<p>If we adopt the \(\chi\) standard, the best first guess in Wordle is TRACE, which scatters target words over 150 of the 243 Zip codes. Other strong choices are CRATE and SALET (148 codes each) and SLATE and REAST (147). The bottom of the heap is good ole QAJAQ, with 18.</p>
<p>Using TRACE as the start word and averaging over all target words, the performance of the scatter algorithm actually exceeds that of the max-entropy program. The mean number of guesses is 3.49. There are no failures requiring 7+ guesses, and only one target word requires six guesses.</p>
<p>Figure 9.Guess criterion: maximize scatter<br/>Guess pool: common and arcane<br/>Start word: TRACE<img alt="Bar chart showing the percent of Wordle puzzles solved in n guesses, for n=1 through n=7+, using maximum scatter to choose guesses." border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/maxScatterLong_trace.svg" width=""/></p>
<p class="indent">What I find most noteworthy about these results is how closely the programs are matched, as measured by the average number of guesses needed to finish a game. It really looks as if the three criteria are all equally good, and it’s a matter of indifference which one you choose. This (tentative) conclusion is supported by another series of experiments. Instead of starting every game with the word that appears best for each algorithm, I tried generating random pairs of start words and target words, and measured each program’s performance for 10,000 such pairings. Having traded good start words for randomly selected ones, it’s no surprise that performance is somewhat weaker across the board, with the average number of guesses hovering near 3.7 instead of 3.5. But all three algorithms continue to be closely aligned, with figures for average outcome within 1 percent. And in this case it’s not just the averages that line up; the three graphs look very similar, with a tall peak at four guesses per game.</p>
<p>Figure 10.<img alt="Three bar charts showing the percent of Wordle puzzles solved in n guesses, for n=1 through n=7+, with random pairs of start words and target words. From left to right the charts show results for max entropy, min standard deviation, and max scatter." border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/randompair_10000_comparison.svg" width="900"/></p>
<p class="indent">As I looked at these results, it occurred to me that the programs might be so nearly interchangeable for a trivial reason: because they are playing identical games most of the time. Perhaps the three criteria are similar enough that they often settle on the same sequence of guess words to solve a given puzzle. This <em>does</em> happen: There are word pairs that elicit exactly the same response from all three programs. It’s not a rare occurrence. But there are also plenty of examples like the trio of game grids in Figure 11, where each program discovered a unique pathway from FALSE to VOWEL.</p>
<p>Figure 11.<img alt="Comparison of Wordle trajectories for the starting word FALSE and the target word VOWEL with three algorithms: max entropy, min standard deviation, max scatter." border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/false-vowel-comparison.svg" width="640"/></p>
<p class="indent">A few further experiments show that the three programs arrive at three distinct solutions in about 35 percent of random games; in the other 65 percent, at least two of the three solutions are identical. In 20 percent of the cases all three are alike. Figure 12.<img alt="Unique unanimous graph" border="0" class="alignright" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unique_unanimous_graph.svg" width=""/>Figure 12 shows the relevant statistics for a sample of 5,000 games with random pairings of start and target words. (The notation \(H =\sigma =\chi\) refers to outcomes in which all programs yield the same result. In \(H \ne\sigma \ne\chi\) the three solutions are all distinct. The other three bars count individual pairwise matches.) The result for \(\sigma = \chi\) is a curiosity I don’t understand. It seems those two programs almost never agree unless \(H\) also concurs.</p>
<p>I puzzled over these observations for some time. If the algorithms discover wholly different paths through the maze of words, why are those paths so often the same length? I now have a clue to an answer, but it may not be whole story, and I would welcome alternative explanations.</p>
<hr/>
<p>My mental model of what goes on inside a Wordling program runs like this: The program computes the spectrum of each word to be considered as a potential guess, then computes some function—\(H\), \(\sigma\), or \(\chi\)—that reduces the spectrum to a single number. The number estimates the expected quality or efficiency of the word if it is taken as the next guess in the game. Finally we choose the word that either maximizes or minimizes this figure of merit (the word with largest value of \(H\) or \(\chi\), or the smallest value of \(\sigma\)).</p>
<p>So far so good, but there’s an unstated assumption in that scheme: I take it for granted that evaluating the spectra will always yield a single, unique extreme value of \(H\), \(\sigma\), or \(\chi\). What happens if two words are tied for first place? One could argue, of course, that if the words earn the same score, they must be equally good choices, and we should pick one of them at random or by some arbitrary rule. Even if there are three or four or a dozen co-leaders, the same reasoning should apply. But when there are two thousand words all tied for first place, I’m not so sure.</p>
<p>Can such massive traffic jams at the finish line actually happen in a real game of Wordle? At first I didn’t even consider the possibility. When I rated all possible starting words for the Shannon max-entropy algorithm, the ranking turned out to be a total order: In the list of 12,792 words there were no ties—no pairs of words whose spectra have the same \(H\) value. Hence there’s no ambiguity about which word is best, as measured by this criterion.</p>
<p>But this analysis applies only to the opening play—the choice of a first guess, when all the common words are equally likely to be the target. In the endgame the situation is totally different. Suppose the list of 2,315 common words has been whittled down to just five viable candidates for Wordle-of-the-day. When the five target words are sorted into Zip-code categories and the entropy of these patterns is calculated (excluding empty Zip codes), there are only seven possible outcomes, as shown in Figure 13. The patterns correspond to the seven ways of partitioning the number 5 (namely 5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, and 1+1+1+1+1).</p>
<p>Figure 13.The bars in these graphs could be rearranged in various ways, but the \(H\), \(\sigma\), and \(\chi\) measures give the same result for all permutations. <img alt="Spectra of five words" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/spectra_of_five_words.svg" width=""/></p>
<p class="indent">In this circumstance, the 12,972 guess words cannot all have unique values of \(H\). On the contrary, with only seven distinct values to go around, there must be thousands of tie scores in the ranking of the words. Thus the max-entropy algorithm cannot pick a unique winner; instead it assembles a large class of words that, from the program’s point of view, are all equally good choices. Which of those words ultimately becomes the next guess is more or less arbitrary. For the most part, my programs pick the one that comes first in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>The same arguments apply to the minimum-standard-deviation algorithm. As for the max-scatter function, that has numerous tied scores even when the number of candidates is large. Because the variable \(\chi\) takes on integer values in the range from 1 to 243 (and in practice never strays outside the narrower range 18 to 150), there’s no avoiding an abundance of ties.</p>
<p>The presence of all these co-leaders offers an innocent explanation of how the three algorithms might arrive at solutions that are different in detail but generally equal in quality. Although the programs pick different words, those words come from the same equivalence class, and so they yield equally good outcomes.</p>
<p>But a doubt persists. Can it really be true that hundreds or thousands of words are all equally good guesses in some Wordle positions?  Can you choose any one of those words and expect to finish the game in the same number of plays?</p>
<p>Let’s go back to Figure 11, where the maximum-entropy program follows the opening play of FALSE with DETER and then BINGO. Some digging through the entrails of the program reveals that BINGO is not the uniquely favored guess at this point in the progress of the game; VENOM, VINYL, and VIXEN are tied with BINGO at \(H = 3.122\) bits. The program chooses BINGO simply because it comes first alphabetically. As it happens, the choice is an unfortunate one. Any of the other three words would have concluded the game more quickly, in four guesses rather than five.</p>
<p>Does that mean we now have unequivocal evidence that the program is suboptimal? Not really. At the stage of the game where BINGO was chosen, there were still 10 viable possibilities for the target word. The true target might have been LIBEL, for example, in which case BINGO would have been superior to VENOM or VIXEN.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Human players see Wordle as a word game. What else could it be? To solve the puzzle you scour the dusty corners of your vocabulary, searching for words that satisfy certain constraints or fit a given template. You look for patterns of vowels and consonants and other curious aspects of English orthography. </p>
<p>For the algorithmic player, on the other hand, Wordle is a numbers game. What counts is maximizing or minimizing some mathematical function, such as entropy or standard deviation. The words and letters all but disappear. </p>
<p>The link between words and numbers is the Umpire’s scoring rule, with the spectrum of Zip codes that comes out of it. Every possible combination of a guess word and a target word gets reduced to a five-digit ternary number. Instead of computing each of these numbers as the need arises, we can precompute the entire set of Zip codes and store it in a matrix. The content of the matrix is determined by the letters of the words we began with, but once all the numbers have been filled in, we can dispense with the words themselves. Operations on the matrix depend only on the numeric indices of the columns and rows. We can retrieve any Zip code by a simple table lookup, without having to think about the coloring of letter tiles. </p>
<p>In exploring this matrix, let’s set aside the arcana for the time being and work only with common words. With 2,315 possible guesses and the same number of possible targets, we have \(2{,}315^2 \approx 5.4\) million pairings of a guess and a target. Each such pairing gets a Zip code, which can be represented by a decimal integer in the range from 0 to 242. Because these small numbers fit in a single byte of computer memory, the full matrix occupies about five-and-a-half megabytes.</p>
<p>Figure 14 is a graphic representation of the matrix. Each column corresponds to a guess word, and each row to a target word. The words are arranged in alphabetical order from left to right and top to bottom. The matrix element where a column intersects a row holds the Zip code for that combination. The color scheme is the same as in Program 2. The main diagonal (upper left to lower right) is a bright green stripe because each word when played against itself gets a score of 22222, equivalent to five green tiles. The blocks of lighter green all along the diagonal mark regions where guess words and target words share the same first letter and hence have scores with at least one green tile. The largest of these blocks is for words beginning with the letter S. A few other blocks are quite tiny, reflecting the scarcity of words beginning with J, K, Q, Y, and Z. A box for X is lacking entirely; the Wordle common list has no words beginning with X.</p>
<p>Figure 14.Mouseover to magnify<img alt="Score matrix HSL2" border="0" class="centered withLoupe" height="900" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/score_matrix_HSL2.png" width="900"/></p>
<p class="indent">Gazing deeply into the tweedy texture of Figure 14 reveals other curious structures, but some features are misleading. The matrix appears to be symmetric across the main diagonal: The point at (<em>a, b</em>) always has the same color as the point at  (<em>b, a</em>). But the symmetry is an artifact of the graphic presentation, where colors are assigned based only on the <em>number</em> of gray, gold, and green tiles, ignoring their positions within a word. The underlying mathematical matrix is not symmetric.</p>
<p>I first built this matrix as a mere optimization, a way to avoid continually recomputing the same Zip codes in the course of a long series of Wordle games. But I soon realized that the matrix is more than a technical speed boost. It encapsulates pretty much everything one might want to know about the entire game of Wordle.</p>
<p>Figure 15 presents a step-by-step account of how matrix methods lead to a Wordle solution. In the first stage <em>(upper left)</em> the player submits an initial guess of SLATE, which singles out column 1778 in the matrix (1778 being the position of SLATE in the alphabetized list of common words). The second stage <em>(upper right)</em> reveal’s the Umpire’s feedback, coloring the tiles as follows: <img alt="SLATE with gold tiles at S and T, gray elsewhere" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SLATE_colored_for_FIRST_10010.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>. To the human solver this message would mean: “Look for words that have an S (but not in front) and a T (but not in fourth position).” To the computer program the message says: “Look for rows in the matrix whose 1778th entry is equal to 10010 (base 3) or 84 (base 10). It turns out there are 24 rows meeting this condition, which are highlighted in blue. (Some lines are too closely spaced to be distinguished.) I have labeled the highlighted rows with the words they represent, but the labels are for human consumption only; the program has no need of them.</p>
<p>Figure 15.<img alt="Matrix solution four stages 900px" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/matrix_solution_four_stages_900px.svg" width="895"/></p>
<p>In the third panel <em>(lower left)</em>, the program has chosen a second guess word, TROUT, which earns the feedback <img alt="TROUT with a gold tiles at R and a green tile for the final T" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TROUT-colored-for-FIRST-01002.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>. I should mention that this is not a word I would have considered playing at this point in the game. The O and U make sense, because the first guess eliminated A and E and left us in need of a vowel; but the presence of two Ts seems wasteful. We already know the target word has a T, and pinning down where it is seems less important than identifying the target word’s other constituent letters. I might have tried PROUD here. Yet TROUT is a brilliant move! It eliminates 7 words that start with T, 12 words that don’t have an R, 17 words that have either an O or a U or both, and 4 words that don’t end in T. In the end only one word remains in contention: FIRST.</p>
<p>All this analysis of letter positions goes on only in my mind, not in the algorithm. The computational process is simpler. The guess TROUT designates column 2118 of the matrix. Among the 24 rows identified by the first guess, SLATE, only row 743 has the Zip code value 01002 (or 29 decimal) at its intersection with column 2118. Row 743 is the row for FIRST. Because it is the only remaining viable candidate, it must be the target word, and this is confirmed when it is played as the third guess <em>(lower right)</em>. </p>
<p>There’s something disconcerting—maybe even uncanny—about a program that so featly wins a word game while ignoring the words. Indeed, you can replace all the words in Wordle with utter gibberish—with random five-letter strings like SCVMI, AHKZB, and BOZPA—and the algorithm will go on working just the same. It has to work a little harder—the average number of guesses is near 4—but a human solver would find the task almost impossible.</p>
<p>The square matrix of Figure 14 includes only the common words that serve as both guesses and targets in Wordle. Including the arcane words expands the matrix to 12,972 columns, with a little more than 30 million elements. At low resolution this wide matrix looks like this:</p>
<p>Figure 16.<img alt="Score matrix HSL2 allwords lowres" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/score_matrix_HSL2_allwords_lowres.png" width="900"/></p>

<hr/>
<p>Commentators on Wordle have given much attention to the choice of a first guess: the start word, the sequence of letters you type when facing a blank grid. At this point in the game you have no clues of any kind about the composition of the target word; all you know is that it’s one of 2,315 candidates. Because this list of candidates is the same in every game, it seems  there might be one universal best starter word—an opening play that will lead to the smallest average number of guesses, when the average is taken over all the target words. Furthermore, because 2,315 isn’t a terrifyingly large number, a brute-force search for that word might be within the capacity of a less-than-super computer.</p>
<p>Start-word suggestions from players and pundits are a mixed lot. A website called <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/22884031/wordle-game-tips-best-first-guess-5-letter-words">Polygon</a> offers some whimsical ideas, such as FARTS and OUIJA. GameRant also has oddball options, including JUMBO and ZAXES. <a href="https://medium.com/@tglaiel/the-mathematically-optimal-first-guess-in-wordle-cbcb03c19b0a">Tyler Glaiel</a> offers better advice, reaching deep into the arcana to come up with SOARE and ROATE. Grant Sanderson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA">skillfully deduces</a> that CRANE is the best starter, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRed0Xmc2Wg">takes it all back</a>.</p>
<p>For each of the algorithms I have mentioned above (except the random one) the algorithm itself can be pressed into service to suggest a starter. For example, if we apply the max-entropy algorithm to the entire set of potential guess words, it picks out the one whose spectrum has the highest \(H\) value. As I’ve already noted, that word is SOARE, with \(H = 5.886\). Table 1 gives the 15 highest-scoring choices, based on this kind of analysis, for the max-entropy, min–standard deviation and max-scatter algorithms.</p>

<p>Perusing these lists reveals that they all differ in detail, but many of the same words appear on two or more lists, and certains patterns turn up everywhere. A disproportionate share of the words have the letters A, E, R, S, and T; and half the alphabet never appears in any of the lists.</p>
<p>Figure 17 looks at the distribution of starter quality ratings across the entire range of potential guess words, both common and arcane. The 12,972 starters have been sorted from best to worst, as measured by the max-entropy algorithm. The plot gives the number of bits of information gained by playing each of the words as the initial guess, in each case averaging over all 2,315 target words. </p>
<p>Figure 17.<img alt="First round starter rankings maxH" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/first_round_starter_rankings_maxH.svg" width=""/></p>
<p>The peculiar shape of the curve tells us something important about Wordling strategies. A small subset of words in the upper left corner of the graph make exceptionally good starters. In the first round of play they elicit almost six bits of information, which is half of what’s needed to finish the game. At the other end of the curve, a slightly larger cohort of words produce really awful results as starters, plunging down to the 1.8 bits of QAJAQ. In between these extremes, the slope of the curve is gradual, and there are roughly 10,000 words that don’t differ greatly in their performance.</p>
<p>These results might be taken as the last word on first words, but I would be a cautious about that. The methodology makes an implicit “greedy” assumption: that the strongest first move will always lead to the best outcome in the full game. It’s rather like assuming that the tennis player with the best serve will always win the match. Experience suggests otherwise. Although a strong start is usually an advantage, it’s no guarantee of victory.</p>
<p>We can test the greedy assumption in a straightforward if somewhat laborious way: For each proposed starter word, we run a complete set of 2,315 full games—one for each of the target words—and we keep track of the average number of guesses needed to complete a game. Playing 2,315 games takes a few minutes for each algorithm; doing that for 12,792 starter words exceeds the limits of my patience. But I have compiled full-game results for 30 starter words, all of them drawn from near the top of the first-round rankings. </p>
<p>Table 2 gives the top-15 results for each of the algorithms. Comparing these lists with those of Table 1 reveals that first-round supremacy is not in fact a good predictor of full-game excellence. None of the words leading the pack in the first-move results remain at the head of the list when we measure the outcomes of complete games.</p>

<p class="indent">What’s the lesson here? Do I recommend that when you get up in the morning to face your daily Wordle, you always start the game with REAST or TRACE or SALET or one of the other words near the top of these lists? That’s not <em>bad</em> advice, but I’m not sure it’s the <em>best</em> advice. One problem is that each of these algorithms has its own favored list of starting words. Your own personal Wordling algorithm—whatever it may be—might respond best to some other, idiosyncratic, set of starters.</p>
<p>Moreover, my spouse, who Wordles and <a href="https://www.quordle.com/#/">Quordles</a> and <a href="https://octordle.com/">Octordles</a> and <a href="https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html">Absurdles</a>, reminds me gently that it’s all a game, meant to be fun, and some people may find that playing the same word day after day gets boring.</p>
<p>Figure 18 presents the various algorithms at their shiny best, each one using the starter word that brings out its best performance. For comparison I’ve also included my own Wordling record, based on 126 games I’ve played since January. I’m proud to say that I Wordle better than a random number generator.</p>
<p>Figure 18.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>I turn now from the opening move to the endgame, which I find the most interesting part of Wordle—but also, often, the most frustrating. It seems reasonable to say that the endgame begins when the list of viable targets has been narrowed down to a handful, or when most of the letters in the target are known, and only one or two letters remain to be filled in.</p>
<p>Occasonally you might find yourself entering the endgame on the very first move. There’s the happy day when your first guess comes up all green—an event I have yet to experience. Or you might have a close call, such as playing the starter word EIGHT and getting this feedback: <img alt="EIGHT scored 4green" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/EIGHT-scored-4green.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>. Having scored four green letters, it looks like you’ve got an easy win. With high hopes, you enter a second guess of FIGHT, but again you get the same four greens and one gray. So you type out LIGHT next, and then MIGHT. After two more attempts, you are left with this disappointing game board:</p>
<p>Figure 19.<img alt="The IGHT catastrophe" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-IGHT-catastrophe.png" width="200"/></p>
<p>What seemed like a sure win has turned into a wretched loss. You have used up your six turns, but you’ve not found the Wordle-of-the-day. Indeed, there are still three candidate targets yet to be tried: SIGHT, TIGHT, and WIGHT. </p>
<p>The _ IGHT words are by no means the only troublemakers. Similar families of words match the patterns _ ATCH, _ OUGH, _ OUND, _ ASTE and _ AUNT. You can get into even deeper endgame woes when an initial guess yields three green tiles. For example, 12 words share the template S_ _ ER, 25  match _ O_ ER, and 29 are consistent with _ A_ ER. </p>
<p>These sets of words are challenging not only for the human solver but also, under some circumstances, for Wordling algorithms. In Program 1, choose the word list “Candidates only” and then try solving the puzzle for target words such as FOYER, WASTE, or VAUNT. Depending on your starter word, you are likely to see the program struggle through several guesses, and it may fail to find the answer within six tries.</p>
<p>The “Candidates only” setting requires the program to choose each guess from the set of words that have not yet been excluded from consideration as the possible target. For example, if feedback from an earlier guess has revealed that the target ends in T and has an I, then every subsequent guess must end in T and have an I. (Restricting guesses to candidates only is similar to the Wordle app’s “hard mode” setting, but a little stricter.)</p>
<p>Compelling the player to choose guesses that might be winners doesn’t seem like much of a hardship or handicap. However, trying to score a goal with every play is seldom the best policy. Other guesses, although they can’t possibly be winners, may yield more information.</p>
<p>An experienced and wordly-wise human Wordler, on seeing the feedback <img alt="EIGHT scored 4green" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/EIGHT-scored-4green.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>, would know better than to play for an immediate win. The prudent strategy is play a word that promises to reveal the identity of the one missing letter. Here’s an example of how that works.</p>
<p>Figure 20.
</p><div style="display: flex; padding: 20px 0px;">
<img alt="EIGHT FLOWN WIGHT" border="0" height="240" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/EIGHT_FLOWN_WIGHT.png" style="padding: 0px 0px;" width="200"/><img alt="EIGHT FLOWN MARSH SIGHT" border="0" height="240" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/EIGHT_FLOWN_MARSH_SIGHT.png" style="padding: 0px 0px;" width="200"/><img alt="EIGHT FLOWN MARSH TIGHT" border="0" height="240" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/EIGHT_FLOWN_MARSH_TIGHT.png" width="200"/>
</div>
<p>At left the second-guess FLOWN detects the presence of a W, which means the target can only be WIGHT. In the middle, FLOWN reveals only absences, but the further guess MARSH finds an S, which implies the target must be SIGHT. At right, the second and third guesses have managed to eliminate F, L, W, N, M, R, and S as initial letters, and all that’s left is the T of TIGHT.</p>
<p>This virtuoso performance is not the work of some International Grand­master of Wordling. It is produced by the max-entropy algorithm, when the program is allowed a wider choice of potential guesses. The standard-deviation and max-scatter algorithms yield identical results. There is no special logic built into any of these programs for deciding when to play to win and when to hunker down and gather more information. It all comes out of the Zip code spectrum: FLOWN and MARSH are the words that maximize \(H\) and \(\chi\), and that minimize \(\sigma\). And yet, when you watch the game unfold, it looks mysterious or magical.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The cautious strategy of accumulating intelligence before committing to a line of play yields better results on average, but it comes with a price. All of the best algorithms achieve their strong scores by reducing the number of games that linger for five or six rounds of guessing. However, those algorithms also reduce the number of two-guess games, an effect that has to be counted as collateral damage. Two-guess triumphs make up less than 3 percent of the games played by the Zip code–based programs. Contrast that with the letter-frequency algorithm: In most respects it is quite mediocre, but it wins more than 6 percent of its games in two guesses. And among my personal games, 7 percent are two-guess victories. (I don’t say this to brag; what it suggests is that my style of play is a tad reckless.)</p>
<p>The Zip code–based programs would have even fewer two-guess wins without a heuristic that improves performance in a small fraction of cases. Whenever the list of candidate target words has dwindled down to a length of two, there’s no point in seeking more information to distinguish between the two remaining words. Suppose that after the first guess you’re left with the words SWEAT and SWEPT as the only candidates. For your second guess you could play a word such as ADEPT, where either the A or the P would light up to indicate which candidate is the target. You would then have a guaranteed win in three rounds. But if you simply played one of the candidate words as your second guess, you would have a 50 percent chance of winning in two rounds, and otherwise would finish in three, for an average score of 2.5.</p>
<p>This heuristic is already implemented in the programs discussed above. It makes a noticeable difference. Removing it from the max-entropy program drops the number of two-guess games from 51 down to 35 (out of 2,315). </p>
<p>Can we go further with this idea? Suppose there are three candidates left as you’re preparing for the second round of guessing. The cautious, information-gathering strategy would bring consistent victory on the third guess. Playing one of the candidates leads to a game that lasts for two, three, or four turns, each with probability one-third, so the average is again three guesses. The choice appears to be neutral. In practice, playing one of the candidates brings a tiny improvement in average score—too tiny to be worth the bother. </p>
<p>Another optimization says you should always pick one of the remaining candidates for your sixth guess. Gathering additional information is pointless in this circumstance, because you’ll never have a chance to use it. However, the better algorithms almost never reach the sixth guess, so this measure has no payoff in practice.</p>
<p>Apart from minor tricks and tweaks like these, is there any prospect of building significantly better Wordling programs? I have no doubt that im­provement is possible, even though all my own attempts to get better results have failed miserably. </p>
<p>Getting to an average performance of 3.5 guesses per game seems fairly easy; getting much beyond that level may require new ideas. My impression is that existing methods work well for choosing the first guess and perhaps the second, but are less effective in closing out the endgame. When the number of candidates is small, the Zip code–based algorithms cannot identify a single best next guess; they merely divide the possibilities into a few large classes of better and worse guesses. We need finer means of discrimination. We need tiebreakers.</p>
<p>I’ll briefly mention two of my failed experiments. I thought I would try going beyond the Zip code analysis and computing for each combination of a guess word and a potential target word how much the choice would shrink the list of candidates. After all, the point of the game is to shrink that list down to a single word. But the plague of multitudinous ties afflicts this algorithm too. Besides, it’s computationally costly.</p>
<p>Another idea was to bias the ranking of the Zip code spectra, favoring codes that have more gold and green letter tiles, on the hypothesis that we learn more when a letter is present or correct. The hypothesis is disproved! Even tiny amounts of bias are detrimental.</p>
<p>My focus has been on reducing the average number of guesses, but maybe there are other goals worth pursuing. For example, can we devise an algorithm that will solve every Wordle with no more than four guesses? It’s not such a distant prospect. Already there are algorithms that exceed four guesses only in about 2 percent of the cases. </p>
<p>Perhaps progress will come from another quarter. I’ve been expecting someone to put one of the big machine-learning systems to work on Wordle. All I’ve seen so far is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00557">small-scale study</a>, based on the technique of reinforcement learning, done by Benton J. Anderson and Jesse G. Meyer. Their results are not impressive, and I am led to wonder if there’s something about the problem that thwarts learning techniques just as it does other algorithmic approaches.</p>
<p>Wordle falls into the class of combinatorial word games. All you need to know is how letters go together to make a word; meaning is beside the point. Most games of this kind are highly susceptible to computational <em>force majeure</em>. A few lines of code and a big word list will find exhaustive solutions in milliseconds. For example, another New York <em>Times</em> game called Spelling Bee asks you to make words out of seven given letters, with one special letter required to appear in every word. I’m not very good at Spelling Bee, but my computer is an ace. The same code would solve the Jumble puzzles on the back pages of the newspaper. With a little more effort the program could handle Lewis Carroll’s Word Links (better known today as Don Knuth’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_ladder">Word Ladders</a>). And it’s a spiffy tool for cheating at Scrabble.</p>
<p>In this respect Wordle is different. One can easily write a program that plays a competent game. Even a program that chooses words at random can turn in a respectable score. But this level of proficiency is nothing like the situation with Spelling Bee or Jumble, where the program utterly annihilates all competition, leaving no shred of the game where the human player could cling to claims of supremacy. In Wordle, every now and then I beat my own program. How can that happen, in this day and age?</p>
<p>The answer might be as simple and boring as computational complexity. If I want my program to win, I’ll have to invest more CPU cycles. Or there might be a super-clever Wordle-wrangling algorithm, and I’ve just been too dumb to find it. Then again, there might be something about Wordle that sets it apart from other combinatorial word games. That would be interesting.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3 id="note_1">Note 1. History of the game and of the word lists.</h3>
<p>The charming story of Wordle’s creation was told last January in the New York <em>Times</em>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">“Wordle Is a Love Story”</a> read the headline. Josh Wardle, a software developer formerly at Reddit, created the game as a gift to his partner, Palak Shah, a fan of word games. The <em>Times</em> story, written by Daniel Victor, marvelled at the noncommercial purity of the website: “There are no ads or flashing banners; no windows pop up or ask for money.” Three weeks later the <em>Times</em> bought the game, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/media/new-york-times-wordle.html">commenting in its own pages</a>, “The purchase . . . reflects the growing importance of games, like crosswords and Spelling Bee, in the company’s quest to increase digital subscriptions to 10 million by 2025.” So much for love stories.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the new owners have not fiddled with the rules of the game, but there have been a few revisions to the word lists. Here’s a summary based on changes observed between February and May.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="undent">Six words were removed from the list of common words (a.k.a. target words), later added to the list of arcane words, then later still removed from that list as well, so that they are no longer valid as either a guess or a target:</p>
<p>AGORA, PUPAL, LYNCH, FIBRE, SLAVE, WENCH</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="undent">Twenty-two words were moved from various positions in the common words list to the end of that list (effectively delaying their appearance as Wordle-of-the-day until sometime in 2027):</p>
<p>BOBBY, ECLAT, FELLA, GAILY, HARRY, HASTY, HYDRO, </p>
<p>LIEGE, OCTAL, OMBRE, PAYER, SOOTH, UNSET, UNLIT, </p>
<p>VOMIT, FANNY, FETUS, BUTCH, STALK, FLACK, WIDOW, </p>
<p>AUGUR</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="undent">Two words were moved forward from near the end of the common list to a higher position where they replaced FETUS and BUTCH:</p>
<p>SHINE, GECKO</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="undent">Two words were removed from the arcane list and not replaced:</p>
<p>KORAN, QURAN</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="indent">Almost all the changes to the common list affect words that would have been played at some point in 2022 if they had been left in place. I expect further purges when the editors get around to vetting the rest of the list. </p>
<h3 id="note_2">Note 2. The Umpire’s scoring rule.</h3>
<p>When I first started playing Wordle, I had a simple notion of what the tile colors meant. If a tile was colored green, then that letter of the guess word appeared in the same position in the target word. A gold tile meant the letter would be found elsewhere in the target word. A gray tile indicated the letter was entirely absent from the target word. For my first Wordler program I wrote a procedure implementing this scheme, although its output consisted of numbers rather than colors: green = 2, gold = 1, gray = 0.</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function scoreGuess(guess, target)
	score = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
	for i in 1:5
		if guess[i] == target[i]
			score[i] = 2
		elseif occursin(guess[i], target)
			score[i] = 1
		end
	end
	return score
end</code></pre>
<p class="indent">This rule and its computer implementation work correctly as long as we never apply them to words with repeated letters. But suppose the target word is MODEM and you play the guess MUDDY. Following the rule above, the Umpire would offer this feedback: <img alt="MUDDY scored 2 0 2 1 0, or green gray green gold gray" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MUDDY-20210.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>. Note the gold coloring of the second D. It’s the correct marking according to the stated rule, because the target word has a D not in the fourth position. But that D in MODEM is already “spoken for”; it is matched with the green D in the middle of MUDDY. The gold coloring of the second D could be misleading, suggesting that there’s another D in the target word.</p>
<p>The Wordle app would color the second D gray, not gold: <img alt="MUDDY scored 2 0 2 0 0, or green gray green gray gray" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MUDDY-20200.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>. The rule, apparently, is that each letter in the target word can be matched with only one letter in the guess word. Green matches take precedence.</p>
<p>There remains some uncertainty about which letter gets a gold score when there are multiple options. If MUDDY is the target word and ADDED is the guess word, we know that middle D will be colored green, but which of the other two Ds in ADDED gets a gold tile? I have not been able to verify how the Wordle app handles this situation, but my program assigns priority from left to right: <img alt="ADDED scored 0 1 2 0 0, or gray gold green gray gray" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ADDED-01200.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>.</p>
<p>This minor amendment to the rules brings a considerable cost in complexity to the code. We need an extra data structure (the array <code>tagged</code>) and an extra loop. The first loop (with index <code>i</code>) finds and marks all the green matches; the second loop (indices <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>) identifies gold tiles that have not been preempted by earlier green or gold matches. </p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function scoreGuess(guess, target)
  score  = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  tagged = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  for i in 1:5
    if guess[i] == target[i]
      score[i] = 2
      tagged[i] = 2
    end
  end
  for j in 1:5
    for k in 1:5
      if guess[j] == target[k] &amp;&amp; score[j] == 0 &amp;&amp; tagged[k] == 0
        score[j] = 1
        tagged[k] = 1
      end
    end
  end
  return score
end</code></pre>
<p>It is this element of the scoring rules that forbids Zip codes such as <img alt="Zip code 2 2 2 2 1, colored green green green green gold" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/four_green_one_gold.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/> and its permutations in Figure 6. Under the naive rules, the guess STALL played against the target STALE would have been scored <img alt="STALL scored 2 2 2 2 1, or green green green green gold" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/STALL-22221.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>. The refined rule renders it as <img alt="STALL scored 2 2 2 2 0, or green green green green gray" border="0" height="20" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/STALL-22220.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" width=""/>.</p>
<h3 id="note_3">Note 3. The virtues of a uniform distribution.</h3>
<p>Let’s think about a game that’s simpler than Wordle, though doubtless less fun to play. You are given a deck of 64 index cards, each with a single word written on it; one of the words, known only to the Umpire, is the target. Your instructions are to “cut” the deck, dividing it into two heaps. Then the all-seeing Umpire will tell you which heap includes the target word. For the next round of play, you set aside the losing heap, and divide the winning heap into two parts; again the Umpire indicates which pile holds the winning word. The process continues until the heap approved by the Umpire consists of a single card, which must necessarily be the target. The question is: How many rounds of play will it take to reach this decisive state?</p>
<p>If you always divide the remaining stack of cards into two <em>equal</em> heaps, this question is easy to answer. On each turn, the number of cards and words remaining in contention is cut in half: from 64 to 32, then on down to 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. It takes six halvings to resolve all uncertainty about the identity of the target. This bisection algorithm is a central element of information theory, where the fundamental unit of measure, the <em>bit</em>, is defined as the amount of information needed to choose between two equally likely alternatives. Here the choices are the two heaps of equal size, which have the same probability of holding the target word. When the Umpire points to one heap or the other, that signal provides exactly one bit of information. To go all the way from 64 equally likely candidates to one identified target takes six rounds of guessing, and six bits of information.</p>
<p>Bisection is known to be an optimal strategy for many problem-solving tasks, but the source of its strength is sometimes misunderstood. What matters most is not that we split the deck into <em>two</em> parts but that we divide it into <em>equal</em> subsets. Suppose we cut a pack of 64 cards into four equal heaps rather than two. When the Umpire points to the pile that includes the target, we get twice as much information. The search space has been reduced by a factor of four, from 64 cards to 16. We still need to acquire a total of six bits to solve the problem, but because we are getting two bits per round, we can do it in three splittings rather than six. In other words, we have a tradeoff between more simple decisions and fewer complex decisions.</p>
<p>Figure 21 illustrates the nature of this tradeoff by viewing a decision process as traversing a tree from the root node (at the top) to one of 16 leaf nodes (at the bottom). For the binary tree on the left, finding your way from the root to a leaf requires making four decisions, in each case choosing one of two paths. In the quaternary tree on the right, only two decisions are needed, but there are four options at each level. Assuming a four-way choice “costs” twice as much as a two-way choice, the information content is the same in both cases: four bits.</p>
<p>Figure 21.<img alt="Trees binary and quad" border="0" class="align-center" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/trees_binary_and_quad.svg" width=""/></p>
<p class="indent">But what if we decide to split the deck unevenly, producing a larger and a smaller heap? For example, a one-quarter/three-quarter division would yield a pile of 16 cards on the left and 48 cards on the right. If the target happens to lie in the smaller heap, we are better off than we would be with an even split: We’ve gained two bits of information instead of one, since the search space has shrunk from 64 cards to 16. However, the probability of this outcome is only 1/4 rather than 1/2, and so our expected gain is only one bit. When the target card is in the larger pile, we acquire less than one bit of information, since the search space has fallen from 64 cards only as far as 48, and the probability of this event is 3/4. Averaging across the two possible outcomes,  the loss outweighs the gain.</p>
<p>Figure 22 shows the information budget for every possible cut point in a deck of 64 cards. The red curves labeled <em>left</em> and <em>right</em> show the number of bits obtained from each of the two piles as their size varies. (The <em>x</em> axis labels the size of the left pile; wherever the left pile has \(n\) cards, the right pile has \(64 - n\).) The overarching green curve is the sum of the left and right values. Note that the green curve has its peak in the center, where the deck has been split into two equal subsets of 32 cards each. This is the optimum strategy.</p>
<p>Figure 22.The equation for the left curve is \(y = (n/m)(\log_2 m - \log_2 n)\), where \(m = 64\) and \(n\) is the size of the left subset. For the right curve, substitute \(m - n\) for \(n\).<img alt="Plot of info from unequal subsets" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/plot_of_info_from_unequal_subsets.svg" width=""/></p>
<p class="indent">I have made this game go smoothly by choosing 64 as the number of cards in the deck. Because 64 is a power of 2, you can keep dividing by 2 and never hit an odd number until you come to 1. With decks of other sizes the situation gets messy; you can’t always split the deck into two equal parts. Nevertheless, the same principles apply, with some compromises and approx­imations. Suppose we have a deck of 2,315 cards, each inscribed with one of the Wordle common words. (The deck would be about two feet high.) We repeatedly split it as close to the middle as possible, allowing an extra card in one pile or the other when necessary. Eleven bisections would be enough to distinguish one card out of \(2^{11} = 2{,}048\), which falls a little short of the goal. With 12 bisections we could find the target among \(2^{12} = 4{,}096\) cards, which is more than we need. There’s a mathematical function that interpolates between these fenceposts: the base-2 logarithm. Specifically, \(\log_2 2{,}315\) is about 11.18, which means the amount of information we need to solve a Wordle puzzle is 11.18 bits. (Note that \(2^{11.18} \approx 2315\). Of the 2,315 positions where the target card might lie within the deck, 1,783 are resolved in 11 bisections, and 532 require a 12th cut.)</p>
<h3 id="note_4">Note 4. Understanding the Shannon entropy equation.</h3>
<p>The foundational document of information theory, Claude Shannon’s 1948 paper “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” gives the entropy equation is this form:</p>
<p>\[H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i .\]</p>
<p class="undent">The equation’s pedigree goes back further, to Josiah Willard Gibbs and Ludwig Boltzmann, who introduced it in a different context, the branch of physics called statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve run into this equation many times, but I do not count it among my close friends. Whenever I come upon it, I have to stop and think carefully about what the equation means and how it works. The variable \(p_i\) represents a probability. We are asked to multiply each \(p_i\) by the logarithm of \(p_i\), then sum up the products and negate the result. Why would one want to do such a thing? What does it accomplish? How do these operations reveal something about entropy and information?</p>
<p class="indent">When I look at the righthand side of the equation, I see an expression of the general form \(n \log n\), which is a familiar trope in several areas of mathematics and computer science. It generally denotes a function that grows faster than linear but slower than quadratic. For example, sorting \(n\) items might require \(n \log n\) comparison operations. (For any \(n\) greater than 2, \(n \log_2 n\) lies between \(n\) and \(n^2\).) </p>
<p>That’s <em>not</em> what’s going on here. Because \(p\) represents a probability, it must lie in the range \(0 \le p \le 1\). The logarithm of a number in this range is negative or at most zero. This gives \(p \log p\) a different complexion. It also draws attention to that weird minus sign hanging out in front of the summation symbol.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe another form of the equation is easier to understand, even though the transformation introduces more bristly mathematical notation. Let’s begin by moving the minus sign from outside to inside the summation, attaching it to the logarithmic factor:</p>
<p>\[H = \sum_{i} p_i (-\log_2 p_i) .\]</p>
<p class="undent">The rules for logarithms and exponents tell us that \(-\log x = \log x^{-1}\), and that \(x^{-1} = 1/x\). We can therefore rewrite the equation again as</p>
<p> \[H = \sum_{i} p_i \log_2 \frac{1}{p_i} .\]</p>
<p>Now the nature of the beast becomes a little clearer. Figure 23.<img alt="Graph of p log 1overp" border="0" class="alignright" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/graph_of_p_log_1overp1.svg" style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;" width="275"/>The factors \(p\) and \(\log (1/p)\) pull in opposite directions. If you make \(p\) larger, you make \(\log (1/p)\) smaller, and vice versa. At both extremes of the allowed range, near \(p = 0\) and \(p = 1\), the value of \(p \log (1/p)\) approaches 0. In between these limits, \(p \log (1/p)\) is always positive, and should have a maximum for some value of \(p\). Figure 23 shows that this is true. It’s no coincidence that the curve has the same form as one of those in Figure 22. (If you’re curious about the location of the peak, I’ll give you a hint: It lies where \(p\) is equal to the reciprocal of a famous number.)</p>
<p>We can now bring in some of the particulars of the Wordle problem. The probability \(p_i\) is in fact the probability that the target word is found in Zip code \(i\). Note that \(n_i / m\) has the proper behavior for a probability. It always lies between 0 and 1, and the sum of \(n_i / m\) for all \(i\) is equal to 1.This probability is equal to \(n_i / m\), where \(n_i\) is the number of words assigned to Zip code \(i\), and \(m\) is the total number of words in all the Zip codes. Making the substitutions \(p_i \rightarrow n_i / m\) and \(1 / p_1 \rightarrow m / n_i\), we get the new equation</p>
<p> \[H = \sum_{i} \frac{n_i}{m} \log_2 \frac{m}{n_i} .\]</p>
<p>And now for the final transformation. The laws of logarithms state that \(\log x/y\) is equal to \(\log x - \log y\), so we can rewrite the Shannon equation as</p>
<p>\[H = \sum_{i} \frac{n_i}{m} (\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i) .\]</p>
<p class="undent">In this form the equation is easy to relate to the problem of solving a Wordle puzzle. The quantity \(\log_2 m\) is the total amount of information (measured in bits) that we need to acquire in order to identify the target word; \(\log_2 n_i\) is the amount of information we will still need to ferret out if Zip code \(i\) turns out the hold the target word. The difference of these two quantities is what we gain if the target is in Zip code \(i\). The coefficient \(n_i / m\) is the probability of this event.</p>
<p>One further emendation is needed. The logarithm function is undefined at 0, as \(\log x\) diverges toward negative infinity as \(x\) approaches 0 from above. Thus we have to exclude from the summation all terms with \(n_i = 0\). We can also fill in the limits of the index \(i\).</p>
<p>\[H = \sum_{\substack{i = 1\\n_i \ne 0}}^{242} \frac{n_i}{m} (\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i) \]</p>
<p>Shannon’s discussion of the entropy equation is oddly diffident. He introduces it by listing a few assumptions that the \(H\) function should satisfy, and then asserting as a theorem that \(H = -\Sigma p \log p\) is the only equation meeting these requirements. In an appendix to the 1948 paper he proves the theorem. But he also goes on to write, “This theorem, and the assumptions required for its proof, are in no way necessary for the present theory [<em>i.e.</em>, information theory]. It is given chiefly to lend a certain plausibility to some of our later definitions.” I’m not sure what to make of Shannon’s cavalier dismissal of his own theorem, but in the case of Wordle analysis he seems to be right.

    <summary>Irritated by repeated claims that spiral galaxies are logarithmic spirals (\(\mathbb{M}\)), sourced to pop science instead of expert research, I found “Pitch angle variations in spiral galaxies” (Savchenko &amp; Reshetnikov, MNRAS 2013) which tells a more complicated story. In logarithmic spirals, the pitch angle is constant, in Archimedean spirals it decreases with radius, and in hyperbolic spirals it increases. All three are used as models of galaxies.

The trick is that the “random article” button isn’t uniformly random on articles. It tags articles with permanent random numbers in the unit interval, and when pressed picks another random number and looks for the next larger tag. For seldom-viewed articles, most views are random, and the probability of getting a random view is proportional to the length of the gap between an article’s permanent random number and the next smaller one. So the tail of least-viewed articles is dominated by unlucky articles whose gap is small.</p>

Shinichi Mochizuki is a mathematician who is at the center of a decade old claim. He has—he says since 2012—solved a famous open problem in number theory called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture">abc</a> conjecture. This conjecture is in number theory and would revolutionize our understanding of the structure of the natural numbers. </p>

<p>
</p><p><b> What is the ABC? </b></p>
<p/><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture">abc</a> conjecture is a conjecture in number theory, first proposed by Joseph Oesterle and David Masser independently around 1985. It is stated in terms of three positive integers, <img alt="{a, b, c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2C+b%2C+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (hence the name) that are relatively prime and satisfy <img alt="{a + b = c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%2B+b+%3D+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> denotes the product of the distinct prime factors of <img alt="{abc}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Babc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the conjecture essentially states that <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is usually not much smaller than <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>
The common term for the product <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the distinct prime factors of a positive integer <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the “radical” of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, written <img alt="{rad(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Brad%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by Wikipedia, in Timothy Gowers’s <em>Princeton Companion</em> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOfUsvemJDMC&amp;pg=PA681#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">article</a>, and in other sources in abc. We demur from doubling up on an established term with a different meaning and suggest calling it the “wingspan” <img alt="{w(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then square-free integers have the largest possible wingspan, while large prime powers minimize it. Now we can state the conjecture formally:</p>
<blockquote><p>
For every <img alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, all but finitely many triples of relatively prime positive numbers giving <img alt="{a + b = c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%2B+b+%3D+c%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> have </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  w(abc) &gt; c^{1-\epsilon}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++w%28abc%29+%3E+c%5E%7B1-%5Cepsilon%7D.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Intuitively what it says is that numbers that have large powers of different primes cannot be related by addition. As <img alt="{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%5Crightarrow+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, it says that the wingspan of the triple’s product <img alt="{n=abc}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3Dabc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> must at least approach <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which is greater than the cube root of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Note, incidentally, that if any two of <img alt="{a,b,c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%2Cc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> share a prime factor <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then so does the third, so we can divide out all such <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to get <img alt="{a',b',c'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%2Cb%27%2Cc%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> meeting the hypothesis. </p>
<p>
The point of the conjecture is that it relates addition and multiplication. It allows making inferences about the multiplicative structure of natural numbers from additive properties and vice-versa. The formal theory of the natural numbers with respect to addition alone, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic">Presburger arithmetic</a>, is decidable, as is the theory of multiplication alone, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skolem_arithmetic">Skolem arithmetic</a>. The theory of both <img alt="{+}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\times}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctimes%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano arithmetic</a>, is of course undecidable. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture">abc</a> gives a playbook for leveraging the decidable sub-systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> ABC Implies What? </b></p>
<p/><p>
The conjecture has high <em>explanatory power</em> in that many other conjectures (listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture#Some_consequences">here</a>) follow from it. Among them, we note:</p>
<ol>
<li> Whereas no one has significantly simplified Andrew Wiles’s famously difficult proof strategy for Fermat’s Last Theorem (FLT), the theorem for <img alt="{n \ge 6}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cge+6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> follows quickly from a weaker analogue of the abc conjecture.
</li><li> A generalization of FLT concerning powers that are sums of powers, called the Fermat-Catalan conjecture, also follows from abc.
</li><li> If a polynomial <img alt="{P(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with integer coefficients has at least three simple zeroes, then there are only finitely many positive integers <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that <img alt="{P(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a perfect power (i.e., such that <img alt="{P(x) = m^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%28x%29+%3D+m%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for some integers <img alt="{m,k \geq 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%2Ck+%5Cgeq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>).
</li></ol>
<p>
This raises the following natural question for us computational complexity theorists:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 Does the abc conjecture imply any “shocks” in complexity theory—namely, resolving basic open questions that have been open for over half a century?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken and I are not aware of any. It does not seem to affect factoring, or complexity theory, or any main ingredients of our favorite P=NP problem. But it does have great impact on anything that concerns Diophantine questions. It is possible that connections may emerge at this level of detail. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Is The ABC Proved? </b></p>
<p/><p>
Here is a timeline of Mochizuki <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/math-mystery-shinichi-mochizuki-and-the-impenetrable-proof/">proof</a>: </p>
<p>
Mochizuki made his work public in August 2012 without any fanfare. Soon it was picked up and the mathematical community was made aware of the claim he has proven the abc conjecture. This started the quest to determine if his proof is correct.</p>
<p>
The proof is long and complex. Workshops were held in 2015 and 2016 on it. The presentations did not lead to acceptance of Mochizuki’s ideas, and the proof remains unclear.</p>
<p>
Enter Peter Scholze and Jakob Stix—two world experts on number theory. They visited Kyoto University for five days of discussions with Mochizuki in 2018. It did not resolve the correctness of the proof but did bring into focus where the difficulties lay.</p>
<p>
They wrote a report <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/why_abc_is_still_a_conjecture.pdf">Why abc is still a conjecture</a>. It starts:<br/>
<em><br/>
We, the authors of this note, came to the conclusion that there is no proof. We are going to explain where, in our opinion, the suggested proof has a problem, a problem so severe that in our opinion small modifications will not rescue the proof strategy.<br/>
</em></p>
<p>
Then, Mochizuki wrote a response of his view of why their claims were wrong: <a href="https://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/Cmt2018-05.pdf">Comments On The Manuscript by Scholze-Stix</a>. He said:<br/>
<em><br/>
It should be stated clearly that the assertion that “these are inessential to the point we are making” is completely false! I made numerous attempts to explain this during the March discussions, and it is most unfortunate that we were ultimately unable to communicate regarding this issue.<br/>
</em></p>
<p>
The disagreement over the correctness remains:  Other authors have pointed to the unresolved dispute between Mochizuki and Scholze over the correctness of this work as an instance in which the peer review process of mathematical journal publication has failed in its usual function of convincing the mathematical community as a whole of the validity of a result. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Explaining Math </b></p>
<p/><p>
Albert Einstein may have said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“If you can’t explain it to a six year old, you don’t understand it yourself.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Some attribute this instead to Richard Feynman. But whoever said it the mathematical community generally agrees with the point. In the 1962 <a href="https://www.biblio.com/book/new-perspectives-physics-broglie-louis-translated/d/999571270">book</a> New Perspectives in Physics, by Louis De Broglie, states that Einstein, when discussing theories, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“<img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> ought to lend themselves to as simple a description as that even a child could understand…”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I wonder if the requirement “explain it to a six year old” does not mean the six year old must understand it. Rather that when you explain it to them they listen politely. That is the requirement is they listen. What do you think?</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Mochizuki still claims his <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11378">proof</a>. He violates the above rule: he cannot explain it to a six year old—not even a senior expert. It still has not yet been accepted as passing the peer review stage. See <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/titans-of-mathematics-clash-over-epic-proof-of-abc-conjecture-20180920/">this</a> for some general comments. And <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12220">this</a> for some more. It has lots of comments.</p>
<p>
Can the abc ever be resolved? I wonder if there is some way to say suppose that the abc is true. And then prove some surprising complexity consequence holds? Perhaps violate P=NP for example, or some other result. </p></font></font></div>

    <title>Orna Kupferman's Interview with Christel Baier, Holger Hermanns and Joost-Pieter Katoen, CONCUR 2022 ToT Award Recipients</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><i><span class="im">I am delighted to post <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ornak/" target="_blank">Orna Kupferman</a>'s interview with <a href="https://concur2022.mimuw.edu.pl/tot-award/" target="_blank">CONCUR 2022 Test-of-Time Award</a> recipients <a href="https://wwwtcs.inf.tu-dresden.de/~baier/" target="_blank">Christel Baier</a>, <a href="https://depend.cs.uni-saarland.de/~hermanns/" target="_blank">Holger Hermanns</a> and<a href="https://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~katoen/" target="_blank"> Joost-Pieter Katoen</a>. </span></i></p><p><span class="im"><i><br/>Thanks to Christel, Holger and Joost-Pieter for their answers (labelled BHK in what follows) and to Orna (Q below) for conducting the interview. Enjoy and watch this space for upcoming interviews with the other award recipients!</i>  <br/></span></p><p><span class="im">Q: You receive the CONCUR Test-of-Time Award 2022 for your paper "<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-48320-9_12.pdf" target="_blank">Approximate symbolic model checking of continuous-time Markov chains</a>," which appeared <br/>at CONCUR 1998. In that article, you combine three different challenges: symbolic algorithms, real-time systems, and probabilistic systems. Could you briefly explain to our readers what the main challenge in such a combination is?<br/><br/></span>BHK: The main challenge is to provide a fixed-point characterization of time-bounded reachability probabilities: the probability to reach a given target state within a given deadline. Almost all works in the field up to 1999 treated discrete-time probabilistic models and focused on "just" reachability probabilities: what is the probability to eventually end up in a given target state? This can be characterized as a unique solution of a linear equation system. The question at stake was: how to incorporate a real-valued deadline <i>d</i>? The main insight was <br/>to split the problem in staying a certain amount of time, <i>x</i> say, in the current state and using the remaining <i>d-x</i> time to reach the target from its successor state. This yields a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volterra_integral_equation" target="_blank">Volterra integral equation system</a>; indeed time-bounded reachability probabilities are unique solutions of such equation systems. In the CONCUR'99 paper we suggested to use symbolic data structures to do the numerical integration; later we found out that much more efficient techniques can be applied.<span class="im"><br/><br/>Q: Could you tell us how you started your collaboration on the award-winning paper? In particular, as the paper combines three different challenges, is it the case that each of you has brought to the research different expertise?<br/><br/></span>BHK: Christel and Joost-Pieter were both in Birmingham, where a meeting of a <br/>collaboration project between German and British research groups on stochastic systems and process algebra took place. There the first ideas of model checking continuous-time Markov chains arose, especially for time-bounded reachability: with stochastic process algebras there were means to model CTMCs in a compositional manner, but verification was lacking. Back in Germany, Holger suggested to include a steady-state operator, the counterpart of transient properties that can be expressed using timed reachability probabilities. We then also developed the symbolic data structure to support the verification of the entire logic.<span class="im"/><span class="im"><br/><br/>Q: Your contribution included a generalization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram" target="_blank">BDDs (binary decision diagrams)</a> to <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~emc/papers/Contributions%20to%20Edited%20Volumes/Multi-Terminal%20Binary%20Decision%20Diagrams%20and%20Hybrid%20Decision%20Diagrams.pdf" target="_blank">MTDDs (multi-terminal decision diagrams)</a>, which allow both Boolean and real-valued variables. What do you think about the current state of symbolic algorithms, in particular the choice between SAT-based methods and methods that are based on decision diagrams?<br/><br/></span>BHK: BDD-based techniques entered probabilistic model checking in the mid 1990's for discrete-time models such as Markov chains. Our paper was one of the first, perhaps even the first, that proposed to use BDD structures for real-time stochastic processes. Nowadays, SAT, and in particular SMT-based techniques belong to the standard machinery in probabilistic model checking. SMT techniques are e.g., used in bisimulation minimization at the language level, counterexample generation, and parameter synthesis. This includes both linear as well as non-linear theories. BDD techniques are still used, mostly in combination with sparse representations, but it is fair to say that SMT is becoming more and more relevant.<span class="im"><br/><br/>Q: What are the research topics that you find most interesting right now? Is there any specific problem in your current field of interest that you'd like to see solved?<br/><br/></span>BHK: This depends a bit on whom you ask! Christel's recent work is about cause-effect reasoning and notions of responsibility in the verification context. This ties into the research interest of Holger who looks at the foundations of perspicuous software systems. This research is rooted in the observation that the explosion of opportunities for software-driven innovations comes with an implosion of human opportunities and capabilities to understand and control these innovations. Joost-Pieter focuses on pushing the borders of automation in weakest-precondition reasoning of probabilistic programs. This involves loop invariant synthesis, probabilistic termination proofs, the development of deductive verifiers, and so forth. Challenges are to come up with good techniques for synthesizing quantitative loop invariants, or even complete probabilistic programs.<span class="im"><br/><br/>Q: What advice would you give to a young researcher who is keen to start working on topics related to symbolic algorithms, real-time systems, and probabilistic systems?<br/><br/></span>BHK: Try to keep it smart and simple.</p></div>

    <title>Discussions I wish we were having</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><br/></p><p>1) Democrats think the best way to avoid school shootings (and other problems with guns) is to have regulations on Guns. They have proposed legislation. The Republicans think its a mental health issue. They have proposed legislation for this. NO THEY HAVEN"T. I would respect the <i>its a mental health</i> <i>issue</i> argument if the people saying this  respected it. They do not. See <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/report-texas-last-access-mental-health-care/269-1283fcee-0dc4-4948-9dda-886f55c49ca3">here</a>. Idea: Politico should leak a (false) memo  by Gov Abbott where he says </p><p><i>We have a serious mental health crisis in Texas which caused the recent event. I am not just saying this to deflect from the gun issue. I have drawn up a bill to fund mental health care, providing more money, for care and for studies. I call on Republicans and Democrats to pass it ASAP.</i></p><p>I wonder- if this false memo was leaked, would he deny it and say </p><p><i>I didn't write that. I am using mental health only as a way to deflect from the gun issue. How dare they say that I am reasonable and am proposing actual solutions. </i></p><p>Or would he be forced to follow through?</p><p>2) Democrats think Biden won the election. Some Republicans think Trump won the election. One issue was Arizona. So some republicans organized a recount of Arizona. And when they found out that Biden really did win it they said, as the good Popperian scientists they are, <i>we had a falsifiable hypothesis and it</i> <i>was shown to be false, so now we acknowledge the original hypothesis was wrong. </i>NO THEY DIDN"T. They seem to point to the Arizona audit as proof that they were right, even though it proves the opposite. (Same for all the court cases they lost.)</p><p>3) At one time I read some books that challenged evolution (Darwin on Trial by Phillip Johnson was one of them). Some of them DID raise some good points about how science is done (I am NOT being sarcastic). Some of them DID raise some questions like the gap in the fossil record and Michael Behe's notion of irreducible complexity.  (In hindsight these were window dressing and not what they cared about.) MY thought at the time was <i>its good to have people</i> v<i>iew a branch of science with a different viewpoint. Perhaps the scientists at the Discovery Institute will find something interesting. </i>(The Discovery institute is a think tank and one of their interests is Int. Design.) Alas, the ID people seem to spend their time either challenging the teaching of Evolution in school OR doing really bad science. Could intelligent people who think Evolution is not correct look at it in a different way than scientists do, and do good science, or at least raise good questions,  and come up with something interesting? I used to think so. Now I am not so sure.</p><p>4) I wish the debate was <i>what to do about global warming </i>and not <i>is global warming happening? </i>Conjecture: there will come a time when environmentalists finally come around to nuclear power being part of the answer. At that point, Republicans will be against Nuclear power just because the Democrats are for it. </p><p>5) I sometimes get email discussions like the following (I will call the emailer Mel for no good reason.)</p><p>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>MEL: Dr. Gasarch, I have shown that R(5)=45.</p><p>BILL: Great! Can you email me your 2-coloring of K_{44} that has no mono K_5?</p><p>MEL: You are just being stubborn. Look at my proof!</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Clyde has asked me <i>what if Mel had a nonconstructive proof?</i></p><p>FINE- then MEL can tell me that. But Mel doesn't know math well enough to make that</p><p>kind of argument. Here is the discussion I wish we had</p><p>-------------------------------------------</p><p>MEL: Dr. Gasarch, I have shown that R(5)=45.</p><p>BILL: Great! Can you email me your coloring of K_{44} that has no mono K_5?</p><p>MEL: The proof is non-constructive.</p><p>BILL: Is it a probabilistic proof? If so then often the prob is not just nonzero but close to 1. Perhaps you could write a program that does the coin flipping and finds the coloring.</p><p>MEL: The proof uses the Local Lovasz Lemma so the probe is not close to 1.</p><p>BILL: Even so, that can be coded up.</p><p>MEL: Yes but... (AND THIS IS AN INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION)</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>Maybe Mel really did prove R(5)=44, or maybe not, but the above conversation would lead to</p><p>enlightenment. </p><p><br/></p></div>

<p>So anyway, if you’re one of the thousands of readers who come here simply to learn more about quantum computing and computational complexity, rather than to try to provoke me into mounting a public defense of my own existence (which defense will then, ironically but inevitably, stimulate <em>even more</em> attacks that need to be defended against) … well, either scroll down to the very end of this post, or wait for the next post.</p>

<p>Thanks so much to all my readers who donated to <a href="https://fundtexaschoice.org/">Fund Texas Choice</a>.  As promised, I’ve personally given them a total of $4,106.28, to match the donations that came in by the deadline.  I’d encourage people to continue donating anyway, while for my part I’ll probably run some more charity matching campaigns soon.  These things are addictive, like pulling the lever of a slot machine, but where the rewards go to making the world an infinitesimal amount more consistent with your values.</p>

<p>Of course, now there’s a brand-new atrocity to shame my adopted state of Texas before the world.  While the Texas government will go to extraordinary lengths to protect unborn children, the world has now witnessed 19 of its<em>born</em> children consigned to gruesome deaths, as the “good guys with guns”—waited outside and prevented parents from entering the classrooms where their children were being shot.  I have nothing original to add to the global outpourings of rage and grief.  Forget about the statistical frequency of these events: I know perfectly well that the risk from car crashes and home accidents is orders-of-magnitude greater.  Think about it this way: the United States is now known to the world as “the country that can’t or won’t do anything to stop its children from semi-regularly being gunned down in classrooms,” not even measures that virtually every other comparable country on earth has successfully taken.  It’s become <em>the</em> symbol of national decline, dysfunction, and failure.  If so, then the stakes here could fairly be called existential ones—not because of its <em>direct</em> effects on child life expectancy or GDP or any other index of collective well-being that you can define and measure, but rather, because a country that lacks the will to solve this will be judged by the world, and probably accurately, as lacking the will to solve anything else.</p>

<p>In return for the untold thousands of hours I’ve poured into this blog, which has never once had advertising or asked for subscriptions, my reward has been years of vilification by sneerers and trolls.  Some of the haters even compare me to Elliot Rodger and other aggrieved mass shooters.  And I mean: yes, it’s <em>true</em> that I was bullied and miserable for years.  It’s true that Elliot Rodger, Salvador Ramos (the Uvalde shooter), and most other mass shooters were also bullied and miserable for years.  But, Scott-haters, if we’re being intellectually honest about this, we might say that the similarities between the mass shooter story and the Scott Aaronson story end at a certain point not very long after that.  We might say: it’s not just that Aaronson didn’t respond by hurting anybody—rather, it’s that his response loudly <em>affirmed</em> the values of the Enlightenment, meaning like, the whole package, from individual autonomy to science and reason to the rejection of sexism and racism to everything in between.  Affirmed it in a manner that’s not secretly about popularity (demonstrably so, because it doesn’t <em>get</em> popularity), affirmed it via self-questioning methods intellectually honest enough that they’d probably <em>still</em> have converged on the right answer even in situations where it’s now obvious that almost everyone you around would’ve been converging on the <em>wrong</em> answer, like (say) Nazi Germany or the antebellum South.</p>



<p>I’ve been to the valley of darkness.  While there, I decided that the only “revenge” against the bullies that was possible or desirable was to <em>do</em> something with my life, to achieve something in science that at least some bullies might envy, while also starting a loving family and giving more than most to help strangers on the Internet and whatever good cause comes to his attention and so on.  And after 25 years of effort, some people might say I’ve sort of <em>achieved</em> the “revenge” as I’d then defined it.  And they might further say: if you could get every school shooter to redefine “revenge” as “becoming another Scott Aaronson,” that would be, you know, like, a step upwards.  An improvement.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>And let this be the final word on the matter that I ever utter in all my days, to the thousands of SneerClubbers and Twitter randos who pursue this particular line of attack against Scott Aaronson (yes, we do mean the <em>thousands</em>—which means, it both <em>feels to its recipient like</em> the entire earth yet <em>actually is</em> less than 0.01% of the earth). </p>



<p><strong>We see what <em>Scott</em> did with <em>his</em> life, when subjected for a decade to forms of psychological pressure that are infamous for causing young males to lash out violently.  What would <em>you</em> have done with <em>your</em> life?</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>A couple weeks ago, when the trolling attacks were arriving minute by minute, I toyed with the idea of permanently shutting down this blog.  <em>What’s the point?</em> I asked myself.  <em>Back in 2005, the open Internet was fun; now it’s a charred battle zone.  Why not restrict conversation to my academic colleagues and friends?  Haven’t I done enough for a public that gives me so much grief?</em>  I was dissuaded by many messages of support from loyal readers.  Thank you so much.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>If anyone needs something to cheer them up, you should really watch <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/prehistoric-planet/umc.cmc.4lh4bmztauvkooqz400akxav?ign-itscg=MC_20000&amp;ign-itsct=atvp_brand_omd&amp;mttn3pid=Google%20AdWords&amp;mttnagencyid=a5e&amp;mttncc=US&amp;mttnsiteid=143238&amp;mttnsubad=OUS2019950_1-600303192626-c&amp;mttnsubkw=144248666108__J1lRfctc_&amp;mttnsubplmnt=">Prehistoric Planet</a>, narrated by an excellent, 96-year-old David Attenborough.  Maybe 35 years from now, people will believe dinosaurs looked or acted somewhat differently from these portrayals, just like they believe somewhat differently now from when I was a kid.  On the other hand, if you literally took a time machine to the Late Cretaceous and starting filming, you couldn’t get a result that <em>seemed</em> more realistic, let’s say to a documentary-watching child, than these CGI dinosaurs on their CGI planet seem.  So, in the sense of passing that child’s Turing Test, you might argue, the problem of bringing back the dinosaurs has now been solved.</p>



<p>If you … err … <em>really</em> want to be cheered up, you can follow up with <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/dinosaur-apocalypse/">Dinosaur Apocalypse</a>, <em>also</em> narrated by Attenborough, where you can (again, as if you were there) watch the dinosaurs being drowned and burned alive in their billions when the asteroid hits.  We’d still be scurrying under rocks, were it not for that lucky event that only a monster could’ve called lucky at the time.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Several people asked me to comment on the recent <a href="https://scorpioncapital.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reports/IONQ.pdf">savage investor review</a> against the quantum computing startup IonQ.  The review amusingly mixed together every imaginable line of criticism, with every imaginable degree of reasonableness from 0% to 100%.  Like, quantum computing is impossible even in theory, <em>and</em> (in the very next sentence) other companies are much closer to realizing quantum computing than IonQ is.  And <a href="https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond">IonQ’s response</a> to the criticism, and see also <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/05/26/waging-war-on-quantum/">this</a> by the indefatigable Gil Kalai.</p>



<p>Is it, err, OK if I sit this one out for now?  There’s probably, like, actually an <em>already-existing</em> machine learning model where, if you trained it on all of my previous quantum computing posts, it would know exactly what to say about this.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-082 |  Low-Degree Polynomials Extract from Local Sources | 

	Omar Alrabiah, 

	Eshan Chattopadhyay, 

	Jesse Goodman, 

	Xin Li, 

	João Ribeiro</title>
    <summary>We continue a line of work on extracting random bits from weak sources that are generated by simple processes. We focus on the model of locally samplable sources, where each bit in the source depends on a small number of (hidden) uniformly random input bits. Also known as local sources, this model was introduced by De and Watson (TOCT 2012) and Viola (SICOMP 2014), and is closely related to sources generated by AC$^0$ circuits and bounded-width branching programs. In particular, extractors for local sources also work for sources generated by these classical computational models.

Despite being introduced a decade ago, little progress has been made on improving the entropy requirement for extracting from local sources. The current best explicit extractors require entropy $n^{1/2}$, and follow via a reduction to affine extractors. To start, we prove a barrier showing that one cannot hope to improve this entropy requirement via a black-box reduction of this form. In particular, new techniques are needed.

In our main result, we seek to answer whether low-degree polynomials (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) hold potential for breaking this barrier. We answer this question in the positive, and fully characterize the power of low-degree polynomials as extractors for local sources.
More precisely, we show that a random degree $r$ polynomial is a low-error extractor for $n$-bit local sources with min-entropy $\Omega(r(n\log n)^{1/r})$, and we show that this is tight.

Our result leverages several new ingredients, which may be of independent interest. Our existential result relies on a new reduction from local sources to a more structured family, known as local non-oblivious bit-fixing sources. To show its tightness, we prove a ``local version'' of a structural result by Cohen and Tal (RANDOM 2015), which relies on a new ``low-weight'' Chevalley-Warning theorem.</summary>

    <title>TR22-081 |  Theory and Applications of Probabilistic Kolmogorov Complexity | 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Igor Oliveira</title>
    <summary>Diverse applications of Kolmogorov complexity to learning [CIKK16], circuit complexity [OPS19], cryptography [LP20], average-case complexity [Hir21], and proof search [Kra22] have been discovered in recent years. Since the running time of algorithms is a key resource in these fields, it is crucial in the corresponding arguments to consider time-bounded variants of Kolmogorov complexity. While fruitful interactions between time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and different areas of theoretical computer science have been known for quite a while (e.g., [Sip83, Ko91, ABK+06, AF09], to name a few), the aforementioned results have led to a renewed interest in this topic. 

The theory of Kolmogorov complexity is well understood, but many useful results and properties of Kolmogorov complexity are not known to hold in time-bounded settings. Unfortunately, this creates technical difficulties or leads to conditional results when applying methods from time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity to algorithms and complexity theory. Perhaps even more importantly, in many cases it is desirable or even necessary to consider randomised algorithms. Since random strings have high complexity, the classical theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity might be inappropriate or simply cannot be applied in such contexts.

To mitigate these issues and develop a more robust theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity that survives in the important setting of randomised computations, some recent papers [Oli19, LO21, LOS21, GKLO22, LOZ22] have explored probabilistic notions of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, such as $\mathrm{rKt}$ complexity [Oli19], $\mathrm{rK}^t$ complexity [LOS21], and $\mathrm{pK}^t$ complexity [GKLO22]. These measures consider different ways of encoding an object via a probabilistic representation. In this survey, we provide an introduction to probabilistic time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and its applications, highlighting many open problems and  research directions.</summary>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Friedman">Harvey Friedman</a> is a famous mathematical logician who spent most of his career at Ohio State University. He worked not on proving new theorems as much as finding the axioms needed to prove them. Later in his career it was the axioms needed for certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_cardinal">large cardinal</a> theorems. These questions can be very subtle and difficult—not unlike lower bounds in complexity theory. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/hf/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20086" height="259" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/hf.png?resize=194%2C259&amp;ssl=1" width="194"/></a><br/>
Harvey was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the world’s youngest professor when he taught at Stanford University at age 18 as an assistant professor of philosophy. He got his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967—hence the young age. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> The Difference </b></p>
<p/><p>
Harvey has taken a viewpoint for most of his career that is different from other logicians. Godel’s incompleteness theorems apply to most logic systems—certainly those that are strong enough for central areas of mathematics. But the majority of mathematicians believe that incompleteness does not apply to their everyday work. In short most do not think:</p>
<p>
	<i>I cannot prove P not equal to NP, so it must be incomplete.</i> 	 </p>
<p>Rather they feel that this means I am not smart enough to resolve P vs NP. Which of these is true? </p>
<p>
For example, Harvey has created numerous algebraic and geometric systems that make no explicit reference to logic but which, under a suitable coding, contain a logical system to which Godel’s incompleteness theorems apply. Furthermore, these <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/modern-logic-godel-friedman-and-reverse-mathematics">systems</a> look similar to many systems used by mathematicians in their everyday work. Harvey uses these examples to argue that incompleteness cannot be dismissed as a phenomenon that occurs only in overly general foundational frameworks contrived by logicians. He argues that it applies often to their everyday world.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> An Example </b></p>
<p/><p>
Harvey is also able to find numerous combinatorial statements with clear geometric meaning that are proved using large cardinals axioms and shown to require them. These <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9811187.pdf">results</a> are famous to Harvey. Such axioms previously seemed to require statements that are not geometric. </p>
<p>
Gill Williamson can show that this can be used to connect these problems to the assumption that subset sum is solvable in polynomial time. See the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11707.pdf">On The Difficulty Of Proving P Equals NP In ZFC</a>. This curious connection between the P vs. NP problem and the theory of large cardinals seems to suggest that either P=NP is false or otherwise not provable in ZFC. This connection is <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/beatcs/column81.pdf">surprising</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Incompleteness </b></p>
<p/><p>
Harvey does have a conjecture that shows that certain statements are not incomplete. He is interested in both sides of this coin: sometimes statements are provable and sometimes not. Concretely many mathematical theorems, such as Fermat’s Last Theorem, can be proved in very weak systems such as EFA. The <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00670733/document">Grand Conjecture</a> says:  Every theorem published in the Annals of Mathematics whose statement involves only finitary mathematical objects (i.e. what logicians call an arithmetical statement) can be proved in EFA. </p>
<p>
EFA is the weak fragment of Peano Arithmetic based on the usual quantifier-free axioms for <img alt="{0, 1, +, \times, x^y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%2C+1%2C+%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+x%5Ey%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, together with the scheme of induction for all formulas whose quantifiers are bounded. While it is easy to construct artificial arithmetical statements that are true but not provable in EFA the point of the grand conjecture is that natural examples of such statements seem to be rare. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
 When Harvey was just starting to <a href="https://nautil.us/this-man-is-about-to-blow-up-mathematics-5857/">read</a>, at age 4 or 5, he remembers pointing to a dictionary and asking his mother what it was. It’s used to find out what words mean, she explained. A few days later, he returned to her with his verdict: The volume was completely worthless. For every word he’d looked up, the dictionary had taken him in circles: from “large” to “big” to “great” and so on, until he eventually arrived back at “large” again. She just looked at me as if I were a really strange, peculiar child, Friedman laughs. </p>
<p>
This is an <a href="https://nautil.us/this-man-is-about-to-blow-up-mathematics-5857/">insight</a> reported in an article by Jordana Cepelewicz. I cannot imagine Harvey was four or five when he told his mom this.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_L._Herman">Arthur Herman</a> is a popular Historian and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. On Forbes Magazine he “comments on quantum computing and AI and American national security”, and his recent Forbes article <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/arthurherman/2022/05/19/waging-war-on-quantum/?sh=2044c5318896">Waging War on Quantum</a> (thanks, Alexander Vlasov) starts as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>Quantum computing will never work. Keeping enough qubits stable long enough to do any significant calculating or processing, is a mathematical impossibility. The whole idea that one day quantum computers will discover new miracle drugs, or crack public encryption systems, is a mirage. Even worse, it’s a hoax.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>That’s been the message from so-called quantum skeptics for a decade or more, including physicists like Gil Kalai of Hebrew University and Mikhail Dyakonov of the University of Montepellier—all in spite of the fact that quantum computers have continued to grow in sophistication and qubit power. Most experts now agree it’s not a question if a large-scale quantum will emerge that can break into public encryption systems using Shor’s algorithm, but </strong></em><strong>when</strong><em><strong>.”</strong></em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first paragraph gives a reasonable description of my views, however I <strong>never</strong> referred to the whole idea of quantum computing as a hoax. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding the second paragraph, it is indeed correct that quantum computers have continued to grow in sophistication and qubit power, however <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">my theory</a> (based on a computational complexity argument) is that progress for reducing the error rate will reach a wall and that recent progress merely approaches this limit. Let me elaborate a little on the development of the past decade as I see it</span>.<br/>
</span></p>
<p>Before moving to my assessment I would like to note that Arthur Herman’s offers an outrageous conclusion to his article. He suggests that skepticism of quantum computers (and of the company <a href="https://ionq.com/">IonQ</a>) puts the skeptics’ countries at risk. In my opinion, the militant rhetoric of the title and of the conclusion is very inappropriate.</p>
<h2>Assessment of progress in the past decade</h2>
<p>The past quantum computing decade is characterized both by notable progress, adjustment of expectations, larger investments, much enthusiasm, and some hype. The overall picture is unclear and might be clearer 5-10 years from now.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The following picture (click to enlarge) describes the shift in the community view over the last decade (as I see it).</span></p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2010-2020d.png"><img alt="2010-2020d" class="alignnone  wp-image-22721" height="308" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2010-2020d.png?w=724&amp;h=308" width="724"/></a></p>
<p>On the left you can see David DiVincenzo’s famous 7-steps road map to quantum computers. DiVincenzo put forward these steps in his 2000 paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002077">The physical implementation of quantum computation</a>,  and the above picture on the left is a graphic description of these steps in a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1231930">2013 review paper</a> by Michel Devoret and Rob Schoelkopf.  The caption under the Figure asserts that <span style="color: #0000ff;">“Superconducting qubits are the only solid-state implementation at the third stage, and they now aim at reaching the fourth stage (green arrow). In the domain of atomic physics and quantum optics, the third stage had been previously attained by trapped ions and by Rydberg atoms. No implementation has yet reached the fourth stage, where a logical qubit can be stored, via error correction, for a time substantially longer than the decoherence time of its physical qubit components.”</span> The fourth step “logical memory with (substantial) longer lifetime than physical qubits” looked to many like a near term goal ten years ago.</p>
<p>One important development of the last ten years was to introduce building NISQ computers and achieving “quantum supremacy” (and related tasks like high “quantum volume”) as an intermediate goal towards DiVincenzo’s step four. (See the picture on the right.) Of course, there is nothing wrong with setting intermediate goals, we do it all the time and this can be very fruitful.</p>
<p>For me, from the skeptical point of view, these intermediate goals were an opportunity, allowing me to present a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/29/the-argument-against-quantum-computers-a-very-short-introduction/">clear computational theoretic argument</a> for why “quantum supremacy” is out of reach and to connect the problem with the theory of noise-sensitivity and noise-stability and with Fourier methods that I and my colleagues developed in the 90s.</p>
<p>Adding the intermediate goal of quantum supremacy also represented a much slower time-table than what people previously anticipated. For example, nine years ago in 2013  John Martinis <a href="https://youtu.be/7Pok08VvkeU">gave a lecture</a> at <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/qstart/">QSTART</a>,  the opening conference of our HUJI quantum science center. At that time, John expected to have the ability of building distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes within a few years and the tasks of demonstrating logical gates and of logical qubits with <img alt="10^{-15}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B-15%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> error rates some years later. John also mentioned the ability to control 20 qubits within one month (to this Ray Laflamme commented that it is going to be a long month). All these targets are today still out of reach. It is undisputed that considerably lower noise rates are required even for achieving distance-3 surface codes and it is still not possible to have good control of 20-qubit (and perhaps even 10-qubit) quantum computation.</p>
<p>Of course, John Martinis himself was the leader of the Google efforts towards “quantum supremacy” which are now being carefully evaluated, and his vision and technology from 2013 was important for the Sycamore NISQ experiments. Let me mention that Google’s fantastic “quantum supremacy” claims were <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/10/amazing-feng-pan-and-pan-zhang-announced-a-way-to-spoof-classically-simulate-the-googles-quantum-supremacy-circuit/">largely (but not fully) refuted</a>.</p>
<p>There was a similar level of optimism from various other researchers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Schoelkopf#Schoelkopf.27s_law">It was expected</a> that coherence time would increase by a factor of ten every three years and there was a proposed “<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/does-nevens-law-describe-quantum-computings-rise-20190618/">double exponential law</a>” prediction for the classical computational power required to simulate quantum devices as time proceeds.  I personally don’t regard these specific claims as hype but rather as (at times, over-the-top) reasoned optimism, but both the reasoning and the predictions themselves should carefully be examined.</p>
<p>NISQ computers are interesting, and they allow interesting quantum physics experiments. Herman asserts that <strong><em>“quantum hybrid systems are making the qubit revolution something that’s happening now, not just a distant dream” </em></strong>and this echoes hopes of several researchers in academia and industry. My analysis asserts that NISQ computers are, from the computational complexity perspective, primitive classical computational devices with inherent chaotic behavior, and therefore, I don’t see how hybrid systems and the interface with conventional computers would turn them into useful computational devices. (They can still be useful for quantum physics experimentation.)</p>
<p>Let me repeat: slower progress than anticipated is very common, setting new intermediate goals is both common and welcome. By themselves they do not imply that the target of “<em><strong>large-scale quantum computers that can break into public encryption systems using Shor’s algorithm” </strong></em>is unrealistic, and indeed many experts in the field believe that it is a matter of time for this ultimate goal to be reached. My view is different, I try to explain my argument to other experts, and to offer experimental predictions and theoretical implications. There are good reasons to hope that the matter will be tested experimentally in the years to come, but my assessment is that the experimental picture from the past decade <strong>is not clear</strong>.</p>
<h3>IonQ, trapped ion quantum computation, and Elon Musk</h3>
<p>Herman’s article was triggered by a 183-page document written by a group called “Scorpion Capital.” The document attacks Maryland-based quantum computer company IonQ and among various concerns it also briefly mentions my and Michel Dyakonov’s positions about quantum computers.  I myself share the common view that ion-trap methods for quantum computers form a major avenue and that Chris Monroe (a co-founder of IonQ) is a major player in this direction. I don’t know much about IonQ’s specific efforts, but I would expect that large scale investment is required to put ion-trap methods to test and I personally would like to see it being tested. So I would be quite pleased to see <strong>Elon Musk</strong> deciding to buy IonQ or the Israeli trapped ion QC company of <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/ozeri/welcome-weizmann-trapped-ions-lab">Roee Ozeri</a> (or both) <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> and to make  trapped ion technology his quantum computing signature. Incidentally, the comment section of my 2018 <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/gil-kalais-argument-against-quantum-computers-20180207/">Quanta Magazine interview</a> presented an interesting exchange between Monroe and me (starting <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/gil-kalais-argument-against-quantum-computers-20180207/#comment-4559220424">here</a>).</p>
<h3>A few more remarks:</h3>
<p>1) Herman’s article raises several other interesting issues like when (and if) is the appropriate time to transfer to “post quantum cryptography” protocols.</p>
<p>2) There are a few researchers skeptical of quantum computers that actually conduct research and write papers (and books) about it. (There are others that regard the idea as absurd nonsense of absolutely no interest.) A notable researcher who wrote several important papers in the skeptical direction since the late 90s is Robert Alicki from the University of Gdansk.</p>
<p>3) Here is Herman’s crazy conclusion: “No one is saying the Scorpion Capital short-sellers are in Chinese pay, or that skeptics like Dyakonov and Kalai are knowingly putting their countries at risk. But waging war on the U.S. quantum industry can have serious consequences, unless quantum companies and labs show that they are not intimidated, and reassure the public that the quantum future doesn’t rest on hype but significant achievements—achievements that will make our country and our world safer, stronger, and more confident about our future as a whole.”</p>
<p>4) I changed the title to reflect the main topic of the post.</p>
<p><strong>Update (June 1, 2022):</strong> Very relevant to the discussion above: Yosi Avron told me about a very recent breakthrough for distance-3 surface code that is reported in the paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04566-8">Realizing repeated quantum error correction in a distance-three surface code</a>, by S. Krinner et al. (Here is a link to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03708">arXive version</a>, the researchers are from ETH, Jülich center, Quebec and other places.) Michael Rothschild (and others) told me about this recent breakthrough by a team led by Thomas Monz from the University of Innsbruck and Markus Müller from Aachen University and Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany for creating entangled logical qubits. The paper is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03079-6">Entangling logical qubits with lattice surgery</a> by Erhard et al, see <a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-01-error-protected-quantum-bits-entangled.html">also here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, now that Scott Aaronson<a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6444"> outsourced this very post of mine</a> for quantum computing commentary, I will end with a quote of Scott taken from the interesting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gil.kalai.1/posts/10160341938448792">Facebook thread</a> related to this post.  These days, Scott is busy dealing with deplorable rude remarks and attacks over the Internet pointed at him.  In my view, and this brings us back also to Herman’s piece, belligerent attacks are not appropriate in general and certainly are not constructive in academic discussions.</p>
<p>Scott commented that he chose to “sit this one out for now” regarding IonQ, and I asked him if he is still a believer in Google/Sycamore.  Here is Scott’s response (that I find rather reasonable; see further discussion between us in the thread).</p>

I think it showed the major result that the circuit fidelity scaled simply like the gate fidelity to the number of gates, and if that continues to be the case, then contrary to what you say, fault-tolerance will ultimately work. I also think that tensor network and other methods have gotten better at spoofing Sycamore’s Linear XEB score classically, nearly wiping out the quantum advantage as measured by time, though a significant quantum advantage remains as measured by floating-point ops or energy expenditure for the same LXEB score. We knew that quantum supremacy would be a moving target; recent progress underscores the need for better gate fidelities (which, fortunately, seem to be happening anyway) to stay ahead of classical computing on these benchmarks.</em></div>

    <title>TR22-080 |  QBF Merge Resolution is powerful but unnatural | 

	Meena Mahajan, 

	Gaurav Sood</title>
    <summary>The Merge Resolution proof system (M-Res) for QBFs, proposed by Beyersdorff et al. in 2019, explicitly builds partial strategies inside refutations. The original motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations encountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the syntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end up prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res over many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a comparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle this question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only LD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently known resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from Beyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res and LQU$^+$-Res.

Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i) MRes is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system, and (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the context of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. These results suggest that MRes is better used with weakening, though whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open. We note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+ $ $\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and Slivovsky).</summary>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Abstract: Algorithms increasingly interact with strategic, self-interested players; their design must take player incentives into account or risk being “gamed” and failing miserably. The algorithmic game theory literature traditionally focused on “mechanisms” – algorithms that incentivize players to truthfully report the <strong>input</strong>. In this talk we shift focus from mechanisms to “contracts”, which are concerned with the algorithm’s <strong>output</strong> and players’ incentives to carry it out. The goal of this talk is to describe where we’re at in forming a new algorithmic theory of contract design.</p>
<p>I will demonstrate how algorithmic approaches – in particular the approach of <strong>beyond worst-case analysis</strong> – can shed light on a classic economic puzzle regarding simple contracts. Within the realm of <strong>incentives and learning</strong>, I will discuss how classifiers induce incentives and show a formal relation to contracts.</p>
<p>Based on joint works with Tal Alon, Magdalen Dobson, Paul Duetting, Ron Lavi, Ariel Procaccia, Tim Roughgarden, Elisheva Shamash and Jamie Tucker-Foltz.</p>

    <title>TR22-079 |  Lower Bound Methods for Sign-rank and their Limitations | 

	Hamed Hatami, 

	Pooya Hatami, 

	William Pires, 

	Ran Tao, 

	Rosie Zhao</title>
    <summary>The sign-rank of a matrix $A$ with $\pm 1$ entries is the smallest rank of a real matrix with the same sign pattern as $A$. To the best of our knowledge, there are only three known methods for proving lower bounds on the sign-rank of explicit matrices:  (i) Sign-rank is at least the VC-dimension; (ii) Forster's method, which states that sign-rank is at least the inverse of the largest possible average margin among the representations of the matrix by points and half-spaces; (iii) Sign-rank is at least a logarithmic function of the density of the largest monochromatic rectangle. 
 

We prove several results regarding the limitations of these methods. 


$\bullet$ We prove that, qualitatively,  the monochromatic rectangle density is the strongest of these three lower bounds. If it fails to provide a super-constant lower bound for the sign-rank of a  matrix, then the other two methods will fail as well.   
$\bullet$ We show that there exist $n \times n$ matrices with sign-rank $n^{\Omega(1)}$ for which none of these methods can provide a super-constant lower bound.   
$\bullet$ We show that sign-rank is at most an exponential function of the deterministic communication complexity with access to an equality oracle. We combine this result with Green and Sanders' quantitative version of  Cohen's idempotent theorem to show that for a large class of sign matrices (e.g., XOR-lifts), sign-rank is at most an exponential function of the $\gamma_2$ norm of the matrix. We conjecture that this holds for all sign matrices. 
$\bullet$ Towards answering a question of Linial,  Mendelson,   Schechtman, and  Shraibman regarding the relation between sign-rank and discrepancy, we conjecture that sign-ranks of the $\pm1$ adjacency matrices of hypercube graphs can be arbitrarily large. We prove that none of the three lower bound techniques can resolve this conjecture in the affirmative.</summary>

    <title>TR22-078 |  Improved local testing for multiplicity codes | 

	Dan Karliner, 

	Amnon Ta-Shma</title>
    <summary>Multiplicity codes are a generalization of Reed-Muller codes which include derivatives as well as the values of low degree polynomials, evaluated in every point in $\mathbb{F}_p^m$. 
Similarly to Reed-Muller codes, multiplicity codes have a local nature that allows for local correction and local testing. 
Recently, the authors and Salama showed that the plane test, which tests the degree of the codeword on a random plane, is a good local tester for small enough degrees.
In this work we simplify and extend the analysis of local testing for multiplicity codes, giving a more general and tighter analysis. In particular, we show that multiplicity codes $\mathrm{MRM}_{p}(m, d, s)$ over prime fields with arbitrary $d$ are locally testable by an appropriate $k$-flat test, which tests the degree of the codeword on a random $k$-dimensional affine subspace. The relationship between the degree parameter $d$ and the required dimension $k$ is shown to be nearly optimal, and improves on the degree previously known in the case of planes.

Our analysis relies on a generalization of the technique of canonincal monomials introduced by Haramaty, Shpilka and Sudan (FOCS 2011). Generalizing canonical monomials to the multiplicity case requires substantially different proofs which exploit the algebraic structure of multiplicity codes.</summary>

    <title>TR22-077 |  Explicit Lower Bounds Against $\Omega(n)$-Rounds of Sum-of-Squares | 

	Max Hopkins, 

	Ting-Chun Lin</title>
    <summary>We construct an explicit family of 3-XOR instances hard for $\Omega(n)$-levels of the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) semi-definite programming hierarchy. Not only is this the first explicit construction to beat brute force search (beyond low-order improvements (Tulsiani 2021, Pratt 2021)), combined with standard gap amplification techniques it also matches the (optimal) hardness of random instances up to imperfect completeness (Grigoriev TCS 2001, Schoenebeck FOCS 2008). 

Our result is based on a new form of small-set high dimensional expansion (SS-HDX) inspired by recent breakthroughs in locally testable and quantum LDPC codes. Adapting the recent framework of Dinur, Filmus, Harsha, and Tulsiani (ITCS 2021) for SoS lower bounds from the Ramanujan complex to this setting, we show any (bounded-degree) SS-HDX can be transformed into a highly unsatisfiable 3-XOR instance that cannot be refuted by $\Omega(n)$-levels of SoS. We then show Leverrier and Z\'emor's (Arxiv 2022) recent qLDPC construction gives the desired explicit family of bounded-degree SS-HDX. Incidentally, this gives the strongest known form of bi-directional high dimensional expansion to date.</summary>

    <title>Privacy Doona&amp;#58; Why We Should Hide Among The Clones</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In this blog post, we will discuss a recent(ish) result of Feldman, McMillan, and Talwar <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803" title="Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Kunal Talwar. Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a>, which provides an improved and simple analysis of the so-called “amplification by shuffling” formally connecting local privacy (LDP) and shuffle privacy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Now, I’ll assume the reader is familiar with both LDP and Shuffle DP: if not, a quick-and-dirty refresher (with less quick, and less dirty references) can be found <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/\trustmodels">here</a>, and of course there is also Albert Cheu’s excellent survey on Shuffle DP <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11839" title="Albert Cheu. Differential Privacy in the Shuffle Model: A Survey of Separations. arXiv 2021"><strong>[Cheu21]</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I will also ignore most of the historical details, but it is worth mentioning that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803" title="Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Kunal Talwar. Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a> is not the first paper on this “amplification by shuffling,” (which, for local reasons, I’ll just call a <em>privacy <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/doona">doona</a></em>) but rather is the culmination of a rather long line of work involving many cool ideas and papers, starting with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01394" title="Albert Cheu, Adam D. Smith, Jonathan Ullman, David Zeber, Maxim Zhilyaev. Distributed Differential Privacy via Shuffling. EUROCRYPT 2019"><strong>[CSUZZ19</strong></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12469" title="&#xDA;lfar Erlingsson, Vitaly Feldman, Ilya Mironov, Ananth Raghunathan, Kunal Talwar, Abhradeep Thakurta. Amplification by Shuffling: From Local to Central Differential Privacy via Anonymity. SODA 2019"><strong>EFMRTT19]</strong></a>: I’d refer the reader to <strong>Table 1</strong> in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803" title="Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Kunal Talwar. Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a> for an overview.</p>

<p>Alright, now that the caveats are behind us, what <em>is</em> “amplification by shuffling”? In a nutshell, it is capturing the (false!) intuition that “anonymization provides privacy” (which, again, is false! Don’t do this!) and making it… less false. The idea is that while <em>anonymization does not provide in itself any meaningful privacy guarantee</em>, it can <em>amplify existing, rigorous privacy guarantee</em>. So if I start with a somewhat lousy LDP guarantee, but then all the messages sent by all users are completely anonymized, then my lousy LDP guarantee suddenly gets <em>much</em> stronger (roughly speaking, the \(\varepsilon\) parameter goes down with the square root of of the number of users involved). Which is wonderful! Let’s see what this means, quantitatively.</p>

<h3 id="the-result-of-feldman-mcmillan-and-talwar">The result of Feldman, McMillan, and Talwar.</h3>
<p>Here, we will focus on the simpler case of <em>noninteractive</em> protocols (one-shot messages from the users to the central server, no funny business with messages going back and forth); which is conceptually simpler to state and parse, still very rich and interesting, and, well, very relevant in practice (being the easiest and cheapest to deploy). If you want the results in their full glorious generality, though, they are in the paper.</p>

<p>What the main theorem of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803" title="Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Kunal Talwar. Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a> is saying for this noninteractive setting can then be stated as follows: if I have an <em>\(\varepsilon_L\)-locally private</em> (LDP) protocol for a task, where all \(n\) users pass their data through the same randomizer (algorithm) \(R\) and send the resulting message \(y_i \gets R(x_i)\), then just permuting the messages \(y_1\dots,y_n\) immediately gives an \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-<em>shuffle</em> private protocol for the same task, for any pair \((\varepsilon,\delta)\) which satisfies
<a name="eq:eps:epsL"/>
\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \leq \log\left( 1+ 16\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}-1}{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}+1}\sqrt{\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation}
as long as \(n \gg e^{\varepsilon_{L}}\log(1/\delta)\). That is quite a lot to parse, though: what does this actually <em>mean</em>?</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, the assumption that all users have the same randomizer (or at least cannot be distinguished by their randomizer) is quite natural: if they didn’t, then we wouldn’t be able to say anything in general, since the randomizer they use could just give away their identity completely. For instance, as an extreme case, the randomizer of user \(i\) could just append \(i\) to the message (it’s OK, still LDP!), and then shuffling achieves exactly nothing: we know who sent what. So OK, asking for all randomizers to be the same is not really a restriction.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, each user only sends one message, and this preserves its length (we just shuffled the messages, didn’t modify them!). So if you start with an LDP protocol with amazing features XYZ (e.g., the messages are \(1\)-bit long, or users don’t share a random seed, or the randomizers run in time \(O(1)\)), then the shuffle protocol enjoys exactly the same properties. (It only enjoys naturally some <em>robustness</em>, in the sense that if \(10\%\) if the \(n\) users maliciously deviate from the protocol, they can’t really jeopardize the privacy of the remaining \(90\%\) of users.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Which is… good.)</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, this is inherently approximate DP. Here we started with pure LDP (you can also extend that to approximate LDP) and ended up with approximate Shuffle DP: this is not a mistake, that’s how it is. I am not a purist (erm) myself, and that looks more than good enough to me; but if you seek pure Shuffle DP, then this result is not the droid you’re looking for.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="This is not the pure DP guarantee you are looking for." src="https://differentialprivacy.org/../images/droids-looking.png" width="50%"/>
</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Alright, <em>what</em> is this guarantee stated in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:eps:epsL">(1)</a> giving us? Let’s interpret the expression in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:eps:epsL">(1)</a> in two parameter regimes, focusing on \(\varepsilon\) (fixing some small \(\delta&gt;0\)). If we start with \(\varepsilon_{L} \ll 1\) for our LDP randomizers \(R\), then a first-order Taylor expansion shows that we get
\[
		\varepsilon \approx \varepsilon_{L}\cdot 8\sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}}
\]
so that <em>shuffling improved our privacy parameter by a factor \(\sqrt{n}\)</em>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> 😲 This is great! With more users, comes more privacy!</p>

<p>But that was starting with small \(\varepsilon_{L}\), that is, already pretty good privacy guarantees for our LDP “building block” \(R\). What happens if we start with “somewhat lousy” privacy guarantees, that is, \(\varepsilon_{L} \gg 1\)? Do we get anything interesting then?
Another Taylor expansion (everything is a Taylor expansion) shows us that, then,
<a name="eq:epsL:ll:one"/>
\[
\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \approx \log\left( 1+ 8\sqrt{\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation}
\]
or, put differently,
<a name="eq:epsL:gg:one"/>
\[
\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \approx 8e^{\varepsilon_{L}/2}\sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}} \tag{3}
\end{equation}
\]
That’s a bit harder to interpret, but that seems… useful? It is: let us see how much, with a couple examples.</p>

<h4 id="learning">Learning.</h4>
<p>The first one is distribution learning, a.k.a. density estimation: you have \(n\) i.i.d. samples (one per user) from an unknown probability distribution \(\mathbf{p}\) over a discrete domain of size \(k\), and your goal is to output an estimate \(\widehat{\mathbf{p}}\) such that, with high (say, constant) probability, \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(\widehat{\mathbf{p}}\) are close in <em>total variation distance</em>:
\[
		\operatorname{TV}(\mathbf{p},\widehat{\mathbf{p}}) = \sup_{S\subseteq [k]} (\mathbf{p}(S) - \widehat{\mathbf{p}}(S) ) \leq \alpha
\]
(if total variation distance seems a bit mysterious, it’s exactly half the \(\ell_1\) distance between the probability mass functions). We know how to solve this problem in the non-private setting: \(n=\Theta\left( \frac{k}{\alpha^2} \right)\) samples are necessary and sufficient. We know how to solve this problem in the (central) DP setting: \(n=\Theta\left( \frac{k}{\alpha^2} + \frac{k}{\alpha\varepsilon} \right)\) samples are necessary and sufficient <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/hash/2b3bf3eee2475e03885a110e9acaab61-Abstract.html" title="Ilias Diakonikolas, Moritz Hardt, Ludwig Schmidt. Differentially Private Learning of Structured Discrete Distributions. NeurIPS 2015"><strong>[DHS15]</strong></a>. We know how to solve this problem in the LDP setting: 
<a name="eq:learning:ldp"/>
\begin{equation}
n=\Theta\left(\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2(e^\varepsilon-1)^2}+\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2e^\varepsilon}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation}
samples are necessary and sufficient <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/acharya19a.html" title="Jayadev Acharya, Ziteng Sun, Huanyu Zhang. Hadamard Response: Estimating Distributions Privately, Efficiently, and with Little Communication. AISTATS 2019"><strong>[ASZ19]</strong></a> (note that the first term is just \(k/(\alpha^2\varepsilon^2)\) for small \(\varepsilon\)). Now, as they say in Mulan: <em>let’s make a shuffle DP algo out of you.</em></p>

<p>If we want to achieve \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-shuffle DP, we need to select \(\varepsilon_L\). Based on <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:ll:one">(2)</a> and <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:gg:one">(3)</a>, and ignoring pesky constants we will choose it so that
<a name="eq:choice:epsL"/>
\begin{equation}
	 \varepsilon_{L} \approx \varepsilon \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}}  \quad\text{ or }\quad e^{\varepsilon_{L}} \approx \varepsilon^2 \cdot \frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}\,. \tag{5}
\end{equation}
depending on whether \(\frac{\varepsilon^2 n}{\log(1/\delta)}\geq 1\). Plugging that back in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:learning:ldp">(4)</a>, we see that the first case corresponds to the first term (small \(\varepsilon_{L}\)) and the second to the second term (\(\varepsilon_{L} \geq 1\)), and overall the condition on \(n\) for the original LDP algorithm to 
successful learn the distribution becomes
\[
	n \gtrsim 
	\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2(e^{\varepsilon_{L}}-1)^2}+\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2e^{\varepsilon_{L}}}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}
	\approx \frac{k^2\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n}+\frac{k^2\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2} 
	 \approx \frac{k^2\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}
\]
(where \(\gtrsim\) means “let’s ignore constants”). There is an \(n\) in the RHS as well, so reorganizing and handling the two terms separately the condition on \(n\) becomes
\[
	n \gtrsim \frac{k \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}
\]
which… is great? We immediately get a sample complexity \(O\left(\frac{k}{\alpha^2}+\frac{k \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}\right)\) in the shuffle DP model, which (ignoring the \(\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}\)) matches the one in the <em>central</em> DP setting!</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Taking an optimal LDP algorithm and just shuffling the messages <em>immediately</em> gives an optimal shuffle DP algorithm, no extra work needed.</p>

<h4 id="uniformity-testing">(Uniformity) Testing.</h4>
<p>Alright, maybe it was a fluke? Let’s look at another “basic” problem close to my heart: we don’t want to learn the probability distribution \(\mathbf{p}\), just test whether it is actually <em>the</em> uniform distribution<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> \(\mathbf{u}\) on the domain \([k]={1,2,\dots,k}\). So if \(\mathbf{p} =\mathbf{u}\), you’ve got to say “yes” with probability at least \(2/3\), and if \(\operatorname{TV}(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{u})&gt;\alpha\), then you need to say “no” with probability at least \(2/3\).</p>

<p>This is also well understood in the non-private setting (\(n=\Theta(\sqrt{k}/\alpha^2)\)) <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4626074" title="Liam Paninski. A Coincidence-Based Test for Uniformity Given Very Sparsely Sampled Discrete Data. IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2008"><strong>[Paninski08]</strong></a> [see also <a href="https://ccanonne.github.io/survey-topics-dt.html}{my upcoming survey">my upcoming survey</a>], in the central DP setting (\(n=\Theta\left( \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2} + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha\sqrt{\varepsilon}}+\frac{k^{1/3}}{\alpha^{4/3}\varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{1}{\alpha\varepsilon} \right)\)) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05128" title="Jayadev Acharya, Ziteng Sun, Huanyu Zhang.

<p>Now, say you want an (\(\varepsilon,\delta)\)-shuffle DP algorithm for uniformity testing, but don’t want to design one from scratch (though it <em>is</em> possible to do so, and some did <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09481" title="Victor Balcer, Albert Cheu, Matthew Joseph, Jieming Mao. Connecting Robust Shuffle Privacy and Pan-Privacy. SODA 2021"><strong>[BCJM21</strong></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08987" title="Cl&#xE9;ment L. Canonne, Hongyi Lyu. Uniformity Testing in the Shuffle Model: Simpler, Better, Faster. SOSA 2022"><strong>CL22</strong></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10032" title="Albert Cheu, Chao Yan. Pure Differential Privacy from Secure Intermediaries. arXiv 2021"><strong>CY21]</strong></a>). Let’s say you want to look at the “no-common-random-seed-shared-by-users” model (a.k.a. <em>private-coin</em> setting): so you stare at the corresponding LDP communication complexity, <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:testing:ldp:privatecoin">(7)</a>, and try to choose \(\varepsilon_L\) to start with before shuffling. This will be the same as in the learning example (i.e., <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:choice:epsL">(5)</a>): based on <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:ll:one">(2)</a> and <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:gg:one">(3)</a>, we will set
\begin{equation}
	 \varepsilon_{L} \approx \varepsilon \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}}  \quad\text{ or }\quad e^{\varepsilon_{L}} \approx \varepsilon^2 \cdot \frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}\,.
\end{equation}
depending on whether \(\frac{\varepsilon^2 n}{\log(1/\delta)}\geq 1\). Plugging this back in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:testing:ldp:privatecoin">(7)</a> and quickly checking which case corresponds to each term, we then easily get that for our algorithm to correctly solve the uniformity testing problem, it suffices that the sample complexity (number of users) \(n\) satisfies
\[
	n \gtrsim \frac{k^{3/2}}{\alpha^2(e^{\varepsilon_L}-1)^2} + \frac{k^{3/2}}{\alpha^2e^{\varepsilon_L}} + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}
	 \approx \frac{k^{3/2}\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n } + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}
\]
which, reorganizing and solving for \(n\), means that it suffices to have 
\[
	n \gtrsim \frac{k^{3/4}\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon} + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}\,.
\]
And, <em>voilà</em>! Even better, we also have strong evidence to suspect that this sample complexity \(O\Big(\frac{k^{3/4}\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}+ \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}\Big)\) is tight among all private-coin algorithms.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Now, if you wanted to look at <em>public-coin</em> shuffle DP protocols (with a common random seed available), then you would start with an optimal public-coin LDP algorithm (and look at <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:testing:ldp:publiccoin">(6)</a>), and setting \(\varepsilon_L\) the same way you’d get a shuffle DP algorithm with sample complexity
\[
n=O\Big(\frac{k^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(1/\delta)}{\alpha^{4/3}\varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{\sqrt{k\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}+ \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}\Big)
\]
which, well, is <em>also</em> strongly believed to be optimal!</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Here again, taking an optimal off-the-shelf LDP algorithm and just shuffling the messages <em>immediately</em> gives an optimal shuffle DP algorithm, no extra work needed.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion.</h3>
<p>I hope the above convinced you of how useful this privacy amplification can be: from an optimal LDP algorithm, featuring any extra appealing characteristics you like, <em>just adding an extra shuffling step as postprocessing</em> yields an (often optimal? At least good) shuffle DP algorithm, <em>with the same characteristics</em> and built-in robustness against malicious users.</p>

<p>All you need is to make sure that your starting point, the LDP algorithm satisfies a couple things: (1) all users have the same randomizer,<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and (2) it works in all regimes of \(\varepsilon\) (both high-privacy, \(\varepsilon \leq 1\), <em>and</em> low-privacy, \(\varepsilon \gg 1\)). Once you’ve got this, Bob’s your uncle! You get shuffle DP algorithms for free.</p>

<p>It is not only appealing from a theoretical point of view, by the way! The authors of the paper worked hard to make their empirical analysis compelling as well, and their code is available <a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-shuffling-amplification">on GitHub</a> 📝. But more importantly, from a practitioner’s point of view, this means it is enough to design, implement, and test <em>one</em> algorithm (the LDP one we start with) to automatically get a trusted one in the shuffle DP model as well: this reduces the risks of bugs, security failures, the amount of work spending tuning, testing…</p>

<p>So yes, whenever possible, we <em>should</em> hide among the clones!</p>

Intuitively, the “amplification by shuffling” paradigm can be seen as anonymizing the messages from local randomizers, whose message distribution can be mathematically decomposed as a mixture of “noise distribution not depending on the user’s input” and “distribution actually depending on their input.” As a result, each user randomly sends a message from the first or second distribution of the mixture.  But the shuffling then hides the informative messages (drawn from the second part of the mixture) among the non-informative (noise) ones: so the noise messages end up providing a “privacy blanket” in which sensitive information is safely and soundly wrapped. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:1">↩</a></p>

<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism">Longtermism</a>” is a moral philosophy that places much more weight on the well-being of all future generations than on the current one. It <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism">holds</a> that “positively influencing the long-term future is a key moral priority of our time,” where “long term” can be <em>really</em> long term, e.g., “many thousands of years in the future, or much further still.”   At its core is the belief that each one of the potential quadrillion or more people that may exist in the future is as important as any single person today.</p>

<p>Longtermism has recently attracted attention, some of it in <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/the-dangerous-ideas-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk">alarming tones</a>. The reasoning behind longtermism is natural: if we assume that human society will continue to exist for at least a few millennia, many more people will be born in the future than are alive today. However, since predictions are famously hard to make, especially about the future, longtermism invariably gets wrapped up with probabilities. Once you do these calculations, preventing an infinitely bad outcome, even if it would only happen with tiny probability, will have infinite utility. Hence longtermism tends to focus on so-called “existential risk”:  The risk that humanity will go through in an extinction event, like the one suffered by the Neanderthals or Dinosaurs, or another type of irreversible humanity-wise calamity.<br/></p>



<p>This post explains why I do not subscribe to this philosophy. Let me clarify that I am not saying that all longtermists are bad people. Many “longtermists” have given generously to improve people’s lives worldwide, particularly in developing countries. For example, none of the top charities of <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">Givewell</a> (an organization associated with the effective altruism movement, in which many prominent longtermists are members) focus on hypothetical future risks. Instead, they all deal with current pressing issues, including Malaria, childhood vaccinations, and extreme poverty. Overall the effective altruism movement has done much to benefit currently living people. Some of its members <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17962134/future-perfect-podcast-kidney-donation">donated their kidneys to strangers</a>: These are good people- morally better than me. It is hardly fair to fault people that are already contributing more than most others for caring about issues that I think are less significant.</p>

<p/>



<p>This post critiques the philosophy of longtermism rather than the particular actions or beliefs of “longtermists.” In particular, the following are often highly correlated with one another:</p>



<ol><li>Belief in the philosophy of longtermism.</li><li>A belief that existential risk is not just a concern for the far-off future and a low-probability event, but there is a very significant chance of it happening in the near future (next few decades or at most a century).</li><li>A belief that the most significant existential risk could arise from artificial intelligence and that this is a real risk in the near future.</li></ol>



<p>Here I focus on (1) and explain why I disagree with this philosophy. While I might disagree on specific calculations of (2) and (3), I fully agree with the need to think and act regarding near-term risks.  Society tends to err on the side of being too myopic. We prepare too little even for risks that are not just predictable but are also predicted, including climate change, pandemics, nuclear conflict, and even software hacks. It is hard to motivate people to spend resources for safety when the outcome (bad event not happening) is invisible. It is also true that over the last decades, humanity’s technological capacities have grown so much that for the first time in history, we are capable of doing irreversible damage to our planet. </p>



<p>In addition to the above, I agree that we need to think carefully about the risks of any new technology, particularly one that, like artificial intelligence, can be very powerful but not fully understood.  Some AI risks are relevant to the shorter term: they are likely over the next decade or are already happening. There <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815">are</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205">several</a> <a href="https://fairmlbook.org/">books</a> on these challenges. None of my critiques apply to such issues. At some point, I might write a separate blog post about artificial intelligence and its short and long-term risks. </p>



<p>My reasons for not personally being a “longtermist” are the following:</p>



<p><strong>The probabilities are too small to reason about.</strong></p>



<p>Physicists know that there is no point in writing a measurement up to 3 significant digits if your measurement device has only one-digit accuracy. Our ability to reason about events that are decades or more into the future is severely limited. At best, we could estimate probabilities up to an order of magnitude, and even that may be optimistic. Thus, claims such as <a href="https://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html">Nick Bostrom’s</a>, that <em>“the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred billion times as much as a billion human lives”</em> make no sense to me.  This is especially the case since these “probabilities” are Bayesian, i.e., correspond to degrees of belief. If, for example, you evaluate the existential-risk probability by aggregating the responses of 1000 experts, then what one of these experts had for breakfast is likely to have an impact larger than 0.001 percent (which, according to Bostrom, would correspond to much more than 10²⁰ human lives). To the extent we can quantify existential risks in the far future, we can only say something like “extremely likely,” “possible,” or “can’t be ruled out.” Assigning numbers to such qualitative assessments is an exercise in futility. </p>



<p><strong>I cannot justify sacrificing current living humans for abstract probabilities.</strong></p>



<p>Related to the above, rather than focusing on specific, measurable risks (e.g., earthquakes, climate change), longtermism is often concerned with extremely hard to quantify risks. In truth, we cannot know what will happen 100 years into the future and what would be the impact of any particular technology. Even if our actions will have drastic consequences for future generations, the dependence of the impact on our choices is likely to be chaotic and unpredictable. To put things in perspective, many of the risks we are worried about today, including nuclear war, climate change, and AI safety, only emerged in the last century or decades. It is hard to underestimate our ability to predict even a decade into the future, let alone a century or more.</p>



<p>Given that there is so much suffering and need in the world right now, I cannot accept a philosophy that prioritizes abstract armchair calculations over actual living humans. (This concern is not entirely hypothetical: <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism-2/">Greaves and MacAskill</a> estimate that $100 spent on AI safety would, in expectation, correspond to saving a <em>trillion lives</em> and hence would be “far more than the near-future benefits of bednet distribution [for preventing Malaria],” and recommend that it is better that individuals “fund AI safety rather than developing world poverty reduction.”)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism">Moorhouse</a> compares future humans to ones living far away from us. He says that just like “something happening far away from us in space isn’t less intrinsically bad just because it’s far away,” we should care about humans in the far-off future as much as we care about present ones. But I think that we <em>should</em> care less about very far away events, especially if it’s so far away that we cannot observe them. E.g., as far as we know, there may well be trillions of sentient beings in the universe right now whose welfare can somehow be impacted by our actions. </p>



<p><strong>We cannot improve what we cannot measure.</strong></p>



<p>An inherent disadvantage of probabilities is that they are invisible until they occur. We have no direct way to measure whether a probability of an event X has increased or decreased. So, we cannot tell whether our efforts are working or not. The <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/05/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-blockchain-a-book-review/">scientific revolution</a> involved moving from armchair philosophizing to making measurable predictions. I do not believe we can make meaningful progress without concrete goals. For some risks, we do have quantifiable goals (Carbon emissions, number of nuclear warheads). Still, there are significant challenges to finding a measurable proxy for very low-probability and far-off events. Hence, even if we accept that the risks are real and vital, I do not think we can directly do anything about them before finding such proxies. </p>



<p>Proxies do not have to be perfect: Theoretical computer science made much progress using the imperfect measure of worst-case asymptotic complexity. The same holds for machine learning and artificial benchmarks. It is enough that proxies encourage the generation of new ideas or technologies and achieve gradual improvement. One lesson from modern machine learning is that the objective (aka loss function) doesn’t have to perfectly match the task for it to be useful.</p>



<p><strong>Long-term risk mitigation can only succeed through short-term progress.</strong></p>



<p>Related to the above, I believe that addressing long-term risks can only be successful if it’s tied to shorter-term advances that have clear utility. For example, consider the following two extinction scenarios:</p>



<p>1. The actual Neanderthal extinction.<br/>2. A potential human extinction 50 years from now due to total nuclear war.</p>



<p>I argue that the only realistic scenario to avoid extinction in both cases is a sequence of actions that improve some measurable outcome. While sometimes extinction could theoretically be avoided by a society making a huge sacrifice to eliminate a hypothetical scenario, this could never actually happen.</p>



<p>While the reasons for the Neanderthal extinction are not fully known, most researchers believe that Neanderthals were out-competed by our ancestors – modern humans – who had better tools and ways to organize society. The crucial point is that the approaches to prevent extinction for Neanderthal were the same ones to improve their lives in their current environment. They may not have been capable of doing so, but it wasn’t because they were working on the wrong problems.</p>



<p>Contrast this with the scenario of human extinction through total nuclear war. In such a case, our conventional approaches for keeping nuclear arms in check, such as international treaties and sanctions, have failed. Perhaps in hindsight, humanity’s optimum course of action would have been a permanent extension of the middle ages, stopping the scientific revolution from happening through restricting education, religious oppression, and vigorous burning-at-stake of scientists.  Or perhaps humanity could even now make a collective decision to go back and delete all traces of post 17th-century science and technology.</p>



<p>I cannot rule out the possibility that, in hindsight, one of those outcomes would have had more aggregate utility than our current trajectory. But even if this is the case, such an outcome is simply not possible. Humanity can not and will not halt its progress, and solutions to significant long-term problems have to arise as a sequence of solutions to shorter-range measurable ones, each of which shows positive progress. Our only hope to avoid a total nuclear war is through piecemeal quantifiable progress.  We need to use diplomacy, international cooperation, and monitoring technologies to reduce the world’s nuclear arsenal one warhead at a time. This piecemeal, incremental approach may or may not work, but it’s the only one we have. </p>



<p><strong>Summary: think of the long term, but act and measure in the short term.</strong></p>



<p>It is appropriate for philosophers to speculate on hypothetical scenarios centuries into the future and wonder whether actions we take today could influence them. However, I do not believe such an approach will, in practice, lead to a positive impact on humanity and, if taken to the extreme, may even have negative repercussions. We should maintain epistemic humility. Statements about probabilities involving fractions of percentage points, or human lives in the trillions, should raise alarm bells. Such calculations can be particularly problematic since they can lead to a “the end justifies the means” attitude, which can accept any harm to currently living people in the name of the practically infinite multitudes of future hypothetical beings. </p>



<p>We need to maintain the invariant that, even if motivated by the far-off future, our actions “first do no harm” to living, breathing humans. Indeed, as I mentioned, even longtermists don’t wake up every morning thinking about how to reduce the chance that something terrible happens in the year 1,000,000 AD by 0.001%. Instead, many longtermists care about particular risks because they believe these risks are likely in the near-term future. If you manage to make a convincing case that humanity faces a real chance of near-term total destruction, then most people would agree that this is very very bad, and we should act to prevent it. It doesn’t matter whether humanity’s extinction is two times or a zillion times worse than the death of half the world’s population. Talking about trillions of hypothetical beings thousands of years into the future only turns people off. There is a reason that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager">Pascal’s Wager</a> is not such a winning argument, and I have yet to meet someone who converted to a particular religion because it had the grisliest version of hell.</p>



<p>This does not mean that thinking and preparing for longer-term risks is pointless. Maintaining seed banks, monitoring asteroids, researching pathogens, designing vaccine platforms, and working toward nuclear disarmament, are all essential activities that society should take. Whenever a new technology emerges, artificial intelligence included, it is crucial to consider how it can be misused or lead to unintended consequences. By no means do I argue that humanity should spend all of its resources only on actions that have a direct economic benefit. Indeed, the whole enterprise of basic science is built on pursuing directions that, in the short term, increase our knowledge but do not have practical utility. Progress is not measured only in dollars, but it should be measured somehow. Epistemic humility also means that we should be content with working on direct, measurable proxies, even if they are not perfect matches for the risk at hand. For example, the probability of extinction via total nuclear war might not be a direct function of the number of deployed nuclear warheads. However, the latter is still a pretty good proxy for it.</p>



<p>Similarly, even if you are genuinely worried about long-term risk, I suggest you spend most of your time in the present. Try to think of short-term problems whose solutions can be verified, which might advance the long-term goal. A “problem” does not have to be practical: it can be a mathematical question, a computational challenge, or an empirically verifiable prediction. The advantage is that even if the long-term risk stays hypothetical or the short-term problem turns out to be irrelevant to it, you have still made measurable progress. As <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/05/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-blockchain-a-book-review/">has happened before</a>, to make actual progress on solving existential risk, the topic needs to move from philosophy books and blog discussions into empirical experiments and concrete measures.</p>

<p>
David Hilbert famously presented 23 important open mathematical problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. He intended to include a 24th on the simplicity of proofs.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss this problem, which was “lost” until the historian Rüdiger Thiele discovered it in Hilbert’s papers in 2000 and brought it to light in a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=C970003BC10AB452B346D45B8AAE14B6?doi=10.1.1.97.7633&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a> for the American Mathematical Monthly.</p>
<p>
I (Ken) have long wondered why Hilbert targeted the number 23 for his list. That some of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems">problems</a> have broad, vague statements tells me he could have altered their number. To be sure, he discussed only 10 in his actual 1900 lecture; the rest appeared in his long <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3.pdf">article</a> that year. Until Dick drafted this post and I found Thiele’s article, I had not known about a No. 24—a nice factorial number. </p>
<p>
As <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsta.2018.0040">discussed</a> by Inês Hipolito and Reinhard Kahle, in a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/toc/rsta/2019/377/2140">special issue</a> of the UK Royal Society <em>Philosophical Transactions A</em> devoted to Hilbert’s 24th, there were only faint traces of it until Thiele’s discovery. They decline to guess Hilbert’s motives for leaving it out, but I venture this: Hilbert could not agree with himself on the terms by which to state it, even broadly. How to quantify simplicity was already the subject of Dick’s draft, into which we blend.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Pólya on Proofs </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One simple question is whether a human notion of simpler proof would accord with, say, that of a Martian. George Pólya was one of a vanguard of Hungarian emigré scientists who came to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martians_(scientists)">The Martians</a> after another of them, the physicist Leo Szilard, gave this answer to Enrico Fermi’s question of why aliens had not been detected when life in the universe should be plentiful:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“They are among us, but they call themselves Hungarians.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Kidding aside, this could set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf</a> type hypothesis that humans from disparate linguistic groups and mathematical cultures could have different values for proofs. Even if so, the joke would be on non-Hungarians, because Paul Erdős, whose idea of “Proofs from The Book” set the internationally recognized standard of proof elegance, was also a “Martian.”</p>
<p>
Pólya’s quote above hits the nail on the head. For an example, consider the <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/math/q1.html">theorem</a> that: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> The square root of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is irrational. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>
The well-known proof begins by supposing not: </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/23/hilberts-lost-problem/proof-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-20055"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-20055" height="460" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/proof.png?resize=450%2C460&amp;ssl=1" width="450"/></a></p>
<p>
One might claim that this famous proof is not obvious—do you agree?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Measure </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Now consider the general task of proving statements of this form:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em><a name="pos"/> For all <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(n) &gt; 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28n%29+%3E+0.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
</em><p><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Think this as an encoding of an interesting property: For example, for each <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> there is a prime <img alt="{p&gt;n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Or for each planar graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> there is some four coloring of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Or <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
To make this more concrete, let us base proofs on the Peano axioms for arithmetic, and suppose that <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is well-defined in this system. Note that proving <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be total computable is not the same as proving that all its values are <em>positive</em> as Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#pos">2</a> asserts. In case Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#pos">2</a> is provable, we have two key parameters:</p>
<li>D: The length of the definition of <img alt="{f(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.
</li><li>P: The length of the full proof of Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#pos">2</a>.
<p/><p><br/>
Our proof simplicity measure is then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  M=\frac{P}{D} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++M%3D%5Cfrac%7BP%7D%7BD%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p/><h2> Some Instances </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are some keys to understanding the value <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> intuitively:</p>
<ol>
<li> For known provable problems we might have that <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is not too large
</li><li> For classic problems like the Four-Color problem we might have that <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is huge. Think of the proof that arises in this case.
</li><li> For many chess positions where one side can win, say checkmate in 30 moves, the proof of that is likewise huge. Crafting chess problems where the proof is both crisp and hard to find is a centuries-old art.
</li><li> For open problems, <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is currently infinite.
</li><li> But for practical software we get something bounded. The trouble here is that <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is potentially huge and could be the size of <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.
</li></ol>
<p>
Consider for the last case a program that calculates your tax payment based on the US tax code, for example. The code has wording like:  </p>
<blockquote><p>
An apparently insignificant discrepancy between the wording in the Statutes at Large and the wording in some editions of the U.S. Code with respect to a provision of the Internal Revenue Code (specifically, the words “any papers” in the first sentence of 6104(a)(1)(A) is described by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of Tax Analysts v. Internal Revenue Serv., 214 F.3d 179 (D.C. Cir. 2000), in footnote 1. According to the Court, some versions of the U.S. Code show the text as “any paper” while the Statutes at Large version shows the text as “any papers.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Thus the proof <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> could be the same size of <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Thus,</p>
<p>
Case: <img alt="{P &gt;&gt; D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP+%3E%3E+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This is the usual proof of a classic problem like the four-color problem. Huge proof. </p>
<p>
Case: <img alt="{P \approx D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP+%5Capprox+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This is like a simple problem or like a proof of a complex program with tons of bits in its description. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Proofs and Software </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My famous—infamous?—<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">paper</a> with Alan Perlis and Rich de Millo raised the related issue in the first sentence of our abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is argued that formal verifications of programs, no matter how obtained, will not play the same key role in the development of computer science and software engineering as proofs do in mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This argument made over four decades ago has been argued by critics as being wrong. Take a look at <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/06/i-went-to-debate-about-program-verif.html">this</a> for comments about the recent <a href="https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/2021/05/26/debate-that-changed-programming-living-history/">debate</a> on the paper moderated by Harry Lewis.</p>
<p>
We claim that we were correct but for a different reason that we made in the original paper. We got it <b>right</b> but for the wrong reason. The real reason is alluded to in this <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication8316-abstract.html">statement</a> by Tony Hoare, whose programme of proofs for programs partly spurred our paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ten years ago, researchers into formal methods (and I was the most mistaken among them) predicted that the programming world would embrace with gratitude every assistance promised by formalisation to solve the problems of reliability that arise when programs get large and more safety-critical. Programs have now got very large and very critical—well beyond the scale which can be comfortably tackled by formal methods. … It has turned out that the world just does not suffer significantly from the kind of problem that our research was originally intended to solve.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
See also his 1996 <a href="http://176.9.41.242/docs/math/1996-hoare.pdf">position paper</a>, “How Did Software Get So Reliable Without Proof?”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Does this measure <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> shed some light on the problems of program verification? Is it useful? Would it have satisfied Hilbert? Hilbert’s handwritten note discovered by Thiele showed him thinking in terms of proofs via polynomial invariants and equations—hence maybe not at a brute level of counting symbols.</p>

    <title>In the 1960's students protested the Vietnam war!/In 1830 students protested... Math?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> I was at SUNY Stonybrook for college 1976-1980. </p><p>I remember one student protest about a change to the calendar that (I think) would have us go home for winter break and then come back for finals.  I don't recall how that turned out. </p><p>However I had heard about the protests in the 1960's over the Vietnam war. Recall that there was a draft back then so college students were directly affected. </p><p>I was reading a book `<i>Everything you know is wrong'</i> which noted that some people thought the first time there were student protests was in the 1960's but this is not true. (Not quite as startling as finding out that a ships captain cannot perform weddings.) </p><p>It pointed to <i>The 1830 Conic Section Rebellion. </i>I quote Wikipedia (full entry is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_Sections_Rebellion">here</a>)</p><p><i>Prior to the introduction of blackboards, Yale students had been allowed to consult diagrams in their textbooks when solving geometry problems pertaining to conic sections – even on exams. When the students were no longer allowed to consult the text, but were instead required to draw their own diagrams on the blackboard, they refused to take the final exam. As a result forty-three of the ninety-six students – among them, Alfred Stille, and Andrew Calhoun, the son of John C. Calhoun (Vice Pres a the time) – were summarily expelled, and Yale authorities warned neighboring universities against admitting them.</i></p><p>Random Thoughts</p><p>1) From my 21st century prospective I am on the students side. It seems analogous to allowing students to use calculators-- which I do allow. </p><p>2) From my 21st century prospective the punishment seems unfair. </p><p>3) The notion of a school telling other schools to not admit student- I do not think this would happen now, and might even be illegal (anti-trust).</p><p>4) I am assuming  the students wanted to be able to consult their text out of some principle: we want to learn concepts not busy work.  And again, from my prospective I agree that it was busy work. </p><p>5) Since all of my thoughts are from a 21st century prospective, they may be incorrect, or at least not as transferable to the 1830 as I think. (Paradox: My ideas may not be as true as I think. But if I think that...) </p><p>6) I try to avoid giving busy work. When I teach Decidability and Undecidability I NEVER have the students actually write a Turing Machine that does something. In other cases I also try to make sure they never have to do drudge work.  And I might not even be right in the 21st century- some of my colleagues tell me its good for the students to get their hands dirty (perhaps just a little) with real TM to get a feel for the fact that they can do anything. </p><p>7) The only student protests I hear about nowadays are on political issues. Do you know of any student protests on issues of how they are tested or what the course requirements are, or something of that ilk? I can imagine my discrete math students marching with signs that say: </p><p>DOWN WITH INDUCTION!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR22-076 |  Average-Case Hardness of Proving Tautologies and Theorems | 

	Hunter Monroe</title>
    <summary>We consolidate two widely believed conjectures about tautologies---no optimal proof system exists, and most require superpolynomial size proofs in any system---into a $p$-isomorphism-invariant condition satisfied by all paddable $\textbf{coNP}$-complete languages or none. The condition is: for any Turing machine (TM) $M$ accepting the language, $\textbf{P}$-uniform input families requiring superpolynomial time by $M$ exist (equivalent to the first conjecture) and appear with positive upper density in an enumeration of input families (implies the second). In that case, no such language is easy on average (in $\textbf{AvgP}$) for a distribution applying non-negligible weight to the hard families.

The hardness of proving tautologies and theorems is likely related. Motivated by the fact that arithmetic sentences encoding "string $x$ is Kolmogorov random" are true but unprovable with positive density in a finitely axiomatized theory $\mathcal{T}$ (Calude and Jürgensen), we conjecture that any propositional proof system requires superpolynomial size proofs for a dense set of $\textbf{P}$-uniform families of tautologies encoding "there is no $\mathcal{T}$ proof of size $\leq t$ showing that string $x$ is Kolmogorov random". This implies the above condition.

The conjecture suggests that there is no optimal proof system because undecidable theories help prove tautologies and do so more efficiently as axioms are added, and that constructing hard tautologies seems difficult because it is impossible to construct Kolmogorov random strings. Similar conjectures that computational blind spots are manifestations of noncomputability would resolve other open problems.</summary>

    <title>TR22-075 |  Vanishing Spaces of Random Sets and Applications to Reed-Muller Codes |

    <summary>We study the following natural question on random sets of points in $\mathbb{F}_2^m$:
    

Given a random set of $k$ points $Z=\{z_1, z_2, \dots, z_k\} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^m$, what is the dimension of the space of degree at most $r$ multilinear polynomials that vanish on all points in $Z$?


We show that, for $r \leq \gamma m$ (where $\gamma &gt; 0$ is a small, absolute constant) and $k = (1-\epsilon) \cdot {m \choose {\leq r}}$ for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the space of degree at most $r$ multilinear polynomials vanishing on a random set $Z = \{z_1,\ldots, z_k\}$ has dimension exactly ${m \choose {\leq r}} - k$ with probability $1 - o(1)$. This bound shows that random sets have a much smaller space of degree at most $r$ multilinear polynomials vanishing on them, compared to the worst-case bound (due to Wei (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 1991)) of ${m \choose{\leq r}} - {{\log_2 k}\choose {\leq r}} \gg {m\choose{\leq r}} - k$. 

    Using this bound, we show that high-degree Reed-Muller codes ($\text{RM}(m,d)$ with $d &gt; (1-\gamma) m$) ``achieve capacity'' under the Binary Erasure Channel in the sense that, for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we can recover from $(1 - \epsilon) \cdot {m\choose {\leq m-d-1}}$ random erasures with probability $1 - o(1)$. This also implies that $\text{RM}(m,d)$ is also efficiently decodable from $\approx {m\choose {\leq m-(d/2)}}$ random errors for the same range of parameters.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Martha Osegueda, one of Mike Goodrich’s students at UC Irvine, successfully defended her doctoral dissertation yesterday. Martha is originally Salvadorean, and came to UCI from an undergraduate degree at the University of Texas El Paso. Her research at UCI has spanned a wide variety of topics in graph drawing, phylogeny, computational geometry, and parallel query complexity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Minimum-width drawings of phylogenetic trees” from <em>COCOA</em> 2019 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36412-0_4">doi:10.1007/978-3-030-36412-0_4</a>) is about drawing evolutionary trees compactly. For the version of tree drawing they study, it turns out to be NP-hard when the order of the leaves is unconstrained but linear-time solvable for fixed leaf orderings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Reconstructing binary trees in parallel” from <em>SPAA</em> 2020 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15259">arXiv:2006.15259</a>) involved the reconstruction of evolutionary trees from queries asking which pair of a triple of species is closest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Concatenation arguments and their applications to polyominoes and polycubes”, in <em>CGTA</em> 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2021.101790">doi:10.1016/j.comgeo.2021.101790</a>) and “On the number of compositions of two polycubes” from <em>EuroComb</em> 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83823-2_12">doi:10.1007/978-3-030-83823-2_12</a>) strengthen the known lower bounds on the growth rates of polyominoes and polycubes, using arguments based on counting ways of gluing pairs of smaller polyforms into larger ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Angles of arc-polygons and Lombardi drawings of cacti”, from <em>CCCG</em> 2021 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03615">arXiv:2107.03615</a>) is my only collaboration with Martha and one <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/07/10/angles-arc-triangles.html">I have posted about here</a>. It characterizes the vertex angles that are possible in triangles with circular-arc sides, and uses that characterization to prove the existence of a Lombardi drawing for any cactus graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Parallel network mapping algorithms” from <em>SPAA</em> 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3409964.3461822">doi:10.1145/3409964.3461822</a>) and “Mapping Networks via parallel \(k\)th-hop traceroute queries” from <em>STACS</em> 2022 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2022.4">doi:10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2022.4</a>) are on traceroute-like problems: mapping the structure of a computer communication network using a small number of parallel rounds of pings to determine distances from nodes on the network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Taming the knight’s tour: Minimizing turns and crossings” from <em>FUN</em> 2021 and <em>TCS</em> 2022 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2021.12.002">doi:10.1016/j.tcs.2021.12.002</a>) shows how to move a chess knight around all of the squares of a chessboard, touching each square once, so that the number of times the knight’s path crosses itself or deviates from a straight path are both simultaneously approximately minimized.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Diamonds are forever in the blockchain: Geometric polyhedral point-set pattern matching” is her newest work, in submission. It studies problems of aligning a polyhedron to sample points from a similarly-shaped surface, motivated by an application in tracing the provenance of ethically sourced diamonds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Despite all of these good publications, Mike tells me that it was difficult to persuade Martha that she had done enough for a doctorate. But she had, easily, and now she’s moving on to a position at Meta. Congratulations, Martha!</p>
