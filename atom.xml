from optimal solutions to neighboring (i.e., locally modified) instances? For
example, can we efficiently compute an optimal coloring for a graph from
optimal colorings for all one-edge-deleted subgraphs? Studying such questions
not only gives detailed insight into the structure of the problem itself, but
also into the complexity of related problems; most notably graph theory's core
notion of critical graphs (e.g., graphs whose chromatic number decreases under
deletion of an arbitrary edge) and the complexity-theoretic notion of
minimality problems (also called criticality problems, e.g., recognizing graphs
that become 3-colorable when an arbitrary edge is deleted).
</p>
<p>We focus on two prototypical graph problems, Colorability and Vertex Cover.
For example, we show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal coloring for a
graph from optimal colorings for all its one-vertex-deleted subgraphs, and that
this remains true even when optimal solutions for all one-edge-deleted
subgraphs are given. In contrast, computing an optimal coloring from all (or
even just two) one-edge-added supergraphs is in P. We observe that Vertex Cover
exhibits a remarkably different behavior, demonstrating the power of our model
to delineate problems from each other more precisely on a structural level.
</p>
<p>Moreover, we provide a number of new complexity results for minimality and
criticality problems. For example, we prove that Minimal-3-UnColorability is
complete for DP (differences of NP sets), which was previously known only for
the more amenable case of deleting vertices rather than edges. For Vertex
Cover, we show that recognizing beta-vertex-critical graphs is complete for
Theta_2^p (parallel access to NP), obtaining the first completeness result for
a criticality problem for this class.

halfspaces in the presence of Massart noise. Specifically, we are given a set
of labeled examples $(\mathbf{x}, y)$ drawn from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$
on $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ such that the marginal distribution on the unlabeled
points $\mathbf{x}$ is arbitrary and the labels $y$ are generated by an unknown
halfspace corrupted with Massart noise at noise rate $\eta&lt;1/2$. The goal is to
find a hypothesis $h$ that minimizes the misclassification error
$\mathbf{Pr}_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ h(\mathbf{x}) \neq y
\right]$.
</p>
<p>We give a $\mathrm{poly}\left(d, 1/\epsilon \right)$ time algorithm for this
problem with misclassification error $\eta+\epsilon$. We also provide evidence
that improving on the error guarantee of our algorithm might be computationally
hard. Prior to our work, no efficient weak (distribution-independent) learner
was known in this model, even for the class of disjunctions. The existence of
such an algorithm for halfspaces (or even disjunctions) has been posed as an
open question in various works, starting with Sloan (1988), Cohen (1997), and
was most recently highlighted in Avrim Blum's FOCS 2003 tutorial.

    <title>Tight Polynomial Worst-Case Bounds for Loop Programs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561420800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Ben=Amram:Amir_M=.html">Amir M. Ben-Amram</a>, Geoff Hamilton <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10047">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In 2008, Ben-Amram, Jones and Kristiansen showed that for a simple
programming language---representing non-deterministic imperative programs with
bounded loops, and arithmetics limited to addition and multiplication - it is
possible to decide precisely whether a program has certain growth-rate
properties, in particular whether a computed value, or the program's running
time, has a polynomial growth rate.
</p>
<p>A natural and intriguing problem was to move from answering the decision
problem to giving a quantitative result, namely, a tight polynomial upper
bound. This paper shows how to obtain asymptotically-tight, multivariate,
disjunctive polynomial bounds for this class of programs. This is a complete
solution: whenever a polynomial bound exists it will be found.
</p>
<p>A pleasant surprise is that the algorithm is quite simple; but it relies on
some subtle reasoning. An important ingredient in the proof is the forest
factorization theorem, a strong structural result on homomorphisms into a
finite monoid.

    <title>Computer-Simulation Model Theory (P= NP is not provable)</title>

reality (including the universe, our body, our thinking, walking and etc) are
computations, and the reality is a computer simulation program like a video
game. All works we do (talking, reasoning, seeing and etc) are computations
performed by the universe-computer which runs the simulation program. Inspired
by the view of the simulation hypothesis (but independent of this hypothesis),
we propose a new method of logical reasoning named "Computer-Simulation Model
Theory", CSMT. Computer-Simulation Model Theory is an extension of Mathematical
Model Theory where instead of mathematical-structures, computer-simulations are
replaced, and the activity of reasoning and computing of the reasoner is also
simulated in the model. (CSMT) argues that:
</p>
<p>For a formula $\phi$, construct a computer simulation model $S$, such that
</p>
<p>1- $\phi$ does not hold in $S$, and
</p>
<p>2- the reasoner $I$ $($human being, the one who lives inside the reality$)$
cannot distinguish $S$ from the reality $(R)$,
</p>
<p>then $I$ cannot prove $\phi$ in reality.
</p>
<p>Although $\mathrm{CSMT}$ is inspired by the simulation hypothesis, but this
reasoning method is independent of the acceptance of this hypothesis. As we
argue in this part, one may do not accept the simulation hypothesis, but knows
$\mathrm{CSMT}$ a valid reasoning method. As an application of
Computer-Simulation Model Theory, we study the famous problem P vs NP. We let
$\phi \equiv\mathrm{ [P= NP]} $ and construct a computer simulation model $E$
such that $\mathrm{P= NP}$ does not hold in $E$.

    <title>On Strong Diameter Padded Decompositions</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Filtser:Arnold.html">Arnold Filtser</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09783">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given a weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$, a partition of $V$ is $\Delta$-bounded if
the diameter of each cluster is bounded by $\Delta$. A distribution over
$\Delta$-bounded partitions is a $\beta$-padded decomposition if every ball of
radius $\gamma\Delta$ is contained in a single cluster with probability at
least $e^{-\beta\cdot\gamma}$. The weak diameter of a cluster $C$ is measured
w.r.t. distances in $G$, while the strong diameter is measured w.r.t. distances
in the induced graph $G[C]$. The decomposition is weak/strong according to the
diameter guarantee.
</p>
<p>Formerly, it was proven that $K_r$ free graphs admit weak decompositions with
padding parameter $O(r)$, while for strong decompositions only $O(r^2)$ padding
parameter was known. Furthermore, for the case of a graph $G$, for which the
induced shortest path metric $d_G$ has doubling dimension $d$, a weak
$O(d)$-padded decomposition was constructed, which is also known to be tight.
For the case of strong diameter, nothing was known.
</p>
<p>We construct strong $O(r)$-padded decompositions for $K_r$ free graphs,
matching the state of the art for weak decompositions. Similarly, for graphs
with doubling dimension $d$ we construct a strong $O(d)$-padded decomposition,
which is also tight. We use this decomposition to construct
$(O(d),\tilde{O}(d))$-sparse cover scheme for such graphs. Our new
decompositions and cover have implications to approximating unique games, the
construction of light and sparse spanners, and for path reporting distance
oracles.

subsets of these nodes $P_1,\cdots,P_M$. Assume that the nodes in a given $P_i$
are observed in a local coordinate system. The registration problem is to
compute the coordinates of the $N$ nodes in a global coordinate system, given
the information about $P_1,\cdots,P_M$ and the corresponding local coordinates.
The network is said to be uniquely registrable if the global coordinates can be
computed uniquely (modulo Euclidean transforms). We formulate a necessary and
sufficient condition for a network to be uniquely registrable in terms of
rigidity of the body graph of the network. A particularly simple
characterization of unique registrability is obtained for planar networks.
Further, we show that $k$-vertex-connectivity of the body graph is equivalent
to quasi $k$-connectivity of the bipartite correspondence graph of the network.
Along with results from rigidity theory, this helps us resolve a recent
conjecture due to Sanyal et al. (IEEE TSP, 2017) that quasi $3$-connectivity of
the correspondence graph is both necessary and sufficient for unique
registrability in two dimensions. We present counterexamples demonstrating that
while quasi $(d+1)$-connectivity is necessary for unique registrability in any
dimension, it fails to be sufficient in three and higher dimensions.

Although
many efficient enumeration algorithms for maximal independent sets have been
proposed, no fine-grained analysis for the non-maximal variant has not been
given. As the main result, we propose an algorithm \texttt{EIS} for the
non-maximal variant that runs in amortized $O(q)$ time and liner space, where
$q$ is the maximum integer such that there is no clique with $q$ vertices in
the given graph. Note that \texttt{EIS} correctly works even if we do not know
the exact value of $q$. In addition, it is known that several sparse graph
class have constant clique number which is defined by the size of a maximum
clique, e.g., triangle-free graphs, planer graphs, bounded degenerate graphs,
locally bounded expansion graphs, and so on. Hence, as a by product,
\texttt{EIS} is optimal when input graphs are in a graph class with forbidden
subgraphs on fixed number of vertices.

graphical models. In high-dimensional problems it is often too costly to store
the entire sample covariance matrix. We propose a new input model in which one
can query single entries of the sample covariance matrix. We present
computationally efficient algorithms for structure recovery in Gaussian
graphical models with low query and computational complexity. Our algorithms
work in a regime of tree-like graphs and, more generally, for graphs of small
treewidth. Our results demonstrate that for large classes of graphs, the
structure of the corresponding Gaussian graphical models can be determined much
faster than even computing the empirical covariance matrix.

When the
data are noisy, smoothing is applied to make the signal more apparent. However,
the difference between signal and noise is ill-defined, as it depends upon the
application domain of the data. Common methods used to smooth line charts, such
as rank filters, convolutional filters, frequency domain filters, and
subsampling, optimize on various properties of the data. However, these methods
are only ideal in certain limited scenarios. We present TopoLines, a method for
smoothing line charts by leveraging techniques from Topological Data Analysis.
The design goal of TopoLines is to smooth line charts while maintaining
prominent peaks, as defined by persistent homology, in the data. We compare
TopoLines to 5 popular line smoothing methods using data from 4 application
domains. We evaluate TopoLines in terms of $l^2$-norm of the residual as the
simplification threshold is varied, and we perform a user study to evaluate
users' perception of the accuracy of TopoLines.

route for a single taxicab. Directly applying it for multiple taxicabs may
cause an excessive overlap of recommended routes. The multi-taxicab
recommendation problem is challenging and has been less studied. In this paper,
we first formalize a collective mobile sequential recommendation problem based
on a classic mathematical model, which characterizes time-varying influence
among competing taxicabs. Next, we propose a new evaluation metric for a
collection of taxicab routes aimed to minimize the sum of potential travel
time. We then develop an efficient algorithm to calculate the metric and design
a greedy recommendation method to approximate the solution. Finally, numerical
experiments show the superiority of our methods. In trace-driven simulation,
the set of routes recommended by our method significantly outperforms those
obtained by conventional methods.

<p>On the Importance of Disciplinary Pride for Multidisciplinary Collaboration</p>
<p>I am a big fan of collaborations, even if they <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2014/07/01/collaboration-competition-and-competition-within-collaboration/">come with their own challenges</a>. I always got further and enjoyed research much more because of my collaborators. I’m forever indebted to so many colleagues and dear, dear friends. Each and every one of them was better than me in some ways. To contribute, I had to remember my own strengths and bring them to the table. The premise of this post is that the same holds for collaboration between fields. It should be read as a call for theoreticians to bring the tools and the powerful way of thinking of TOC into collaborations. We shouldn’t be blind to the limitation of our field but obsessing on those limitations is misguided and would only limit our impact. Instead we should bring our best and trust on the other disciplines we collaborate with to do the same (allowing each to complement and compensate for the other).</p>
<p>The context in which these thoughts came to my mind is Algorithmic Fairness. In this and other areas on the interface between society and computing, true <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/11/01/simons-cluster-on-algorithmic-fairness/">collaboration is vital</a>. Not surprisingly, attending multidisciplinary programs on Algorithm Fairness, is a major part of my professional activities these days. And I love it – I get to learn so much from people and disciplines that have been thinking about fairness for many decades and centuries. In addition, the Humanities are simply splendid. Multidisciplinary collaborations come with even more challenges than other collaborations: the language, tools and perspectives are different. But for exactly the same reasons they can be even more rewarding. Nevertheless, my fear and the reason for this post is that my less experienced TOC colleagues might come out from those interdisciplinary meetings frustrated and might lose confidence in what TOC can contribute. It feels to me that <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PDF/toc-sp2.pdf">old lessons</a> about the value of TOC need to be learned again. There is a lot to be proud of, and holding to this pride would in fact make us better collaborators not worse.</p>
<p>In the context of Algorithmic Fairness, we should definitely acknowledge (as we often do) that science exists within political structures, that algorithms are not objective and that mathematical definitions cannot replace social norms as expressed by policy makers. But let’s not take these as excuses for inaction and let’s not withdraw to the role of spectators. In this era of algorithms, other disciplines need us just as much as we need them .</p>

    <title>Are you smarter than a 5th grade amoeba?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(title of this blog is due to Henry Baker who posted an article about this elsewhere)<br/>
<br/>
Amoeba finds approx solution to TSP in linear time:<a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-12-amoeba-approximate-solutions-np-hard-problem.html">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years we have seen models of computation that claim to solve NPC or other hard problems quickly. I ask non-rhetorically and with and open mind how they have panned out.<br/>
<br/>
In no particular order:<br/>
<br/>
1) Parallelism. For solving problems faster YES. For speeding up how to solve NPC problems I think YES. For making P=NP somehow NO.  Even so, parallel computers have been a definite practical success.<br/>
<br/>
2) Quantum Computing. Will they factor large numbers anytime soon? Ever? Should we view the effort to build them as an awesome and insightful Physics experiment? Are there any problems that they are NOW doing faster? Is Quantum Crypto (I know, not the same thing) actually used? Will other things of interest come out of the study of quantum computing? It already has, see <a href="https://theoryofcomputing.org/articles/gs002/gs002.pdf">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3) DNA computing. Did that lead to practical solutions to NPC problems? I do not think it did. Did that lead to interesting math? Interesting biology? Interesting science?  I do not know.<br/>
<br/>
4) Autistic  computing for finding primes: see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/09/possibly-recruits-for-polymath-primes.html">here</a>. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist ,claimed that two autistic twin brothers could generate large primes quickly. This story was never put to a rigorous test and may not be quite right.<br/>
<br/>
5) Amoeba computing: Too early to tell. The article seems to say it succeeded on 8 cities<br/>
<br/>
The problem with all of these non-standard models of computing is SCALE.  And the more powerful classic computers get, the harder it is for these nonstandard models to compete.<br/>
<br/>
Are these models interesting even if they don't end up getting us fast algorithms? They can be:<br/>
<br/>
1) Do they lead to mathematics of interest? (Quantum- Yes, Parallelism- Yes)<br/>
<br/>
2) Did they inspire algorithms for classical computers? (Quantum- Yes)<br/>
<br/>
3) Do they give insight into other fields? (Quantum for Physics yes, DNA-computing for bio-??)<br/>
<br/>
4) Have they ACTUALLY sped up  up computations in meaningful ways for problems we care about (Parallelism  has)<br/>
<br/>
If  you know of any result which I missed<br/>
<br/>
 (e.g.,<br/>
<br/>
 Amoeba-computing giving insight into evolution,<br/>
<br/>
Autistic computing being used by the NSA to find primes,<br/>
<br/>
 DNA computing  leading to interesting mathematics)<br/>
<br/>
 then leave polite comments!<br/>

logspace Turing machines, which provide a unifying framework for efficient
query evaluation in areas like information extraction and graph databases,
among others. We investigate the complexity of three fundamental algorithmic
problems for these classes: enumeration, counting and uniform generation of
solutions, and show that they have several desirable properties in this
respect.
</p>
<p>Both complexity classes are defined in terms of non-deterministic logspace
transducers (NL transducers). For the first class, we consider the case of
unambiguous NL transducers, and we prove constant delay enumeration, and both
counting and uniform generation of solutions in polynomial time. For the second
class, we consider unrestricted NL transducers, and we obtain polynomial delay
enumeration, approximate counting in polynomial time, and polynomial-time
randomized algorithms for uniform generation. More specifically, we show that
each problem in this second class admits a fully polynomial-time randomized
approximation scheme (FPRAS) and a polynomial-time Las Vegas algorithm for
uniform generation. Interestingly, the key idea to prove these results is to
show that the fundamental problem $\text{#NFA}$ admits an FPRAS, where
$\text{#NFA}$ is the problem of counting the number of strings of length $n$
(given in unary) accepted by a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA). While
this problem is known to be $\text{#P}$-complete and, more precisely,
$\text{SpanL}$-complete, it was open whether this problem admits an FPRAS. In
this work, we solve this open problem, and obtain as a welcome corollary that
every function in $\text{SpanL}$ admits an FPRAS.

incomparable if $u$ doesn't reach $v$ and vice versa. We denote by \emph{width}
of a DAG $G$, $w_G$, the maximum size of a set of incomparable vertices of $G$.
In this paper we present an algorithm that computes a dominance drawing of a
DAG G in $k$ dimensions, where $w_G \le k \le \frac{n}{2}$. The time required
by the algorithm is $O(kn)$, with a precomputation time of $O(km)$, needed to
compute a \emph{compressed transitive closure} of $G$, and extra $O(n^2w_G)$ or
$O(n^3)$ time, if we want $k=w_G$. Our algorithm gives a tighter bound to the
dominance dimension of a DAG. As corollaries, a new family of graphs having a
2-dimensional dominance drawing and a new upper bound to the dimension of a
partial order are obtained. We also introduce the concept of transitive module
and dimensional neck, $w_N$, of a DAG $G$ and we show how to improve the
results given previously using these concepts.

$F$ of vertices of a given graph $G=(V,E)$ such that $G \setminus F$ does not
contain a path on $d$ vertices. The paths we aim to cover need not to be

When parameterized by the size of the solution $k$, 5-PVC has direct trivial
algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(5^kn^{\mathcal{O}(1)})$ running time and, since
$d$-PVC is a special case of $d$-Hitting Set, an algorithm running in
$\mathcal{O}(4.0755^kn^{\mathcal{O}(1)})$ time is known. In this paper we
present an iterative compression algorithm that solves the 5-PVC problem in
$\mathcal{O}(4^kn^{\mathcal{O}(1)})$ time.

above-guarantee parametrisations, we investigate the complexity of Dominating
Set when given a suitable lower-bound witness. Concretely, we consider being
provided with a maximal r-independent set X (a set in which all vertices have
pairwise distance at least r + 1) along the input graph G which, for r &gt;= 2,
lower-bounds the minimum size of any dominating set of G. In the spirit of
gap-parameters, we consider a parametrisation by the size of the 'residual' set
R := V (G) \ N [X]. Our work aims to answer two questions: How does the
constant r affect the tractability of the problem and does the restriction to
sparse graph classes help here? For the base case r = 2, we find that the
problem is paraNP -complete even in apex- and bounded-degree graphs. For r = 3,
the problem is W[2]-hard for general graphs but in FPT for nowhere dense
classes and it admits a linear kernel for bounded expansion classes. For r &gt;=
4, the parametrisation becomes essentially equivalent to the natural parameter,
the size of the dominating set.

Services (LBS). In this work, we propose a novel geometric framework based on
the classical discrete geometric structure, the Voronoi-Delaunay duality (VDD).
We utilize the fact that the user location cannot be recovered if only given an
irregular $n$-sided Voronoi cell around it, and the anonymity zone is the
intersection of all the parallel strips perpendicular to and bounded by $n$
Voronoi edges. The irregular Voronoi cell and its variations can be used as the
concealing space to hide the user location or the region of interest and
submitted to the LBS server. Within this framework, we propose multiple typical
anonymizing models by introducing irregularity to the convex regular VDD
structure by shifting the interior Voronoi cell, exterior Delaunay polygon,
sector rays, or their combinations. The proposed methods are efficient by
taking advantage of the VDD principle where main computations are linear
line-line intersections. Experiments with various parameters demonstrate the
efficiency and efficacy of the proposed $n$-VDD framework.

    <title>Fairness and Utilization in Allocating Resources with Uncertain Demand</title>

the fairness properties of algorithms, and the trade-offs between fairness and
utilization have a long history in this domain. A recent line of work has
considered fairness questions for resource allocation when the demands for the
resource are distributed across multiple groups and drawn from a probability
distribution. In such cases, a natural fairness requirement is that individuals
from different groups should have (approximately) equal probabilities of
receiving the resource. A largely open question in this area has been to bound
the gap between the maximum possible utilization of the resource and the
maximum subject to this fairness condition. Here we obtain some of the first
provable upper bounds on this gap. We show lower bounds but also some general
upper bounds for arbitrary distributions, as well as much stronger upper bounds
for specific families of distributions that are typically used to model levels
of demand. In particular, we find --- somewhat surprisingly --- that there are
natural classes of distributions for which it is possible to simultaneously
achieve maximum utilization and the given notion of fairness; and we show that
for power-law distributions, there is a non-trivial gap between the solutions,
but this gap can be bounded by a constant independent of the parameters of the
distribution.

    <title>Sharp Bounds on the Runtime of the (1+1) EA via Drift Analysis and Analytic Combinatorial Tools</title>

function has recently been determined by Hwang et al. (2018) up to additive
errors of $O((\log n)/n)$. The same approach proposed there also leads to a
full asymptotic expansion with errors of the form $O(n^{-K}\log n)$ for any
$K&gt;0$. This precise result is obtained by matched asymptotics with rigorous
error analysis (or by solving asymptotically the underlying recurrences via
inductive approximation arguments), ideas radically different from
well-established techniques for the running time analysis of evolutionary
computation such as drift analysis. This paper revisits drift analysis for the
(1+1) EA on OneMax and obtains that the expected running time $E(T)$, starting
from $\lceil n/2\rceil$ one-bits, is determined by the sum of inverse drifts up
to logarithmic error terms, more precisely $$\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor
n/2\rfloor}\frac{1}{\Delta(k)} - c_1\log n \le E(T) \le \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor
n/2\rfloor}\frac{1}{\Delta(k)} - c_2\log n,$$ where $\Delta(k)$ is the drift
(expected increase of the number of one-bits from the state of $n-k$ ones) and
$c_1,c_2 &gt;0$ are explicitly computed constants. This improves the previous
asymptotic error known for the sum of inverse drifts from $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$
to a logarithmic error and gives for the first time a non-asymptotic error
bound. Using standard asymptotic techniques, the difference between $E(T)$ and
the sum of inverse drifts is found to be $(e/2)\log n+O(1)$.

of an autoencoder's latent space via a novel type of loss, operating on
information from persistent homology. Under mild conditions, this loss is
differentiable and we present a theoretical analysis of the properties induced
by the loss. We choose one-class learning as our upstream task and demonstrate
that the imposed structure enables informed parameter selection for modeling
the in-class distribution via kernel density estimators. Evaluated on computer
vision data, these one-class models exhibit competitive performance and, in a

our results indicate that a single autoencoder, trained on auxiliary

our approach, we develop a general method to approximately calculate the kernel

our approach can be applied to various types of SVM, such as linear SVM,

make classification with arbitrary success probability in logarithmic runtime,
matching the runtime of the quantum SVM.

problem called the 2D Hidden Linear Function (2D HLF) problem that can be
solved exactly by a constant-depth quantum circuit using bounded fan-in gates
(or QNC^0 circuits), but cannot be solved by any constant-depth classical
circuit using bounded fan-in AND, OR, and NOT gates (or NC^0 circuits). In
other words, they exhibited a search problem in QNC^0 that is not in NC^0.
</p>
<p>We strengthen their result by proving that the 2D HLF problem is not
contained in AC^0, the class of classical, polynomial-size, constant-depth
circuits over the gate set of unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates, and NOT gates.
We also supplement this worst-case lower bound with an average-case result:
There exists a simple distribution under which any AC^0 circuit (even of nearly
exponential size) has exponentially small correlation with the 2D HLF problem.
Our results are shown by constructing a new problem in QNC^0, which we call the
Relaxed Parity Halving Problem, which is easier to work with. We prove our AC^0
lower bounds for this problem, and then show that it reduces to the 2D HLF
problem.
</p>
<p>As a step towards even stronger lower bounds, we present a search problem
that we call the Parity Bending Problem, which is in QNC^0/qpoly (QNC^0
circuits that are allowed to start with a quantum state of their choice that is
independent of the input), but is not even in AC^0[2] (the class AC^0 with
unbounded fan-in XOR gates).
</p>
<p>All the quantum circuits in our paper are simple, and the main difficulty
lies in proving the classical lower bounds. For this we employ a host of
techniques, including a refinement of H{\aa}stad's switching lemmas for
multi-output circuits that may be of independent interest, the
Razborov-Smolensky AC^0[2] lower bound, Vazirani's XOR lemma, and lower bounds
for non-local games.

    <title>Horizon Visibility Graphs and Time Series Merge Trees are Dual</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561334400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Stephen:Colin.html">Colin Stephen</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08825">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we introduce the horizon visibility graph, a simple extension
to the popular horizontal visibility graph representation of a time series, and
show that it possesses a rigorous mathematical foundation in computational
algebraic topology. This fills a longstanding gap in the literature on the
horizontal visibility approach to nonlinear time series analysis which, despite
a suite of successful applications across multiple domains, lacks a formal
setting in which to prove general properties and develop natural extensions.
The main finding is that horizon visibility graphs are dual to merge trees
arising naturally over a filtered complex associated to a time series, while
horizontal visibility graphs are weak duals of these trees. Immediate
consequences include availability of tree-based reconstruction theorems,
connections to results on the statistics of self-similar trees, and relations
between visibility graphs and the emerging field of applied persistent
homology.

<p>
Lucy Lu Wang is the lead author of a paper released this Friday on gender parity in computer science. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07883.pdf">paper</a> is from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The authors are Wang, Gabriel Stanovsky, Luca Weihs, and Oren Etzioni.  We will call them WSWE for short. </p>
<p>
Today we will discuss some of the issues this study raises.</p>
<p>
The paper was highlighted by the New York Times in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/technology/gender-gap-tech-computer-science.html">article</a> titled, “The Gender Gap in Computer Science Research Won’t Close for 100 Years.”  The news article begins with an equally sobering statement of this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em>Women will not reach parity with men in writing published computer science research in this century if current trends hold, according to a study released on Friday. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We are for gender-neutral opportunities and have always promoted this—see our earlier discussions <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/its-ada-lovelace-day/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/absolute-firsts/">here</a>. We are for doing a better job in supporting women in computer science. The study by WSWE is an important paper that helps frame the problem. Quoting them:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The field has made more of an effort to reach a more balanced gender status. But the data seems to show that even with all the progress, we are still not making the change fast enough. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I suggest that you might wish to read the paper. Unfortunately there are many papers with similar conclusions—see <a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1301">this</a> by Natalie Schluter, for example. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Main Points </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are some points of the paper by WSWE:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>There is a measurable gap</i>. No one would, I believe, doubt this. But it is important to see that it is measurable. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>The gap is shrinking, but slowly</i>. Again this seems correct, but whether it is shrinking in all relevant measures of publication weight is still an issue.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>The predictions</i>. Perhaps it will not be closed for over a century. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Modern technology allows such a study</i>. This is one aspect that we can all applaud. WSWE used automated tools that allowed this study to search millions of papers.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Issues </h2><p/>
<p>
WSWE filtered a corpus of <b>2.87 million</b> papers tagged as in computer science.  The volume constrained their approaches to handling several basic issues.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> How to tell the gender of an author?  They use first names and try to detect gender from that alone. This is not easy.  Not only can differently-gendered names in different nations or language groups have the same Romanized form, many names apply to both genders within those groups.  The names Taylor and Kelley are perfect examples pf the latter. </p>
<p>
WSWE used a statistical weighing method. So “Taylor,” for example, would be weighted as 55 percent female, 45 percent male.  The weightings come from a large database called <i>Gender API</i> compiled from government and social agencies not directly related to computer science. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> Another issue concerns the prediction part of their paper. They attempt to extrapolate and guess when there will be parity between female and male authorship. </p>
<p>
As all predictions this is not easy. It is my main complaint with this and other papers on the gender-gap issue. They predict that parity will not be reached until 2167, in 168 years. An earlier <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/640548/gender-parity-computer-science-could-take-280-years/">study</a> puts the parity point at 280 years away.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I believe that a major issue is hiring by computer science departments and other institutions. A major CS department just hired <img alt="{N&gt;1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N&gt;1}"/> assistant professors, of which <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> were male. This is a problem. </p>
<p>
Should studies on the gender gap count all papers? Perhaps they should weight the papers by some citation indices. Are women writing more impactful papers? What percent of papers by gender have citations rate above X?—you get the idea. </p>
<p>
Finally I wonder if parity is the right goal? <b>How about aiming for more women papers than men</b>? Why not?</p>

<p>The course is an aftermath of a few lectures and summer school tutorials given in various locations, in which  lectures goal of the course was to present the most useful methods and ideas in a rigorous-but-not-tedious way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for a mathematically-prepared undergraduate student, and/or researcher beginning their endeavor into machine learning.</li>
<li>Focus on the important: we start with stochastic gradient descent for training deep neural networks.</li>
<li>Bring out the main ideas: i.e. projection-free methods, second-order optimization, the three main acceleration techniques, qualitatively discuss the advantages and applicability of each.</li>
<li>*short* proofs, that everyone can follow and extend in their future research. I prefer being off by a constant/log factor from the best known bound with a more insightful proof.</li>
<li>Not loose track of the goal: generalization/regret, rather than final accuracy. This means we talked about online learning, generalization and precision issues in ML.</li>

<p>This is still work in progress, please feel free to send me typos/corrections, as well as other topics you’d like to see (on my todos already: lower bounds, quasi-convexity, and the homotopy method).</p>
<p>Note: zero-order/bandit optimization is an obvious topic that’s not address. The reason is purely subjective – it appears as a chapter in <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">this textbook</a> (that also started as lecture notes!).</p>

    <title>TR19-089 |  Exponential separation between shallow quantum circuits and unbounded fan-in shallow classical circuits | 

	Adam Bene Watts, 

	Robin Kothari, 

	Luke Schaeffer, 

	Avishay Tal</title>
    <summary>Recently, Bravyi, Gosset, and König (Science, 2018) exhibited a search problem called the 2D Hidden Linear Function (2D HLF) problem that can be solved exactly by a constant-depth quantum circuit using bounded fan-in gates (or QNC^0 circuits), but cannot be solved by any constant-depth classical circuit using bounded fan-in AND, OR, and NOT gates (or NC^0 circuits). In other words, they exhibited a search problem in QNC^0 that is not in NC^0.

We strengthen their result by proving that the 2D HLF problem is not contained in AC^0, the class of classical, polynomial-size, constant-depth circuits over the gate set of unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates, and NOT gates. We also supplement this worst-case lower bound with an average-case result: There exists a simple distribution under which any AC^0 circuit (even of nearly exponential size) has exponentially small correlation with the 2D HLF problem. Our results are shown by constructing a new problem in QNC^0, which we call the Relaxed Parity Halving Problem, which is easier to work with. We prove our AC^0 lower bounds for this problem, and then show that it reduces to the 2D HLF problem.

As a step towards even stronger lower bounds, we present a search problem that we call the Parity Bending Problem, which is in QNC^0/qpoly (QNC^0 circuits that are allowed to start with a quantum state of their choice that is independent of the input), but is not even in AC^0[2] (the class AC^0 with unbounded fan-in XOR gates).

All the quantum circuits in our paper are simple, and the main difficulty lies in proving the classical lower bounds. For this we employ a host of techniques, including a refinement of H{\aa}stad's switching lemmas for multi-output circuits that may be of independent interest, the Razborov-Smolensky AC^0[2] lower bound, Vazirani's XOR lemma, and lower bounds for non-local games.</summary>

    <title>Report from SoCG</title>
    <summary>As I mentioned in my previous post, I just finished attending the Symposium on Computational Geometry in Portland. The conference proceedings are open access through LIPIcs.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/06/20/portland-street-art.html">my previous post</a>, I just finished attending the Symposium on Computational Geometry in Portland. The <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/portals/lipics/index.php?semnr=16108">conference proceedings are open access through LIPIcs</a>.</p>

<p>The conference started on Tuesday (after some earlier social activities) with the best paper talk by Arnaud de Mesmay, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.27">Almost tight lower bounds for hard cutting problems in embedded graphs</a>” (with V. Cohen-Addad, É. Colin de Verdière, and D. Marx) proving that, to find the shortest set of cuts to slice a genus- surface into a disk, the exponent must depend linearly on  (assuming the exponential time hypothesis).</p>

<p>Several of the contributed talks from throughout the conference particularly caught my attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shay Moran’s paper with A. Yehudayoff, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.51">On weak -nets and the Radon number</a>” concerned abstract convexity spaces where the convex sets are any set family closed under intersection. A space has Radon number  if every  points can be partitioned into two subsets whose convex hulls (smallest containing convex sets) intersect, and a point in the intersection is called a Radon point. Having bounded Radon number turns out to be equivalent to having weak -nets, subsets of points that (for a given measure on the space) intersect every large convex set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mitchell Jones’ “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.41">Journey to the center of the point set</a>” (with Sariel Har-Peled) improved an old paper of mine on using Radon points to find points of high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centerpoint_(geometry)">Tukey depth</a> in high-dimensional point sets in time polynomial in the dimension, improving both the polynomial and the depth of the resulting points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sariel Har-Peled spoke on his work with Timothy Chan, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.23">Smallest -enclosing rectangle revisited</a>”. As well as shaving logs from the time bounds for finding rectangles that enclose a given number of points and minimize their area or perimeter, they found a general reduction from problems on  points to  problems on  points, allowing one to turn factors of  in the time bounds into factors of . Previously such reductions were only known for -point subset problems where the optimal solution lies among the  nearest neighbors of some input point, true for rectangle perimeter but not rectangle area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timothy Chan’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.20">Computing Shapley values in the plane</a>” concerns an interesting combination of game theory and computational geometry. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value">Shapley value</a> is a method for assigning credit when multiple people collaborate to produce some value (given as input a function from subsets of people to the value of a subset). It can be defined by adding contributors one-by-one in a random order and setting each contributor’s Shapley value to the expected increase in value when that contributor is added. It sums to the total value and is the unique function with this property that obeys several other natural and desirable axioms for credit assignment. For arbitrary functions from subsets of  contributors to subset values, it takes time  to compute, but Timothy described polynomial time algorithms for cases when the value function has some geometric meaning, such as when it measures the area of the convex hull of a subset of  points. There’s probably a lot more to be done in the same direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Patrick Schnider’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.56">Ham-Sandwich cuts and center transversals in subspaces</a>” has some partial results towards a conjectured generalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_sandwich_theorem">ham sandwich theorem</a>: given  probability distributions in -dimensional Euclidean space, it should be possible to find  hyperplanes whose checkerboard partition of space simultaneously bisects all of the distributions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jie Xue spoke on “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.60">Near-optimal algorithms for shortest paths in weighted unit-disk graphs</a>” (with Haitao Wang). Here “weighted” means that overlapping unit disks are connected by an edge whose length is the Euclidean distance between their centers. Previous methods obtained near-linear algorithms by using bichromatic closest pair data structures to simulate Dijkstra’s algorithm. Instead, Wang and Xue use a related relaxation algorithm that partitions the plane into a grid and at each step relaxes all edges between certain pairs of grid squares, using data structures for additively weighted nearest neighbors. By avoiding the overhead of closest pairs they shave several logs from the runtime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arnaud de Mesmay spoke again towards the end of the conference on “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.49">The unbearable hardness of unknotting</a>”, with Yo’av Rieck, Eric Sedgwick, and Martin Tancer. They used a reduction from 3-satisfiability, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_link">Hopf links</a> for variables and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings">Borromean links</a> for clauses (connected to each other by ribbons), to prove that it’s NP-complete to find an unlinked subset of a link with a maximum number of components. By a second level of replacement that doubles the strands of each link, they also showed that it’s NP-complete to find the minimum number of crossing changes or of Reidemeister moves to unlink a link or to unknot a knot.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon I went to the workshop on open problems. After the obligatory open problem session, we debated whether we should collect problems on <a href="https://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/">The Open Problems Project</a>, <a href="http://www.openproblemgarden.org/">The Open Problem Garden</a>, or some new system that, since it doesn’t exist, can be more perfect than anything that does. Then I switched to the Young Researcher’s Forum (unfortunately missing the open problem implementation challenge); at the YRF, my student Daniel Frishberg spoke about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06875">our work on using nearest neighbor chains to speed up greedy algorithms</a>.</p>

<p>The invited talks on Wednesday and Friday were by Sanjoy Dasgupta and Bruce Donald, respectively. Dasgupta spoke on using concepts from geometric data structures to interpret the neural structure of the olfactory system in fruit flies (and hopefully, eventually, vice versa: to use our understanding of neural structures to develop new data structures). For instance, the first three layers of neurons in this system appear to implement an “expand-and-sparsify” data structure that represents low-dimensional normalized vectors by randomly mapping them to much higher dimensional vectors and then listing as a set a smaller number of high-value coordinates. This appears to be closely analogous to known methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing">locality-sensitive hashing</a>.  Donald spoke on using geometric methods to represent and infer the shapes of proteins, and to design proteins with desired shapes and functions.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening was the conference banquet, at the famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Ballroom_(Portland,_Oregon)">Crystal Ballroom</a>, conveniently located near Powell’s Books. Matthew Dickerson showed up (after many years absence from SoCG) and brought some musical family members for a live concert.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Marquee for Michael Dickerson and Shaky Situation" src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/portland/ShakySituation-m.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;"/></p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon I stopped by the workshop on algebraic methods where I had the pleasure of seing Josh Zahl give his talk on a whiteboard instead of using prepared slides. It was on methods for proving bounds on the number of incidences among geometric objects by combining naive bounds based on forbidden complete bipartite subgraphs of the incidence graphs, cuttings of space into smaller regions within which one applies these naive bounds, and cuttings of the objects into pieces in order to make the forbidden subgraphs smaller.</p>

<p>The conference business meeting was also Thursday, and ran very smoothly.
Next year SoCG will be in Zurich; the year after that, in Buffalo. We now have an officially incorporated society, <a href="http://www.computational-geometry.org/society/index.html">The Society for Computational Geometry</a>, so that we can maintain buffer funds for the conference from one year to the next; it will be supported by an increase of $30-$35 in non-student registration fees. And the attendees voted overwhelmingly in favor of both <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/safetoc.html">the SafeTOC anti-harassment guidelines</a> and ensuring and better advertising the availability of childcare at future conferences.</p>

<p>The conference was dedicated to the memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Pollack">Ricky Pollack</a>, but it also included a celebration on Friday of a living computational geometer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hershberger">John Hershberger</a>, who led the effort to bring SoCG to Oregon, and turned 60 just before the conference began. Happy birthday, John!</p>

The context is as follows: in a <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09353">STOC 2018 paper</a> followed by a <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08647">COLT 2019 paper</a>, the following corruption model was discussed: stochastic bandits, except for <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> rounds which are adversarial. The state of the art bounds were of the form: optimal (or almost optimal) stochastic term plus <img alt="K C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-189063850ed2dd251e3453bcdf72bb1f_l3.png?resize=30%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="30"/>, and it was mentioned as an open problem whether <img alt="KC" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a11b6676b92ebe2d33985ebf5d9107fe_l3.png?resize=30%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="30"/> could be improved to <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> (there is a lower bound showing that <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> is necessary — when <img alt="C = O(\sqrt{T})" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="20" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7a63a8eb07aa9c2f39df62272d6a867e_l3.png?resize=92%2C20&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="92"/>). As was discussed in the comment section, it seemed that indeed this clean best of both worlds approach should certainly shed light on the corruption model. It turns out that this is indeed the case, and a one-line calculation resolves positively the open problem from the COLT paper. The formal result is as follows (recall the notation/definitions from <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/06/10/amazing-progress-in-adversarially-robust-stochastic-multi-armed-bandits/">the previous blog post</a>):</p>

<p>I’m writing this post to draw attention to the imminent deadline of <a href="https://tpdp.cse.buffalo.edu/2019/">TPDP 2019</a>, co-located with CCS 2019 in London. I’ll spare you the full details (click the link for more information), but most pressing is the deadline tomorrow, June 21, 2019, anywhere on Earth (let me know if this presents hardship for you, and I can pass concerns on to the chair). Essentially anything related to the theory or practice of differential privacy is welcome. Submissions are limited to four pages in length and are lightly refereed, based on originality, relevance, interest, and clarity. There are no published proceedings, and previously published results are welcome. If you’ve been looking to get to know the community, consider either submitting or attending the workshop! </p></div>

    <title xml:lang="en-US">Quanta of Solace</title>
    <summary xml:lang="en-US">In Quanta magazine, Kevin Hartnett has a recent article entitled A New Law to Describe Quantum Computing’s Rise? The article discusses “Neven’s Law”—a conjecture, by Hartmut Neven (head of Google’s quantum computing effort), that the number of integrated qubits is now increasing exponentially with time, so that the difficulty of simulating a state-of-the-art QC on […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In <em>Quanta</em> magazine, Kevin Hartnett has a recent article entitled <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/does-nevens-law-describe-quantum-computings-rise-20190618/">A New Law to Describe Quantum Computing’s Rise?</a>  The article discusses “Neven’s Law”—a conjecture, by Hartmut Neven (head of Google’s quantum computing effort), that the number of integrated qubits is now increasing exponentially with time, so that the difficulty of simulating a state-of-the-art QC on a fixed classical computer is increasing <em>doubly</em> exponentially with time.  (Jonathan Dowling tells me that he expressed the same thought years ago.)</p>



<p>Near the end, the <em>Quanta</em> piece quotes some UT Austin professor whose surname starts with a bunch of A’s as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“I think the undeniable reality of this progress puts the ball firmly in the court of those who believe scalable quantum computing can’t work.   They’re the ones who need to articulate where and why the progress will stop.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The quote is perfectly accurate, but in context, it might give the impression that I’m endorsing Neven’s Law.  In reality, I’m reluctant to fit a polynomial or an exponential or any other curve through a set of numbers that so far hasn’t exceeded about 50.  I say only that, regardless of what anyone believes is the ultimate rate of progress in QC, what’s already happened today puts the ball firmly in the skeptics’ court.</p>



<p>Also in <em>Quanta</em>, Anil Ananthaswamy has a new article out on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-to-turn-a-quantum-computer-into-the-ultimate-randomness-generator-20190619/">How to Turn a Quantum Computer Into the Ultimate Randomness Generator</a>.  This piece covers two schemes for using a quantum computer to generate “certified random bits”—that is, bits you can <em>prove</em> are random to a faraway skeptic.  one due to me, the other due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00640">Brakerski et al</a>.  The article cites my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">paper with Lijie Chen</a>, which shows that under suitable computational assumptions, the outputs in my protocol are hard to spoof using a classical computer.  The randomness aspect will be addressed in a paper that I’m currently writing; for now, see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/certrand2.ppt">these slides</a>.</p>



<p>As long as I’m linking to interesting recent <em>Quanta</em> articles, Erica Klarreich has <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-disproves-hedetniemis-graph-theory-conjecture-20190617/">A 53-Year-Old Network Coloring Conjecture is Disproved</a>.  Briefly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedetniemi%27s_conjecture">Hedetniemi’s Conjecture</a> stated that, given any two finite, undirected graphs G and H, the chromatic number of the tensor product G⊗H is just the minimum of the chromatic numbers of G and H themselves.  This reasonable-sounding conjecture has now been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02167">falsified</a> by Yaroslav Shitov.  For more, see also <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/05/10/sansation-in-the-morning-news-yaroslav-shitov-counterexamples-to-hedetniemis-conjecture/">this post by Gil Kalai</a>—who appears here <em>not</em> in his capacity as a quantum computing skeptic.</p>



<p>In interesting math news beyond <em>Quanta</em> magazine, the Berkeley alumni magazine has a piece about the crucial, neglected topic of <a href="https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2019-06-14/chalk-market-where-mathematicians-go-get-good-stuff">mathematicians’ love for Hagoromo-brand chalk</a> (hat tip: Peter Woit).  I can personally vouch for this.  When I moved to UT Austin three years ago, most offices in CS had whiteboards, but I deliberately chose one with a blackboard.  I figured that chalk has its problems—it breaks, the dust gets all over—but I could live with them, much more than I could live with the Fundamental Whiteboard Difficulty, of all the available markers always being dry whenever you want to explain anything.  With the Hagoromo brand, though, you pretty much get all the benefits of chalk with none of the downsides, so it just strictly dominates whiteboards.</p>



<p>Jan Kulveit asked me to advertise the <a href="https://espr-camp.org/">European Summer Program on Rationality</a> (ESPR), which will take place this August 13-23, and which is aimed at students ages 16-19.  I’ve <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410">lectured</a> both at ESPR and at a similar summer program that ESPR was modeled after (called SPARC)—and while I was never there as a student, it looked to me like a phenomenal experience.   So if you’re a 16-to-19-year-old who reads this blog, please consider applying!</p>



<p>I’m now at the end of my annual family trip to Tel Aviv, returning to the Eastern US tonight, and then on to <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2019/stocprogram.html">STOC’2019</a> at the <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">ACM Federated Computing Research Conference</a> in Phoenix (which I can blog about if anyone wants me to).  It was a good trip, although marred by my two-year-old son Daniel falling onto sun-heated metal and suffering a second-degree burn on his leg, and then by the doctor botching the treatment.  Fortunately Daniel’s now healing nicely.  For future reference, whenever bandaging a burn wound, <em>be sure</em> to apply lots of Vaseline to prevent the bandage from drying out, and also to change the bandage daily.  Accept no fancy-sounding substitute.</p></div>

<div/>
<div>Dear all,</div>
<div/>
<div>The TCS Women 2019 program is finalized: <a href="https://sigact.org/tcswomen/tcs-women-2019/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://sigact.org/tcswomen/tcs-women-2019/</a>. Here are some details:</div>
<div/>
<div>On June 23rd, we have our TCS Women Spotlight workshop from 2 pm to 5 pm. This will feature an inspirational talk by Ronitt Rubinfeld (MIT &amp; Tel Aviv University)–“Comedy of Errors”, and rising stars talks by Naama Ben-David (CMU), Debarati Das (Charles University), Andrea Lincoln (MIT) and Oxana <span style="color: #000000;">Poburinnaya (Boston University). The workshop is open to all and we would love to see you all there.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">On June 24th, we have the TCS Women lunch and panel of distinguished researchers from academia and industries. This year’s panelists include Shuchi Chawla (University of Wisconsin), Julia Chuzhoy (TTIC), Edith Cohen (Google), Faith Ellen (University of Toronto), Rachel Lin (University of Washington) and Nutan Limaye (Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai). The event is open to all women participants of FCRC.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to these, there will be a TCS Women poster session held jointly with the STOC poster session on June 24th. Fourteen women researchers will be presenting posters on their research. More information is available on our website. All are welcome. </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">We are providing travel scholarships to more than forty women students this year to attend STOC and FCRC. We secured funding from the NSF, Akamai, Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Thank you!<br/>
</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Looking forward to seeing you soon!</span></div>
