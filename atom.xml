John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did not use Zoom. Their correspondence, from 1777 up to their deaths hours apart on July 4, 1826, fills a 600-page <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adams-Jefferson-Letters-Complete-Correspondence-Jefferson/dp/0807842303">book</a>. </p>
<p>
Today, Independence Day in the US, we consider the kind of intellectual fireworks represented by the correspondence.</p>
<p>
Jefferson and Adams were intellectual opposites as well as political rivals. Adams favored a strong central government to bridle human passions, whereas Jefferson’s support for the French Revolution continued beyond its devolution into the Reign of Terror. They debated many other points of politics, philosophy, and culture. </p>
<p>
Abigail Adams, the wife of John, joined in some of the exchanges. Because she often stayed in Massachusetts while he was in Philadelphia or New York or elsewhere, the husband and wife exchanged many letters—over 1,100 in all. His letter to her on July 3, 1776, instituted the use of fireworks to celebrate anniversaries of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>
Today there is not much in the way of fireworks displays. Most have been canceled because we cannot have crowds to view them. In the Buffalo area, some townships are having small displays with limited access, and some displays are being set on high points for possible area viewing. So we felt we should write about fireworks of a different kind, a kind that is not restricted by the pandemic and might thrive through it. But first we’ll make a point about the history of fireworks.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Fireworks: Ancient, Early, and Modern </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Fireworks go back at least 1,100 years to China, where chemists discovered the fun of stuffing volatile compounds into tubes of bamboo or paper and setting them off. Some have pyrotechnics going back another 1,000 years, to about 200 BCE, insofar as bamboo was known to pop with a loud sound when dried and heated. Gunpowder traveled best of the compounds and made its way into Europe at least by the 1200s. The first recorded wide-scale fireworks display in Europe was in 1486 for the wedding of King Henry VII to Elizabeth of York, which ended the Wars of the Roses. Shakespeare mentions fireworks in <em>Love’s Labours Lost</em>. The Mughals in India from the 1500s to the 1800s made fireworks a diversion for noble women on the Diwali holiday:</p>

<p>
Our point is that 1776 isn’t even halfway back to the beginning of using fireworks for celebrations even just in the West. Can we even call it “Early”? Lavish displays to mark major events were common by the mid-1700s. A royal display in 1749 was accompanied by orchestral music commissioned from George Frideric Handel and went ahead despite rain. Over 12,000 people also paid to attend the main rehearsal six days earlier, many braving an hours-long traffic jam on approaches to the London Bridge. That feels quite modern to us. Adams’s <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-02-02-0016">letter</a> mentioned other social features we know today:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The pandemic has curtailed others of these. The major North American team sports have not resumed either. Some parades have been run in “reverse” mode: the floats and performers stay put while spectators drive by slowly in cars.</p>
<p>
Adams’s letter has another, earlier, passage that chills today. The letter begins by saying that the Declaration was supposed to have been made in December, 1775, and enumerates plans the colonies had made contingent on this. He then says that what caused the plans to be aborted was an outbreak of disease:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> All these Causes however in Conjunction would not have disappointed Us, if it had not been for a Misfortune, which could not be foreseen, and perhaps could not have been prevented, I mean the Prevalence of the small Pox among our Troops. . . . This fatal Pestilence compleated our Destruction.—It is a Frown of Providence upon Us, which We ought to lay to heart. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The ellipsis is in the letter—as Ken’s children have pointed out, trailing off thought with dots in letters or e-mails or Facebook posts or texts is a habit of us older folk. Thus a specific outbreak of a contagious disease changed our history then as now.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ideas: Ancient, Early, and Modern </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/some-real-and-some-virtual-news/">remarked</a> on how the pandemic has affected opportunities to exchange ideas and how to compensate. One impacted series that both of us intended to visit this spring has been the series of workshops at the Simons Institute in Berkeley. </p>
<p>
Still, the Simons Foundation has continued its other ways to stimulate ideas. Here we offer our congratulations to Venkatesan Guruswami, Omer Reingold, and David Woodruff, who have just been <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/simons-investigators/?tab=awardees&amp;filter_years=2020">appointed</a> as Simons investigators for 2020. </p>
<p>
In briefly talking about their work, we want to make a point about how the pandemic enables <em>taking the long view</em> of ideas—in a way that appointments such as these promote. It is easy to get wrapped up in immediate aspects of a current hot problem and not be aware that it has a history. The history may not involve exactly the same ideas as the problem, but related ideas whose importance was appreciated much earlier. “Early” may not mean the Middle Ages or the 1700s as with fireworks, but it can mean times before any of us were born.</p>
<p>
Venkatesan and Omer and David each have done some stellar research, broadly in various parts of theory. They each have many results, but we thought we would highlight just one result each. We picked a result that we think is representative, is deep, is beautiful, and is one that we personally admire the most.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> “Ancient” Times </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
Venkatesan did important work on a problem that was created before complexity theory existed. Our favorite is his ground-breaking work on list decoding.</p>
<p>
What is the best way to encode data to protect it against various kinds of errors? This is still open. But Venkatesan changed the landscape. </p>
<p>
The questions about error correcting codes go back to the 1940’s. Usually the first results are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">credited</a> to Richard Hamming in 1947. Soon the notion of list decoding was introduced. The cool idea is that doing not require an answer, but allow a list of possible answers. The hope is that with other information about the message we might be able to select <i>the</i> answer.</p>
<p>
Venkatesan and Ken’s colleague Atri Rudra found explicit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_decoding">codes</a> that achieve list-decoding capacity, that is, they have optimal redundancy. </p>
<p>
What we like so much is the model is so natural and so powerful. There are many applications of list decoding to complexity theory. See Madhu Sudan’s <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/madhu/papers/noneed/ifip-journ.ps">survey</a> for some additional comments. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Early Times </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
Omer did his most important work on problems that were first studied in the early days of complexity theory. Our favorite is his beautiful work on small-memory deterministic graph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL_(complexity)">walks</a>. </p>
<p>
Is <img alt="{\mathsf{L &lt; NL}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BL+%3C+NL%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{L &lt; NL}}"/>? This is still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NL_(complexity)">open</a>. But Omer made a huge contribution to our understanding of fundamental complexity classes. Romas Aleliunas, Dick Karp, Laszlo Lovasz, and Charlie Rackoff proved earlier that random small space could navigate undirected graphs provided they could flip coins. In a sense Omer removed the coins to get his result that undirected graph connectivity is in <img alt="{\mathsf{L}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BL%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{L}}"/>. The previous result was easy—I can say that because I (Dick) was a co-author on it—but Omer’s theorem is deep.</p>
<p>
Omer’s <a href="https://omereingold.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/sl.pdf">proof</a> drew heavily on expander graphs and the zig-zag product from his earlier work with Salil Vadhan and Avi Wigderson for creating them. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Modern Times </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
David did his most important work on problems that were only created relatively recently. Our favorite is his work on approximately <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dwoodruf/www/knw10b.pdf">counting</a> distinct elements. This work is joint with Daniel Kane and Jelani Nelson and appeared at PODS 2010. It was the first streaming algorithm with an optimal combination of space usage and update time. Here is the relevant table from their paper (KNW):</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/algtable.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17261" height="163" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/algtable.jpg?w=500&amp;h=163" width="500"/></a></p>
<p>
Streaming algorithms are relatively new and parts of data science are newer. But working with data is old, as old as codes. This finally leads us to pose an outlandish question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Can all of this work be usefully interpreted from the standpoint of coding theory? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This is outlandish, because the word “code” does not even appear in either Reingold’s paper or KNW. But part of holding coding theory to be a paradigm, as both Ken and I experienced in graduate school, is that its perspective should expand. Is this capable of creating intellectual fireworks? We’ll see.</p>
<p>

Have a safe and happy fourth of July.</p>

    <title>Multicommodity Flows in Planar Graphs with Demands on Faces</title>

Seymour
showed that if the union of supply and demand graphs is planar, then the cut
condition is sufficient for routing demands. Okamura-Seymour showed that if all
demands are incident on one face, then again cut condition is sufficient for
routing demands. We consider a common generalization of these settings where
the end points of each demand are on the same face of the planar graph. We show
that if the source sink pairs on each face of the graph are such that sources
and sinks appear contiguously on the cycle bounding the face, then the flow cut
gap is at most 3. We come up with a notion of approximating demands on a face
by convex combination of laminar demands to prove this result.

    <title>Approximating Sparse Quadratic Programs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1593907200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Hermelin:Danny.html">Danny Hermelin</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kellerhals:Leon.html">Leon Kellerhals</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Niedermeier:Rolf.html">Rolf Niedermeier</a>, Rami Pugatch <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01252">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, we consider the problem of
maximizing $x^TAx$ subject to the constraint $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. This problem,
called MaxQP by Charikar and Wirth [FOCS'04], generalizes MaxCut and has
natural applications in data clustering and in the study of disordered magnetic
phases of matter. Charikar and Wirth showed that the problem admits an
$\Omega(1/\lg n)$ approximation via semidefinite programming, and Alon,
Makarychev, Makarychev, and Naor [STOC'05] showed that the same approach yields
an $\Omega(1)$ approximation when $A$ corresponds to a graph of bounded
chromatic number. Both these results rely on solving the semidefinite
relaxation of MaxQP, whose currently best running time is
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}\cdot \min\{N,n^{1.5}\})$, where $N$ is the number of nonzero
entries in $A$ and $\tilde{O}$ ignores polylogarithmic factors.
</p>
<p>In this sequel, we abandon the semidefinite approach and design purely
combinatorial approximation algorithms for special cases of MaxQP where $A$ is
sparse (i.e., has $O(n)$ nonzero entries). Our algorithms are superior to the
semidefinite approach in terms of running time, yet are still competitive in
terms of their approximation guarantees. More specifically, we show that:
</p>
<p>- UnitMaxQP, where $A \in \{-1,0,1\}^{n\times n}$, admits an
$(1/3d)$-approximation in $O(n^{1.5})$ time, when the corresponding graph has
no isolated vertices and at most $dn$ edges.
</p>
<p>- MaxQP admits an $\Omega(1/\lg a_{\max})$-approximation in $O(n^{1.5} \lg
a_{\max})$ time, where $a_{\max}$ is the maximum absolute value in $A$, when
the corresponding graph is $d$-degenerate.
</p>
<p>- MaxQP admits a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation in $O(n)$ time when the
corresponding graph has bounded local treewidth.
</p>
<p>- UnitMaxQP admits a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation in $O(n^2)$ time when
the corresponding graph is $H$-minor-free.

algorithm has a near-linear work dependency on the size of the target graph.
Existing low depth algorithms do not guarantee that the work remains
asymptotically the same for any constant-sized pattern. By using a connection
to certain separating cycles, our subgraph isomorphism algorithm can decide the
vertex connectivity of a planar graph (with high probability) in asymptotically
near-linear work and poly-logarithmic depth. Previously, no sub-quadratic work
and poly-logarithmic depth bound was known in planar graphs (in particular for
distinguishing between four-connected and five-connected planar graphs).

    <title>Adapting $k$-means algorithms for outliers</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1593907200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Grunau:Christoph.html">Christoph Grunau</a>, Václav Rozhoň <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01118">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>This paper shows how to adapt several simple and classical sampling-based
algorithms for the $k$-means problem to the setting with outliers.
</p>
<p>Recently, Bhaskara et al. (NeurIPS 2019) showed how to adapt the classical
$k$-means++ algorithm to the setting with outliers. However, their algorithm
needs to output $O(\log (k) \cdot z)$ outliers, where $z$ is the number of true
outliers, to match the $O(\log k)$-approximation guarantee of $k$-means++. In
this paper, we build on their ideas and show how to adapt several sequential
and distributed $k$-means algorithms to the setting with outliers, but with
substantially stronger theoretical guarantees: our algorithms output
$(1+\varepsilon)z$ outliers while achieving an $O(1 /
\varepsilon)$-approximation to the objective function. In the sequential world,
we achieve this by adapting a recent algorithm of Lattanzi and Sohler (ICML
2019). In the distributed setting, we adapt a simple algorithm of Guha et al.
(IEEE Trans. Know. and Data Engineering 2003) and the popular $k$-means$\|$ of
Bahmani et al. (PVLDB 2012).
</p>
<p>A theoretical application of our techniques is an algorithm with running time
$\tilde{O}(nk^2/z)$ that achieves an $O(1)$-approximation to the objective
function while outputting $O(z)$ outliers, assuming $k \ll z \ll n$. This is
complemented with a matching lower bound of $\Omega(nk^2/z)$ for this problem
in the oracle model.

    <title>A Method for Fast Computing the Algebraic Degree of Boolean Functions</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bakoev:Valentin.html">Valentin Bakoev</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01116">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The algebraic degree of Boolean functions (or vectorial Boolean functions) is
an important cryptographic parameter that should be computed by fast
algorithms. They work in two main ways: (1) by computing the algebraic normal
form and then searching the monomial of the highest degree in it, or (2) by
examination the algebraic properties of the true table vector of a given
function. We have already done four basic steps in the study of the first way,
and the second one has been studied by other authors. Here we represent a
method for fast computing (the fastest way we know) the algebraic degree of
Boolean functions. It is a combination of the most efficient components of
these two ways and the corresponding algorithms. The theoretical time
complexities of the method are derived in each of the cases when the Boolean
function is represented in a byte-wise or in a bitwise manner. They are of the
same type $\Theta(n.2^n)$ for a Boolean function of $n$ variables, but they
have big differences between the constants in $\Theta$-notation. The
theoretical and experimental results shown here demonstrate the advantages of
the bitwise approach in computing the algebraic degree - they are dozens of
times faster than the byte-wise approaches.

arbitrary graph $G$, and that enumerate in output all the (inclusion-wise)
maximal "subgraphs" of $G$ which fulfil a given property $\Pi$. All over this
paper, we study several different properties $\Pi$, and the notion of subgraph
under consideration (induced or not) will vary from a result to another.
</p>
<p>More precisely, we present efficient algorithms to list all maximal split
subgraphs, sub-cographs and some subclasses of cographs of a given input graph.
All the algorithms presented here run in polynomial delay, and moreover for
split graphs it only requires polynomial space. In order to develop an
algorithm for maximal split (edge-)subgraphs, we establish a bijection between
the maximal split subgraphs and the maximal independent sets of an auxiliary
graph. For cographs and some subclasses , the algorithms rely on a framework
recently introduced by Conte &amp; Uno called Proximity Search. Finally we consider
the extension problem, which consists in deciding if there exists a maximal
induced subgraph satisfying a property $\Pi$ that contains a set of prescribed
vertices and that avoids another set of vertices. We show that this problem is
NP-complete for every "interesting" hereditary property $\Pi$. We extend the
hardness result to some specific edge version of the extension problem.

and an important step in geometry processing is to remove these noise
components from these surfaces (given as points-set or triangulated mesh). The
noise-removal process (denoising) can be performed by filtering the surface
normals first and by adjusting the vertex positions according to filtered
normals afterwards. Therefore, in many available denoising algorithms, the
computation of noise-free normals is a key factor. A variety of filters have
been introduced for noise-removal from normals, with different focus points
like robustness against outliers or large amplitude of noise. Although these
filters are performing well in different aspects, a unified framework is
missing to establish the relation between them and to provide a theoretical
analysis beyond the performance of each method.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce such a framework to establish relations between a
number of widely-used nonlinear filters for face normals in mesh denoising and
vertex normals in point set denoising. We cover robust statistical estimation
with M-smoothers and their application to linear and non-linear normal
filtering. Although these methods originate in different mathematical theories
- which include diffusion-, bilateral-, and directional curvature-based
algorithms - we demonstrate that all of them can be cast into a unified
framework of robust statistics using robust error norms and their corresponding
influence functions. This unification contributes to a better understanding of
the individual methods and their relations with each other. Furthermore, the
presented framework provides a platform for new techniques to combine the
advantages of known filters and to compare them with available methods.

the generalization of newly appeared G-SGD algorithm to more practical network
is hindered. The Basis Path Set Searching problem is formulated from the
perspective of graph theory, to find the basis path set in a regular
complicated neural network. Our paper aims to discover the underlying cause of
path dependency between two independent substructures. Algorithm DEAH is
designed to solve the Basis Path Set Searching problem by eliminating such path
dependency. The path subdivision chain is proposed to effectively eliminate the
path dependency inside the chain and between chains. The theoretical proofs and
analysis of polynomial time complexity are presented. The paper therefore
provides one methodology to find the basis path set in a more general neural
network, which offers theoretical and algorithmic support for the application
of G-SGD algorithm in more practical scenarios.

distributions is the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). This work proposes a
new annealing step-size schedule for ULA, which allows to prove new convergence
guarantees for sampling from a smooth log-concave distribution, which are not
covered by existing state-of-the-art convergence guarantees. To establish this
result, we derive a new theoretical bound that relates the Wasserstein distance
to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that
complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new
step size schedule to an existing constrained sampling algorithm, we show
state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave
distribution, as well as improved dimension dependence.

and Error Correcting Code (ECC). In the first problem, two parties hold two
strings, and one party tries to learn the other party's string through
communication. In the second problem, one party tries to send a message to
another party through a noisy channel, by adding some redundant information to
protect the message. Two important goals in both problems are to minimize the
communication complexity or redundancy, and to design efficient protocols or
codes.
</p>
<p>Both problems have been studied extensively. In this paper we study whether
asymmetric partial information can help in these two problems. We focus on the
case of Hamming distance/errors, and the asymmetric partial information is
modeled by one party having a vector of disjoint subsets $\vec{S}=(S_1, \cdots,
S_t)$ of indices and a vector of integers $\vec{k}=(k_1, \cdots, k_t)$, such
that in each $S_i$ the Hamming distance/errors is at most $k_i$. We establish
both lower bounds and upper bounds in this model, and provide efficient
randomized constructions that achieve a $\min\lbrace O(t^2), O\left((\log \log
n)^2\right) \rbrace $ factor within the optimum, with almost linear running
time.
</p>
<p>We further show a connection between the above document exchange problem and
the problem of document exchange under edit distance, and use our techniques to
give an efficient randomized protocol with optimal communication complexity and
\emph{exponentially} small error for the latter. This improves the previous
result by Haeupler \cite{haeupler2018optimal} (FOCS'19) and that by Belazzougui
and Zhang \cite{BelazzouguiZ16} (FOCS'16). Our techniques are based on a
generalization of the celebrated expander codes by Sipser and Spielman
\cite{sipser1996expander}, which may be of independent interests.

directly perform gates between arbitrary pairs of qubits, which is unlikely to
be practical for large-scale experiments. Power-law interactions with strength
decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ in the distance $r$ provide an experimentally
realizable resource for information processing, whilst still retaining
long-range connectivity. We leverage the power of these interactions to
implement a fast quantum fanout gate with an arbitrary number of targets. Our
implementation allows the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and Shor's algorithm
to be performed on a $D$-dimensional lattice in time logarithmic in the number
of qubits for interactions with $\alpha \le D$. As a corollary, we show that
power-law systems with $\alpha \le D$ are difficult to simulate classically
even for short times, under a standard assumption that factoring is classically
intractable. Complementarily, we develop a new technique to give a general
lower bound, linear in the size of the system, on the time required to
implement the QFT and the fanout gate in systems that are constrained by a
linear light cone. This allows us to prove an asymptotically tighter lower
bound for long-range systems than is possible with previously available
techniques.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Like many academics, I’ve now been regularly “attending” conferences and giving talks via Zoom for four months.  Naturally, I’ve learned a lot about how to use this platform—one that, despite numerous quirks and flaws, <em>actually works</em> well enough that it could probably replace at least 2/3 of in-person talks and meetings after the covid crisis is over.  But one particular lesson is so important that I thought I’d make a public service announcement of it.  So without further ado:</p>



<p><strong>Email the link.</strong></p>



<p>You know, the thing like</p>



<p>https://us02web.zoom.us/jblahblah</p>



<p>that you actually click to get to the actual conversation.  <em>Definitely</em> email the link to the speaker (!).  But also email it to whomever said they plan to attend.  Resend the link between a day and an hour in advance, so that it doesn’t get buried, but turns up right away when people search their inboxes.  If possible, put the link in <em>every single email</em> about the meeting or lecture.  Even if you already sent the link for previous iterations of the meeting and it hasn’t changed, send it again.  Don’t assume people will find the link on the web.  Don’t make them click through five other links or open an attached PDF for it.  Don’t send ten emails that explain every possible detail of the meeting except how to get to it.  Just <strong>email the link.</strong>  That’s all.  Thanks!</p></div>

<p>As <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2018/02/20/research-masters/">I wrote before</a>, for students that discovered their interest in theoretical CS late in their undergrad, or perhaps after they graduated, a research Masters, can be a great option. This is particularly the case if the program is funded (i.e., students get a stipend and don’t need to pay tuition). Such programs are not common in the U.S., but there are some excellent choices around the world.</p>



<p>Since (as far as I know) there is no single source listing such programs, I thought a crowdsourced Google spreadsheet might be useful and so created one here: <a href="http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters" rel="nofollow">http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters</a></p>



<p>If you know of more places, please fill out this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/qfnbEZYYYDtFCDpx9" rel="nofollow">https://forms.gle/qfnbEZYYYDtFCDpx9</a> </p></div>

    <p>Dubious journal publisher MDPI provides special-issue editors with some number of no-publication-charge slots, but requires that priority for these slots be given to first-world scholars, because they are the ones with “more abundant scientific research resources” (read: funds to pay publication charges). This didn’t sit well with three environmental health failure researchers, who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/16/failure-fails-as-publisher-privileges-the-privileged/">resigned their guest editorship over it</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104363585936972806"/>, <a href="https://wash.leeds.ac.uk/what-the-f-how-we-failed-to-publish-a-journal-special-issue-on-failures/">see also</a>).</p>

The sides of the triangle are straighter than a Reuleaux triangle would be, and its corners are slightly narrower than equilateral. Cool logo, though.</p>

Ritchie’s doctoral committee signed off in 1968, but the Harvard Library wanted a bound copy and he was unwilling to pay the binding costs so he never officially received his Ph.D. According to the post, the thesis defines a simple model of computation characterizing primitive recursion, within which one can prove that the complexity and growth rates of primitive recursive functions are equal.</p>

    <title>TR20-097 |  6-Uniform Maker-Breaker Game Is PSPACE-Complete | 

	Md Lutfar Rahman, 

	Thomas Watson</title>
    <summary>In a STOC 1976 paper, Schaefer proved that it is PSPACE-complete to determine the winner of the so-called Maker-Breaker game on a given set system, even when every set has size at most 11. Since then, there has been no improvement on this result. We prove that the game remains PSPACE-complete even when every set has size 6.</summary>

<p>2020 sucks.</p>



<p>Yesterday I learned that <a href="https://www.cifar.ca/cifarnews/2020/06/18/a-quantum-festschrift-for-david-poulin">David Poulin</a>, a creative and widely-beloved quantum computing and information theorist, has died at age 43, of an aggressive brain cancer.  After studying under many of the field’s legends—Gilles Brassard, Wojciech Zurek, Ray Laflamme, Gerard Milburn, John Preskill—David became a professor at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec.  There he played a leading role in CIFAR (the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research), eventually co-directing its quantum information science program with Aephraim Steinberg.  Just this fall (!), David moved to Microsoft Research to start a new phase of his career.  He’s survived by a large family.</p>



<p>While I can’t claim any deep knowledge of David’s work—he and I pursued very different problems—it seems appropriate to mention some of his best-known contributions.  With David Kribs, Ray Laflamme, and Maia Lesosky, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0504189">introduced</a> the formalism of operator quantum error correction, and made many other contributions to the theory of quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance (including the estimation of thresholds).  He and coauthors <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1147">showed</a> in a <em>Nature</em> paper how to do quantum state tomography on 1D matrix product states efficiently.  With Pavithran Iyer, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3235">proved</a> that optimal decoding of stabilizer codes is #P-hard.</p>



<p>And if none of that makes a sufficient impression on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers: well, back in 2013, when D-Wave was claiming to have achieved huge quantum speedups, David Poulin was one of the few experts willing to take a clear skeptical stance in public (including right in my comment section—see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1400#comment-79596">here</a> for example).</p>



<p>I vividly remember being officemates with David back in 2003, at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo—before Perimeter had its sleek black building, when it still operated out of a converted tavern.  (My and David’s office was in the basement, reached via a narrow staircase.)  David liked to tease me: for example, if I found him in conversation with someone else and asked what it was about, he’d say, “oh, nothing to do with computational efficiency, no reason for you to care.”  (And yet, much of David’s work ultimately <em>would</em> have to do with computational efficiency.)</p>



<p>David was taken way too soon and will be missed by everyone who knew him.  Feel free to share David stories in the comments.</p></div>

Joshua Greene and Andrew Lobb <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09193.pdf">proved</a> last month that every <em>smooth</em> Jordan curve in the plane and real <img alt="{r \leq 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cleq+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r \leq 1}"/>, there are four points on the curve that form a rectangle with sides of ratio <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>.</p>
<p>
Today we explain how this result relates to Otto Toeplitz’s famous “square peg conjecture,” which is the case <img alt="{r = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r = 1}"/> when the curve need not be smooth.</p>
<p><span id="more-17244"/></p>
<p>
We noticed this via an <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> last Thursday by Kevin Hartnett for <em>Quanta</em>. Hartnett describes this research advance as a product of the pandemic inducing them to take time for deeper reflection on fundamental problems. We wonder how much is bubbling on hard problems in our own field—this is one reason for our last post’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/some-real-and-some-virtual-news">interest</a> in (good kinds of) “gossip.”  He also gives great diagrams for the geometrical intuition.</p>
<p>
We will portray this advance instead along lines of things we’ve said recently about how to attack hard problems by seeking and solving simpler ones or special cases as stepping stones. Dick wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/21/the-inscribed-square-problem/">post</a> two years ago on the original Toeplitz problem, which this work still leaves open. That post focused on ways general Jordan curves can be nasty. This one needs an extra niceness condition but proves a stronger result for all <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>. How much can progress on “nice” inform problems with “nasty”? That kind of question comes up in complexity theory all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Pegging Rectangles </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A <em>Jordan curve</em> is the image of a continuous 1-1 map <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> from the circle to the plane. The condition of being 1-1 prevents the image from intersecting itself, so it is a single closed loop. By the Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem">theorem</a>, the loop always partitions the rest of the plane into two connected regions, exactly one of which is bounded. Amazingly, a Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood_curve">can</a> have positive Lebesgue measure, yet cannot fill all of <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{R}^2}"/>. Such curves can, however, approach the kind of space-filling curves defined by Giuseppe Peano, and thus have any Lebesgue density less than <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, as was noted also by William Osgood in his 1903 <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1986455.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
<p>
The Toeplitz conjecture is that every Jordan curve has four points that form a square. As noted in Dick’s post, the positive-area case is actually an easy yes-case. Nasty cases are where the curve is nowhere-differentiable with zero area. Thus far, the problem has been answered <em>yes</em> only in the presence of some uniformity condition that limits the local nastiness of the curve. The simplest one is for the curve to be <em>smooth</em> in that <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> has a continuous first derivative. Here is a smooth curve that is not convex, so that the square need not be “inside” the curve:</p>
<p/><p/>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/29/taking-a-problem-down-a-peg/matschkefig2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17247"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17247" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/matschkefig2.jpg?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
This diagram is from Benjamin Matchske’s wonderful recent <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/201404/rnoti-p346.pdf">survey</a> of the peg problem in the <em>AMS Notices</em>. Four months ago we’d have said it looks like a thin heart or fat boomerang. <i>Now</i> it looks to us like a face mask.</p>
<p>
As the survey notes, it is easy to show that every Jordan curve has <em>some</em> rectangle. The rectangle problem is to show that rectangles of <i>every</i> aspect ratio <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> can be pegged to the curve. There are two main reasons the square and rectangle problems are hard and harder:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Although any Jordan curve can be written as a limit of nice ones, the squares in the nice ones can degenerate to a single point in the limit. <p/>
</li><li>
Even for nice curves, a parity property that holds for squares can fail for rectangles.
</li></ol>
<p>
The property in the second point enables arguments of the kind: <em>for generic curves the number of squares is odd, therefore it is nonzero</em>. This then carries over to sufficiently nice curves in the generic closure. The failure of this property for rectangles is a main reason the results by Greene and Lobb are new.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Paper </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The new paper is written tersely at a high level, and we must confess not being able to catch all details in compressed time. But we can highlight some aspects of the argument. First, as we have said, it exemplifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Solve a Simpler Problem</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is however coupled with a second aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Bring Up the Reserves</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
It may be that the rectangle conjecture is not only true but “equally true” in the sense that the fundamental reason applies equally well to the case of rectangles. The parity argument that works for cases involving squares may be a crutch that misses the deepest explanations. Promoting arguments that avoid this crutch may marshal resources needed to make a breakthrough on the main problem for completely general Jordan curves.</p>
<p>
This runs somewhat counter to what we have said about <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> versus <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> proof attempts recently. The reason for <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/> believed by most is that problems like SAT require <em>exponential</em> time, not just super-polynomial time. Yet no one knows even a <em>super-linear</em> lower bound, apart from barely-superlinear bounds that exploit grainy aspects of the multitape Turing machine model and apply only to it. Nor is any super-linear lower bound known on Boolean circuit size. Maybe it is a viable strategy also to “bring up reserves” by finding restricted cases where (conditional) exponential lower bounds can be proven, as well as to explore contingencies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">SETH</a>, as we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">here</a>. But both of use have always felt that the super-linear frontier holds the buried keys to further progress.</p>
<p>
The Greene-Lobb proof has two aspects that may also resonate in complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Blow Up the Objects</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> in <em>Quanta</em> has great diagrams illustrating how the set of pairs of points on the curve corresponds to a Möbius strip in a related space. Cole Hugelmeyer, a graduate student at Princeton, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07336.pdf">proved</a> last year how to get rectangles covering at least one-third of possible values <img alt="{r \in (0,1]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cin+%280%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r \in (0,1]}"/> by embedding the Möbius strips in a four-dimensional space. Intersections between a strip and a rotated copy yield rectangles on the original Jordan curve. </p>
<p>
That led Greene and Lobb to consider larger objects with properties like pairs of Möbius strips in the larger space. The Klein bottle is the natural next thing to consider and led to a feature of their proof that made the desired conclusion pop out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Identify and Rule Out Obstructions</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The clever point pivots on the fact that a Klein bottle cannot be smoothly embedded into the complex plane <img alt="{\mathbb{C}^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{C}^2}"/> as a Lagrangian submanifold. The proof shows that for any prescribed aspect ratio <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> one can construct a mapping that almost succeeds in embedding such a Klein bottle. The fact that it must fail means that the image must yield a point of intersection witnessing the failure. The presence of this point then yields the construction of four other points on the Jordan curve that form the vertices of the needed rectangle.</p>
<p>
We have briefly <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">mentioned</a> how the concept of <em>obstructions</em> is integral to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_complexity_theory">Geometric</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1944345.1944346">Complexity</a> <a href="http://gct.cs.uchicago.edu/">Theory</a> attack on <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/>. Closer to home, however, is how László Babai's graph isomorphism algorithm and proof works by identifying a subclass of graphs called Johnson graphs as obstructions to a simpler algorithm, as we highlighted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/snow-and-theory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Can you find more lessons from the new advance on the Toeplitz problem?  Dick and I have considered ideas of blowing up from languages to pairs of languages (and making <i>reductions</i> between problems the fundamental units of analysis) but this has not gone beyond dreamwork.</p>

    <title>Can you name a famous living Chemist? Can anyone?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
I was re-watching the  Greatest-of-all-time Jeopardy championship and the following happen (I paraphrase)<br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
Alex Trebek: The category is Chemistry and we have a special guest reading the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Darling: I wonder who that will be.<br/>
<br/>
Bill: Hmm. I assume some famous chemist.<br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
So who was it? Bryan Cranston, the actor who PLAYED chemist Walter White on <i>Breaking Bad.</i><br/>
<br/>
Why couldn't they get a famous living chemist to read the clues?<br/>
<br/>
My guess: there are no famous living chemists.<br/>
<br/>
The number of famous living scientists is fairly short and they are often known for things that are not quite their science. Some are famous because the popularize science (deGrasse Tyson, Dawkins) or because of something unusual about their life (Hawkings when he was alive) or for something else entirely that they did (Ted Kaczynski).  Are any famous for the actual work that they do in the science?<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Wiles was famous for a brief time, and even made People Magazine's <i>25 most intriguing people of the year</i> list in the early 1990's (after he solved Fermat's Last Theorem). So he was famous but it was short lived.<br/>
<br/>
Terry Tao was on the Colbert Report (see <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/6wtwlg/the-colbert-report-terence-tao">here</a>) after he won the Fields Medal, the MacAuthor Genius award, and the Breakthrough prize. And even that fame was short lived.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the web page of Nobel Prize winners, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The only Chemistry Nobel's I recognized were Marie Curie,  Irene Joilet-Curie (Marie's Daughter), and Erst Rutherford.<br/>
<br/>
The only Physics Nobel's I recognized were<br/>
<br/>
Richard Feynman,<br/>
<br/>
 Eugene Wigner (for writing about <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences</a>),<br/>
<br/>
Richard Hofstadter (since he was the father of Douglas H and an uncle of Leonard H)<br/>
<br/>
 Andrew Geim (since he won  both an Ig-Noble prize and a Nobel prize, see  <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/10/noble-and-ig-noble-prizes.html">here</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Wolfgang Pauli (I've heard the term `Pauli Principle" though I did not know what it was until I looked it up while preparing this blog. I prob still don't really know what it means.)<br/>
<br/>
Enrico Fermi<br/>
<br/>
Erwin Schrodinger<br/>
<br/>
Paul Dirac<br/>
<br/>
Robert Millikan<br/>
<br/>
Albert Einstein<br/>
<br/>
Max Karl Ernest Ludwig Planck (I thought his last name was `Institute')<br/>
<br/>
Johannes Diderik van der Waals<br/>
<br/>
Pierre Curie<br/>
<br/>
Marie Curie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, some questions:<br/>
<br/>
a) Am I wrong? Are there famous living chemists I never heard of? Are there any famous living scientists who are famous for their work in science?<br/>
<br/>
b) If I am right then was there ever a time when there were famous scientists?<br/>
<br/>
c) If there was such a time, what changed?<br/>
<br/>
(I ask all of this non-rhetorically and with no agenda to push.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <title>What We've Learned to Control</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m giving a keynote address at the <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/">virtual IFAC congress this July</a>, and I submitted an abstract that forces me to reflect on the current state of research at the intersection of machine learning and control. 2020 is particularly appropriate for reflection: For personal reasons, I’ve been working in this space for about half a decade now and <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/">wrote a blog series on the topic two years ago</a> and it seemed like ideal timing. For the broader community, 2020 happens to be the year we were promised fleets of self-driving cars. Of course, for a myriad of reasons, we’re nowhere close to achieving this goal. Full self-driving has been a key motivator of work in learning-enabled autonomous systems, and it’s important to note this example as a marker of how difficult problems this space really are.</p>

<p>The research community has come to terms with this difficulty, and has committed itself to address the many pressing challenges. Over the last year I attended several great meetings on this topic, including an <a href="https://ajwagen.github.io/adsi_learning_and_control/">NSF funded workshop at UW</a>, a plenary session at <a href="https://ita.ucsd.edu/ws/">ITA</a>, a workshop on intersections of <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">learning, control, and optimization at IPAM</a>, and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/l4dc/home">second annual conference on Learning for Dynamics and Control</a>. There is clearly a ton of enthusiasm from researchers in a many different disciplines, and we’re seeing fascinating results mixing techniques from machine learning, computer science, and control. Obviously, I’m going to be leaving out many incredible papers, but, focusing on the theoretical end of the spectrum, perhaps I could highlight <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11899">new work on policy optimization</a> that demonstrates how simple optimization techniques can efficiently solve classic, nonconvex control-design problems or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">work connecting regret minimization and adaptive control</a> that provides nonasymptotic bounds.</p>

<p>This work has been very useful for establishing language to bridge communication between the diverse research camps interested in the space of learning, dynamics and automation. But, as I’ll discuss shortly, I’d argue that it hasn’t provided many promising approaches to improving large-scale autonomy. That’s ok! These problems are incredibly difficult and aren’t going to be solved by wishing for them to be solved. But I also think it might be worth taking a moment to reflect on which problems we are working on. It’s always a bit too easy for theorists to focus  on improving technical results and lose sight of why someone proved those results in the first place.</p>

<p>As an illustrative example, my research group spent a lot of time studying the <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/08/lqr/">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a> (LQR). The point of this work was initially to establish baselines: LQR has a closed form solution when the model is known, so we wanted to understand how different algorithms might perform when the underlying model was unknown. It turns out that if you are willing to collect enough data, the best thing you can do for LQR is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07826">estimate the dynamical model, and then exploit this model as if it were true</a>. This so-called “certainty equivalent control” is what practitioners have been doing since the mid-60s to fly satellites and solve other optimal control problems. Proving this result required a bunch of new mathematical insights that established connections between high dimensional statistics and automatic control theory. But it did not bring us closer to solving new challenges in robotics or autonomous systems. Our work here merely showed that what the controls community had been doing for 50 years was already about as well as we could do for this important baseline problem.</p>

<p>So what are the ways forward? Are there things that theory-minded folks can work on short term that might help us understand paths towards improving learning systems in complex feedback loops? Let me suggest a few challenges that I see as both very pressing, but also ones where we might be able to make near-term progress.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-is-still-not-reliable-technology">Machine Learning is still not reliable technology</h2>

<p>At the aforementioned <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">IPAM meeting</a>, Richard Murray gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi8Y---ce28">fantastic survey of the sorts of standards of reliability imposed in aerospace engineering</a>. Go watch it! I don’t want to spoil it for you, but his discussion of Ram Air Turbines is gripping. Richard covers what is needed to get to the sorts of reliability we’d like in autonomous systems. Unfortunately, having <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08237">88.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet</a>—while a stunning achievement—doesn’t tell us how to get to systems with failure rates on the order of 1 in a billion. As Boeing has tragically shown, cutting corners on autonomous system safety standards has horrible, tragic consequences.</p>

<p>How can we make machine learning more robust? How can we approach the failure rates needed for safe, reliable autonomy? And how can we establish testing protocols to assure we have such low failure rates?</p>

<h2 id="prediction-systems-in-feedback-loops">Prediction systems in feedback loops</h2>

<p>One particular aspect that I think is worth considering is how supervised learning systems can function as “sensors” in feedback loops. Even if you know everything about a dynamical system, when you observe the state via an estimator generated by a learned component, it’s not clear how to best take action on this observation. Most classic control and planning assumes that your errors in state-estimation are Gaussian or nicely uniformly bounded. Of course, the errors from machine learning systems are neither of these (I recommend checking out the <a href="https://youtu.be/A0cb7wZVFf4">crazy videos</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1130956365063761920">confusion</a> that comes out of Tesla Autopilot’s vision systems). How to properly characterize the errors of machine learning systems for control applications seems like a useful, understudied problem. Using off-the-shelf machine learing analysis, it’s unavoidable to have to densely sample all of the possible scenarios in advance in order to guarantee the sort of uniform error bounds desired by control algorithms. This isn’t practical, and, indeed, it’s clear that this sort of sensor characterization is not needed to make reasonable demos work. Though it’s a bit mundane, I think a huge contribution lies in understanding how much data we need to quantify the uncertainty in learned perception components. It’s still not clear to me if this is a machine learning question or a closed-loop design question, and I suspect both views of the problem will be needed to make progress.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-we-all-sleeping-on-model-predictive-control">Why are we all sleeping on model predictive control?</h2>

<p>I still remain baffled by how <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/05/02/adp/">model predictive control</a> (MPC) is consistently under appreciated. We’ll commonly see the same tasks in the same meeting, one task done on a robot using some sort of deep reinforcement learning and the other done using model predictive control, and the disparity in performance is stark. It’s like the difference between watching an Olympic level sprinter and me jogging in my neighborhood with a set of orthotics.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from the IPAM workshop. Martin Riedmiller presented work at DeepMind to catch a ball in a cup:</p>



<p>This system uses two cameras, has a rather large “cup,” (it’s a wastepaper basket) and yet still takes 3 days to train on the robot. Francesco Borrelli presented a different approach. Using only a single camera and basic, simple Newtonian physics, and MPC they were able to achieve this performance on the standard-sized “ball-in-a-cup” toy:</p>



<p>If you only saw these two videos, I can’t fathom why would you invest all of your assets into deep RL. I understand there are still a lot of diehards out there, and I know this will offend them. But I want to make a constructive point: so many theorists are spending a lot of time studying RL algorithms, but few in the ML community are analyzing MPC and why it’s so successful. We should rebalance our allocation of mental resources!</p>

<p>Now, while the basic idea of MPC is very simple, the theory gets very hairy very quickly. It definitely takes some time and effort to learn about how to prove convergence of MPC protocols. I’d urge the MPC crowd to connect more with the learning theory crowd to see if a common ground can be found to better understand how MPC works and how we might push its performance even farther.</p>

<h2 id="perhaps-we-should-stop-taking-cues-from-alphago">Perhaps we should stop taking cues from AlphaGo?</h2>

<p>One of the grand goals in RL is to use function approximation algorithms to estimate value functions. The conventional wisdom asserts that the world is a giant Markov Decision Process and once you have its value function, you can just greedily maximize it and you’ll win at life. Now, this sort of approach clearly doesn’t work for robots, and I’m perplexed by why people still think it will work at all. Part of the motivation is that this approach was used to solve Go. But at some point I think we all have to come to terms with the fact that games are not the real world.</p>

<p>Now, I’d actually argue that RL <em>does</em> work in the real world, but it’s in systems that most people don’t actively think of as RL systems. Greedy value function estimation and exploitation is <em>literally</em> how all internet revenue is made. Systems simply use past data to estimate value functions and then choose the action that maximizes the value at the next step. Though seldom described as such, these are instances of the “greedy contextual bandit” algorithm, and this algorithm makes tech companies tons of money. But many researchers have also pointed out that this algorithm leads to misinformation, polarization, and radicalization.</p>

<p>Everyone tries to motivate RL by the success of AlphaGo, but they should be using the success of Facebook and Google instead. And if they did this, I think it would be a lot more clear why RL is terrifying and dangerous, and one whose limitations we desperately need to understand so that we can build safer tools.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-the-70s-about-optimal-control">Lessons from the 70s about optimal control</h2>

<p>I have one set of ideas along these lines that, while I think is important, I still am having a hard time articulating. Indeed, I might just take a few blog posts to work through my thoughts on this, but let me close this blog with a teaser of discussions to come. As I mentioned above, optimal control was a guiding paradigm for a variety of control applications in the 60s and 70s. During this time, it seemed like there might even be hidden benefits to a full-on optimization paradigm: though you’d optimize a single, simple objective, you would often get additional robustness guarantees for free. However, it turned out that this was very misleading and that <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1101812">there were no guarantees of robustness even for simple optimal control problems</a>. This shouldn’t be too surprising, as if you devote a lot of resources towards one objective, you are likely neglecting some other objective. But showing how and why these fragilities arise is quite delicate. It’s not always obvious how you <em>should</em> be devoting your resources.</p>

<p>Trying to determine how to allocate engineering resources to balance safety and performance is the heart of “robust control.” One thing I’m fascinated by moving forward is if any of the early developments in robust control might transfer over for a new kind of “robust ML.” Unfortunately for all of us, robust control is a rather encrypted literature. There is a lot of mathematics, but often not clear statements about <em>why</em> we study particular problems or what are the fundamental limits of feedback. While diligent young learning theorists have been scouring classic control theory text books for insights, these books don’t always articulate what we can and cannot do and what are the problems that control theory might help solve. We still have a lot of work to do in communicating what we know and what problems remain challenging. I think it would be useful for control theorists to think of how to best communicate the fundamental concepts of robust control. I hope to take up this challenge in the next few months on this blog.</p>

<p><em>I’d like to thank Sarah Dean, Horia Mania, Nik Matni, and Ludwig Schmidt for their helpful feedback on this post. I’d also like to thank John Doyle for several inspiring conversations about robustness in optimal control and on the encrypted state of the control theory literature.</em></p></div>

    <title>Sorting with integer offsets</title>
    <summary>Here’s a cute exercise for the next time you’re teaching radix sorting in an algorithms class:</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Here’s a cute exercise for the next time you’re teaching radix sorting in an algorithms class:</p>

<p>Suppose you’re given as input a set of real numbers , and an integer parameter . Describe an algorithm for sorting the  numbers  in time . You can assume that standard arithmetic operations on real numbers (including comparisons and rounding down to an integer) take constant time per operation.</p>

<p>Models of computation that mix constant-time real arithmetic and rounding operations can be problematic, as by building up and then rounding numbers with unlimited precision you can access a level of computational power beyond what actual computers can do, but I don’t think that’s a concern here. If someone wants to use bit-packing tricks to implement a crazy but fast sorting algorithm in this model, they’re beyond the level of this exercise.</p>

<p>The same method (which I’m not going to describe, to preserve its value as an exercise) more generally allows you to take as input pairs  and sort the numbers  in time  where . But it relies heavily on the fact that you’re adding integers to the ’s. For a problem that can’t be handled in this way, consider instead sorting the numbers  where we multiply instead of adding. Or, if you prefer to view this as a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_%2B_Y_sorting"> sorting</a> problem, take logs in your favorite base and sort the numbers . It’s not at all obvious to me whether this can be done in the same  time bound.</p>

<p>The motivation for looking at all this is <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/47120/95">a question about how to implement the greedy set cover quickly</a>. You can find the unweighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem#Greedy_algorithm">greedy set cover</a> in linear time (linear in the sum of the sizes of the input sets; this is an exercise in CLRS), and you can approximate the weighted greedy set cover very accurately in linear time using similar ideas. If you could sort  quickly you could use the sorted order to compute the weighted greedy set cover exactly in the same time as the sorting algorithm. Which is totally useless because the greedy cover is already an approximation, so a fast and accurate approximation to the greedy cover is good enough. But I think the question of sorting  is interesting despite its uselessness in this application.</p>

<h2>Rani Sharim’s two-player variants of John Conway’s game-of-life</h2>
<p><a href="https://ranisharim.github.io/game_of_life_2_players/">Here is a web-page</a> by a student in my “Game Theory” course where you can play several two-players variants of John Conway’s game-of-life.  (A couple of variants were considered before. See, e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0207679">this  paper</a>.)</p>
<p>I really enjoyed playing Rani’s games and it can certainly cheer you up in difficult times. Questions about the game, remarks, and suggestions for improvements and for new features, are most welcome.</p>
<h2>How to catch lies with statistics, a 2006  presentation by Maya Bar-Hillel</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19929" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png?w=640"/></a></p>
<p>Maya Bar-Hillel (left) and Ester Samuel-Cahn</p>
<p>Here is an interesting 2006 <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/ester.ppt">power point presentation entitled <strong><em>How to detect lies with statistics</em></strong> by Maya Bar-Hillel.</a>  This was a talk given by Maya at the <a href="http://www.esterconference.huji.ac.il/">conference</a> honoring Prof. Ester Samuel- Cahn , Jerusalem, December 18-20, 2006, and it described a planned research project of Maya Bar-Hillel with Yossi Rinott, David Budescu and myself. At the end we did not pursue it, mainly because each of us was involved in various other projects (but also because we were skeptical about some aspects of it.)  Ester Samuel-Cahn (1933-2015) was a famous Israeli statistician. (Here is a <a href="http://www.sci-princess.info/archives/291">post by Yosi Levy in Hebrew</a> about the conference and about Ester.)</p>
<p>The lecture starts with “Last year, <em>Statistical Science</em> celebrated 50 years for `How to Lie with Statistics’ the book [by Durell Huff] whose title inspired this talk.”</p>
<p>And here are a few other quotes from Maya’s presentation</p>
<p>“We are not sure a general toolkit for detecting lies with statistics can be developed. Perhaps that explains why none yet exists.  We have shown just a collection of anecdotes. But they can be classified and categorized. Some do seem generalizeable, at least to some extent.”</p>
<p>and the conclusion</p>
<blockquote><p>A famous quip by Fred Mosteller: “It is easy to lie with statistics, but easier to lie without them.”</p>
<p>Likewise, we should say:  “It is possible to detect (some) lies with statistics, but easier to detect them with other means”.</p></blockquote>
<h2>New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems</h2>
<p>Peter Keevash, Alexey Pokrovskiy, Benny Sudakov, and Liana Yepremyan’s paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00526">New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems,</a> describes remarkable progress very old questions regarding transversals in Latin square.</p>
<h2>Topological Tverberg news</h2>
<p>I came across a very interesting paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05251">The topological Tverberg problem beyond <span class="search-hit mathjax">prime</span> powers</a> by Florian Frick and Pablo Soberón with new bounds and a new method for topological Tverberg theorem in the non prime-power case.</p>
<h2>Jeager’s conjecture refuted</h2>
<p>A year ago I came across <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2114324995342352&amp;set=a.507523926022475&amp;type=3&amp;theater">this cool facebook post</a> by Rupei Xu</p>
<blockquote><p>OMG! Just learned that Jaeger’s conjecture is false for every t&gt;=3. An interesting consequence of it is that a specific version of Goddyn’s conjecture on thin spanning trees is false, which shows some negative evidence that the thin spanning tree approaches may fail to lead to a constant factor approximation algorithm for ATSP!</p></blockquote>
<h2>A cool rainbow post <a href="http://matroidunion.org/?p=2541">Short rainbow cycles in graphs and matroids</a> by Tony Huynh</h2>
<h2>More on the game of life</h2>
<p>Let me mention two problems I posted 6-7 years ago about Conway’s game of life. <a class="question-hyperlink" href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/132402/conways-game-of-life-for-random-initial-position">Conway’s game of life for random initial position</a> and <a class="question-hyperlink" href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/17914/does-a-noisy-version-of-conways-game-of-life-support-universal-computation">Does a noisy version of Conway’s game of life support universal computation?</a></p>

    <title>Writing Code for a Paper :  A Note to Students</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This post both relates to some of the stuff I'll be presenting at Friday's STOC workshop on Algorithms with Predictions, but is also for future students in my classes, who sometimes wonder why I have them write code on theory material.  (Somehow this might be a theme for a lecture in my grad class next semester, so maybe these are a first attempt at notes for the lecture.  Comments  and  suggestions welcome.)<br/><br/>Some of the work I'm doing is looking at how queueing systems perform with various sorts of predictions on the times the jobs take.  This particular work I'm doing on my own.  (While most of my research has been and is with collaborators, and it's one of the things I enjoy about computer science -- we're a very collaborative field!, which seems to surprise many people -- I still sometimes like to do research projects on my own.  I've looked at queueing systems since my PhD thesis, and it's a bit outside the research interest of most of my collaborator pool, and it's "fun" sometimes to do my own thing.  The reason why "fun" is in quotes is described below.)  <br/><br/>Often in my work in queueing I'm looking at mean-field limits (meant to model infinite systems of queues, which provides a good approximation for large finite systems under reasonable assumptions), where I can derive families of differential equations describing the system behavior.  I can also simulate the large finite system directly, and make sure the results match.  I generally do this for all of these types of papers.<br/><br/>Now the numbers I get from simulating the system directly and from simulating the differential equations should match (say within 1% or so).  If they don't, something is wrong.  In an effort to avoid wrongness, I won't consider the paper ready for outside consumption until I get a match.  Unfortunately, there are three ways things can go wrong.<br/><br/>1.  My simulation code for the queueing system might have bugs.<br/>2.  My code to evaluate the differential equations might have bugs.<br/>3.  My equations themselves might have bugs.<br/><br/>And I find there are two main categories of bugs.  Sometimes the bugs are simple/standard coding mistakes -- I'm off by 1 on an index, or I cut and paste and forget to change an i++ to a j++ in one my double loops, or I type x instead of a y.  Usually it's pretty easy to find these things, although I've had times where a hidden typo took hours to find.  But sometimes the bug is a thinking mistake -- I've forgotten a subcase and so my equations aren't complete (and so my code evaluating the equations won't give the right answer), or I've not handled a subcase correctly in my simulation.  That type usually takes longer. <br/><br/>Usually, the first time through, most all of these types of bugs happen -- my math is off, I've typed some stuff wrong, it can all happen.  And then, like coders everywhere, I go through and fix it.  And it's painful.  Sometimes everything goes right, a quick check or two and everything works.  For more complicated stuff, it's more time figuring out what went wrong than setting up the code to begin with.  And being the personality type to not let things sit, that can mean late nights figuring out what went wrong.<br/><br/>For my talk this week, there was one last problem I wanted to include, which meant finally taking the model and writing the equations and code.  I didn't even need it for the talk, but it's also the last bit before I put a paper draft on arxiv, so taking advantage of a deadline, I figured now was the time.  Which means the last 2 days, I've spent many hours (and a late night) trying to remove the disagreements.<br/><br/>On the plus side, when everything finally works, it's a wonderful feeling.  And it always makes me feel better when I have worked to verify my math this way;  this time, what kept me up well past midnight and took several hours to track down was actually a boundary case I had left out of the equations.  (I had looked at the equations over and over again without noticing I had left out the subcase;  I had to step through numbers from the differential equations one time step at a time to track down what was missing, and then the numbers told me what I had done wrong.)<br/><br/>On the down side, it's work, and debugging is never particularly fun.<br/><br/>For students out there, maybe I'm just explaining that I understand the pain that I am putting you through.  You may wonder why I have you do simulations that take a few hours if you do them well, but days if you don't think through the best approach.  But using programming and theory together can be powerful;  it's helped me countless times in my research.<br/><br/>(Related: on theory and experiments that <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191184-theory-without-experiments/fulltext">I've written on before</a>, along with <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191183-experiments-as-research-validation/fulltext">a viewpoint by Jeffrey Ullman</a>.)<br/><br/><br/></div>

    <title>TR20-095 |  On Basing Auxiliary-Input Cryptography on NP-hardness via Nonadaptive Black-Box Reductions | 

	Mikito Nanashima</title>
    <summary>A black-box (BB) reduction is a central proof technique in theoretical computer science. However, the limitations on BB reductions have been revealed for several decades, and the series of previous work gives strong evidence that we should avoid a nonadaptive BB reduction to base cryptography on NP-hardness (e.g., Akavia et al., 2006). Then should we also give up such a familiar proof technique even for an intermediate step towards cryptography?

In this paper, we continue to explore the capability of nonadaptive BB reductions and extend our knowledge on such a central technique out of the current (worst-to-average) framework. In particular, we investigate the attempt to base weaker cryptographic notions allowed to take auxiliary-input via nonadaptive BB reductions. As a result, we prove the following theorems: (1) if we base an auxiliary-input pseudorandom generator (AIPRG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses; (2) if we base an auxiliary-input one-way function (AIOWF) or auxiliary-input hitting set generator (AIHSG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then an (i.o.-)one-way function also exists based on NP-hardness (via an adaptive BB reduction).

The first result gives new evidence that nonadaptive BB reductions are insufficient to base AIPRG. The second result also yields a weaker but still surprising consequence of nonadaptive BB reductions, that is, a one-way function based on NP-hardness. In fact, the second result is interpreted as the following two opposite ways. Pessimistically, it shows that basing AIOWF or AIHSG via nonadaptive BB reductions is harder than constructing a one-way function based on NP-hardness, which can be regarded as a negative result. Note that AIHSG is a weak primitive implied even by the hardness of learning; thus, this pessimistic view gives conceptually stronger limitations than the currently known limitations on nonadaptive BB reductions. Optimistically, our result gives a new hope: a breakthrough construction of auxiliary-input primitives might also be useful to construct standard cryptographic primitives. This optimistic view enhances the significance of further investigation on constructing auxiliary-input or other intermediate cryptographic primitives instead of standard cryptographic primitives.</summary>

    <title>An equilibrium in nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>While there has been incredible progress in convex and nonconvex minimization, a multitude of problems in ML today are in need of efficient algorithms to solve min-max optimization problems. 
 Unlike minimization, where algorithms can always be shown to converge to some local minimum, there is no notion of a local equilibrium in min-max optimization that exists for general nonconvex-nonconcave functions.
    In two recent papers, we give  two notions of local equilibria that are guaranteed to exist and efficient algorithms to compute them.
In this post we present the key ideas behind a second-order notion of local min-max equilibrium from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> and in the next we will talk about a different notion along with the algorithm and show its implications to GANs from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12376">this paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="min-max-optimization">Min-max optimization</h2>

<p>Min-max optimization of an objective function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$</p>



<p>is a powerful framework in optimization, economics, and ML as it allows one to model learning in the presence of multiple agents with competing objectives.
In ML applications, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">GANs</a> and <a href="https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org">adversarial robustness</a>, the min-max objective function may be nonconvex-nonconcave.
We know that min-max optimization is at least as hard as minimization, hence, we cannot hope to find a globally optimal solution to min-max problems for general functions.</p>

<h2 id="approximate-local-minima-for-minimization">Approximate local minima for minimization</h2>

<p>Let us first revisit the special case of minimization, where there is a natural notion of an approximate second-order local minimum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$x$ is a second-order $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ if
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now suppose we just wanted to minimize a function $\mathcal{L}$, and we start from any point which is <em>not</em> at an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}$.
Then we can always find a direction to travel in along which either $\mathcal{L}$ decreases rapidly, or the second derivative of $\mathcal{L}$ is large.
 By searching in such a direction we can easily find a new point which has a smaller value of $\mathcal{L}$ using only local information about the gradient and Hessian of $\mathcal{L}$.
 This means that we can keep decreasing $\mathcal{L}$ until we reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum (see <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Boris_Polyak2/publication/220589612_Cubic_regularization_of_Newton_method_and_its_global_performance/links/09e4150dd2f0320879000000/Cubic-regularization-of-Newton-method-and-its-global-performance.pdf">Nesterov and Polyak</a>,  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3055399.3055464">here</a>,  <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Ge15.pdf">here</a>,  and also an earlier <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2016/03/22/saddlepoints">blog post</a> for how to do this with only access to gradients of $\mathcal{L}$).
 If $\mathcal{L}$ is Lipschitz smooth and bounded, we will reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum in polynomial time from any starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an analogous definition with similar properties for min-max optimization?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="problems-with-current-local-optimality-notions">Problems with current local optimality notions</h2>
<p>There has been much recent work on extending theoretical results in nonconvex minimization to min-max optimization (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00331">here</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9430-efficient-algorithms-for-smooth-minimax-optimization">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02629.pdf">here</a>,  <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9631-solving-a-class-of-non-convex-min-max-games-using-iterative-first-order-methods.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07512">here</a>.
One way to extend the notion of local minimum to the min-max setting is to seek a solution point called a “local saddle”–a point $(x,y)$ where 1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x, \cdot)$ and 2) $x$ is a local minimum for $f(\cdot, y).$</p>

<p>For instance,
 this is used  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00838.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10461.pdf">here</a>, and <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/adolphs19a.html">here</a>.
But, there are very simple examples of two-dimensional bounded functions where a local saddle does not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, consider $f(x,y) = sin(x+y)$ from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">here</a>. Check that none of the points on this function are simultaneously a local minimum for $x$ and local maximum for $y$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that no local saddle exists may be surprising, since an $\varepsilon$-global solution to a min-max optimization problem <em>is</em> guaranteed to exist as long as the objective function is uniformly bounded.
Roughly, this is because, in a global min-max setting, the max-player is empowered to globally maximize the function $f(x,\cdot)$, and the min-player is empowered to minimize the “global max” function $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$.</p>

<p>The ability to compute the global max  allows the min-player to  predict the max-player’s response.
If $x$ is a global minimum of $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$, the min-player is aware of this fact and will have no incentive to update $x$.
On the other hand, if the min-player can only simulate the max-player’s updates locally (as in local saddle),
then the min-player may try to update her strategy even when it leads to a net increase in $f$.
This can happen because the min-player is not powerful enough to accurately simulate the max-player’s response. (See  a  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">related notion</a> of local optimality with similar issues due to vanishingly small updates.)</p>

<p>The fact that players who can only make local predictions are
unable to predict their opponents’ responses can lead to convergence problems in many popular algorithms such as<br/>
gradient descent ascent (GDA). This non-convergence behavior can occur if the function has no local saddle point (e.g. the function $sin(x+y)$  mentioned above), and can even happen on some functions, like $f(x,y) = xy$ which do have a local saddle point.</p>

<br/>
<b>Figure 1.</b> GDA spirals off to infinity from almost every starting point on the objective function $f(x,y) = xy$.

<h2 id="greedy-max-a-computationally-tractable-alternative-to-global-max">Greedy max: a computationally tractable alternative to global max</h2>

<p>To allow for a more stable min-player, and a more stable notion of local optimality, we would like to empower the min-player to more effectively simulate the max-player’s response. 
While the notion of global min-max does exactly this by having the min-player compute the global max function $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, computing the global maximum may be intractable.</p>

<p>Instead, we replace the global max function $\max_y (f(\cdot ,y))$ with a computationally tractable alternative. 
Towards this end, we restrict the max-player’s response, and the min-player’s simulation of this response, to updates which can be computed using any algorithm from a class of second-order optimization algorithms.
More specifically, we restrict the max-player to updating $y$ by traveling along continuous paths which start at the current value of $y$ and along which either $f$ is increasing or the second derivative of $f$ is positive.  We refer to such paths as greedy paths since they model a class of second-order “greedy” optimization algorithms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy path:</strong> A unit-speed path $\varphi:[0,\tau] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is greedy if $f$ is non-decreasing over this path, and for every $t\in[0,\tau]$
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roughly speaking, when restricted to updates obtained from greedy paths, the max-player will always be able to reach a point which is an approximate local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$, although there may not be a greedy path which leads the max-player to a global maximum.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/greedy_region_omega_t.png" style="width: 400px;"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/global_max_path_no_axes_t.png" style="width: 400px;"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 2.</b> <i>Left:</i> The light-colored region $\Omega$ is reachable from the initial point $A$ by a greedy path; the dark region is not reachable. <i>Right:</i> There is always a greedy path from any point $A$ to a local maximum ($B$), but a global maximum ($C$) may not be reachable by any greedy path.
</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To define an alternative to $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, we consider the local maximum point with the largest value of $f(x,\cdot)$ attainable from a given starting point $y$ by any greedy path.
We refer to the value of $f$ at this point as the <em>greedy max function</em>, and denote this value by $g(x,y)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy max function:</strong> 
    $g(x,y) = \max_{z \in \Omega} f(x,z),$
where $\Omega$ is points reachable from $y$ by greedy path.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="our-greedy-min-max-equilibrium">Our greedy min-max equilibrium</h2>
<p>We use the greedy max function to define a new second-order notion of local optimality for min-max optimization, which we refer to as a greedy min-max equilibrium.
Roughly speaking, we say that $(x,y)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if 
1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$ (and hence the endpoint of a greedy path), and 
2) if $x$ is a local minimum of the greedy max function $g(\cdot,y)$.</p>

<p>In other words, $x$ is a local minimum of $\max_y f(\cdot, y)$ under the constraint that the maximum is computed only over the set of greedy paths starting at $y$.
Unfortunately, even if $f$ is smooth, the greedy max function may not be differentiable with respect to $x$ and may even be discontinuous.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2_grid_t.png" width="400"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2g_grid_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 3.</b> <i>Left:</i> If we change $x$ from one value $x$ to a very close value $\hat{x}$, the largest value of $f$ reachable by greedy path undergoes a discontinuous change.  <i>Right:</i>  This means the greedy max function $g(x,y)$ is discontinuous in $x$.</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>This creates a problem, since the definition of $\varepsilon$-local minimum only applies to smooth functions.</p>

<p>To solve this problem we would ideally like to smooth $g$ by convolution with a Gaussian.
Unfortunately, convolution can cause the local minima of a function to “shift”– a point which is a local minimum for $g$ may no longer be a local minimum for the convolved version of $g$ (to see why, try convolving the function $f(x) = x - 3x I(x\leq 0) + I(x \leq 0)$ with a Gaussian $N(0,\sigma^2)$ for any $\sigma&gt;0$).
To avoid this, we instead consider a “truncated” version of $g$, and then convolve this function in the $x$ variable with a Gaussian to obtain our smoothed version of $g$.</p>

<p>This allows us to define a notion of greedy min-max equilibrium.  We say that a point $(x^\star, y^\star)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if $y^\star$ is an approximate local maximum of $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, and $x^\star$ is an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of this smoothed version of $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Greedy min-max equilibrium:</b>
$(x^{\star}, y^{\star})$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if

 
where $S(x,y):= \mathrm{smooth}_x(\mathrm{truncate}(g(x, y))$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any point which is a local saddle point (talked about earlier) also satisifeis our equilibrium conditions. The converse, however, cannot be true as a local saddle point may not always exist. Further, for compactly supported convex-concave functions a point is a greedy min-max equilibrium (in an appropriate sense) if and only if it is a global min-max point. (See Section 7 and Appendix A respectively in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">our paper</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="greedy-min-max-equilibria-always-exist-and-can-be-found-efficiently">Greedy min-max equilibria always exist! (And can be found efficiently)</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> we show: A greedy min-max equilibrium is always guaranteed to exist provided that $f$ is uniformly bounded with Lipschitz Hessian. We do so by providing an algorithm which converges to a greedy min-max equilibrium, and, moreover, we show that it is able to do this in polynomial time from any initial point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Main theorem:</b> Suppose that we are given access to a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and to its gradient and Hessian.  And suppose that $f$ is unformly bounded by $b&gt;0$ and has $L$-Lipschitz Hessian.
Then given any initial point, our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-greedy min-max equilibrium $(x^\star,y^\star)$ of $f$ in $\mathrm{poly}(b, L, d, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of difficulties that our algorithm and proof must overcome:
One difficulty in designing an algorithm is that the greedy max function may be discontinuous. 
To find an approximate local minimum of a discontinuous function, our algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo hill climbing algorithm with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0408007">zeroth-order optimization version</a> of stochastic gradient descent.
Another difficulty is that, while one can easily compute a greedy path from any starting point, there may be many different greedy paths which end up at different local maxima.
Searching for the greedy path which leads to the local maximum point with the largest value of $f$ may be infeasible.
In other words the greedy max function $g$ may be intractable to compute.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/greedy_paths_no_axes_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 4.</b>There are many different greedy paths that start at the same point $A$.  They can end up at different local maxima ($B$, $D$), with different values of $f$.  In many cases it may be intractable to search over all these paths to compute the greedy max function.
 </div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To get around this problem, rather than computing the exact value of $g(x,y)$, we instead compute a lower bound $h(x,y)$ for the greedy max function. Since we are able to obtain this lower bound by computing only a <em>single</em> greedy path, it is much easier to compute than greedy max function.</p>

<p>In our paper, we prove that if 1) $x^\star$ is an approximate local minimum for the this lower bound $h(\cdot, y^\star)$, and  2) $y^\star$ is a an approximate local maximum for $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, then $x^\star$ is also an approximate local minimum for the greedy max $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.
This allows us to design an algorithm which obtains a greedy min-max point by minimizing the computationally tractable lower bound $h$, instead of the greedy max function which may be intractable to compute.</p>

<h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude</h2>

<p>In this post we have shown how to extend a notion of second-order equilibrium for minimization to min-max optimization which is guaranteed to exist for any function which is bounded and Lipschitz, with Lipschitz gradient and Hessian.
We have also shown that our algorithm is able to find this equilibrium in  polynomial time from any initial point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our results do not require any additional assumptions such as convexity, monotonicity, or sufficient bilinearity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an upcoming blog post we will show how one can use some of the ideas from here to obtain a new min-max optimization algorithm with applications to stably training GANs.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-094 |  Is it possible to improve Yao’s XOR lemma using reductions that exploit the efficiency of their oracle? | 

	Ronen Shaltiel</title>
    <summary>Yao's XOR lemma states that for every function $f:\set{0,1}^k \ar \set{0,1}$, if $f$ has hardness $2/3$ for $P/poly$ (meaning that for every circuit $C$ in $P/poly$, $\Pr[C(X)=f(X)] \le 2/3$ on a uniform input $X$), then the task of computing $f(X_1) \oplus \ldots \oplus f(X_t)$ for sufficiently large $t$ has hardness $\half +\epsilon$ for $P/poly$.

Known proofs of this lemma cannot achieve $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k^{\omega(1)}}$, and even for $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k}$, we do not know how to replace
$P/poly$ by AC$^0[\textsc{parity}]$ (the class of constant depth circuits with the gates $\set{\textsc{and,or,not,parity}}$ of unbounded fan-in).

Recently, Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola (FOCS 2018) (building on a sequence of earlier works) showed that these limitations cannot be circumvented by \emph{black-box reductions}. Namely, by reductions $\Red^{(\cdot)}$ that given oracle access to a function $D$ that violates the conclusion of Yao's XOR lemma, implement a circuit that violates the assumption of Yao's XOR lemma.

There are a few known reductions in the related literature on worst-case to average case reductions that are \emph{non-black box}. Specifically, the reductions of Gutfreund, Shaltiel and Ta Shma (Computational Complexity 2007) and  Hirahara (FOCS 2018)) are ``class reductions'' that are only guaranteed to succeed when given oracle access to an oracle $D$ from some efficient class of algorithms. These works seem to circumvent some black-box impossibility results.

In this paper we extend the previous limitations of Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola to class reductions, giving evidence that class reductions cannot yield the desired improvements in Yao's XOR lemma.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first limitation on reductions for hardness amplification that applies to class reductions.

Our technique imitates the previous lower bounds for black-box reductions, replacing the inefficient oracle used in that proof, with an efficient one that is based on limited independence, and developing tools to deal with the technical difficulties that arise following this replacement.</summary>

<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>This morning, like many others, I woke up to the terrible news that Scott Alexander—the man I call “the greatest Scott A. of the Internet”—has <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">deleted SlateStarCodex in its entirety</a>.  The reason, Scott explains, is that the <em>New York Times</em> was planning to run an article about SSC.  Even though the article was going to be <em>positive</em>, NYT decided that by policy, it would need to include Scott’s real surname (Alexander is his middle name).  Scott felt that revealing his name to the world would endanger himself and his psychiatry patients.  Taking down his entire blog was the only recourse that he saw.</p>



<p>The NYT writer, Cade Metz, was someone who I’d previously known and trusted from his reporting on Google’s quantum supremacy experiment.  So in recent weeks, I’d spent a couple hours on the phone with Cade, answering his questions about the rationality community, the history of my interactions with it, and why I thought SlateStarCodex spoke to so many readers.  Alas, when word got around the rationality community that Cade was writing a story, a huge panic arose that he was planning on some sort of <em>Gawker</em>-style hit piece or takedown.  Trying to tamp down the fire, I told Scott Alexander and others that I knew Cade, his intentions were good, he was only trying to understand the community, and everyone should help him by talking to him openly.</p>



<p>In a year of historic ironies, here’s another one: that it was the decent, reasonable, and well-meaning Cade Metz, rather than any of the SneerClubbers or Twitter-gangsters who despised Scott Alexander for sharing his honest thoughts on hot-button issues, who finally achieved the latter’s dark dream of exiling Scott from the public sphere.</p>



<p>The recent news had already been bad enough: Trump’s “temporary suspension” of J1 and H1B visas (which will deal a body blow to American universities this year, and to all the foreign scientists who planned to work at them), on top of the civil unrest, on top of the economic collapse, on top of the now-resurgent coronavirus.  But with no more SlateStarCodex, now I <em>really</em> feel like my world is coming to an end.</p>



<p>I’ve considered SSC to be the best blog on the Internet since not long after discovering it five years ago.  Of course my judgment is colored by one of the most notorious posts in SSC’s history (“Untitled”) being a ferocious defense of me, when thousands were attacking me and it felt like my life was finished.  But that’s merely what brought me there in the first place.  I stayed because of Scott’s insights about everything else, and because of the humor and humanity and craftsmanship of his prose.  Since then I had the privilege to become friends with Scott, not only virtually but in real life, and to meet dozens of others in the SSC community, in its Bay Area epicenter and elsewhere.</p>



<p>In my view, for SSC to be <em>permanently</em> deleted would be an intellectual loss on the scale of, let’s say, John Stuart Mill or Mark Twain burning their collected works.  That might sound like hyperbole, but not (I don’t think) to the tens of thousands who read Scott’s essays and fiction, particularly during their 2013-2016 heyday, and who went from casual enjoyment to growing admiration to the gradual recognition that they were experiencing, “live,” the works that future generations of teachers will assign their students when they cover the early twenty-first century.  The one thing that mitigates this tragedy is the hope that it will yet be reversed (and, of course, the fact that backups still exist in the bowels of the Internet).</p>



<p>When I discovered Scott Alexander in early 2015, the one issue that gave me pause was his strange insistence on maintaining pseudonymity, even as he was already then becoming more and more of a public figure.  In effect, Scott was trying to erect a firewall between his Internet persona and his personal and professional identities, and was <em>relying on the entire world’s goodwill</em> not to breach that firewall.  I thought to myself, “this can’t <em>possibly</em> last!  Scott simply writes too well to evade mainstream notice forever—and once he’s on the world’s radar, he’ll need to make a choice, about who he is and whether he’s ready to own his gifts to posterity under his real name.”  In retrospect, what astonishes me is that Scott has been able to maintain the “double life” for as long as he has!</p>



<p>In his takedown notice, Scott writes that it’s considered vitally important in psychiatry for patients to know almost nothing about their doctors, beyond their names and their areas of expertise.  That caused me to wonder: OK, but doesn’t the world already have enough psychiatrists who are ciphers to their patients?  Would it be so terrible to have one psychiatrist with a clear public persona—possibly even one who patients sought out <em>because</em> of his public persona, because his writings gave evidence that he’d have sympathy or insight about their conditions?  To become a psychiatrist, does one really need to take a lifelong vow of boringness—a vow never to do or say anything notable enough that one would be “outed” to one’s patients?  What would Freud, or Jung, or any of the other famous therapist-intellectuals of times past have thought about such a vow?</p>



<p>Scott also mentions that he’s gotten death threats, and harassing calls to his workplace, from people who hate him because of his blog (and who found his real name by sleuthing).  I wish I knew a solution to that.  For what it’s worth, my blogging has <em>also</em> earned me a death threat, and threats to sue me, and accusatory letters to the president of my university—although in my case, the worst threats came neither from Jew-hating neo-Nazis nor from nerd-bashing SJWs, but from crackpots enraged that I wouldn’t use my blog to credit their proof of P≠NP or their refutation of quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>When I started <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> back in 2005, I remember thinking: this is it.  From now on, the only secrets I’ll have in life will be ephemeral and inconsequential ones.  From this day on, every student in my class, every prospective employer, every woman who I ask on a date (I wasn’t married yet), can know whatever they want to know about my political sympathies, my deepest fears and insecurities, any of it, with a five-second Google search.  Am I ready for that?  I decided that I was—partly just because I‘ve never had the mental space to maintain multiple partitioned identities <em>anyway</em>, to remember what each one is or isn’t allowed to know and say!  I won’t pretend that this is the right decision for everyone, but it was my decision, and I stuck with it, and it wasn’t always easy but I’m still here and so evidently are you.</p>



<p>I’d be <em>overjoyed</em> if Scott Alexander were someday to reach a place in his life where he felt comfortable deciding similarly.  That way, not only could he enjoy the full acclaim that he’s earned for what he’s given to the world, but (much more importantly) his tens of thousands of fans would be able to continue benefitting from his insights.</p>



<p>For now, though, the brute fact is that Scott is obviously <em>not</em> comfortable making that choice.  That being so, it seems to me that, if the NYT was able to respect the pseudonymity of Banksy and many others who it’s reported on in the past, when revealing their real names would serve no public interest, then it should also be able to respect Scott Alexander’s pseudonymity.  Especially now that Scott has sent the most credible signal imaginable of how much he values that pseudonymity, a signal that astonished even me.  The world does not exist only to serve its rare geniuses, but surely it can make such trivial concessions to them.</p></div>
