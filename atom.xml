bounded clique-width. Several of these problems are polynomially solvable on a
hereditary graph class G if they are so on the atoms (graphs with no clique
cut-set) of G. Hence, we initiate a systematic study into boundedness of
clique-width of atoms of hereditary graph classes. A graph G is H-free if H is
not an induced subgraph of G, and G is (H_1, H_2)-free if it is both H_1-free
and H_2-free. A class of H-free graphs has bounded clique-width if and only if
its atoms have this property. This is no longer true for (H_1, H_2)-free graphs
as evidenced by one known example. We prove the existence of another such pair
(H_1, H_2) and classify the boundedness of (H_1, H_2)-free atoms for all but 22
cases.

    <title>Eliminating Intermediate Measurements in Space-Bounded Quantum Computation</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1591574400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Fefferman:Bill.html">Bill Fefferman</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Remscrim:Zachary.html">Zachary Remscrim</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03530">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A foundational result in the theory of quantum computation known as the
"principle of safe storage" shows that it is always possible to take a quantum
circuit and produce an equivalent circuit that makes all measurements at the
end of the computation. While this procedure is time efficient, meaning that it
does not introduce a large overhead in the number of gates, it uses extra
ancillary qubits and so is not generally space efficient. It is quite natural
to ask whether it is possible to defer measurements to the end of a quantum
computation without increasing the number of ancillary qubits.
</p>
<p>We give an affirmative answer to this question by exhibiting a procedure to
eliminate all intermediate measurements that is simultaneously space-efficient
and time-efficient. A key component of our approach, which may be of
independent interest, involves showing that the well-conditioned versions of
many standard linear-algebraic problems may be solved by a quantum computer in
less space than seems possible by a classical computer.

    <title>Detecting and Analyzing Mobility Hotspots using Surface Networks</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1591574400</feedworld_mtime>

dramatically over the past few decades. A persistent difficulty is summarizing
large collections of mobile objects. This paper develops methods for extracting
and analyzing hotspots or locations with relatively high levels of mobility
activity. We use kernel density estimation (KDE) to convert a large collection
of mobile objects into a smooth, continuous surface. We then develop a
topological algorithm to extract critical geometric features of the surface;
these include critical points (peaks, pits and passes) and critical lines
(ridgelines and course-lines). We connect the peaks and corresponding
ridgelines to produce a surface network that summarizes the topological
structure of the surface. We apply graph theoretic indices to analytically
characterize the surface and its changes over time. To illustrate our approach,
we apply the techniques to taxi cab data collected in Shanghai, China. We find
increases in the complexity of the hotspot spatial distribution during normal
activity hours in the late morning, afternoon and evening and a spike in the
connectivity of the hotspot spatial distribution in the morning as taxis
concentrate on servicing travel to work. These results match with scientific
and anecdotal knowledge about human activity patterns in the study area.

outages, sensors known as phasor measurement units can installed. Due to
implementation costs, it is desirable to minimize the number of sensors
deployed while ensuring that the grid can be effectively monitored. This
optimization problem motivates the graph theoretic power dominating set
problem. In this paper, we propose a novel integer program for identifying
minimum power dominating sets by formulating a set cover problem. This
problem's constraints correspond to neighborhoods of zero forcing forts; we
study their structural properties and show they can be separated, allowing the
proposed model to be solved via row generation. The proposed and existing
methods are compared in several computational experiments in which the proposed
method consistently exhibits an order of magnitude improvement in runtime
performance.

positive/negative opinion regarding a particular topic. In the $r$-threshold
(resp. $\alpha$-threshold) model, a node becomes black if at least $r$ of its
neighbors (resp. $\alpha$ fraction of its neighbors) are black, and white
otherwise. The $r$-monotone (resp. $\alpha$-monotone) model is the same as the
$r$-threshold (resp. $\alpha$-threshold) model, except that a black node
remains black forever.
</p>
<p>What is the number of rounds that the process needs to stabilize? How many
nodes must be black initially so that black color takes over or survives? Our
main goal in the present paper is to address these two questions

external resource, which is rented for a non-interrupted period. Jobs that need
this external resource are executed only when the external resource is
available. There is a cost associated with the scheduling of jobs and a cost
associated with the duration of the renting period of the external resource. We
look at three classes of problems with an external resource: a class of
problems where the renting period is budgeted and the scheduling cost needs to
be minimized, a class of problems where the scheduling cost is budgeted and the
renting period needs to be minimized, and a class of two-objective problems
where both, the renting period and the scheduling cost, are to be minimized. We
provide a thorough complexity analysis (NP-hardness proofs and
pseudo-polynomial algorithms) for different members of these three classes.

In this
paper, we study a problem of computing distance-generalized core decomposition
on a network. A distance-generalized core, also termed $(k, h)$-core, is a
maximal subgraph in which every vertex has at least $k$ other vertices at
distance no larger than $h$. The state-of-the-art algorithm for solving this
problem is based on a peeling technique which iteratively removes the vertex
(denoted by $v$) from the graph that has the smallest $h$-degree. The
$h$-degree of a vertex $v$ denotes the number of other vertices that are
reachable from $v$ within $h$ hops. Such a peeling algorithm, however, needs to
frequently recompute the $h$-degrees of $v$'s neighbors after deleting $v$,
which is typically very costly for a large $h$. To overcome this limitation, we
propose an efficient peeling algorithm based on a novel $h$-degree updating
technique. Instead of recomputing the $h$-degrees, our algorithm can
dynamically maintain the $h$-degrees for all vertices via exploring a very
small subgraph, after peeling a vertex. We show that such an $h$-degree
updating procedure can be efficiently implemented by an elegant bitmap
technique. In addition, we also propose a sampling-based algorithm and a
parallelization technique to further improve the efficiency. Finally, we
conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world graphs to evaluate our
algorithms. The results show that, when $h\ge 3$, our exact and sampling-based
algorithms can achieve up to $10\times$ and $100\times$ speedup over the
state-of-the-art algorithm, respectively.

reclaim area of an airport. The problem is originated by a real-life
application in Copenhagen airport. The objective is to construct a robust
schedule taking passenger and airline preferences into account. We consider a
number of business and fairness constraints, avoiding congestions, and ensuring
a good passenger flow. Robustness of the solutions is achieved by matching the
delivery time with the expected arrival time of passengers, and by adding
buffer time between two flights scheduled on the same belt. We denote this
problem as the Baggage Belt Assignment Problem (BBAP). We first derive a
general Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the problem. Then, we
propose a Branch-and-Price (B&amp;P) algorithm based on a reformulation of the ILP
model tackled by Column Generation. Our approach relies on an effective dynamic
programming algorithm for handling the pricing problems. We tested the proposed
algorithm on a set of real-life data from Copenhagen airport as well as on a
set of instances inspired by the real data. Our B&amp;P scheme outperforms a
commercial solver launched on the ILP formulation of the problem and is
effective in delivering high quality solutions in limited computational times,
making it possible its use in daily operations in medium-sized and large

    <title>From Checking to Inference: Actual Causality Computations as Optimization Problems</title>

Recent formal approaches,
proposed by Halpern and Pearl, have made this concept mature enough to be
amenable to automated reasoning. Actual causality is especially vital for
building accountable, explainable systems. Among other reasons, causality
reasoning is computationally hard due to the requirements of counterfactuality
and the minimality of causes. Previous approaches presented either inefficient
or restricted, and domain-specific, solutions to the problem of automating
causality reasoning. In this paper, we present a novel approach to formulate
different notions of causal reasoning, over binary acyclic models, as
optimization problems, based on quantifiable notions within counterfactual
computations. We contribute and compare two compact, non-trivial, and sound
integer linear programming (ILP) and Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) encodings
to check causality. Given a candidate cause, both approaches identify what a
minimal cause is. Also, we present an ILP encoding to infer causality without
requiring a candidate cause. We show that both notions are efficiently
automated. Using models with more than $8000$ variables, checking is computed
in a matter of seconds, with MaxSAT outperforming ILP in many cases. In
contrast, inference is computed in a matter of minutes.

closely related to the minimum graph bisection problem over certain random
graph models. In the stochastic block model distribution over networks with
community structure, a well-known semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of
the minimum bisection problem recovers the underlying communities whenever
possible. Motivated by their superior scalability, we study the theoretical
performance of linear programming (LP) relaxations of the minimum bisection
problem for the same random models. We show that unlike the SDP relaxation that
undergoes a phase transition in the logarithmic average-degree regime, the LP
relaxation exhibits a transition from recovery to non-recovery in the linear
average-degree regime. We show that in the logarithmic average-degree regime,
the LP relaxation fails in recovering the planted bisection with high
probability.

DFS-Tree, on the semi-external environment becomes a hot topic, because the
scales of the graphs grow rapidly which can hardly be hold in the main memory,
in the big data era. Existing semi-external DFS algorithms assume the main
memory could, at least, hold a spanning tree T of a graph G, and gradually
restructure T into a DFS-Tree, which is non-trivial. In this paper, we present
a comprehensive study of semi-external DFS problem, including the first
theoretical analysis of the main challenge of this problem, as far as we know.
Besides, we introduce a new semi-external DFS algorithm with an efficient edge
pruning principle, named EP-DFS. Unlike the traditional algorithms, we not only
focus on addressing such complex problem efficiently with less I/Os, but also
focus on that with simpler CPU calculation (Implementation-friendly) and less
random I/O access (key-to-efficiency). The former is based on our efficient
pruning principle; the latter is addressed by a lightweight index N+-index,
which is a compressed storage for a subset of the edges for G. The extensive
experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real graphs confirms that our
EP-DFS algorithm outperforms the existing techniques.

results. The existing hardness results focus on the network architecture, and
assume that the network's weights are arbitrary. A natural approach to settle
the discrepancy is to assume that the network's weights are "well-behaved" and
posses some generic properties that may allow efficient learning. This approach
is supported by the intuition that the weights in real-world networks are not
arbitrary, but exhibit some "random-like" properties with respect to some
"natural" distributions. We prove negative results in this regard, and show
that for depth-$2$ networks, and many "natural" weights distributions such as
the normal and the uniform distribution, most networks are hard to learn.
Namely, there is no efficient learning algorithm that is provably successful
for most weights, and every input distribution. It implies that there is no
generic property that holds with high probability in such random networks and
allows efficient learning.

for the represented data set. However, a learned Bloom filter may under-utilize
the model by not taking full advantage of the output. The learned Bloom filter
uses the output score by simply applying a threshold, with elements above the
threshold being interpreted as positives, and elements below the threshold
subject to further analysis independent of the output score (using a smaller
backup Bloom filter to prevent false negatives). While recent work has
suggested additional heuristic approaches to take better advantage of the
score, the results are only heuristic. Here, we instead frame the problem of
optimal model utilization as an optimization problem. We show that the
optimization problem can be effectively solved efficiently, yielding an
improved {partitioned learned Bloom filter}, which partitions the score space
and utilizes separate backup Bloom filters for each region. Experimental
results from both simulated and real-world datasets show significant
performance improvements from our optimization approach over both the original
learned Bloom filter constructions and previously proposed heuristic
improvements.

completion where the goal is to recover a low-rank tensor from sparse
observations of its entries. Existing algorithms are either heuristic without
provable guarantees, based on solving large semidefinite programs which are
impractical to run, or make strong assumptions such as requiring the factors to
be nearly orthogonal. In this paper we introduce a new variant of alternating
minimization, which in turn is inspired by understanding how the progress
measures that guide convergence of alternating minimization in the matrix
setting need to be adapted to the tensor setting. We show strong provable
guarantees, including showing that our algorithm converges linearly to the true
tensors even when the factors are highly correlated and can be implemented in
nearly linear time. Moreover our algorithm is also highly practical and we show
that we can complete third order tensors with a thousand dimensions from
observing a tiny fraction of its entries. In contrast, and somewhat
surprisingly, we show that the standard version of alternating minimization,
without our new twist, can converge at a drastically slower rate in practice.

<p><strong>One-Sided Error Testing of Monomials and Affine Subspaces</strong> by Oded Goldreich and Dana Ron (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/068/">ECCC</a>). This work focuses on one-sided testing of two kinds of problems (and their variants): <br/><span class="has-inline-color has-blue-color">1.</span> Testing Monomials: Suppose you are given a function \(f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\). Is \(f = \wedge_{i \in I} x_i\) (that is, is \(f\) a monotone monomial). <br/><span class="has-inline-color has-blue-color">2.</span> Testing Affine Subspaces: Consider the task of testing whether a \(f \colon \mathcal{F}^n \to \{0,1\}\) is the indicator of an \((n-k)\)-dimensional affine space for some \(k\) (where \(\mathcal{F}\) is a finite field).<br/></p>



<p>The paper shows that the general problem — the one in which the arity of the monomial (resp the co-dimension of the subspace) is not specified has one-sided query complexity \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)\). The same holds for testing whether the arity of the monomial is at most \(k\) (resp the co-dimension of the subspace is at most \(k\)). Finally, the exact problem which seeks to test whether the arity of the monomial is exactly \(k\) (resp the co-dimension of the space is exactly \(k\)) has query complexity \(\Omega(\log n)\). For two sided testers however, size oblivious testers are known for this problem. Thus, like the authors remark, two-sided error is inherent in the case of the exact version of the problem.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Sampling Arbitrary Subgraphs Exactly Uniformly in Sublinear Time</strong> by Hendrik Fichtenberger, Mingze Gao, Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01861v2">arXiv</a>). Readers of PT Review are no strangers to the problem of counting cliques in sublinear time (with a certain query model). Building on tools from [1], in [2], Eden-Ron-Seshadhri gave the first algorithms for counting number of copies \(K_r\) in a graph \(G\) to within a \((1 \pm \varepsilon)\) multiplicative factor. En route to this result, they also gave a procedure to sample cliques incident to some special set \(S \subseteq V(G)\). The query model in [2] allowed the following queries: a u.a.r vertex query, degree query, \(i^{th}\) neighbor query and a pair query which answers whether a pair \((u,v)\) forms an edge. The work under consideration shows a result which I personally find remarkable: given the additional ability to get a u.a.r edge sample, we can do the following. For any graph \(H\) we can obtain a uniformly random subgraph isomorphic to \(H\) in \(G\). Let that sink in: this work shows that you can sample \(H\) <em>exactly uniformly</em> from the graph \(G\).  </p>



<p><strong>Finding Planted Cliques in Sublinear Time</strong> by Jay Mardia, Hilal Asi, Kabir Aladin Chandrasekher (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12002">arXiv</a>). Planted Clique is a time honored problem in average case complexity. This classic problem asks the following: You are given a \(G \sim \mathcal{G}(n, 1/2)\). Suppose I select a subset of \(k\) vertices in this graph and put a clique on the subgraph they induce. In principle it is possible to recover the clique I planted if \(k &gt; (2 + \varepsilon) \log n\). But it seems you get polynomial time algorithms only when \(k \geq \Omega(\sqrt n)\) even after you throw SDPs at the problem. Moreover, so far, the algorithms which recover the planted \(k\)-clique were known to take \(\widetilde{O}(n^2)\) time. This work shows that you actually get algorithms which take time \(\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})\) if \(k \geq \Omega(\sqrt{n \log n})\). The key idea is to first obtain a “core” part of the clique of size \(O(\log n)\) in time \(\widetilde{O}(n^2/k)\). This is followed up with a clique completion routine where you mark all vertices connected to the entire core as being potentially in the clique. The paper also shows a conditional lower bound result which shows that given query access to adjacency matrix of the graph, a natural family of non-adaptive algorithms cannot recover a planted \(k\) clique in time \(o\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)^3\) (for \(k \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt n))\).</p>



<p><strong>A robust multi-dimensional sparse Fourier transform in the continuous setting</strong> by Yaonan Jin, Daogao Liu and Zhao Song (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06156">arXiv</a>).  Suppose you are given an unknown signal whose Fourier Spectrum is k-sparse (that is, there are at most k dominant Fourier Coefficients and all the others are zero or close to zero). Significant research effort has been devoted to learn these signals leading to works which study this problem for multi-dimensional discrete setting and in the one-dimensional continuous case. The \(d\)-dimensional continuous case \((d = \Theta(1))\) was largely unexplored. This work makes progress on this frontier by making some natural assumptions on the unknown signal. In particular, the paper assumes that the frequencies — which are vectors \(f_i’s \in R^d\) — are well separated and satisfy \(\|f_i – f_j\|_2 \leq \eta\) and that all \({f_i}_{i \in [k]} \subseteq [-F, F]^d\) sit inside a bounded box.<br/>The authors assume sample access to the signal in the sense that at any desired timestep \(\tau\), the algorithm can sample the signal’s value. With this setup, the authors show that all the dominant frequencies can be recovered with a \(O_d(k \cdot \log(F/\eta))\) samples by considering a relatively small time horizon.</p>



<p><strong>Extrapolating the profile of a finite population</strong> by Soham Jana, Yury Polyanskiy, Yihong Wu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10561">arXiv</a>). Consider the following setup. You are given a universe \(k\) balls. Ball come in up to \(k\) different colors. Say you \(\theta_j\) balls in color \(j\) for each \(j \in [k]\). One of the fundamental problems in statistics considers taking samples \(m\) balls from the universe and attempts estimating “population profile” (that is, the number of balls in each color). Historically, it is known that unless an overwhelming majority of the universe has been seen, one cannot estimate the empirical distribution of colors. This paper shows that in the sublinear regime, with \(m \geq \omega(k/\log k)\), it is possible to consistently estimate the population profile in total variation. And once you have a handle on the empirical distribution of the population, you can go ahead and learn lots of interesting label invariant properties of your universe (things like entropy, number of distinct elements etc). </p>

<p>(Edit added later)</p>



<p><strong>Testing Positive Semi-Definiteness via Random Submatrices</strong> by Ainesh Bakshi, Nadiia Chepurko, Rajesh Jayaram (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06441">arXiv</a>). Suppose I give you a PSD matrix \(A \in R^{n \times n}\). You know that all of its principle submatrices are also PSD. What if \(A\) was \(\varepsilon\)-far from the PSD cone (in a sense I will define soon)? What can you say about the eigenvalues of principle submatrices of \(A\) now? In this paper, the authors tackle precisely this question. The paper defines a matrix \(A\) to be \(\varepsilon\)-far in \(\ell_2^2\) distance from the PSD Cone if you have that \(\min_{B \geq 0: B \in R^{n \times n}}\|A – B\|_F^2 \geq \varepsilon n^2\). You are allowed to randomly sample a bunch of principle submatrices and check if they are PSD. Armed with this setup, the paper gives a non-adaptive one sided tester for this problem which makes \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^4)\) queries. The paper also supplements this result with a lower bound of \(\widetilde{\Omega}(1/\varepsilon^2)\) queries.</p>

John Gott III is an emeritus professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton. He was one of several independent inventors of the controversial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument">Doomsday</a> <a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=anthropic_principle/doomsday_argument">Argument</a> (DA). He may have been the first to think of it but the last to expound it in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/363315a0.epdf">paper</a> or presentation.</p>
<p>
Today we expound DA as a defense against thought experiments that require unreasonable lengths of time.</p>
<p>
Gott thought of the argument when he saw the Berlin Wall as a 22-year-old touring Berlin in 1969. He reasoned that his visit was a uniformly random event in the lifetime <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> of the wall. That assumption gave him a 75% likelihood that he was not observing the wall in the first quarter of its lifetime. Since the wall was then 8 years old, that became a 75% likelihood that the wall would not last beyond 1993. It came down in late 1989.</p>
<p>
The “Doomsday” name comes when one’s birthdate <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is regarded as a uniformly random sample from the sequence of all human births. If you are my age, <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is probably <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=F7CF2C002ED22C17F221BE1788C43A6E?doi=10.1.1.49.5899&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">closer</a> to ordinal 60 billion than 70 or 100 billion. We can then say we are 95% confident that we are not in the initial 5% of this sequence. That <em>entails</em> the sequence stopping before 1.2 trillion births. If our population levels off at 10 billion with 80 years’ life expectancy, that makes <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> extend no further than the year 12,000 AD. The upshot is that a longer <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> entails asserting that our random sample gave a point unusually <em>early</em> in the span. The purer form of DA also argues that <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is not unusually <em>late</em>, giving this picture:</p>

<p>This doubles the span of <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> allowed with 95% confidence while giving reason—at the time <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> occurs—to believe that the end is not imminent: at least about 1.75 billion more births will come after <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>.

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Debating DA </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The dependence on which observer is taken as the reference point <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is one shiftable parameter of the DA. If you are a preteen reader, then your own birth may be closer to ordinal 70 billion in the sequence, which becomes <em>your</em> reference point. You can then tack on another 2,000 years to <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/>. The earliest human cave painters may have been among the first 3 billion <em>Homo sapiens</em>. With regard to their reference point, <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> has already gone past their 95% limit. </p>
<p>
A more fundamental rebuff to DA comes from the equal reasonableness of an alternate uniformity assumption: that you are a uniformly random element of the set <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H}"/> of all <em>possible</em> human beings. Only a subset <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> of <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H}"/> will ever be born. The longer <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> is, the higher was your prior probability of belonging to <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. Thus the fact of your birth can be construed as weighting the odds toward longer <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> in a way that cancels out the short-<img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> reasoning of DA.</p>
<p>
Even when an instance of DA passes these objections, the inference remains controversial. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/22/predicting-when-pnp-is-resolved/">wrote</a> about DA last year in connection with estimating the lifespan of open problems remaining open. A clear <em>non</em>-instance is trying to apply DA to estimate the lifespan of the Covid-19 pandemic. We have all been going through the span together and <em>now</em> is not a uniformly random sample. </p>
<p>
The DA assumptions would however hold if an alien tourist with no prior knowledge of events dropped in on Earth today. The delicacy of the assumptions makes it significant to seek scenarios where DA firmly applies—and better, where the inference may be deemed <em>necessary</em> to preserve the validity of established modes of inference against extreme skeptical hypotheses. This is what we will try argue in regard to inferences of cheating at chess. </p>

</p><p/><h2> The 1-in-100,000 Question </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/the-problem-of-catching-chess-cheaters/">posted</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/littlewoods-law/">numerous</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/the-crown-game-affair/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/thirteen-sigma/">about</a> my statistical <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/london-calling/">chess</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/15/predicting-chess-and-horses/">model</a>, its giving judgments of odds against null hypotheses of fair play in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"><em>z</em>-scores</a>, and my <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/empirical-humility/">means</a> of <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/our-trip-to-monte-carlo/">validating</a> them. We will suppose for this argument that the modeling is true in the sense that the distribution of <em>z</em>-scores from testing honest players conforms to the standard normal distribution. </p>
<p>
Now let us talk about chess in the years B.C.—before Covid—when the game was played over-the-board (OTB) in-person across a table. Suppose I obtained a <em>z</em>-score of 4.265 from a test of one player in one tournament. I have chosen this number for all of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It corresponds to what I call “face-value odds” of 100,000-to-1 against the null hypothesis, as one can see from <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/experiments/analysis/zCalc.html">this</a> or any similar calculator. <p/>
</li><li>
It is close to my number from an actual case in the year 1 B.C., that is, last year. <p/>
</li><li>
It is also typical of <em>z</em>-scores I have been obtaining these past three months since chess went online, at the point where certain online platforms have made their own decisions to impose sanctions. Here I must add that the platforms’ cheating detection systems avail much information about the manner of play that often furnishes much greater statistical evidence, whereas my minimalist model uses only the record of the moves played in the games.
</li></ul>
<p>
Suppose there were no other relevant information about the case. How would one assess the significance of the <em>z</em>-score of 4.265? Here are two different ways of reasoning that—in the case of OTB chess—arrive at similar answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The Bayesian prior probability of cheating in OTB chess has been estimated between 1-in-10,000 and 1-in-5,000. Suppose the former, and consider a thought experiment in which 100,000 players are tested. For simplicity, let’s suppose all true instances—that is, cheating players—give above 4.265. We expect there to be ten of them, plus one <em>natural</em> occurrence of 4.265 or more. Thus the odds that our score represents a true positive are only 10-in-11. This is well short of the odds range usually needed to meet the standard of <em>comfortable satisfaction</em> used for example by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Thus the 4.265 datum alone should not be sufficient grounds for sanction. <p/>
</li><li>
Suppose there were a policy of sanction above a threshold of 4.25. The sum of playing fields in events held under auspices of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) each year exceeds 100,000. Thus we would expect to find at least one <em>z</em>-score over 4.265 per year by natural chance, whose sanctioning would be a serious human-rights error. FIDE cannot afford a rate of one such error per year. Thus it is insufficient for sanction.
</li></ol>
<p>
A 5.0 standard, however, gives a natural frequency of just over 1-in-3.5 million. The resulting error rate of once in 20-to-30 years might be acceptable in prospect. And the Bayesian argument based on a 0.0001 prior leaves about 350-to-1 odds against the null hypothesis, which is comfortably within the comfortable-satisfaction range as it has been applied. </p>
<p>
FIDE nevertheless has maintained a policy that statistical evidence must be accompanied by some other kind of evidence. If a player is caught looking at a chess position in a bathroom, or found to have a buzzing device or wires on his-or-her person, or signaling behavior is observed, then in fact much lower <em>z</em>-scores (to a threshold of 2.50, about 160-to-1 odds, in current FIDE regulations) are deemed to lend strong support to such evidence. </p>

I posted a similar <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/chess/fidelity/Golfers.html">rationale</a> on my own website in early 2012, where causal evidence is likened to the “black spot” in the novel <em>Treasure Island</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> One More Datum </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Now, however, suppose we have the 4.265 and one more piece of “evidence” that is pertinent but not as clearly causal. It could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The player wore a hat that covers the ears, or <p/>
</li><li>
An unusually bulky sweater (worn on a hot day), or <p/>
</li><li>
Unusual gestures or movements during the games.
</li></ul>
<p>
Say a search of the player turned up nothing, but this occurred after the sequence of games giving the 4.265, a day after the player had been put on notice of suspicion. So the extra information is not a black spot but instead a “grey spot.” What can we conclude now?</p>
<p>
The Bayesian argument seems to depend on judging how this information affects the prior probability of cheating. Does it make cheating a more likely hypothesis? We don’t actually know. Whereas the 1-in-10,000 global prior estimate was based on knowing dozens of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_chess#Incidents">cases</a> over the past decade, only a handful conformed to this level of indication—short of more obvious things like making frequent visits to the restroom or being seen with an ear adornment. The most we can say is that the datum is not irrelevant. An example of an irrelevant datum would be if the player were wearing neon green sneakers—not bulky, no wires, just a weird green.</p>
<p>
I would like, however, to argue that the player’s membership in a smaller sample <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> that is <em>pertinent</em> enhances the significance of the <em>z</em>-score. <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> must be defined by criteria that are not only independent of my statistical analysis of the games but also pertinent so as to avoid selection bias. What is needed to quantify this enhancement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
(a) to collect all (other) kinds of items on a par with the above—say ostentatious bracelets that could camouflage electronic indicators—and</p>
<p>(b) to establish that the frequency of players having <em>any</em> such accoutrement over the global mass of tournaments is at most, say, 1-in-100.<br/>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Now there are several equivalent ways to continue the reasoning. One is to say that since <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> is “at worst” independent, the face-value odds are amplified by a factor of at least 100. The Bayesian mitigation then still leaves about 1,000-to-1 odds against the null hypothesis. Another is to say that in any given year, the chance of seeing the conjunction of these two factors even if we tested everyone is at most 1-in-100. Most to my point, a policy of sanctioning in such cases would have a prospective error rate of once in 100 years. The conjoined error rate of that and sanctioning on 5.0 in isolation would be acceptable.</p>
<p>
A Bayesian defense attorney might still counter: Consider a thought experiment in which we test 100,000 such “bulky” players. We don’t have any new information on the prior rate of cheating by players in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. For all we know, it is still 1-in-10,000. Thus the same terms as before will apply: our experiment will expect to have 10 cheaters in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> plus the one natural false positive, leaving the odds only 10-to-1 as before. Put another way: without knowing the import of specializing to <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> on the likelihood of cheating, you can’t reach any further conclusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Doomsday to the Rescue </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The nub of rejecting this counter-argument is that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Because there are only about 1,000 players in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> per year, the thought experiment of testing 100,000 players in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> now takes 100 years. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the defense attorney is asserting that the mistaken false positive has occurred <em>unusually early</em> in this span. If this is the first year under consideration, then it is a uniformly random event in the first 1% of <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/>. By the same reasoning of DA, the odds of this are only 1-in-100. Compounded by the 10-1 odds against this particular score in the thought experiment being the false positive, we recover something near the 1,000-to-1 odds of the original reasoning.</p>
<p>
We might allow that we are not in the first year of “the cheating era” in chess. The thicket of high-profile cases with solid grounds for judgment goes back a little over 10 years. The factor from DA then goes down to 1-in-10. But this still leaves the overall odds about 100-to-1 against the null hypothesis, and that is commonly taken as an anchor point for the standard of comfortable satisfaction after all mitigating factors have been addressed. </p>
<p>
Thus I am casting the Doomsday interval argument as a defense against unreasonably long thought experiments. It restores a dimension of time that is ignored by the Bayesian objection. This dimension of time is correctly preserved in the analysis of the expected error rate from a policy of imposing sanctions under this <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>–<em>z</em> combination of circumstances.</p>
<p>
Is my line of reasoning valid? You can be the judge. If so, then it is a class of instances where DA is applied merely to <em>conserve</em> an inference of unlikelihood that was originally made by other means. This supports the validity of DA-type inference in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Online Chess and the Time Warp </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are now in the third month of “the online era” in chess. Even though online platforms can process many more kinds of information than I can avail from OTB play, my work has proved highly relevant for global early indications, second opinions, and transparent explanations. Alas, the sanction rate at the new featured tournaments has been well in excess of 1%. We hope this will come down as the playing pool—which has been greatly democratized in massive online events—wises up to the reality of getting caught.</p>
<p>
What I want to discuss here is how this brave new world flips the Bayesian reasoning in a way that may come on too strong <em>for the prosecution</em>, again by its indifference to the element of time. </p>
<p>
Take the 4.265 <em>z</em>-score with a <img alt="{1\%}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1\%}"/> prior. The face-value odds from the <em>z</em>-score are now mitigated only to 1-in-1,000. This gives 99.9% confidence in imposing a sanction. However, the <em>rate of errors</em> would be <em>higher</em> than once-per-year because more players total have been involved per tournament. The tournaments are played at faster Rapid and Blitz paces allowing eight or more games per day, whereas classic OTB tournaments feature one game per day, sometimes two, over a span of a week to ten days. </p>
<p>
This is also set against a vastly higher global sample size. Whereas the entire historical record of OTB chess represented by the ChessBase <a href="https://shop.chessbase.com/en/products/mega_database_2020?ref=RF32-OET9DCF5AK&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIu9P-4-_u6QIVGqSzCh0QQQsyEAAYASAAEgKcevD_BwE">Mega</a> database has yet to hit the 10 million games mark, the online platform <a href="https://lichess.org/">Lichess</a> has now hit 75 million games played <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">per month</a>. Adding in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Chess_Club">ICC</a> and <a href="https://www.chess.com/home">chess.com</a> and ChessBase’s and FIDE’s own servers yields an equation that recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm">Ps 90:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A thousand years of OTB are but a day that passes online. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
For online platforms in isolation, absent anything to distinguish one player’s set of games from any other’s (such as their belonging to a highest-profile tournament), this means that even a 5.0 standard is inadequate for sure judgment. At their volume, online sites can see deviations of by natural chance more than once per day. Thus they either tolerate a higher rate of errors or adopt a standard so high as to let many more guilty <a href="https://en.bab.la/dictionary/french-english/partie-d-echecs">parties</a> through the sieve. </p>
<p>
Such volume means all the more that one should hold a score of 4.265 as insufficient for judgment. This is despite the vastly higher Bayesian likelihood that a sanction based on that score is correct. The greater frequency of actual cheating does mean that the rate of error per positive reading declines, but the rate per absolute time, with regard to the fixed population of honest players, may matter more. This has accompanied deliberations of whether sanctions for online cheating must be given less permanent consequences in order to allow setting thresholds so that a high percentage of actual cheaters are flagged and the error rate can be tolerated.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Does this analysis square with you? Does it help in understanding controversies over the original Doomsday Argument’s paradigm?</p>
<p>
For another pass over the argument, suppose I get a <em>z</em>-score of 4.265 in a narrowly-defined event such as one country’s championship league. Does that limit the sample size, so that the score is more dispositive? The kind of reasoning in point (b) above, where we had to gather all possible indicators that would lead us to constrain the sample, would however mandate widening it at least to include other countries’ leagues. This is an aspect of the “look elsewhere” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-elsewhere_effect">effect</a> where the space of potential tests is widened even before actual tests are considered. Possibly it should be widened to include all tournaments with similar levels of players, in which case we are back to the “square 1” of the 1-in-100,000 section of this post. The point of the analysis of the extra datum about the player is that the sample expansion has an effective pre-defined limit.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="http://phys.lsu.edu/~jdowling/index_files/Dowling.jpg"/></figure>



<p>Today I woke up to the sad and shocking news that Jon Dowling (<a href="http://phys.lsu.edu/~jdowling/">homepage</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/jpdowling?lang=en">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Dowling">Wikipedia</a>)—physics professor at Louisiana State, guy who got the US government to invest in quantum computing back in the 90s, author of the popular book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Schr%C3%B6dingers-Killer-App-Jonathan-Dowling/dp/1439896739">Schrödinger’s Killer App: Race to Build the World’s First Quantum Computer</a>, investigator of BosonSampling among many other topics, owner of a “QUBIT” license plate, and one of my main competitors in the field of quantum computing humor—has passed away at age 65, apparently due to an aortic aneurysm.</p>



<p>Three months ago, right before covid shut down the world, the <em>last</em> travel I did was a seven-hour road trip from Austin to Baton Rouge, together with my postdoc <a href="https://twitter.com/a_rocchetto?lang=en">Andrea Rocchetto</a>, to deliver something called the <a href="https://calendar.lsu.edu/event/the_hearne_eminent_lecture_with_scott_aaronson#.Xtv1HDpKg2w">Hearne Lecture</a> at the Louisiana State physics department.  My topic (unsurprisingly) was Google’s quantum supremacy experiment.</p>



<p>I’d debated whether to cancel the trip, as flying already seemed too dangerous.  Dowling was the one who said “why not just drive here with one of your postdocs?”—which turned into a memorable experience for me and Andrea, complete with a personal tour of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">LIGO</a> and a visit to an alligator hatchery.  I had no inkling that it was the last time I’d ever see Jon Dowling, but am now super-glad that we made the visit.</p>



<p>At the dinner after my talk, Dowling was exactly the same as every other time I’d seen him: loud, piss-drunk, obnoxious, and hilarious.  He dominated the conversation with stories and jokes, referring in every other sentence either to his Irishness or my Jewishness.  His efforts to banter with the waitress, to elicit her deepest opinions about each appetizer and bottle of wine, were so over-the-top that I, sitting next to him, blushed, as if to say, “hey, I’m just the visitor here!  I don’t necessarily <em>endorse</em> this routine!”</p>



<p>But Dowling got away with it because, no matter how many taboos he violated per sentence, there was never any hint of malice in it.  He was an equal-opportunity offender, with his favorite target being himself.  He loved to talk, for example, about my pathological obsession with airy-fairy abstractions, like some kind of “polynomial hierarchy” that hopefully wouldn’t “collapse”—with the punchline being that he, the hardheaded laser physicist, then needed to learn what that meant for his own research.</p>



<p>The quantum computing community of the southern US, not to mention of Twitter and Facebook, and indeed of the entire world, will be poorer without this inimitable, louder-than-life presence.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>In solidarity with the current protests in the United States (<a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.shutdownstem.com/</a>), our speaker asked that the talk this coming Wednesday be postponed.</b></p>
<p><strong>Cliff’s talk has been rescheduled to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thursday, June 18th</span>; we will keep you updated in case of any further change. We would also take this opportunity to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">call the TCS community for feedback, and for suggestions and comments</a>. As a small team organizing this virtual seminar, we are continuously trying to improve and welcome your input.</strong></p>
<p>The next TCS+ talk<em> (and the last of the season!)</em> will take place this coming Wednesday, June 10th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC). <strong>Cliff Stein</strong> from Columbia University will speak about “<em>Parallel Approximate Undirected Shortest Paths Via Low Hop Emulators</em>” (abstract below).</p>
<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. Due to security concerns, <em>registration is required</em> to attend the interactive talk. (The link to the YouTube livestream will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk">on our<br/>
website</a> on the day of the talk, so people who did not sign up will still be able to watch the talk live.) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see &gt;the website.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: Although sequential algorithms with (nearly) optimal running time for finding shortest paths in undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights have been known for several decades, near-optimal parallel algorithms have turned out to be a much tougher challenge. In this talk, we present a <img alt="(1+\varepsilon)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2B%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="(1+\varepsilon)"/>-approximate parallel algorithm for computing shortest paths in undirected graphs, achieving polylog depth and near-linear work. All prior <img alt="(1+\varepsilon)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2B%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="(1+\varepsilon)"/>-algorithms with polylog depth perform at least superlinear work. Improving this long-standing upper bound obtained by Cohen (STOC’94) has been open for 25 years.</p>
<p>Our algorithm uses several new tools. Prior work uses hopsets to introduce shortcuts in the graph. We introduce a new notion that we call low hop emulators. We also introduce compressible preconditioners, which we use in conjunction with Serman’s framework (SODA ’17) for the uncapacitated minimum cost flow problem.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/catcs/">CATCS</a> will be hosting a virtual <strong>“Visioning Workshop”</strong> the <strong>week of </strong><strong>July 20</strong> in order to identify broad research themes within theoretical computer science (TCS) that have potential for a major impact in the future. The goals are similar to the <a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/visioning-workshop/">workshop of the same name</a> in 2008: to package these themes in a way that can be consumed by the general public, which we would deliver primarily to the Computing Community Consortium and others (e.g. funding agencies) to help them advocate for TCS.</p>



<p>While participation in the workshop is primarily through invitation, we have a few slots available for the broader community. If you are interested in participating, please see details of the application process below. The workshop will be organized according to area-wise breakout groups. Each breakout group will have 1-2 leads. Breakout groups will meet for 4-5 hours spread across several days and will be tasked with brainstorming ideas and preparing materials related to their topic. Leads are further expected to participate in plenary sessions held on Monday July 20 and Friday July 24 (4-5 hrs of additional time) where these materials will be discussed.</p>



<p>If you are interested in participating in the workshop, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9">this Google form</a> by <strong>Monday June 15</strong> ( <a href="https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9">https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9</a> ). On this form, applicants are asked to contribute one or two major results in the last 10 years whose significance can be explained in layperson terms, and one or two major challenges for theory whose significance can be explained in layperson terms. <em>[The results need not and generally will not be your own. They just should be easy-to-explain major results in your research area–Boaz] </em>These descriptions can be very brief. We will just use them to select participants and create breakout groups.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-085 |  Neural Networks with Small Weights and Depth-Separation Barriers | 

	Gal Vardi, 

	Ohad Shamir</title>
    <summary>In studying the expressiveness of neural networks, an important question is whether there are functions which can only be approximated by sufficiently deep networks, assuming their size is bounded. However, for constant depths, existing results are limited to depths $2$ and $3$, and achieving results for higher depths has been an important open question. In this paper, we focus on feedforward ReLU networks, and prove fundamental barriers to proving such results beyond depth $4$, by reduction to open problems and natural-proof barriers in circuit complexity. To show this, we study a seemingly unrelated problem of independent interest: Namely, whether there are polynomially-bounded functions which require super-polynomial weights in order to approximate with constant-depth neural networks. We provide a negative and constructive answer to that question, by showing that if a function can be approximated by a polynomially-sized, constant depth $k$ network with arbitrarily large weights, it can also be approximated by a polynomially-sized, depth $3k+3$ network, whose weights are polynomially bounded.</summary>

Alfred Whitehead was a logician and philosopher, who had a student of some note. The student was Bertrand Russell and together they wrote the famous three-volume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a>. It took several hundred pages to get to the result that <img alt="{1+1=2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B1%3D2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1+1=2}"/>.</p>

<p>
Amazing. </p>
<p>
Today I thought that discussing truth might be an interesting topic.<br/>
<span id="more-17119"/></p>
<p>
Whitehead said: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I like this quote. Whitehead was not the best lecturer, however. He gave the prestigious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifford_lectures">Gifford lectures</a> a year after the astronomer Arthur Eddington. As Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead">relates</a> quoting Victor Lowe: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Eddington was a marvellous popular lecturer who had enthralled an audience of 600 for his entire course. The same audience turned up to Whitehead’s first lecture but it was completely unintelligible, not merely to the world at large but to the elect. My father remarked to me afterwards that if he had not known Whitehead well he would have suspected that it was an imposter making it up as he went along … The audience at subsequent lectures was only about half a dozen in all. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Between the pandemic and the unrest in our cities there is debate about what is the “truth”. On cable news—CNN, MSNBC, FOX—one hears statements about the truth. You can also hear statements like “the experts know” or the “model” shows that this is true. Can math shed light on these discussions? What would Whitehead say?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> What is the Truth? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Mathematical truth is the one absolute we can count on—right? Math is precise in its own way, but does it yield truth? Not so clear.</p>
<p>
Whitehead’s proof that <img alt="{1+1=2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B1%3D2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1+1=2}"/> takes 100’s of pages; it may or may not increase your confidence. Here is a short “proof” that <img alt="{2=1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2=1}"/>:</p>

<p>
Math proofs are only as safe as two elements that are unavoidably social: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The care we use in applying our reasoning; and <p/>
</li><li>
The care we use in choosing our assumptions.
</li></ol>
<p>
In the above proof snippet, one step divided by <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> which is the source of the error that <img alt="{2=1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2=1}"/>. A more worrisome issue is reasoning from assumptions. Wrong assumptions are a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Who are the Experts? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert">expert</a> is: An expert is somebody who has a broad and deep competence in terms of knowledge, skill and experience through practice and education in a particular field. </p>
<p>
More amusing definitions are: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Mark Twain defined an expert as “an ordinary fellow from another town.” Will Rogers described an expert as “A man fifty miles from home with a briefcase.” Danish scientist and Nobel laureate Niels Bohr defined an expert as “A person that has made every possible mistake within his or her field.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I find the use of the term <i>expert</i> in regard to the pandemic at best puzzling. How can anyone be an expert when the current situation is unique? The last pandemic happened over a hundred years ago. Unfortunately Twain, Rogers, and Bohr are closer to being correct. The situation we find ourselves in today does not lend itself to being an expert. At least in my non-expert opinion.</p>

Yes there are people, for example, who are experts on various viral agents. But there is more we do not know about this agent that we do know. </p>
<ul>
<li>
Can you get the virus twice? <p/>
</li><li>
Can children get the virus? <p/>
</li><li>
Will a vaccine be possible? <p/>
</li><li>
Are there long-term affects even for those who survive? <p/>
</li><li>
And so on <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Where are the Models? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Models are created by experts, so you probably guess that I am not bullish on models. There are lots of models, for example, on the projection of how many will be infected, and how many will get seriously sick, and sadly how many will succumb. These models are based on various assumptions about how the virus works. Most of these assumptions are not proved in any sense. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I plan on saying more about truth in the future. Take care.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2020main.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> ITC 2020 program</a> is out, and this newborn looks healthy and strong! The program contains exciting new works in the area of Information-Theoretic Cryptography, confirming the importance of this new venue. </p>



<p>The PC, chaired by Daniel Wichs, also chose an amazing sequence of invited talks by Dachman-Soled, Natarajan, Jafar, Kol, Raz, and Vaikuntanathan, so this can also be a good opportunity to hear about the big recent developments in the area.</p>



<p><br/>The conference will be virtual this year. Participation is free but requires registration. We hope to see many of you there</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Scott’s foreword:</span></strong> <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~landau/">Zeph Landau</a>, a noted quantum computing theorist at UC Berkeley who’s worked closely with my adviser Umesh Vazirani, recently asked me if he could write a guest post about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_testing">pooled testing</a> for covid—an old idea that, Zeph argues, could play a crucial role in letting universities safely reopen this fall.  Seeing a small chance to do a great good, I readily agreed.</p>



<p>I should confess that I’m more … fatalistic than Zeph.  Not that I’m proud of it: I think that Zeph’s attitude is superior to mine.  But, like, I’m a theoretical computer scientist with zero expertise in medical testing or statistics, and <em>I</em> knew about pooled testing and its WWII origins—so imagine how thoroughly the actual experts must know the idea.  Just like they know all about variolation, and challenge trials, and copper fixtures, and UV light, and vitamin D supplements, and a dozen other possible tools against covid that future historians might ask why we didn’t try more.</p>



<p>As I’ve written before, I think our fundamental problem is not a lack of good ideas.  It’s that, outside of some isolated pockets of progress, our entire civilization no longer has the will (or ability? is there a difference?) to <em>implement</em> good ideas, or even really to try them.  For anything new that requires coordination, today there are just too many stakeholders who need to be brought on board, too many risks that need further study.  So I see Zeph, and anyone like him, as occupying a tragic position, a bit like that of an Aztec advocating the use of the wheel.  “Sure,” the Aztec elders might calmly reply, “wheeled transport is obvious enough that we’ve <em>all</em> considered it, but a moment’s thought reveals why, in our actually existing empire, it would be reckless, costly, and of at most marginal benefit…”</p>



<p>But I hope I’m wrong!  Better, I hope this post is the one that <em>proves</em> me wrong!  So without further ado, here’s…</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Zeph Landau’s Guest Post</span></strong></p>



<p>This post describes how every university could efficiently use modest testing resources to sensibly and extensively reduce the number of COVID-19 cases on their campus this fall.  It is meant as a call to action to the reader—because without a concerted effort to get the right people the necessary information and take immediate consequential action, a far worse alternative will be implemented almost everywhere. It is my sincere hope, that immediately after reading this post, you will take the following steps:</p>



<p>1) Figure out who is part of the reopening committee at your institution.</p>



<p>2) Find the right people and engage with them either as a fellow faculty member or, better yet, through a connection to get them good information about the information posted here.</p>



<p>3) Then stay engaged and keep pushing.  (See below for links to sample documents.)</p>



<p>OK, here we go.</p>



<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>



<p>How can we safely open a university or college campus such that we ensure that the number of cases does not drastically increase through the newfound interactions between the population?</p>



<p>One obvious, albeit impractical, solution to opening universities is to test everyone, everyday and isolate those that test positive quickly.  Unfortunately, we can’t do that due to costs ($100 per student per day) and availability of tests (on the order of 1000 tests per day at university testing labs).</p>



<p><em>Turns out there is a solution that uses drastically fewer tests and is commensurate in detecting an outbreak. It is called pooled screening which is a variant of pooled testing.</em></p>



<p><strong>The missing piece: early detection surveillance</strong></p>



<p>So how do we detect most contagious people quickly if we don’t have the resources to test everyone regularly?  The answer is by pooled testing—or to be more accurate (I’ll be clear about why this distinction is important later) <strong>pooled screening. </strong>The idea of pooling is old (attributed to Dorfman in the 40’s), simple, and has been used over and over in all kinds of scenarios. Pooled testing works by mixing samples together from a group and then administering a single test to the mixture. The test is designed to be sensitive enough to come up positive whenever <em>at least one</em> underlying sample is positive. Instead of testing each sample individually, you test the mixture, and then only those groups that test positive undergo a second round of testing of each individual sample. The individuals do not need to deliver a second sample; there is more than enough biological material for multiple tests per sample. When prevalence of a disease is low, most pools come up negative and you save a large amount of testing resources and time.  (For those more visually inclined, here is a one minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdC6irz_vys&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">video</a> on pooled testing.)</p>



<p>So what would a good early detection surveillance system look like?  Here is a reasonable and doable framework:</p>



<ul><li>Divide the campus population into three groups (call them A, B, and C).</li><li>Collect samples from each group twice a week, (e.g. Group A: M/Th, Group B: Tu/Fri, Group C Wed/Sat).</li><li>Pool test the samples in groups of 16.</li></ul>



<p>What kinds of resources would this use?</p>



<ul><li>For a 10,000 person campus, you’d need about 200 tests per day, 6 days a week.  The universities that have implemented testing labs typically have the capacity to do on the order of 1000 tests a day.</li><li>Assuming a rough cost of $100 a test (which should be an overestimate if they are using their own lab), it would amount to a $12 a student/ per week.  </li></ul>



<p>What would it accomplish?  It would quickly find outbreaks and new cases.  Under a few different assumptions of the time-course of the viral load in a person, <em>the expected time for detecting an infectious person in this scheme is under 3 days. </em>Those cases would then need to be fed into an existing contact tracing and quarantine protocol.  The result: an outbreak suppressed before it had a chance to get going.</p>



<p>So why aren’t we already doing this?  Read on…</p>



<p><strong>The fear of false negatives in pooling</strong></p>



<p>The general concern to implementing pooling  for Covid-19 in the US is two-fold. </p>



<ol><li>Without the creation of a better test the dilution effect will make the test less sensitive and in turn produce more false negatives.  </li><li>Even if you could solve the scientific sensitivity issue, navigating the process of getting government approval is a big barrier.</li></ol>



<p>Let’s take each of these concerns in turn.  The first is definitely a concern if the goal is 1:1 medical testing.  If a sample can be barely seen as positive in an individual test, then the risk is that the dilution effect when pooled with others will cause the group test to come out negative—giving a wrong result to the positive individual.  The word for this is “sensitivity”, i.e. if a test has 95% sensitivity it means that it’ll be accurate 95% of the time and produce a false negative 5% of the time.  So how sensitive would a pooled test be where you combined 16 individual samples into 1 and just ran it through an existing 1:1 test?  Lab data suggests it would have at least 70% sensitivity.  For 1:1 testing this is a non-starter, however, <strong>the goal is early detection </strong>of an outbreak, which is different and as we shall see, a 70% sensitivity does fine for this purpose.</p>



<p>Suppose you are doing early detection surveillance and imagine that an outbreak starts.  Imagine 3 people are infected.  Because you are sampling every 3 days, you’ll be getting at least 6 positive samples, and the chances that your 70% screen misses all 6 is tiny.  As soon as it catches one, a contact tracing protocol is initiated and the others will be found.</p>



<p>Another way to formulate what is going on is that you are trading sensitivity for speed (in the form of capacity and cost)—and that is a huge win.  The pooling and more frequent testing gives you that speed versus sensitivity tradeoff.  Sure, Lebron James (a 70% free-throw shooter) won’t make every free throw, but the chance that he misses 6 in a row is tiny.</p>



<p>For some, the above thinking is straightforward.  However, for the medical testing paradigm—where the goal is the most accurate test for an individual using the one sample you have—this point of view is foreign and in many ways almost out of reach.   </p>



<p>OK.  So with the concern of sensitivity laid to rest, what about the second concern?  That the regulations will get in the way.  It turns out that this isn’t an issue though again, it is slightly counterintuitive for those who work in medical testing.  The task is surveillance, and therefore the pooling test is being used as a screen (not a medical test): negative group tests are not reported to the individual as a negative test result.   Positive groups are deconvoluted for individual testing and results returned to the person who is positive individually.  HHS/CLIA has indicated there aren’t regulatory restrictions as long as you don’t return test results due to the pooled test.</p>



<p>It is important to re-emphasize that the above is for pooled screening (where negative results are not returned), which is in contrast to pooled testing (where negative pools are reported as negative test results for each individual).  For pooled testing, which has received a jump of coverage due to its use recently in Wuhan, there are large regulatory hurdles—the CDC is just formulating criteria for clearing those hurdles and the science looks like, for now, that most labs wouldn’t be able to get above pools of size 5 or so.</p>



<p><strong>How do you safely collect so many samples?</strong></p>



<p>A different direction of concern for early detection surveillance is the logistics and feasibility around collecting samples.  To date, the gold standard for sampling is a deep nasal swab that requires a professional to do it, requires PPE equipment, and is not a pleasant experience.  Using this method wouldn’t work logistically on campus.</p>



<p>However, there are other sampling techniques that allow people to self-sample, both in the form of a shallow nasal swab and saliva based techniques.  The stated concern is obvious: there is a worry that these sampling techniques are less sensitive.  There is some evidence that this is not the case (and even the opposite) but regardless, as has been discussed— in early detection surveillance it is OK to take a hit on sensitivity.  The system remains robust because of the frequent testing and the goal of detecting an outbreak, not every individual.</p>



<p>Being able to self-sample removes a huge bottleneck.  The picture is very much simplified.  Students/faculty/staff self-sample on their prescribed days (either in the presence of a medical professional or not depending on the approved protocol) and then drop off their sample at any of various drop-off stations on campus.  Those stations deliver the samples to the testing facility for pooling and testing.</p>



<p><strong>You can help to get this done</strong></p>



<p>Is what I’m describing a new idea?  As far as I can tell, the answer is both no and yes.  Pooled testing is in the news both as a theoretical idea and now as being implemented at some scale—in Israel, in a lab in Nebraska, and most recently in Wuhan.   But using pooling as a screen (not a medical test) within an early detection surveillance system that repeatedly screens everyone is, as far as I know, not in the discussion.</p>



<p>What seems clear is that right now—reopening committees and labs are perhaps aware of the idea of pooling but only as a theoretical idea of a technology that might be coming at some vague time in the future.  They are unaware that in the form of early detection surveillance, it is right in front of them ready to go.  They’d need a matter of weeks to convert a 1:1 lab into a lab that could handle both pooled screening and 1:1 testing (this <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069062v2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">lab</a> did it, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FVp55JAs2heqV5ktyGVVdoE-W_XTKmZgCWBy1SEoo-o/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">here</a> is a brief outline of the steps).  In the same timeline, they could develop a system for handling the logistics of sampling large numbers of people.</p>



<p><strong>And that is where each of you come in… </strong>  you can help get these ideas to the right people.  It needs to be done quickly because decisions are being made now as to what to do.  The right people are your colleagues—you just have to find out who they are and reach out to them personally.  You can find out who is on the reopening committee, you can track down faculty members in public health and microbiology.  They are often busy and might be skeptical of what an outsider can offer, but keep trying because my experience has been that if you keep at it and follow up, they will listen and be grateful for the information.</p>

    <title>TR20-084 |  Rate Amplification and Query-Efficient Distance Amplification for Locally Decodable Codes | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Tal Yankovitz</title>
    <summary>In a seminal work, Kopparty et al. (J. ACM 2017) constructed asymptotically good $n$-bit locally decodable codes (LDC) with $2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\log{n}})}$ queries. A key ingredient in their construction is a distance amplification procedure by Alon et al. (FOCS 1995) which amplifies the distance $\delta$ of a code to a constant at a  $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ multiplicative cost in query complexity. Given the pivotal role of the AEL distance amplification procedure in the state-of-the-art constructions of LDC as well as LCC and LTC, one is prompt to ask whether the $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ factor in query complexity can be reduced.

Our first contribution is a significantly improved distance amplification procedure for LDC. The cost is reduced from $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ to, roughly, the query complexity of a length $1/\delta$ asymptotically good LDC. We derive several applications, one of which allows us to convert a $q$-query LDC with extremely poor distance $\delta = n^{-(1-o(1))}$ to a constant distance LDC with $q^{\mathrm{poly}(\log\log{n})}$ queries. As another example, amplifying distance $\delta = 2^{-(\log{n})^\alpha}$, for any constant $\alpha &lt; 1$, will require $q^{O(\log\log\log{n})}$ queries using our procedure.

Motivated by the fruitfulness of distance amplification,  we investigate the natural question of rate amplification. Our second contribution is identifying a rich and natural class of LDC and devise two (incomparable) rate amplification procedures for it. These, however, deteriorate the distance, at which point a distance amplification procedure is invoked. Combined, the procedures convert any $q$-query LDC in our class, having rate $\rho$ and, say, constant distance, to an asymptotically good LDC with $q^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\rho)}$ queries.</summary>

    <title>How to handle grades during the Pandemic</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In March many Colleges sent students home and the rest of the semester was online. This was quite disruptive for the students. Schools, quite reasonably, wanted to make it less traumatic for students.<br/>
<br/>
So what to do about grades? There are two issues. I state the options I have heard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ISSUE ONE  If P/F How to Got About it?<br/>
<br/>
1) Grade as usual.<br/>
<br/>
2) Make all classes P/F.<br/>
<br/>
PRO: Much less pressure on students.<br/>
<br/>
CON: Might be demoralizing for the good students.<br/>
<br/>
3) Make all classes P/F but allow students to opt for letter grades BUT they must decide before the last day of class. Hence teachers must post cutoffs before the final is graded<br/>
<br/>
CON: Complicated and puts (a) teachers in an awkward position of having to post cutoffs before the final, and (b) puts students in an awkward position of having to predict how well they would do.<br/>
<br/>
CON: A student can blow off a final knowing they will still get a D (passing) in the course.<br/>
<br/>
PRO: Good students can still get their A's<br/>
<br/>
CAVEAT: A transcript might look very strange. Say I was looking at a graduate school applicant and I see<br/>
<br/>
Operating Systems: A<br/>
<br/>
Theory of Computation: P<br/>
<br/>
I would likely assume that the Theory course the student got a C. And that might be unfair.<br/>
<br/>
3) Make all classes P/F but allow students to opt for letter grades AFTER seeing their letter grades. <br/>
<br/>
PRO: Less complicated an awkard<br/>
<br/>
PRO: A students blah blah<br/>
<br/>
CAVEAT above still applies.<br/>
<br/>
ISSUE TWO If P/F what about a D in the major<br/>
<br/>
At UMCP COMP SCI (and I expect other depts)<br/>
<br/>
a D is a passing grade for the University<br/>
<br/>
but<br/>
<br/>
a D is not a passing grade for the Major.<br/>
<br/>
So if a s CS Major gets a D in Discrete Math that does not count for the major--- they have to take it over again.<br/>
<br/>
But if classes are P/F what do do about that.<br/>
<br/>
Options<br/>
<br/>
1) Students have to take classes in their major for a letter grade.<br/>
<br/>
CON: The whole point of the P/F is to relieve pressure on the students in these hard times.<br/>
<br/>
PRO: None.<br/>
<br/>
2) Students taking a course in their major who get a D will still get a P on the transcript but will be told that they have to take the class over again.<br/>
<br/>
3) Do nothing, but tell the students<br/>
<br/>
IF you got a D in a course in your major and you are taking a sequel, STUDY HARD OVER THE SUMMER!<br/>
<br/>
4) Do nothing, but tell the teachers<br/>
<br/>
Students in the Fall may have a weak background. Just teach the bare minimum of what they need for the major.<br/>
<br/>
(Could do both 3 and 4)<br/>
<br/>
SO- what is your school doing and how is it working?</div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Today, I interrupt the news of the rapid disintegration of the United States of America, on every possible front at once (medical, economic, social…), to bring you something far more important: a long-planned <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/06/01/99-scott-aaronson-on-complexity-computation-and-quantum-gravity/">two-hour podcast</a>, where theoretical physicist and longtime friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/">Sean Carroll</a> interviews yours truly about complexity theory!  Here’s Sean’s description of this historic event:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There are some problems for which it’s very hard to find the answer, but very easy to check the answer if someone gives it to you. At least, we think there are such problems; whether or not they really exist is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P vs NP problem</a>, and actually proving it will win you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems">a million dollars</a>. This kind of question falls under the rubric of “computational complexity theory,” which formalizes how hard it is to computationally attack a well-posed problem. Scott Aaronson is one of the world’s leading thinkers in computational complexity, especially the wrinkles that enter once we consider quantum computers as well as classical ones. We talk about how we quantify complexity, and how that relates to ideas as disparate as creativity, knowledge vs. proof, and what all this has to do with black holes and quantum gravity.</p></blockquote>



<p>So, OK, I guess I should also comment on the national disintegration thing.  As someone who was once himself the victim of a crazy police overreaction (albeit, trivial compared to what African-Americans regularly deal with), I was moved by the scenes of police chiefs in several American towns taking off their helmets and joining protesters to cheers.  Not only is that a deeply moral thing to do, but it serves a practical purpose of quickly defusing the protests.  Right now, of course, is an <em>even worse time than usual</em> for chaos in the streets, with a lethal virus still spreading that doesn’t care whether people are congregating for good or for ill.  If rational discussion of policy still matters, I support the current push to end the “qualified immunity” doctrine, end the provision of military training and equipment to police, and generally spur the nation’s police to rein in their psychopath minority.</p></div>

<p>For the last year, I have been co organizing a <a href="https://mltheory.org/#talks">theory of machine learning seminar</a> at Harvard. Following the format of our prior Harvard/MSR/MIT theory reading group, these have been extended blackboard talks with plenty of audience interaction.</p>



<p>Following COVID-19, the last three talks in the semester (by Moritz Hardt,  Zico Kolter, and Anima Anandkumar)  were given virtually. Frankly, I was at first unsure whether these seminars can work in the virtual format but was pleasantly surprised. Talks have been very interactive, with plenty of audience participation in the chat channel. In fact, the virtual format has some <em>advantages </em>over physical talks. Sometimes a question will be asked and answered by a co-author over chat, without the speaker needing to interrupt the talk.</p>



<p>Since the seminars were so successful, we decided to continue holding them over the summer. We have an exciting line up of confirmed speakers, and more will come soon. See <a href="https://mltheory.org/#talks">our webpage</a> for more details, which also contains a google calendar and a mailing list you can sign up for to get the Zoom link.</p>
