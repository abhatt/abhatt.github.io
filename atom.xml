    <title>Random projections for high-dimensional curves</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Psarros:Ioannis.html">Ioannis Psarros</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rohde:Dennis.html">Dennis Rohde</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07442">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Modern time series analysis requires the ability to handle datasets that are
inherently high-dimensional; examples include applications in climatology,
where measurements from numerous sensors must be taken into account, or
inventory tracking of large shops, where the dimension is defined by the number
of tracked items. The standard way to mitigate computational issues arising
from the high-dimensionality of the data is by applying some dimension
reduction technique that preserves the structural properties of the ambient
space. The dissimilarity between two time series is often measured by
``discrete'' notions of distance, e.g. the dynamic time warping, or the
discrete Fr\'echet distance, or simply the Euclidean distance. Since all these
distance functions are computed directly on the points of a time series, they
are sensitive to different sampling rates or gaps. The continuous Fr\'echet
distance offers a popular alternative which aims to alleviate this by taking
into account all points on the polygonal curve obtained by linearly
interpolating between any two consecutive points in a sequence.
</p>
<p>We study the ability of random projections \`a la Johnson and Lindenstrauss
to preserve the continuous Fr\'echet distance of polygonal curves by
effectively reducing the dimension. In particular, we show that one can reduce
the dimension to $O(\epsilon^{-2} \log N)$, where $N$ is the total number of
input points while preserving the continuous Fr\'echet distance between any two
determined polygonal curves within a factor of $1\pm \epsilon$. We conclude
with applications on clustering.

    <title>A tight quasi-polynomial bound for Global Label Min-Cut</title>

Souza <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07426">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study a generalization of the classic Global Min-Cut problem, called
Global Label Min-Cut (or sometimes Global Hedge Min-Cut): the edges of the
input (multi)graph are labeled (or partitioned into color classes or hedges),
and removing all edges of the same label (color or from the same hedge) costs
one. The problem asks to disconnect the graph at minimum cost.
</p>
<p>While the $st$-cut version of the problem is known to be NP-hard, the above
global cut version is known to admit a quasi-polynomial randomized $n^{O(\log
\mathrm{OPT})}$-time algorithm due to Ghaffari, Karger, and Panigrahi [SODA
2017]. They consider this as ``strong evidence that this problem is in P''. We
show that this is actually not the case. We complete the study of the
complexity of the Global Label Min-Cut problem by showing that the
quasi-polynomial running time is probably optimal: We show that the existence
of an algorithm with running time $(np)^{o(\log n/ (\log \log n)^2)}$ would
contradict the Exponential Time Hypothesis, where $n$ is the number of
vertices, and $p$ is the number of labels in the input. The key step for the
lower bound is a proof that Global Label Min-Cut is W[1]-hard when
parameterized by the number of uncut labels. In other words, the problem is
difficult in the regime where almost all labels need to be cut to disconnect
the graph. To turn this lower bound into a quasi-polynomial-time lower bound,
we also needed to revisit the framework due to Marx [Theory Comput. 2010] of
proving lower bounds assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis through the Subgraph
Isomorphism problem parameterized by the number of edges of the pattern. Here,
we provide an alternative simplified proof of the hardness of this problem that
is more versatile with respect to the choice of the regimes of the parameters.

    <title>Fixed-parameter tractability of Directed Multicut with three terminal pairs parameterized by the size of the cutset: twin-width meets flow-augmentation</title>

three terminal pairs (with a randomized algorithm). This problem, given a
directed graph $G$, pairs of vertices (called terminals) $(s_1,t_1)$,
$(s_2,t_2)$, and $(s_3,t_3)$, and an integer $k$, asks to find a set of at most
$k$ non-terminal vertices in $G$ that intersect all $s_1t_1$-paths, all
$s_2t_2$-paths, and all $s_3t_3$-paths. The parameterized complexity of this
case has been open since Chitnis, Cygan, Hajiaghayi, and Marx proved
fixed-parameter tractability of the 2-terminal-pairs case at SODA 2012, and
Pilipczuk and Wahlstr\"{o}m proved the W[1]-hardness of the 4-terminal-pairs
case at SODA 2016.
</p>
<p>On the technical side, we use two recent developments in parameterized
algorithms. Using the technique of directed flow-augmentation [Kim, Kratsch,
Pilipczuk, Wahlstr\"{o}m, STOC 2022] we cast the problem as a CSP problem with
few variables and constraints over a large ordered domain.We observe that this
problem can be in turn encoded as an FO model-checking task over a structure
consisting of a few 0-1 matrices. We look at this problem through the lenses of
twin-width, a recently introduced structural parameter [Bonnet, Kim,
Thomass\'{e}, Watrigant, FOCS 2020]: By a recent characterization [Bonnet,
Giocanti, Ossona de Mendes, Simon, Thomass\'{e}, Toru\'{n}czyk, STOC 2022] the
said FO model-checking task can be done in FPT time if the said matrices have
bounded grid rank. To complete the proof, we show an irrelevant vertex rule: If
any of the matrices in the said encoding has a large grid minor, a vertex
corresponding to the ``middle'' box in the grid minor can be proclaimed
irrelevant -- not contained in the sought solution -- and thus reduced.

of a given formula $F$ over a fixed, finite Boolean constraint language
$\Gamma$, with or without weights. More precisely, for each finite Boolean
constraint language $\Gamma$, we consider the following two problems. In Min
SAT$(\Gamma)$, the input is a formula $F$ over $\Gamma$ and an integer $k$, and
the task is to find an assignment $\alpha \colon V(F) \to \{0,1\}$ that
satisfies all but at most $k$ constraints of $F$, or determine that no such
assignment exists. In Weighted Min SAT$(\Gamma$), the input additionally
contains a weight function $w \colon F \to \mathbb{Z}_+$ and an integer $W$,
and the task is to find an assignment $\alpha$ such that (1) $\alpha$ satisfies
all but at most $k$ constraints of $F$, and (2) the total weight of the
violated constraints is at most $W$. We give a complete dichotomy for the
fixed-parameter tractability of these problems: We show that for every Boolean
constraint language $\Gamma$, either Weighted Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is FPT; or
Weighted Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is W[1]-hard but Min SAT$(\Gamma)$ is FPT; or Min
SAT$(\Gamma)$ is W[1]-hard. This generalizes recent work of Kim et al. (SODA
2021) which did not consider weighted problems, and only considered languages
$\Gamma$ that cannot express implications $(u \to v)$ (as is used to, e.g.,
model digraph cut problems). Our result generalizes and subsumes multiple
previous results, including the FPT algorithms for Weighted Almost 2-SAT,
weighted and unweighted $\ell$-Chain SAT, and Coupled Min-Cut, as well as
weighted and directed versions of the latter. The main tool used in our
algorithms is the recently developed method of directed flow-augmentation (Kim
et al., STOC 2022).

problems (CSPs) when the constraints arrive in a random order. We show that
there exists a CSP, namely $\textsf{Max-DICUT}$, for which random ordering
makes a provable difference. Whereas a $4/9 \approx 0.445$ approximation of
$\textsf{DICUT}$ requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space with adversarial ordering,
we show that with random ordering of constraints there exists a
$0.48$-approximation algorithm that only needs $O(\log n)$ space. We also give
new algorithms for $\textsf{Max-DICUT}$ in variants of the adversarial ordering
setting. Specifically, we give a two-pass $O(\log n)$ space
$0.48$-approximation algorithm for general graphs and a single-pass
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ space $0.48$-approximation algorithm for bounded degree
graphs.
</p>
<p>On the negative side, we prove that CSPs where the satisfying assignments of
the constraints support a one-wise independent distribution require
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-space for any non-trivial approximation, even when the
constraints are randomly ordered. This was previously known only for
adversarially ordered constraints. Extending the results to randomly ordered
constraints requires switching the hard instances from a union of random
matchings to simple Erd\"os-Renyi random (hyper)graphs and extending tools that
can perform Fourier analysis on such instances.
</p>
<p>The only CSP to have been considered previously with random ordering is
$\textsf{Max-CUT}$ where the ordering is not known to change the
approximability. Specifically it is known to be as hard to approximate with
random ordering as with adversarial ordering, for $o(\sqrt{n})$ space
algorithms. Our results show a richer variety of possibilities and motivate
further study of CSPs with randomly ordered constraints.

    <title>TR22-104 |  On One-Sided Testing Affine Subspaces | 

	Nader Bshouty</title>
    <summary>We study the query complexity of one-sided $\epsilon$-testing the class of Boolean functions $f:F^n\to \{0,1\}$ that describe affine subspaces and Boolean functions that describe axis-parallel affine subspaces, where $F$ is any finite field. We give a polynomial-time $\epsilon$-testers that ask $\tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ queries. This improves the query complexity $\tilde O(|F|/\epsilon)$ in~[16]. 

We then show that any one-sided $\epsilon$-tester with proximity parameter $\epsilon&lt;1/|F|^d$ for the class of Boolean functions that describe $(n-d)$-dimensional affine subspaces and Boolean functions that describe axis-parallel $(n-d)$-dimensional affine subspaces must make at least
$\Omega(1/\epsilon+|F|^{d-1}\log n)$ and $\Omega(1/\epsilon+|F|^{d-1}n)$ queries, respectively.
This improves the lower bound $\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$  that is proved in~[16] for $F=GF(2)$. We also give  testers for those classes with query complexity that almost match the lower bounds.</summary>

<p>
Karen Donde is the Chair of <a href="https://complexityexhibition.org/">Complexity 2022</a>, which is being held this month in Knoxville, Tennessee. This is not the same as the <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/Archive/2022/fullsite/">Computational Complexity 2022</a> (CCC22) conference, which is being held <b>in-person</b> at the University of Pennsylvania this <b>Wednesday, July 20</b>, through <b>Saturday, July 23</b>. The Knoxville event is not about computer science, nor dynamical nor biological complexity. It is about the art of weaving complex patterns in textiles by hand.</p>
<p>
Today we collect pointers to the papers at CCC22 after saying something separate about weaving and proofs.</p>
<p>
Unlike CCC22, the Knoxville exhibition is also <a href="https://complexityexhibition.org/all-works/">open online</a>. Here is a detail from the Complex Weaver first prize <a href="https://complexityexhibition.org/melanie-olde-morphology-i/">winner</a>, an example of three-dimensional weaving:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/18/complexity-2022/complexweavingprize/" rel="attachment wp-att-20242"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-20242" height="270" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ComplexWeavingPrize.jpg?resize=250%2C270&amp;ssl=1" width="250"/></a></p>
<p>
Like CCC22, the Knoxville event has a program committee. It consists of <a href="http://www.juliehedges.co.uk/">Julie Hedges</a>, <a href="https://www.spadystudios.com/">Robyn Spady</a>, and <a href="https://www.bettyvera.com/">Betty Vera</a>. Also like CCC22, it has a steering committee. Besides Donde, the committee consists of <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MargepyeTextiles?ref=profile_header">Margaret Dugger</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/dyen2weave/">Diane Smith</a>, <a href="https://wovenful.com/an-interview-with-sarah-fortin/">Sarah Fortin</a>, <a href="https://pikespeakweavers.org/member-galleries/nggallery/member-galleries/susan-bowman">Susan Bowman</a>, <a href="https://newworldtextiles.com/about/">Eileen Hallman</a>, <a href="https://www.woodlandsgallerync.com/artists/pat-brown">Pat Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/katiedoanhandweaver/">Katie Doan</a>, <a href="https://www.weavingschool.com/Geri.html">Geri Forkner</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathy-mccarthy-42347828/">Cathy McCarthy</a>, <a href="http://www.spinningforth.com/perso/perso.html">Ruth MacGregor</a>, and <a href="https://weavingspace.co.uk/#About-Weaving-Space">Cally Booker</a>. The gender imbalance is more extreme than for CCC22 or what we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/11/13/popl-2022-et-tu-brute/">noted</a> last fall for POPL22 (also see end of <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/11/24/best-to-dean-mynatt/">this</a>). Oh well.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Weaving Into Theory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Karen Donde also writes a <a href="https://karen63615.wixsite.com/karendondeblog">blog</a>, <em>Speaking of Weaving</em>. The blog has numerous technical how-to articles. In some places they verge on mathematical theory. </p>
<p>
There are more express connections between mathematics and weaving. The mathematics teacher <a href="http://www.patrickhonner.com/about.html">Patrick Honner</a> has a <a href="https://mrhonner.com/weaving">page</a> of posts on weaving. He was featured in an <a href="https://naturalmath.com/2012/07/weaving-mathematics/">article</a> “Weaving your way through mathematics” by the mathematics educator Maria Droujkova. See also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Breul3cnW9s">video</a> on weaving and the mathematics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph">Spirograph</a> patterns.</p>
<p>
On the computing theory side, connections to cellular automata are shown in a 2017 <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Complexity-of-Braids,-Cables,-and-Weaves-with-Holden/5b83e108623548c8b073a1e96b00d027eefb197e">paper</a> by Joshua Holden. There is also a recent <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3411764.3445750">paper</a> from CMU’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute on “Enabling Personal Computational Handweaving with a Low-Cost Jacquard Loom.” </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Weaving Into Proofs </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our association to weaving was really motivated, however, by an <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-do-mathematicians-know-their-proofs-are-correct-20220713/">article</a> last Wednesday by Steven Strogatz, a Cornell mathematician and extraordinary popularizer whom I (Ken) have known since we were undergraduates together at Princeton. The article interviews the Harvard mathematician Melanie Matchett Wood and is titled, “How Do Mathematicians Know Their Proofs Are Correct?”</p>
<p>
We have written about proofs and the social issue of verification <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/06/13/sorting-and-proving/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/23/hilberts-lost-problem/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/12/10/the-future-of-mathematics/">recently</a>. But this article goes into a more particular topic that we tried to get at in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/09/09/a-challenge-from-dyson/">series</a> of <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/06/06/is-this-a-proof-2/">posts</a> in <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/10/11/more-on-testing-dysons-conjecture/">2014</a>. This is about whether probabilistic modeling—not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_method">Probabilistic Method</a> which is airtight—can give confidence in conjectures that is tantamount to proof.</p>
<p>
Strogatz’s interview leads off with a reference to a 2019 <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/where-proof-evidence-and-imagination-intersect-in-math-20190314/">article</a> for <em>Quanta</em> titled, “Where Proof, Evidence, and Imagination Intersect.” That article is by the same Patrick Honner whom we just mentioned for weaving, and gives caveats of how bias and unrecognized implicit constraints can creep into models, so as to invalidate them. </p>
<p>
Wood begins with basic “coinflip” random models of primes—such as mentioned in the above-listed posts—and fixes on a bias-revealing model that we also covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2016/03/26/bias-in-the-primes/">here</a>. She then describes how they incrementally build rules for adjusting coin weights to compensate for biases introduced by small-number cases: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “So the model is something that starts with this coin-flipping model, but then it’s modified by all these other rules, and all the other things that we know about the primes. And once you put all of those things that we do know into the model, you then ask [it] well, do you see, infinitely often, coins coming up prime just 2 apart? And the model tells you, oh, yes, we do see that. In fact, we see it at this very particular rate we can give you a formula for. And then … you see that the model gives you a very accurate prediction for the number of pairs of twin primes you’ll find as you go along. And so then you think, you know, maybe this model knows what it’s talking about.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
In response to Strogatz noting that the accuracy must be judged by long computer runs, Wood is quick to emphasize that the rules given to the model are determined manually:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “But for building this model and coming up with the formula that the model gives. You know, that’s done by hand, essentially, by mathematicians thinking about the model and figuring out with it. … [A]t some point, the computer stops. You know, there’s only so much computing power. But that formula that you would get, that the model would give you, that you could prove is true, again, about this model coin-flipping situation, that formula will keep going. You can put bigger and bigger numbers into that formula, much bigger than your computer could ever, ever compute with.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Proof of the Loom? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Wood goes on to describe <em>universality</em> in probability theory as signifying “that there are certain kinds of machines that if you put in a lot of random inputs, you can predict the output.” She gives as a bellwether example how the Central Limit Theorem creates such a universal machine for the bell curve. Regardless of an unknown distribution <em>D</em>, if you take means of samples from <em>D</em>, then the bell curve gives progressively—and provably—more accurate predictions of your outputs. Strogatz catches the warp and asks whether “somehow we’re getting the idea of universality to show up in number theory? Or am I dreaming?” Her peroration is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “[W]hat my collaborators and I work on is trying to make that kind of dream a reality so that, that some of these puzzling questions about numbers that we don’t know the answer to, maybe we could understand that there are patterns that come out, like a bell curve, like a normal distribution, that we can prove came out of the machine even if we don’t know what mysteries were put in.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
So she is building a machine that takes rules as input—like Jacquard cards for a loom—and produces patterns that are analyzable. We use the computational success of the machine to judge how well universality has taken hold—as theoretically it must—and generate proofs from formulas based on the <em>a-priori</em> predicted outputs using the rules input thus far. </p>
<p>
This is like building a loom for weaving proofs—where, however, there is still the question of confidence in how well the patterns obtained match reality. Such doubt notwithstanding, the process may also augment non-linear ways of evaluating claimed proofs of the kind we discussed <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/06/13/proof-checking-not-line-by-line/">here</a> and recently debated <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/10/discussion-about-proving-again/">here</a>.</p>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Yung-Chung Chiu, Kai-Yuan Lai, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Lu:Hsueh=I.html">Hsueh-I Lu</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07613">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Various classes of induced subgraphs are involved in the deepest results of
graph theory and graph algorithms. A prominent example concerns the {\em
perfection} of $G$ that the chromatic number of each induced subgraph $H$ of
$G$ equals the clique number of $H$. The seminal Strong Perfect Graph Theorem
confirms that the perfection of $G$ can be determined by detecting odd holes in
$G$ and its complement. Chudnovsky et al. show in 2005 an $O(n^9)$ algorithm
for recognizing perfect graphs, which can be implemented to run in
$O(n^{6+\omega})$ time for the exponent $\omega&lt;2.373$ of square-matrix
multiplication. We show the following improved algorithms.
</p>
<p>1. The tractability of detecting odd holes was open for decades until the
major breakthrough of Chudnovsky et al. in 2020. Their $O(n^9)$ algorithm is
later implemented by Lai et al. to run in $O(n^8)$ time, leading to the best
formerly known algorithm for recognizing perfect graphs. Our first result is an
$O(n^7)$ algorithm for detecting odd holes, implying an $O(n^7)$ algorithm for
recognizing perfect graphs.
</p>
<p>2. Chudnovsky et al. extend in 2021 the $O(n^9)$ algorithms for detecting odd
holes (2020) and recognizing perfect graphs (2005) into the first polynomial
algorithm for obtaining a shortest odd hole, which runs in $O(n^{14})$ time. We
reduce the time for finding a shortest odd hole to $O(n^{13})$.
</p>
<p>3. Conforti et al. show in 1997 the first polynomial algorithm for detecting
even holes, running in about $O(n^{40})$ time. It then takes a line of
intensive efforts in the literature to bring down the complexity to
$O(n^{31})$, $O(n^{19})$, $O(n^{11})$, and finally $O(n^9)$. On the other hand,
the tractability of finding a shortest even hole has been open for 16 years
until the very recent $O(n^{31})$ algorithm of Cheong and Lu in 2022. We
improve the time of finding a shortest even hole to $O(n^{23})$.

    <title>Dynamic Algorithms for Maximum Matching Size</title>

This is a
well-studied problem, known to admit several update-time/approximation
trade-offs. For instance, it is known how to maintain a 1/2-approximate
matching in (polylog n) time or a $2/3$-approximate matching in $O(\sqrt{n})$
time, where $n$ is the number of vertices. Improving either of these bounds has
been a long-standing open problem.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that when the goal is to maintain just the size of the
matching instead of its edge-set, then these bounds can indeed be improved. We
give algorithms that maintain
</p>
<p>* a .501-approximation in (polylog n) update-time for general graphs,
</p>
<p>* a .534-approximation in (polylog n) update-time for bipartite graphs, and
</p>
<p>* a $(\frac{2}{3} + \Omega(1))$-approximation in $O(\sqrt{n})$ update-time
for bipartite graphs.

    <title>Generalized Wake-Up: Amortized Shared Memory Lower Bounds for Linearizable Data Structures</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1658102400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Siddhartha Visveswara Jayanti <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07561">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this work, we define the generalized wake-up problem, $GWU(s)$, for a
shared memory asynchronous system with $n$ processes. Informally, the problem,
which is parametrized by an increasing sequence $s = s_1,\ldots,s_p$, asks that
at least $n - i + 1$ processes identify that at least $s_i$ other processes
have "woken up" and taken at least one step for each $1 \le i \le n$. We prove
that any solution to $GWU(s)$ that uses read/write/compare-and-swap variables
requires at least $\Omega\left(\sum_{i = 1}^n \log s_i \right)$ steps to solve.
</p>
<p>The generalized wake-up lower bound serves as a technique for proving lower
bounds on the amortized complexities of operations on many linearizable
concurrent data types through reductions. We illustrate this with several
examples: (1) We show an $\Omega(\log n)$ amortized lower bound on the
complexity of implementing counters and {\em fetch-and-increment} objects which
match the complexities of the algorithms given by Jayanti and Ellen &amp; Woelfel;
the lower bound even extends to a significantly relaxed version of the object.
(2) We show an $\Omega(\log n)$ amortized lower bound on the complexity of the
pop, dequeue, and deleteMin operations of a concurrent stack, queue, and
priority queue respectively that hold even if the data type definitions are
significantly relaxed; (3) In another paper, we have shown an
$\Omega(\log\log(n \ell/m))$ amortized lower bound on the complexity of
operations on a union-find object of size $\ell$ (when $m$ operations are
performed).

    <title>Dynamic Algorithms for Packing-Covering LPs via Multiplicative Weight Updates</title>

updates and we need to maintain an approximately optimal solution. Recently,
significant attention (e.g., [Gupta et al. STOC'17; Arar et al. ICALP'18, Wajc
STOC'20]) has been devoted to the study of special cases of dynamic packing and
covering LPs, such as the dynamic fractional matching and set cover problems.
But until now, there is no non-trivial dynamic algorithm for general packing
and covering LPs.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we settle the complexity of dynamic packing and covering LPs,
up to a polylogarithmic factor in update time. More precisely, in the partially
dynamic setting (where updates can either only relax or only restrict the
feasible region), we give near-optimal deterministic $\epsilon$-approximation
algorithms with polylogarithmic amortized update time. Then, we show that both
partially dynamic updates and amortized update time are necessary; without any
of these conditions, the trivial algorithm that recomputes the solution from
scratch after every update is essentially the best possible, assuming SETH.
</p>
<p>To obtain our results, we initiate a systematic study of the multiplicative
weights update (MWU) method in the dynamic setting. As by-products of our
techniques, we also obtain the first online $(1+\epsilon)$-competitive
algorithms for both covering and packing LPs with polylogarithmic recourse, and
the first streaming algorithms for covering and packing LPs with linear space
and polylogarithmic passes.

    <title>Matching Patterns with Variables Under Edit Distance</title>

We say that
$\alpha$ matches a word $w$, consisting only of terminal letters, if $w$ can be
obtained by replacing the variables of $\alpha$ by terminal words. The matching
problem, i.e., deciding whether a given pattern matches a given word, was
heavily investigated: it is NP-complete in general, but can be solved
efficiently for classes of patterns with restricted structure. If we are
interested in what is the minimum Hamming distance between $w$ and any word $u$
obtained by replacing the variables of $\alpha$ by terminal words (so matching
under Hamming distance), one can devise efficient algorithms and matching
conditional lower bounds for the class of regular patterns (in which no
variable occurs twice), as well as for classes of patterns where we allow
unbounded repetitions of variables, but restrict the structure of the pattern,
i.e., the way the occurrences of different variables can be interleaved.
Moreover, under Hamming distance, if a variable occurs more than once and its
occurrences can be interleaved arbitrarily with those of other variables, even
if each of these occurs just once, the matching problem is intractable. In this
paper, we consider the problem of matching patterns with variables under edit
distance. We still obtain efficient algorithms and matching conditional lower
bounds for the class of regular patterns, but show that the problem becomes, in
this case, intractable already for unary patterns, consisting of repeated
occurrences of a single variable interleaved with terminals.

problems about finding paths in undirected graphs, where the length of the path
could be unbounded in the parameter. The first application of our method is as
follows.
</p>
<p>We give a randomized algorithm, that given a colored $n$-vertex undirected
graph, vertices $s$ and $t$, and an integer $k$, finds an $(s,t)$-path
containing at least $k$ different colors in time $2^k n^{O(1)}$. This is the
first FPT algorithm for this problem, and it generalizes the algorithm of
Bj\"orklund, Husfeldt, and Taslaman [SODA 2012] on finding a path through $k$
specified vertices. It also implies the first $2^k n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm for
finding an $(s,t)$-path of length at least $k$.
</p>
<p>Our method yields FPT algorithms for even more general problems. For example,
we consider the problem where the input consists of an $n$-vertex undirected
graph $G$, a matroid $M$ whose elements correspond to the vertices of $G$ and
which is represented over a finite field of order $q$, a positive integer
weight function on the vertices of $G$, two sets of vertices $S,T \subseteq
V(G)$, and integers $p,k,w$, and the task is to find $p$ vertex-disjoint paths
from $S$ to $T$ so that the union of the vertices of these paths contains an
independent set of $M$ of cardinality $k$ and weight $w$, while minimizing the
sum of the lengths of the paths. We give a $2^{p+O(k^2 \log (q+k))} n^{O(1)} w$
time randomized algorithm for this problem.

the size of the maximum matching of a graph undergoing edge insertions and
deletions with approximation ratio strictly better than $2$. Specifically, we
obtain a $1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\epsilon\approx 1.707+\epsilon$ approximation in
bipartite graphs and a $1.973+\epsilon$ approximation in general graphs. We
thus answer in the affirmative the major open question first posed in the
influential work of Onak and Rubinfeld (STOC'10) and repeatedly asked in the
dynamic graph algorithms literature. Our randomized algorithms also work
against an adaptive adversary and guarantee worst-case polylog update time,
both w.h.p.

<p>Our algorithms are based on simulating new two-pass streaming matching
algorithms in the dynamic setting. Our key new idea is to invoke the recent
sublinear-time matching algorithm of Behnezhad (FOCS'21) in a white-box manner
to efficiently simulate the second pass of our streaming algorithms, while
bypassing the well-known vertex-update barrier.

Tensor Train, Tensor Ring, Tucker, and PEPS decompositions. We approximate $A$
by a binary tree network $T'$ with $O(q)$ cores, such that the dimension on
each edge of this network is at most $\widetilde{O}(k^{O(dt)} \cdot
q/\varepsilon)$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of $G$ and $t$ is its
treewidth, such that $\|A - T'\|_F^2 \leq (1 + \varepsilon) \|A - T\|_F^2$. The
running time of our algorithm is $O(q \cdot \text{nnz}(A)) + n \cdot
\text{poly}(k^{dt}q/\varepsilon)$, where $\text{nnz}(A)$ is the number of
nonzero entries of $A$. Our algorithm is based on a new dimensionality
reduction technique for tensor decomposition which may be of independent
interest.
</p>
<p>We also develop fixed-parameter tractable $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithms for Tensor Train and Tucker decompositions, improving the running
time of Song, Woodruff and Zhong (SODA, 2019) and avoiding the use of generic
polynomial system solvers. We show that our algorithms have a nearly optimal
dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ assuming that there is no $O(1)$-approximation
algorithm for the $2 \to 4$ norm with better running time than brute force.
Finally, we give additional results for Tucker decomposition with robust loss
functions, and fixed-parameter tractable CP decomposition.

    <title>Exact Flow Sparsification Requires Unbounded Size</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1658102400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Krauthgamer:Robert.html">Robert Krauthgamer</a>, Ron Mosenzon <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07363">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given a large edge-capacitated network $G$ and a subset of $k$ vertices
called terminals, an (exact) flow sparsifier is a small network $G'$ that
preserves (exactly) all multicommodity flows that can be routed between the
terminals. Flow sparsifiers were introduced by Leighton and Moitra [STOC 2010],
and have been studied and used in many algorithmic contexts.
</p>
<p>A fundamental question that remained open for over a decade, asks whether
every $k$-terminal network admits an exact flow sparsifier whose size is
bounded by some function $f(k)$ (regardless of the size of $G$ or its
capacities). We resolve this question in the negative by proving that there
exist $6$-terminal networks $G$ whose flow sparsifiers $G'$ must have
arbitrarily large size. This unboundedness is perhaps surprising, since the
analogous sparsification that preserves all terminal cuts (called exact cut
sparsifier or mimicking network) admits sparsifiers of size $f_0(k)\leq
2^{2^k}$ [Hagerup, Katajainen, Nishimura, and Ragde, JCSS 1998].
</p>
<p>We prove our results by analyzing the set of all feasible demands in the
network, known as the demand polytope. We identify an invariant of this
polytope, essentially the slope of certain facets, that can be made arbitrarily
large even for $k=6$, and implies an explicit lower bound on the size of the
network. We further use this technique to answer, again in the negative, an
open question of Seymour [JCTB 2015] regarding flow-sparsification that uses
only contractions and preserves the infeasibility of one demand vector.

systems. At the core, we develop a framework for such proofs (building on a
result of Tsukiji and Hagiwara and a framework for motion planning through
gadgets), showing that any system that can implement three basic gadgets is
PSPACE-complete. We then apply this framework to four different systems,
showing its versatility. First, we prove that Deterministic Constraint Logic is
PSPACE-complete, fixing an error in a previous argument from 2008. Second, we
give a new PSPACE-hardness proof for the reversible `billiard ball' model of
Fredkin and Toffoli from 40 years ago, newly establishing hardness when only
two balls move at once. Third, we prove PSPACE-completeness of zero-player
motion planning with any reversible deterministic interacting $k$-tunnel gadget
and a `rotate clockwise' gadget (a zero-player analog of branching hallways).
Fourth, we give simpler proofs that zero-player motion planning is
PSPACE-complete with just a single gadget, the 3-spinner. These results should
in turn make it even easier to prove PSPACE-hardness of other reversible
deterministic systems.

    <title>TR22-103 |  Almost Chor--Goldreich Sources and Adversarial Random Walks | 

	Dean Doron, 

	Dana Moshkovitz, 

	Justin Oh, 

	David Zuckerman</title>
    <summary>A Chor--Goldreich (CG) source [CG88] is a sequence of random variables  $X = X_1 \circ \ldots \circ X_t$, each $X_i \sim \{0,1 \{^d$, such that each $X_i$ has $\delta d$ min-entropy for some constant $\delta &gt; 0$, even conditioned on any fixing of $X_1 \circ \ldots \circ X_{i-1}$. We typically think of $d$ as constant. We extend this notion in several ways, and most notably allow each $X_i$ to be only $\gamma$-close to having $\delta d$ min entropy.

Studying such almost CG sources allows us to achieve pseudorandomness results which were not known to hold even for standard CG sources, and even for the weaker model of Santha--Vazirani sources [SV86]. We construct a deterministic condenser that on input $X$, outputs a distribution which is close to having constant entropy gap, namely a distribution $Z \sim \{0,1 \}^m$ for $m \approx \delta dt$ with min-entropy $m-O(1)$. 

Our new primitive readily implies fast simulation results:

*	We can simulate $\mathbf{BPP}$ using almost CG sources with constant multiplicative slowdown.
*	When the randomized algorithm has small failure probability, we can simulate it using almost CG sources with no multiplicative slowdown. This result extends to randomized protocols as well, and any setting in which we cannot simply cycle over all seeds, and a ``one-shot'' simulation is needed.

Moreover, our framework is flexible enough to work even when the $X_i$-s only have Shannon entropy rather than min-entropy, and in some cases, even when a few $X_i$-s are completely damaged.

Our main technical contribution is a novel analysis of random walks which may be of independent interest. We analyze walks with adversarially correlated steps, each step being entropy-deficient, on good enough lossless expanders. We prove that such walks (or certain interleaved walks on two expanders), starting from a fixed vertex and walking according to $X_1\circ \ldots \circ X_t$, accumulate most of the entropy in $X$.</summary>

    <title>Implicit Regularization in Hierarchical Tensor Factorization and Deep Convolutional Networks</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The ability of large neural networks to generalize is commonly believed to stem from an implicit regularization — a tendency of gradient-based optimization towards predictors of low complexity.
A lot of effort has gone into theoretically formalizing this intuition.
Tackling modern neural networks head-on can be quite difficult, so existing analyses often focus on simplified models as stepping stones.
Among these, matrix and tensor factorizations have attracted significant attention due to their correspondence to linear neural networks and certain shallow non-linear convolutional networks, respectively. 
Specifically, they were shown to exhibit an implicit tendency towards low matrix and tensor ranks, respectively.</p>

<p>This post overviews a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">ICML 2022 paper</a> with <a href="https://asafmaman101.github.io/">Asaf Maman</a> and <a href="http://www.cohennadav.com/">Nadav Cohen</a>, in which we draw closer to practical deep learning by analyzing <em>hierarchical tensor factorization</em>, a model equivalent to certain <em>deep non-linear</em> convolutional networks. 
We find that, analogously to matrix and tensor factorizations, the implicit regularization in hierarchical tensor factorization strives to lower a notion of rank (called hierarchical tensor rank).
This turns out to have surprising implications on the origin of locality in convolutional networks, inspiring a practical method (explicit regularization scheme) for improving their performance on tasks with long-range dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="background-matrix-and-tensor-factorizations">Background: Matrix and Tensor Factorizations</h2>

<p>To put our work into context, let us briefly go over existing dynamical characterizations of implicit regularization in matrix and tensor factorizations.
In both cases they suggest an incremental learning process that leads to low rank solutions (for respective notions of rank). We will then see how these characterizations transfer to the considerably richer hierarchical tensor factorization.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-factorization-incremental-matrix-rank-learning">Matrix factorization: Incremental matrix rank learning</h3>
<p><em>Matrix factorization</em> is arguably the most extensively studied model in the context of implicit regularization. 
Indeed, it was already discussed in four previous posts (<a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2021/07/08/imp-reg-tf/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">2</a>, <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/07/10/trajectories-linear-nets/">3</a>, <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/06/03/trajectories/">4</a>), but for completeness we will present it once more. 
Consider the task of minimizing a loss $\mathcal{L}_M : \mathbb{R}^{D, D’} \to \mathbb{R}$ over matrices, e.g. $\mathcal{L}_M$ can be a matrix completion loss — mean squared error over observed entries from some ground truth matrix. 
Matrix factorization refers to parameterizing the solution $W_M \in \mathbb{R}^{D, D’}$ as a product of $L$ matrices, and minimizing the resulting objective using <em>gradient descent (GD)</em>:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
\[
    \min\nolimits_{W^{(1)}, \ldots, W^{(L)}} \mathcal{L}_M \big ( W_M \big ) := \mathcal{L}_M \big ( W^{(1)} \cdots W^{(L)} \big ) ~.
\]
</div>
<p>Essentially, matrix factorization amounts to applying a linear neural network (fully connected neural network with no non-linearity) for minimizing $\mathcal{L}_M$. 
We can explicitly constrain the matrix rank of $W_M$ by limiting the shared dimensions of the weight matrices $\{ W^{(l)} \}_l$. However, from an implicit regularization standpoint, the most interesting case is where rank is unconstrained. 
In this case there is no explicit regularization, and the kind of solution we get is determined implicitly by the parameterization and the optimization algorithm.</p>

<p>Although it was initially conjectured that GD (with small initialization and step size) over matrix factorization minimizes a norm (see the seminal work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09280">Gunasekar et al. 2017</a>), recent evidence points towards an implicit matrix rank minimization (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13655">Arora et al. 2019</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13262">Gidel et al. 2019</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06398">Razin &amp; Cohen 2020</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13772">Chou et al. 2020</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09839">Li et al. 2021</a>).
In particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13655">Arora et al. 2019</a> characterized the dynamics of $W_M$’s singular values throughout optimization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (informal; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13655">Arora et al. 2019</a>):</strong>
Gradient flow (GD with infinitesimal step size) over matrix factorization initialized near zero leads the $r$’th singular value of $W_M$, denoted $\sigma_M^{(r)} (t)$, to evolve by:
[ 
    \color{brown}{\frac{d}{dt} \sigma_M^{(r)} (t) \propto \sigma_M^{(r)} (t)^{2 - 2/L}} ~.
]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As can be seen from the theorem above, singular values evolve at a rate proportional to their size exponentiated by $2 - 2 / L$. This means that they are subject to a momentum-like effect, by which they move slower when small and faster when large. 
When initializing near the origin (as commonly done in practice), we therefore expect singular values to progress slowly at first, and then, upon reaching a certain threshold, to quickly rise until convergence. 
<strong>These dynamics create an incremental learning process that promotes solutions with few large singular values and many small ones, i.e. low matrix rank solutions</strong>.
In their paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13655">Arora et al. 2019</a> support this qualitative explanation through theoretical illustrations and empirical evaluations. 
For example, the following plot reproduces one of their experiments:</p>

</div>
<p><br/>
We note that the incremental matrix rank learning phenomenon was later on used to prove exact matrix rank minimization, under certain technical conditions (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09839">Li et al. 2021</a>).</p>

<h3 id="tensor-factorization-incremental-tensor-rank-learning">Tensor factorization: Incremental tensor rank learning</h3>

<p>Despite the significant interest in matrix factorization, as a theoretical surrogate for deep learning its practical relevance is rather limited. 
It corresponds to linear neural networks, and thus misses non-linearity — a crucial aspect of modern neural networks.
As was mentioned in a <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2021/07/08/imp-reg-tf/">previous post</a>, by moving from matrix (two-dimensional array) to tensor (multi-dimensional array) factorizations it is possible to address this limitation.</p>

<p>A classical scheme for factorizing tensors, named CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), parameterizes a tensor as a sum of outer products (for more details on this scheme, see <a href="http://www.kolda.net/publication/TensorReview.pdf">this excellent survey</a>).
Given a loss $\mathcal{L}_T : \mathbb{R}^{D_1, \ldots, D_N} \to \mathbb{R}$ over $N$-dimensional tensors, e.g. $\mathcal{L}_T$ can be a tensor completion loss, we simply refer by <em>tensor factorization</em> to parameterizing the solution $\mathcal{W}_T \in \mathbb{R}^{D_1, \ldots, D_N}$ as a CP factorization, and minimizing the resulting objective via GD:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
\[
    \min\nolimits_{ \{ \mathbf{w}_r^n \}_{r , n} } \mathcal{L}_T \big ( \mathcal{W}_T \big ) := \mathcal{L}_T \big (  {\textstyle \sum}_{r = 1}^R \mathbf{w}_r^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N \big) ~.
\]
</div>
<p>Each term $\mathbf{w}_r^{(1)} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^{(N)}$ in the sum is called a <em>component</em>, and $\otimes$ stands for outer product.
The concept of rank naturally extends from matrices to tensors.
For a given tensor $\mathcal{W}$, its <em>tensor rank</em> is defined to be the minimal number of components (i.e. of outer product summands) $R$ required for CP parameterization to express it.
Note that we can explicitly constrain the tensor rank of $\mathcal{W}_T$ by limiting the number of components $R$.
But, since our interest lies in implicit regularization, we consider the case where $R$ is large enough for any tensor to be expressed.</p>

<p>Similarly to how matrix factorization captures linear neural networks, tensor factorization is equivalent to certain <em>shallow non-linear</em> convolutional networks (with multiplicative non-linearity).
This equivalence was discussed in a couple of previous posts (<a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2021/07/08/imp-reg-tf/">2</a>), for the exact details behind it feel free to check out the preliminaries section of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">our paper</a> and references therein.
The bottom line is that tensor factorization takes us one step closer to practical neural networks.</p>

<p>Motivated by the incremental learning dynamics in matrix factorization, in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09972">previous paper</a> (see accompanying <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2021/07/08/imp-reg-tf/">blog post</a>) we analyzed the behavior of component norms during optimization of tensor factorization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (informal; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09972">Razin et al. 2021</a>):</strong>
Gradient flow over tensor factorization initialized near zero leads the $r$’th component norm, $\sigma_T^{(r)} (t) := || \mathbf{w}_r^1 (t) \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N (t) ||$, to evolve by:
[ 
    \color{brown}{\frac{d}{dt} \sigma_T^{(r)} (t) \propto \sigma_T^{(r)} (t)^{2 - 2/N}} ~.
]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dynamics of component norms in tensor factorization are structurally identical to those of singular values in matrix factorization.
Accordingly, we get a momentum-like effect that attenuates the movement of small component norms and accelerates that of large ones.
This suggests that, <strong>in analogy with matrix factorization, when initializing near zero components tend to be learned incrementally, resulting in a bias towards low tensor rank</strong>.
The following plot empirically demonstrates this phenomenon:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<p><br/>
Continuing with the analogy to matrix factorization, the incremental tensor rank learning phenomenon formed the basis for proving exact tensor rank minimization, under certain technical conditions (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09972">Razin et al. 2021</a>).</p>

<h2 id="hierarchical-tensor-factorization">Hierarchical Tensor Factorization</h2>

<p>Tensor factorization took us beyond linear predictors, yet it still lacks a critical feature of modern neural networks — depth (recall that it corresponds to <em>shallow</em> non-linear convolutional networks).
A natural extension that accounts for both non-linearity and depth is <em>hierarchical tensor factorization</em> — our protagonist — which corresponds to certain <em>deep</em> non-linear convolutional networks (with multiplicative non-linearity).
This equivalence is actually not new, and has facilitated numerous analyses of expressive power in deep learning (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02302">this survey</a> for a high-level overview).</p>

<p>As opposed to tensor factorization, which is a simple construct dating back to at least the early 20’th century (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sapm192761164">Hitchcock 1927</a>), hierarchical tensor factorization was formally introduced only recently (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-009-9094-9">Hackbusch &amp; Kuhn 2009</a>), and is much more elaborate.
Its exact definition is rather technical (the interested reader can find it in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">our paper</a>).
For our current purpose it suffices to know that a hierarchical tensor factorization consists of multiple local tensor factorizations, whose components we call the <em>local components</em> of the hierarchical factorization.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/imp_reg_htf/tf_htf_cnn_blog.png" style="width: 900px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px;"/>
<br/>
<i><b>Figure 3:</b> 
Tensor factorization, which is a sum of components (outer products), <br/> corresponds to a shallow non-linear convolutional neural network (CNN).
<br/> Hierarchical tensor factorization, which consists of multiple local tensor <br/> factorizations, corresponds to a deep non-linear CNN.
</i>
</div>
<p><br/>
In contrast to matrices, which have a single standard definition for rank, tensors posses several different definitions for rank.
Hierarchical tensor factorizations induce their own such notion, known as <em>hierarchical tensor rank</em>.
Basically, if a tensor can be represented through hierarchical tensor factorization with few local components, then it has low hierarchical tensor rank.
This stands in direct analogy with tensor rank, which is low if the tensor can be represented through tensor factorization with few components.</p>

<p>Seeing that the implicit regularization in matrix and tensor factorizations leads to low matrix and tensor ranks, respectively, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">our paper</a> we investigated whether the implicit regularization in hierarchical tensor factorization leads to low hierarchical tensor rank. 
That is, whether GD (with small initialization and step size) over hierarchical tensor factorization learns solutions that can be represented with few local components.
Turns out it does.</p>

<h2 id="dynamical-analysis-incremental-hierarchical-tensor-rank-learning">Dynamical Analysis: Incremental Hierarchical Tensor Rank Learning</h2>

<p>At the heart of our analysis is the following dynamical characterization for local component norms during optimization of hierarchical tensor factorization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (informal):</strong>
Gradient flow over hierarchical tensor factorization initialized near zero leads the $r$’th local component norm in a local tensor factorization, denoted $\sigma_H^{(r)} (t)$, to evolve by:
[ 
    \color{brown}{\frac{d}{dt} \sigma_H^{(r)} (t) \propto \sigma_H^{(r)} (t)^{2 - 2/K}} ~,
]
where $K$ is the number of axes of the local tensor factorization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should really feel like deja vu, as these <strong>dynamics are structurally identical to those of singular values in matrix factorization and component norms in tensor factorization!</strong>
Again, we have a momentum-like effect, by which local component norms move slower when small and faster when large.
As a result, <strong>when initializing near zero local components tend to be learned incrementally, yielding a bias towards low hierarchical tensor rank</strong>.
In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">the paper</a> we provide theoretical and empirical demonstrations of this phenomenon.
For example, the following plot shows the evolution of local component norms at some local tensor factorization under GD:</p>

<h2 id="practical-implication-countering-locality-in-convolutional-networks-via-explicit-regularization">Practical Implication: Countering Locality in Convolutional Networks via Explicit Regularization</h2>

<p>We saw that in hierarchical tensor factorization GD leads to solutions of low hierarchical tensor rank.
But what does this even mean for the associated convolutional networks?</p>

<p>Hierarchical tensor rank is known (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06743">Cohen &amp; Shashua 2017</a>) to measure the strength of long-range dependencies modeled by a network.
In the context of image classification, e.g., it quantifies how well we take into account dependencies between distant patches of pixels.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<br/>
<i><b>Figure 5:</b>

</div>
<p><br/>
<strong>The implicit regularization towards low hierarchical tensor rank in hierarchical tensor factorization therefore translates to an implicit regularization towards <em>locality</em> in the corresponding convolutional networks</strong>.
At first this may not seem surprising, since convolutional networks typically struggle or completely fail to learn tasks entailing long-range dependencies.
However, conventional wisdom attributes this failure to expressive properties (i.e. to an inability of convolutional networks to realize functions modeling long-range dependencies), suggesting that addressing the problem requires modifying the architecture.
Our analysis, on the other hand, reveals that implicit regularization also plays a role: it is not just a matter of expressive power, the optimization algorithm is implicitly pushing towards local solutions.
Inspired by this observation, we asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong>
Is it possible to improve the performance of modern convolutional networks on long-range tasks via explicit regularization (without modifying their architecture)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To explore this prospect, <strong>we designed explicit regularization that counteracts locality by promoting high hierarchical tensor rank (i.e. long-range dependencies)</strong>.
Then, through a series of controlled experiments, <strong>we confirmed that it can greatly improve the performance of modern convolutional networks (e.g. ResNets) on long-range tasks</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, the following plot displays test accuracies achieved by a ResNet on an image classification benchmark, in which it is possible to control the spatial range of dependencies required to model.
When increasing the range of dependencies, the test accuracy obtained by an unregularized network substantially deteriorates, reaching performance no better than random guessing.
As evident from the plot, our regularization closes the gap between short- and long-range tasks, significantly boosting generalization on the latter.</p>

Specialized explicit regularization promoting high hierarchical tensor rank (i.e. long-range dependencies between image regions) can counter the locality of convolutional networks, significantly improving their performance on long-range tasks.

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>Looking forward, there are two main takeaways from our work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Across three different neural network types (equivalent to matrix, tensor, and hierarchical tensor factorizations), we have an architecture-dependant notion of rank that is implicitly lowered. Moreover, the underlying mechanism for this implicit regularization is identical in all cases. This leads us to believe that implicit regularization towards low rank may be a general phenomenon. If true, finding notions of rank lowered for different architectures can facilitate an understanding of generalization in deep learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our findings imply that the tendency of modern convolutional networks towards locality may largely be due to implicit regularization, and not an inherent limitation of expressive power as often believed. More broadly, they showcase that deep learning architectures considered suboptimal for certain tasks can be greatly improved through a right choice of explicit regularization. 
Theoretical understanding of implicit regularization may be key to discovering such regularizers.</p>

    <title>TR22-102 |  Range Avoidance for Low-depth Circuits and Connections to Pseudorandomness | 

	Xiuhan Wang, 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Xin Lyu</title>
    <summary>In the range avoidance problem, the input is a multi-output Boolean circuit with more outputs than inputs, and the goal is to find a string outside its range (which is guaranteed to exist). We show that well-known explicit construction questions such as finding binary linear codes achieving the Gilbert-Varshamov bound or list-decoding capacity, and constructing rigid matrices, reduce to the range avoidance problem of log-depth circuits, and by a further recent reduction [Ren, Santhanam, and Wang, ECCC 2022] to $NC^0_4$ circuits where each output depends on at most $4$ input bits. 

On the algorithmic side, we show that range avoidance for $NC^0_2$ circuits can be solved in polynomial time. We identify a general condition relating to correlation with low-degree parities that implies that any almost pairwise independent set has some string that avoids the range of every circuit in the class. We apply this to $NC^0$ circuits, and to small width CNF/DNF and general De Morgan formulae (via a connection to approximate-degree), yielding non-trivial small hitting sets for range avoidance in these cases.</summary>

    <title>TR22-101 |  A Near-Cubic Lower Bound for 3-Query Locally Decodable Codes from Semirandom CSP Refutation | 

	Omar Alrabiah, 

	Pravesh Kothari, 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Peter Manohar</title>
    <summary>A code $C \colon \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n$ is a $q$-locally decodable code ($q$-LDC) if one can recover any chosen bit $b_i$ of the message $b \in \{0,1\}^k$ with good confidence by randomly querying the encoding $x = C(b)$ on at most $q$ coordinates. Existing constructions of $2$-LDCs achieve $n = \exp(O(k))$, and lower bounds show that this is in fact tight. However, when $q = 3$, far less is known: the best constructions achieve $n = \exp(k^{o(1)})$, while the best known results only show a quadratic lower bound $n \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(k^2)$ on the blocklength.

In this paper, we prove a near-cubic lower bound of $n \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(k^3)$ on the blocklength of $3$-query LDCs. This improves on the best known prior works by a polynomial factor in $k$. Our proof relies on a new connection between LDCs and refuting constraint satisfaction problems with limited randomness. Our quantitative improvement builds on the new techniques for refuting semirandom instances of CSPs developed in [GKM22] and, in particular, relies on bounding the $(\infty \to 1)$-norm of appropriate Kikuchi matrices.</summary>

    <title>TR22-100 |  Streaming complexity of CSPs with randomly ordered constraints |

    <summary>We initiate a study of the streaming complexity of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) when the constraints arrive in a random order. We show that there exists a CSP, namely Max-DICUT, for which random ordering makes a provable difference. Whereas a $4/9 \approx 0.445$ approximation of DICUT requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space with adversarial ordering, we show that with random ordering of constraints there exists a $0.48$-approximation algorithm that only needs $O(\log n)$ space. We also give new algorithms for Max-DICUT in variants of the adversarial ordering setting. Specifically, we give a two-pass  $O(\log n)$ space $0.48$-approximation algorithm for general graphs and a single-pass $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ space $0.48$-approximation algorithm for bounded degree graphs.
    
    On the negative side, we prove that CSPs where the satisfying assignments of the constraints support a one-wise independent distribution require $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-space for any non-trivial approximation, even when the constraints are randomly ordered. This was previously known only for adversarially ordered constraints. Extending the results to randomly ordered constraints requires switching the hard instances from a union of random matchings to simple Erdos-Renyi random (hyper)graphs and extending tools that can perform Fourier analysis on such instances. 
    
    The only CSP to have been considered previously with random ordering is Max-CUT where the ordering is not known to change the approximability. Specifically, it is known to be as hard to approximate with random ordering as with adversarial ordering, for $o(\sqrt{n})$ space algorithms. Our results show a richer variety of possibilities and motivate further study of CSPs with randomly ordered constraints.</summary>

    <title>TR22-099 |  Equivalence Test for Read-Once Arithmetic Formulas | 

	Nikhil Gupta, 

	Chandan Saha, 

	Bhargav Thankey</title>
    <summary>We study the polynomial equivalence problem for orbits of read-once arithmetic formulas (ROFs). Read-once formulas have received considerable attention in both algebraic and Boolean complexity and have served as a testbed for developing effective tools and techniques for analyzing circuits. Two $n$-variate polynomials $f, g \in \mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}]$ are equivalent, denoted as $f \sim g$, if there is an $A \in \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{F})$ such that $f = g(A\mathbf{x})$. The orbit of $f$ is the set of all polynomials equivalent to $f$. We investigate the complexity of the following two natural problems on ROFs:

1. Equivalence test for ROFs: Given black-box access to $f$, check if it is in the orbit of an ROF. If yes, output an ROF $C$ and an $A \in \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{F})$ such that $f = C(A\mathbf{x})$.  
2. Polynomial equivalence for orbits of ROFs: Given black-box access to $f$ and $g$ in the orbits of two unknown ROFs, check if $f \sim g$. If yes, output an $A \in \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{F})$ such that $f = g(A\mathbf{x})$.

These problems are significant generalizations of two well-studied problems in algebraic complexity, namely reconstruction of ROFs and quadratic form equivalence. In this work, we give the first randomized polynomial-time algorithms (with oracle access to quadratic form equivalence) to solve the two problems. The equivalence test works for general ROFs; it also implies an efficient learning algorithm for random arithmetic formulas of unbounded depth and fan-in (in the high number of variables setting). The algorithm for the second problem, which invokes the equivalence test, works for mildly restricted ROFs, namely additive-constant-free ROFs.  	
	
The equivalence test is based on a novel interplay between the factors and the essential variables of the Hessian determinant of an ROF, the essential variables of the ROF, and certain special structures in the ROF that we call "skewed paths". To our knowledge, the Hessian of a general ROF (or even a depth-4 ROF) has not been analyzed before. Analyzing the Hessian and combining the knowledge gained from it with the skewed paths to recursively discover formulas in the orbits of sub-ROFs of lower depth (without incurring an exponential blow-up due to unbounded depth) constitute the main technical contributions of this work.</summary>

<p>This is a photo of my book shelf at the office. Ever since joining Harvard, I have been ordering copies of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a> on a regular basis. I often hand them out to bright students, curious about science, whom I want to expose to the beautiful connections between computer science, math, physics, and even philosophy. Scott has been one of the great popularizers of our field even before he started blogging in 2005. His surveys and blog posts provide some of the best introductions to our field. For example, when investigating  <a href="http://quant-ph/0502072">P vs NP and physical reality</a>, Scott actually <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=266">went out and verified</a> that nature indeed cannot solve an NP-complete problem via finding the globally minimal energy configuration of soap bubbles.  Through his blog, popular writing, and research, Scott has done more than anyone else to introduce new people of all backgrounds to theoretical computer science. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img alt="" height="408" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JRN6bxodVkY1JiHSWOEx4QXtvmH3twDk-O5jGgsio1IM92aUUxYZ87i7T0qU8bfrCnVbBWIt1OV4soNgnhoMpTHvnJBIVk8tAPO_oK2_WLzHbrGfWNpRDQyazey-CG9V0YLDDZ2r45pwOKsSF4PZaQ" width="543"/></figure></div>


<p>One of Scott’s endearing qualities is his openness to all people. While many of us would ignore a random email or anonymous blog comment, Scott would patiently explain for the millionth time why quantum computers can’t solve NP-hard problems by “trying all solutions in parallel” or why Bell’s Inequality does indeed rule out hidden-variable theories of nature. Alas, the same openness also results in him sometimes giving too much attention and caring far too much about the opinions of Internet “trolls” that are not worthy of his time. </p>



<p>While Scott has always attracted some vitriol, recently this has taken to a <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6546">new level</a>, with commenters attacking his integrity, his speech mannerisms, even his T-shirt choice/frequency, and worst of all, his family, with misogynistic attacks on his wife and xenophobic and ableist attacks on neurodivergent researchers.</p>



<p>None of these people have made a fraction of the contributions of Scott not just to science, but also to broadening the diversity of computer science, and other causes including <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6411">assisting women dealing with Texas’ restrictive abortion laws</a>. (As full disclosure, one of the causes <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6256">Scott helped raise money</a> for is <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a> and <a href="https://jamcoder.org.jm/">JamCoders</a> of which I am a board member. I just came back from a <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1545765613167067136?s=20&amp;t=53HLUIjmCwBsl1oYhEQXhw">week teaching in Jamaica</a>, the students were amazing and are so thankful for the chance to participate in this program; they couldn’t care less how often Scott changes his shirt.)</p>



<p>I am grateful that Scott is a member of our scientific community and proud to call him my friend. Does this mean that I agree with all his positions? Absolutely not. I tend to be on his left on many issues  (though am probably more conservative when it comes to oracle-based complexity..). Are there people he’s friendly with whom I even more strongly disagree with, and whose views I might even find repugnant? Probably. But it doesn’t matter, all of us are connected via 6 degrees of separation. If we start to “recursively cancel” every one that is somehow connected to someone we find odious, then we would not be able to talk to anyone.</p>



<p>I hope that Scott is not disheartened by these attacks, and continues to contribute for many years to CS research and education, outreach, and humanity at large.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-098 |  Non-Adaptive Proper Learning Polynomials | 

	Nader Bshouty</title>
    <summary>We give the first polynomial-time *non-adaptive* proper learning algorithm of Boolean sparse multivariate polynomial under the uniform distribution. Our algorithm, for $s$-sparse polynomial over $n$ variables, makes $q=(s/\epsilon)^{\gamma(s,\epsilon)}\log n$ queries where $2.66\le \gamma(s,\epsilon)\le 6.922$ and runs in $\tilde O(n)\cdot poly(s,1/\epsilon)$ time. We also show that for any $\epsilon=1/s^{O(1)}$ any non-adaptive learning algorithm must make at least $(s/\epsilon)^{\Omega(1)}\log n$ queries. Therefore, the query complexity of our algorithm is also polynomial in the optimal query complexity and optimal in $n$.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Update (July 13):</strong> I was honored to read <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/07/13/my-friend-scott-aaronson/">this post</a> by my friend Boaz Barak.</p>



<p><strong>Update (July 14):</strong> By now, comments on this post allegedly from three CS professors  — namely, Josh Alman, Aloni Cohen, and Rana Hanocka — have been unmasked as from impersonators (!!).</p>



<p>I’m obviously the target of one or more motivated attack-trolls who know something about the CS community. This might be the single weirdest thing that’s happened to me in 17 years of blogging, surpassing even the legendary <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=277">Ricoh printer episode</a> of 2007.  It obviously underscores the need for a new, stricter comment policy, which is what this whole post was about.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Yesterday and today, both my work and my enjoyment of the James Webb images were interrupted by an anonymous troll, who used the <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> comment section to heap <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6546#comment-1941041">libelous abuse</a> on me—derailing an anodyne quantum computing discussion to opine at length about how I’m a disgusting creep who surely, probably, maybe has lewd thoughts about his female students.  Unwisely or not, I allowed it all to appear, and replied to all of it.  I had a few reasons: I wanted to prove that I’m now strong enough to withstand bullying that might once have driven me to suicide.  I wanted, frankly, many readers to come to my defense (thanks to those who did!).  I at least wanted readers to <em>see</em> firsthand what I now regularly deal with: the emotional price of maintaining this blog.  Most of all, I wanted my feminist, social-justice-supporting readers to either explicitly endorse or (hopefully) explicitly repudiate the unambiguous harassment that was now being gleefully committed in their name.</p>



<p>Then, though, the same commenter upped the ante further, by heaping misogynistic abuse on my wife <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana</a>—while <em>still</em>, ludicrously and incongruously, cloaking themselves in the rhetoric of social justice.  Yes: apparently the woke, feminist thing to do is now to rate female computer scientists on their looks.</p>



<p>Let me be blunt: I cannot continue to write <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> while dealing with regular harassment of me and my family.  At the same time, I’m also determined not to “surrender to the terrorists.”  So, I’m weighing the following options:</p>



<ul><li>Close comments except to commenters who provide a real identity—e.g., a full real name, a matching email address, a website.</li><li>Move to Substack, and then allow only commenters who’ve signed up.</li><li>Hire someone to pre-screen comments for me, and delete ones that are abusive or harassing (to me or others) before I even see them.  (Any volunteers??)</li><li>Make the comment sections for readers only, eliminating any expectation that I’ll participate.</li></ul>



<p>One thing that’s clear is that the status quo will not continue.  I can’t “just delete” harassing or abusive comments, because the trolls have gotten too good at triggering me, and they will continue to weaponize my openness and my ethic of responding to all possible arguments against me.</p>



<p>So, regular readers: what do you prefer?</p></div>

    <title>Review of The Engines of Cognition: Essays From the LessWrong Forum/Meta question about posts</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> A while back I reviewed<i> A Map that Reflects the Territory</i> which is a collection of essays posted on the lesswrong forum. My review is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/FRED/lesswrong.pdf">here</a>. I posted it to both this blog and to the lesswrong forum. In both cases I posted a link to it. My post to lesswrong is <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JXTEDFCC5r4dW2tta/review-of-a-map-that-reflects-the-territory">here</a></p><p>On the lesswrong post many of the comments, plus some private emails, told me NO BILL- don't post a link, post it directly as text. It was not clear how to do that, but I got it done with help.</p><p>On complexity blog nobody commented that this was a problem. Then again, nobody commented at all, so its not clear what to make of that. </p><p>So</p><p>Meta Question: Is posting a link worse than posting direct text? Note that the book review was 12 pages long and looked great in LaTeX. </p><p>Meta Question: Why did lesswrong care about the format but complexityblog did not (Probably answer: omplexityblog readers did not care at all, whereas Lesswrong cared about what I though about Lesswrong)</p><p>Another Question, not Meta. One of the comments was (I paraphrase)</p><p><i>When I open a pdf file I expected to see something in the style of an academic paper. This is written in very much chatty, free-flowing blog post style with jokes like calling neologisms ``newords'', so the whole think felt more off-kilter than was intended. The style of writing would prob work better as an HTML blog post (which could then be posted directly as a Lesswrong post here instead of hosted elsewhere and linked.)</i></p><p>I think its interesting that the format of an article telegraphs (in this case incorrectly) what type of article it will be. Is this a common problem?  I have had the experience of reading a real academic paper and being surprised that some joke or cultural-reference is in it, though I do not object to this. </p><p>Another comment and question</p><p><i>I was surprised the post only had 11 karma when I saw it (William had send me an advance copy and I'd really liked reading it) but when I saw that it was a link post, I understood why.</i></p><p>I find this hilarious- they have some way the posts are rated!  For one, Lance told me very early on to never worry about comments, and I don't. Second, it reminds me of the Black Mirror episode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)">Nosedive</a>.</p><p>ANYWAY, I have reviewed another collection of essays for less wrong, this one called <i>The Engines of</i> <i>Cognition. </i>I am posting it here as a link: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/FRED/lesswrong2.pdf">here</a>  and I will post it on lesswrong as full text (with help) in a few days. </p><p>I am posting it so I can get comments before I submit it to the SIGACT News book review column. But this is odd since I think this blog has more readers than SIGACT news has subscribers, so perhaps THIS is its real debut, not that. And of course the lesswrong forum is a place where more will read it since its about them. </p><p>So- I appreciate comments to make it a better review!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

In our latest paper, we present a framework for pinpointing the impact of the source datasets in transfer learning. Our framework enables us to improve transfer learning performance by removing source datapoints that are detrimental for a specific target task. It also unlocks various other capabilities, such as debugging transfer learning failures, automatically identifying granular subpopulations in the target dataset, and detecting data leakage between source and target datasets. 
</i></p>

<p>Transfer learning is a widely utilized technique for adapting a model trained on a source dataset to improve performance on a downstream target task. Used in applications ranging from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06871">radiology</a>, <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w13/papers/Kim_End-To-End_Ego_Lane_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf">autonomous driving</a>, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00098">satellite imagery analysis</a>, the transfer learning paradigm also fuels the recent emergence of large vision and language models trained on enormous amounts of data, such as <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">CLIP</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/">GPT-3</a>.</p>

<p>Why is transfer learning so effective though? And, in particular, what drives transfer learning performance? Definitely, much depends on the properties of the source model, i.e., the model trained on the source dataset. For example, recent works highlight the impact of the model’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06871">architecture</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08974">accuracy</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">adversarial vulnerability</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05901">training procedure</a>.</p>

<p>But, in addition to the source model, it is hard to not expect the source dataset to play a major role as well. Indeed, several works have shown that increasing the size of the dataset usually <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11370">boosts transfer learning performance</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07056">Others</a> have found that limiting the source dataset to images that are relevant to the target task can help as well. So: what is the exact role of the source dataset in transfer learning?</p>

<p>In our most <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05739">recent paper</a>, we present a framework for pinpointing the impact of the source dataset on the downstream predictions in transfer learning. This framework draws inspiration from techniques such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03703">influence functions</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00622">datamodels</a> and it enables us, in particular, to automatically identify source datapoints that—positively or negatively—impact transfer learning performance.</p>

<p>We’ll now walk through how we calculate the influence of the source dataset in transfer learning, and then demonstrate how our framework can be used to:</p>

<ul type="a">
  <li>Boost transfer learning performance by removing detrimental source datapoints;</li>
  <li>Automatically extract granular subpopulations in the target dataset by projecting the  class hierarchy of the source dataset onto it; and</li>
  <li>Surface pathologies such as source-target data leakage and misleading or mislabelled source datapoints.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="computing-the-influence-of-the-source-dataset">Computing the Influence of the Source Dataset</h2>

<p>How to pinpoint the relationship between the source dataset’s composition and the model’s downstream predictions? We build here on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03703">influence functions</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00622">datamodels</a> methodology (check out our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">previous post</a> for a deeper dive into these) to study the counterfactual effect of removing source datapoints on the target model’s predictions. However, unlike in the standard supervised setting in which the focus is on individual datapoints, here we focus on removing entire classes. This is motivated by the fact that we expect the removal of entire classes to have a more measurable impact on the features learned by the source model (and thus the resulting model’s predictions).</p>

<p>So, at a high level, we first train a large number of models on random subsets of classes in the source dataset, and fine-tune them on the target task. Then we compute the influence of a source class on a target example by simply measuring the average difference in the model’s performance on a given target example when the class was included versus excluded from the source dataset. A positive influence value thus means that including the class improved the model’s performance on that example, while a negative value indicates that the class was detrimental to the correctness of the corresponding model’s prediction.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-the-most-influential-classes-of-the-source-dataset">Identifying the Most Influential Classes of the Source Dataset</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve calculated these influences, how can we use them to study transfer learning? First, let’s take a look at the ranking of the most positively and negatively influencing classes for a variety of target tasks. We first look at the influences from different ImageNet classes to the entire CIFAR-10 test set:</p>

<p><img alt="Most influential" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/data-transfer/images/most_influencing_classes.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;"/>
<!-- <div class="footnote">
TODO
</div> --></p>

<p>Note that in the most positive source classes tend to semantically overlap with the classes in the target dataset. For example, tailed frog and sorrel horse have the most positive influence for the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains the classes frog and horse.</p>

<p>Also, the plot above suggests that there is a number of source classes, such as bookshop or jigsaw puzzle, whose inclusion actually hurts the overall transfer learning performance. So what happens if we indeed remove these classes from the source dataset? Well, as one might hope, they do boost the transfer learning performance on a variety of downstream image classification:</p>

<p><img alt="Counterfactual main" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/data-transfer/images/main_counterfactual_exp.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
Target task accuracies after removing the most positively or negatively influential ImageNet classes from the source dataset.
</div>

<p>In fact, we can get an accuracy boost of nearly 2.5% on CIFAR-10 (as compared to what one gets from pre-training with the full ImageNet dataset).</p>

<h2 id="leveraging-influences-to-study-transfer-learning">Leveraging Influences to Study Transfer Learning</h2>

<p>Above, we used our framework to pinpoint the most influential—be it positively or negatively— classes for transfer learning. Here, we’ll discuss how our framework provides us with a broader set of tools for studying transfer learning, including: (1) debugging transfer learning failures, (2) automatically extracting granular subpopulations in the target dataset, and (3) detecting data leakage between source and target datasets.</p>

<h3 id="1--debugging-the-failures-of-the-transferred-model">(1)  Debugging the failures of the transferred model</h3>
<p>Suppose our transferred model wrongly predicts the dog image displayed in the figure below—it labels it as a horse. Can we use our framework to understand why our model is making this mistake? Yes! The influences we computed enable us to identify the source class sorrel horse as one having a strong (and the strongest) negative influence on our image of interest. This suggests that the features learned by the source model due to the presence of this class might be the culprit here. Indeed, once we remove the sorrel horse class from the source dataset, our model now makes the correct prediction on our dog image much more frequently (with respect to the randomness of the training procedure).</p>

<div id="debug_examples_widget" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
Identifying highly negatively influencing source classes can explain why our transfer learning model made a mistake (middle). Once we remove the most negatively influencing class from the source dataset, the model predicts the correct label more frequently (right).

</div> -->

<h3 id="2-automatically-extracting-granular-subpopulations-in-the-target-dataset">(2) Automatically extracting granular subpopulations in the target dataset</h3>
<p>Imagine you want to find all the images of ostriches in the CIFAR-10 dataset. However, the problem is that CIFAR-10 does not contain any subpopulation annotations that could help with this task and having to manually look for ostriches among all the images in the bird class is not a very appealing alternative. Our framework allows us to do something much more scalable!</p>

<p>Indeed, as we already observed, the most positively influencing source classes usually semantically overlap with the images in the target dataset they influence the most. In fact, this goes further: the target images which are most influenced by a given source class tend to share relevant salient features too. So, to identify our ostrich subpopulation in CIFAR-10, we just need to look at all the images that are most influenced by the source class “ostrich”! Below we display some of the CIFAR-10 images identified in this way.</p>

<div id="subpop_examples_widget" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">

</div>

<h3 id="3-detecting-data-leakage-and-misleading-source-dataset-examples">(3) Detecting data-leakage and misleading source dataset examples</h3>
<p>Thus far, we have focused on the role of classes in the source dataset in transfer learning. But we can also compute the influences of specific source examples on the transferred model’s predictions. This turns out to enable us to isolate, in particular, instances of data leakage and misleading examples in the source dataset.</p>

<p>Indeed, below, we display ImageNet training examples that are highly influential on CIFAR-10 test examples. The source images that have a highly positive influence are often identical copies of images from the target task (just at a higher resolution)—a clear example of data leakage. On the other hand, images that have a high negative influence tend to be the ones that are misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise surprising.  For example, the presence of the (amusing) ImageNet image of a flying lawnmower (see below) hurts the performance on a CIFAR-10 image of a regular (but similarly shaped) airplane.</p>

<p><img alt="Detect leakage" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/data-transfer/images/detect_leakage.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;"/>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>In this post, we described a new framework for pinpointing the impact of the source dataset in transfer learning. Our framework allows one to improve the transfer learning performance on a range of downstream tasks by identifying and removing source datapoints that are detrimental. Furthermore, by using our framework one can automatically extract granular subpopulations in the target dataset by leveraging the fine-grained class hierarchy of the source dataset, better understand how the errors of the model on the downstream task are rooted in the source dataset, and detect potential data leakage from the source to the downstream dataset. We believe our framework provides a new perspective on transfer learning by highlighting the role of the source dataset in the transfer learning pipeline and gives us a toolkit for performing a fine-grained analysis of it.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-097 |  Unstructured Hardness to Average-Case Randomness | 

	Roei Tell, 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Ron D. Rothblum</title>
    <summary>The leading technical approach in uniform hardness-to-randomness in the last two decades faced several well-known barriers that caused results to rely on overly strong hardness assumptions, and yet still yield suboptimal conclusions.

In this work we show uniform hardness-to-randomness results that *simultaneously break through all of the known barriers*. Specifically, consider any one of the following three assumptions:

1. For some $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists a function $f$ computable by uniform circuits of size $2^{O(n)}$ and depth $2^{o(n)}$ such that $f$ is hard for probabilistic time $2^{\epsilon\cdot n}$.

2. For every $c\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists a function $f$ computable by logspace-uniform circuits of polynomial size and depth $n^2$ such that every probabilistic algorithm running in time $n^{c}$ fails to compute $f$ on a $(1/n)$-fraction of the inputs.

2. For every $c\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists a logspace-uniform family of arithmetic formulas of degree $n^2$ over a field of size $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ such that no algorithm running in probabilistic time $n^{c}$ can evaluate the family on a worst-case input.

Assuming any of these hypotheses, where the hardness is for every sufficiently large input length $n\in\mathbb{N}$, we deduce that $\mathcal{RP}$ can be derandomized in *polynomial time and on *all input lengths*, on average. Furthermore, under the first assumption we also show that $\mathcal{BPP}$ can be derandomized in polynomial time, on average and on all input lengths, with logarithmically many advice bits.

On the way to these results we also resolve two related open problems. First, we obtain an *optimal worst-case to average-case reduction* for computing problems in linear space by uniform probabilistic algorithms; this result builds on a new instance checker based on the doubly efficient proof system of Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum (J. ACM, 2015). Secondly, we resolve the main open problem in the work of Carmosino, Impagliazzo and Sabin (ICALP 2018), by deducing derandomization from weak and general fine-grained hardness hypotheses.</summary>

    <title>TR22-096 |  Communication Complexity of Collision | 

	Mika Göös, 

	Siddhartha Jain</title>
    <summary>The Collision problem is to decide whether a given list of numbers $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in[n]^n$ is $1$-to-$1$ or $2$-to-$1$ when promised one of them is the case. We show an $n^{\Omega(1)}$ randomised communication lower bound for the natural two-party version of Collision where Alice holds the first half of the bits of each $x_i$ and Bob holds the second half. As an application, we also show a similar lower bound for a weak bit-pigeonhole search problem, which answers a question of Itsykson and Riazanov (CCC 2021).</summary>
