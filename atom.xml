    <title>Backpropagation ≠ Chain Rule</title>
    <summary>The chain rule is a fundamental result in calculus. Roughly speaking, it states that if a variable is a differentiable function of intermediate variables , and each intermediate variable is itself a differentiable function of , then we can compute the derivative as follows: Besides being a handy tool for computing derivatives in calculus homework, the chain rule is closely related to the backpropagation algorithm that is widely-used for computing derivatives (gradients) in neural network training. This blog post by Boaz Barak is a beautiful tutorial on the chain rule and the backpropagation algorithm. As in Barak’s post, the backpropagation algorithm is usually taught as an application of the chain rule in machine learning classes. This leads to a common belief that “backpropagation is just applying the chain rule repeatedly”.

<p>In the calculations above, note the difference between partial and full derivatives. For example, the partial derivative <img alt="\frac{\partial b_2}{\partial a} = 3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_2%7D%7B%5Cpartial+a%7D+%3D+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, whereas the full derivative <img alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} b_2}{{\mathrm d} a} = 3\times 1 + 1\times 2 = 5" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_2%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D+%3D+3%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+2+%3D+5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Similarly, the partial derivative <img alt="\frac{\partial c}{\partial b_1} = 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_1%7D+%3D+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, whereas the full derivative <img alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} b_1} = 5\times 1 + 1\times 4 = 9" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_1%7D+%3D+5%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+4+%3D+9&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Intuitively, for every edge in the graph, we can compute the corresponding partial derivative locally (after the <em>forward pass</em>, to be precise), but a full derivative may require longer calculations.</p>



<p>Now it should be clear that equation <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> cannot be <em>directly</em> explained as the standard chain rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a>. The key difference is that in the chain rule, we need partial derivatives of a single variable w.r.t. multiple other variables, whereas in <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a>, we need partial derivatives of multiple variables w.r.t. the same variable.</p>



<p>Of course, one can prove the correctness of backpropagation using the chain rule in various ways, but the simple proof “backpropagation uses the standard chain rule at every step” is incomplete. Also, it is certainly possible to compute derivatives (gradients) on a neural network directly using the chain rule similarly to <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-2">(2)</a>, but in neural network training one typically wants to calculate the derivatives of a single output variable w.r.t. a large number of input variables, in which case backpropagation allows a more efficient implementation than using the standard chain rule directly.</p></div>

<p>A few hours ago <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/combinatorial_theory">the first issue of <em>Combinatorial Theory</em></a> was published. I am happy and proud to take part in this new endeavor. The editorial speaks for itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is the first issue of our new journal, </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. It is owned by mathematicians, dedicated to Diamond Open Access publishing with no fees for authors or readers, and committed to an inclusive view of the vibrant worldwide community in Combinatorics. The journal shares a similar scope with the long-running </em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A<em>(JCT A), owned by Elsevier. In 2020, almost all of the editors of JCT A resigned, deciding that it was the time to found a premier Combinatorics journal owned by mathematicians, not by a commercial publisher. Thus was born </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. That birth has allowed us to rethink how and what we publish. We are proud to have assembled a broad and diverse team of editors. We are also pleased with two new features in our editorial process: </em>doubly-anonymous refereeing<em> to mitigate implicit biases during peer review, and the inauguration of </em>Expository Article<em> submissions to encourage inclusion of valuable well-written expositions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also have warm feelings toward <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A</em> and the earlier <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory</em> (before it split to Ser A and Ser B), which was among the first journals of combinatorics, had important role for the development of our field, and which is still running under new editors.</p>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Ali Mohammad Lavasani, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Pankratov:Denis.html">Denis Pankratov</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08295">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study online matching in the Euclidean $2$-dimesional plane with
non-crossing constraint. The offline version was introduced by Atallah in 1985
and the online version was introduced and studied more recently by Bose et al.
The input to the problem consists of a sequence of points, and upon arrival of
a point an algorithm can match it with a previously unmatched point provided
that line segments corresponding to the matched edges do not intersect. The
decisions are irrevocable, and while an optimal offline solution always matches
all the points, an online algorithm cannot match all the points in the worst
case, unless it is given some side information, i.e., advice. We study two
versions of this problem -- monomchromatic (MNM) and bichromatic (BNM).
</p>
<p>We show that advice complexity of solving BNM optimally on a circle (or, more
generally, on inputs in a convex position) is tightly bounded by the logarithm
of the $n^\text{th}$ Catalan number from above and below. This result corrects
the previous claim of Bose et al. that the advice complexity is $\log(n!)$. At
the heart of the result is a connection between non-crossing constraint in
online inputs and $231$-avoiding property of permutations of $n$ elements We
also show a lower bound of $n/3-1$ and an upper bound of $3n$ on the advice
complexity for MNM on a plane. This gives an exponential improvement over the
previously best known lower bound and an improvement in the constant of the
leading term in the upper bound. In addition, we establish a lower bound of
$\frac{\alpha}{2}\infdiv{\frac{2(1-\alpha)}{\alpha}}{1/4}n$ on the advice
complexity for achieving competitive ratio $\alpha$ for MNM on a circle.
Standard tools from advice complexity, such as partition trees and reductions
from string guessing problem, do not seem to apply to MNM/BNM, so we have to
design our lower bounds from first principles.

unselected 1 tile and then filling the next unfilled square in a chosen
direction from that tile (similar to Tipover and Cross Purposes). We prove
NP-completeness of deciding whether the target square can be filled, by a
reduction from rectilinear planar monotone 3SAT.

    <title>Learning Graph Partitions</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1639612800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Sayan Mukherjee <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07897">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given a partition of a graph into connected components, the membership oracle
asserts whether any two vertices of the graph lie in the same component or not.
We prove that for $n\ge k\ge 2$, learning the components of an $n$-vertex
hidden graph with $k$ components requires at least $\frac{1}{2}(n-k)(k-1)$
membership queries. This proves the optimality of the $O(nk)$ algorithm
proposed by Reyzin and Srivastava (2007) for this problem, improving on the
best known information-theoretic bound of $\Omega(n\log k)$ queries. Further,
we construct an oracle that can learn the number of components of $G$ in
asymptotically fewer queries than learning the full partition, thus answering
another question posed by the same authors. Lastly, we introduce a more
applicable version of this oracle, and prove asymptotically tight bounds of
$\widetilde\Theta(m)$ queries for both learning and verifying an $m$-edge
hidden graph $G$ using this oracle.

advantages have recently been proposed, which implies that quantum technology
has fertile application prospects. However, demonstrating these schemes
experimentally continues to be a central challenge because of the difficulty in
preparing high-dimensional states or highly entangled states. In this study, we
introduce and analyse a quantum coupon collector protocol by employing coherent
states and simple linear optical elements, which was successfully demonstrated
using realistic experimental equipment. We showed that our protocol can
significantly reduce the number of samples needed to learn a specific set
compared with the classical limit of the coupon collector problem. We also
discuss the potential values and expansions of the quantum coupon collector by
constructing a quantum blind box game. The information transmitted by the
proposed game also broke the classical limit. These results strongly prove the
advantages of quantum mechanics in machine learning and communication
complexity.

    <title>Near-Optimal Distributed Degree+1 Colouring</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If you are interested in graph colouring, and specifically in distributed algorithms for that classic problem, I strongly recommend the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00604" target="_blank">recent paper</a> posted by Magnús M. Halldórsson, Fabian Kuhn, Alexandre Nolin and Tigran Tonoyan. (For the record, three of the authors work, or have worked, in my department at Reykjavik University, so I am biased.) </p><p>The above-mentioned paper addresses the problem of finding a proper colouring of a graph when each node <i>v</i> has a palette of degree(<i>v</i>)+1 colours at its disposal. The paper resolves an open problem in distributed colouring and simplifies known results in doing so. As a byproduct of their results, the authors obtain improved streaming and sub-linear time algorithms.   See the paper for much more information on the context for this result and the technical details. </p><p>Congratulations to the authors!</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m on the ICALP 2022 program committee (PC) and was apparently the first to complain when I saw the draft call for papers, and I asked that the requirement that <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=17">submissions must be in LIPIcs style</a> be put to a vote.  Despite substantial support among the PC for not requiring the majority of authors to squander their time formatting in an exotic style submissions that will be rejected, the Supreme Court blocked the vote.  Their main rationale seems to be ensuring correspondence between submissions and proceedings.  Ironically, at the same time other conferences are allowing authors to publish in proceedings an <em>abridged </em>version of the (accepted) submission, to make it easier to publish the paper in a journal (which may not want to have a full version already in a conference).  We are at the nadir in history where human effort is systematically wasted to produce versions that do not even pretend to be useful for readers — only to check boxes.</p>



<p>When I was at the IAS and was briefed about logistics, I was stunned when they asked me if I type my own papers, or if I needed help with that.  I guess the next level will be if you need help with formatting your submissions.</p>



<p>Picture a 100-year old retired scientist who followed the field for 75 years, and who wants to make one more contribution.  Even though they are no match for the raw power of a 15-year old, their ability to draw connections almost makes up for it, and their perspective is invaluable to the community.  This scientist, whose equipment consists of a desktop from two human generations ago, miraculously held together and kept working through sheer love and intimate knowledge, is now being asked to format their paper in LIPIcs style… or to ask someone else to do it for them (talk about fostering collaboration).</p>



<p>Here’s a non-exclusive list of true, terrible things about conferences, most of which were discussed earlier on this blog (see tag <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia-tcs/">utopia-tcs</a>):</p>



<ol><li>Requiring submissions in proceedings format.</li><li>Pre-registering papers by a deadline different than the submission deadline.</li><li>Requiring authors to submit a separate 2-page summary of the paper.</li><li>Ultra-strict page limits, summary rejection for any deviation.</li><li>Suddenly being forced on a short notice to submit a dummy .pdf so that PC assignments can be made.</li><li>Extending the list of topics two days before the deadline.</li><li>Moving deadlines.</li><li>Forcing authors to check multiple times the call for papers and/or constantly monitor email for any of these last-minute changes.</li><li>In the lucky case of acceptance, following up with a barrage of emails involving minutiae such as underfull \hbox.</li><li>Writing “this only takes 60 seconds.”  For me (and, apparently, many others — otherwise why delay answering emails that take 10 seconds to answer?) attending to <em>any</em> task, following <em>any</em> instruction, even “blink” or “say yes” has a huge fix cost, maybe 30 minutes.  So I translate 60 seconds to 31 minutes.</li><li>Hosting the conference in places which are inconvenient, for the attendees and planet earth.</li><li>Hosting the conference at times which are inconvenient for the attendees.</li><li>Requiring in-person PC meetings whose outcome does not justify the costs.</li></ol>



<p>As usual, people in a position of power do not have much incentive to fight to change the very practices that put them in that position in the first place.  But even this cynical remark doesn’t tell the whole story, since the practices got <em>worse</em> with time, unlike the case of journals.  One impression I have is that people have gotten so used to buggy software, constant updates, and general techno slavery that they just accept all of this as another inevitable misery in life… and by far not the worst!  This last point is important, as I think a seeping philosophy that permeates much of the discussion and the decisions is that much more important things are at stake, so who cares about this?  If you really want to spend cycles fixing something, then what about X?  (It’s fun to think where you end up if you stretch this point.)  But another life is possible.</p>



<p>One day, I will throw in my two cents and launch a new journal.  Besides being electronic and free (like ToC) it will have the following features.</p>



<ol><li>Papers, if accepted, will appear in the authors’ chosen format.  No conversion, and no additional effort, will be required for publication.  All the effort will be exclusively directed at improving the content of the paper.</li><li>Submissions can be by pdf attachment or by overlay, but not only to arxiv: to *any* repository.  In particular, authors will not be required to get their paper to compile on the arxiv.</li><li>The identities of the reviewers will be made public (in case of acceptance).  This I am still debating, but so far I am leaning towards it.  The problem that this is trying to address is that while you get reputation points for being on a program committee or on an editorial board, you don’t get many for being an unknown journal referee who is actually supposedly doing the hard work or finally really checking the proofs.  Instead with public identities people can show off the hard work and their role in the community, as happens on more recent platforms like say stackexchange.</li><li>Authors will be free to submit anonymously, or not.  This choice will be made by the authors, not dictated by a committee.</li><li>And perhaps the most consequential thing that I am still debating, should all submissions be public? (Maybe not.)</li></ol>



<p/>



<p>To finish on a high note, a great thing about conferences is the fast turn-around.  It is really depressing — in other fields — to have to wait so long for any quantifiable feedback on your work, and this is definitely something which I liked about the TCS community.  But, to come back to the mood of the post, this good aspect (and others) of conferences can probably be kept while rethinking the not so good.  (For example, there could be a journal with deadlines similar to conferences, which is also what happens for grant proposals etc.)</p>

    <title>TR21-179 |  Smoothed Complexity of Learning Disjunctive Normal Forms, Inverting Fourier Transforms, and Verifying Small Circuits | 

	tatsuie tsukiji</title>
    <summary>This paper aims to derandomize the following problems in the smoothed analysis of Spielman and Teng. Learn Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), invert Fourier Transforms (FT), and verify small circuits' unsatisfiability. Learning algorithms must predict a future observation from the only $m$ i.i.d. samples of a fixed but unknown joint-distribution $P(G(x),y)$ to explain an $\eta$-noisy target. Inverters must retrieve the hidden parameter $\theta$. The smoothed analysis can weaken the adversarial distribution $P(x,y)$ by injecting an appropriate perturbation $G$ with larger min-entropy $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G)$.  We will establish 1--10 for planted functions (Goldreich's PRG) $f_\theta(x) = f(\theta \circ x_1,\ldots,\theta \circ x_d)$ with variables $x_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,2n-1\}$ plugged into $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor)\oplus x_i$ in 1--4, $\theta\circ x_i := \theta_i \cdot \lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor \cdot (-1)^{x_i}\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 5--6, and $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor) \cdot (-1)^{x_i} \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 7. 8--10 will verify the unsatisfiability of small circuits in the worst case analysis (i.e., $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$). Suppose $\log n \gg \log (ds/\varepsilon) + k$ in 1--4. Randomly pick an example $(X,Y)$ from the observed $m$ data in 4.

1. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$, $\mathrm{Max}k\mathrm{CSP}$ of any $k$-variate predicate $f$ requires the sample size $\Omega(n^{(k-\epsilon)/2}) \le m \le \tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ to distinguish between $|\max_\theta P(y=f_\theta(x)) - \max_\theta P'(y=f_\theta(x))| \ge \Omega(1)$ and $P(x,y) \equiv P'(x,y)$ in $n^{O(k)}$ time by given access to both samplers $P(x,y)$ and $P'(x,y)$.
2. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log s$, the planted $s$-term DNF demands $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log s)}$ for $c$ less than 1, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log s + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than 1, to make $n^{O(\log s)}$-time PAC learning (even under a slight noise).
3. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log 1/\varepsilon$, the $\mathrm{planted}$ $\mathrm{AND}$ needs $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$ for $c$ less than $1$, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log(1/\varepsilon) + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than $1$, to make $(\eta+\varepsilon)$-accurate agnostic learning in $n^{O(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$-time.
4. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(\log s)$, the $\mathrm{monotone}$ $\mathrm{DNF}$ with expanding $s$-terms is PAC learnable from $m = n\cdot \mathrm{poly}(s)$ data with $\mathrm{Pr}[\lfloor{{X_{i}/2}}\rfloor, \lfloor{{X_{i'}/2}}\rfloor] \ge {1}/{n^{1+\epsilon}}$  in $n \cdot \tilde{O}(s^{\log d})$ time.
5. LPN and LWE over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p\ge n^{\Omega(1)}$ hiding small secrets $\forall i, |\theta_i| = O(1)$ are breakable in polynomial time. 
6. GapSVP$_{\tilde{O}(n^2)}$ is breakable within polynomial time.
7. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(n)$, any $2^{n/2}$ by $2^{n/2}$ matrix with sparsity $2^{n-n^{\epsilon}}$ demands $\exp(n^{\Omega(1)})$ size $\mathrm{PH^{cc}}$ protocol unless it is learnable from $m = \exp(n^{\epsilon})$ data in $\exp(n^{\epsilon})$ time.
8. $\mathrm{VP} \ne \mathrm{VNP}$ or $\forall k, \mathrm{quasi}$-$NP \not\subset \mathrm{NC}^k$.
9. $\mathrm{PIT} \in \mathrm{DTIME}[n^{\mathrm{poly}(\log \log n)}]$ or $\forall \epsilon, \forall k, \mathrm{NTIME}[2^{n^{\epsilon}}] \not\subset \mathrm{SIZE}[n^k]$.
10. $\mathrm{quasi}$-$\mathrm{NP} \not\subset \mathrm{TC}^0$.</summary>

    <title>Did Lane Hemaspaandra invent the Fib numbers?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> (I abbreviate Fibonacci by Fib throughout. Lane Hemaspaandra helped me with this post.) </p><p>We all learned that Fib invented or discovered the Fib Numbers:</p><p>f_0=1,</p><p>f_1=1, and</p><p>for all n\ge 2, f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}.</p><p>We may have learned that they come up in nature (NOT true, see <a href="https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/fibonacc.htm">here</a>) or that they were important in mathematics (questionable--see this blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/01/how-important-are-fib-numbers-in-math.html">here</a> which says no, but some comments give good counterarguments). You also learned that Fibonacci was the mathematician who first studied them. Also not true!  This one surprised me. </p><p>1) I came across this blog post: <a href="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2021/11/16/why-names-matter/">here</a> that says they were invented by Hemachandra first. Wow--I then recalled that Lane Hemaspaandra's birth surname  was Lane Hemachandra (he married Edith Spaan and they are now both Hemaspaandra). So naturally I emailed him to ask how a 20th-century person could invent something earlier than 1170. He told me a picture of him in the basement ages while he stays young. </p><p>2) It would be nice to say OH, let's call them Hemachandra numbers (would that be  easier than convincing the world to use tau instead of pi,? See <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">The Tau Manifesto</a>) and let students know that there were people other than Europeans who did math back then. But even that story is not as simple as it seems. Lane emailed me this article: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/fibfibs.pdf">here</a> that tells the whole muddled story. (In what follows I leave out the accents.)</p><p>Virahanka seems to be the formulator of the Fib recurrence, though not quite the numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry.  He did this between 600 and 800 AD.</p><p>Gopala, in work prior to 1135, was aware of Virhanka's work. In particular he know about the inductive rule. But he also set the initial values and generated numbers, so he was the first to have the sequence we now call the Fib numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry. </p><p>Hemachandra in 1150 also formulated them, independently.  His motivation was Sanskrit poetry.</p><p>(I will learn some Sanskrit poetry the next time I teach Discrete Math so I can give the students an application of the material!)</p><p>So does Virhanka win? Hardly:</p><p>Acarya Pingala's writings from the 5th or 6th century BC (YES- BC!) indicate that he knew about the Fib numbers in the context of (you guessed it!) Sanskrit poetry. </p><p>3) I would support changing the name of the Fib Numbers to the Pingala numbers. This is both good and bad news for Lane:</p><p>a) Bad news in that he does not get a sequence of number that shares his pre-marriage name.</p><p>b) Good news in that if I settled on Hemachandra numbers then Lane and Edith would have to decide if 0 or 1 or 2 of them want to change their name to Hemachandra. I would guess not--too complicated. Plus one name change in a life is enough. </p><p>4) The story (especially  the articles I pointed to) shows just how complicated history can get. Even a straightforward question like:</p><p><i>Who first formulated the Fib Numbers?</i></p><p>might not have a well-defined answer. Perhaps this is  the wrong question since if people formulate the concept independent of each other, they should all get some credit.  Even if the authors are 1000 years apart. </p><p><i>Side note</i>: Independent Discovery may be harder to assert now since, with the web,  Alice could have seen Bob's paper so it may be hard to call Alice's discovery independent. As I have mentioned before on this blog, my students have a hard time with the notion of Cook and Levin coming up with NP-completeness independently  since  surely one would have posted it and the other would have seen it. An era before posting was possible! Unimaginable to them. Sometimes even to me. </p></div>

    <title>TR21-177 |  Johnson Coverage Hypothesis: Inapproximability of k-means and k-median in $\ell_p$-metrics | 

	Vincent Cohen-Addad, 

	Karthik  C. S., 

	Euiwoong Lee</title>
    <summary>k-median and k-means are the two most popular objectives for clustering algorithms. Despite intensive effort, a good understanding of the approximability of these objectives, particularly in $\ell_p$-metrics, remains a major open problem. In this paper, we significantly improve upon the hardness of approximation factors known in literature for these objectives in $\ell_p$-metrics. 
 
We introduce a new hypothesis called the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis (JCH), which roughly asserts that the well-studied k-max coverage problem on set systems is hard to approximate to a factor greater than $1-\frac{1}{e}$, even when the membership graph of the set system is a subgraph of the Johnson graph. We then show that together with generalizations of the embedding techniques introduced by Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19), JCH implies hardness of approximation results for k-median and k-means in $\ell_p$-metrics for factors which are close to the ones obtained for general metrics. In particular, assuming JCH we show that it is hard to approximate the k-means objective:

$\bullet$ Discrete case: To a factor of 3.94 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.73 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.56 and 1.17 respectively, obtained under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).

$\bullet$ Continuous case: To a factor of 2.10 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.36 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.07 in the $\ell_2$-metric obtained under UGC (and to the best of our knowledge, the continuous case of k-means in $\ell_1$-metric was not previously analyzed in literature).
 
We also obtain similar improvements under JCH for the k-median objective. Additionally, we prove a weak version of JCH using the work of Dinur et al. (SICOMP'05) on Hypergraph Vertex Cover, and recover all the results stated above of Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19) to (nearly) the same inapproximability factors but now under the standard NP$\neq$P assumption (instead of UGC).

Finally, we establish a strong connection between JCH and the long standing open problem of determining the Hypergraph Turan number. We then use this connection to prove improved SDP gaps (over the existing factors in literature) for k-means and k-median objectives.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Gerhard Ringel considered in 1959 the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider a finite family of circles such that every point in the plane is included in at most two circles. What is the minimum number of colors needed to color the circles so that tangent circles are colored with different colors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ringel 1959 circle problem</strong> is the question if this minimum number of colors is bounded.</p>
<p>I mentioned the problem in a post about <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/04/13/coloring-problems-for-arrangements-of-circles-and-pseudocircles/">eight coloring problems for arrangements of circles and pseudocircles</a>, three years ago. (For another recently solved conjecture by Ringel see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/01/27/ringel-conjecture-solved-congratulations-to-richard-montgomery-alexey-pokrovskiy-and-benny-sudakov/">this post</a>.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05042">recent arXiv paper</a> James Davies, Chaya Keller, Linda Kleist, Shakhar Smorodinsky, and Bartosz Walczak solved the problem and showed that any finite number of colors does not suffices. In fact the proved considerably more. The paper is</p>
<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05042">A solution to Ringel circle problem,</a></h3>
<p>and here is the abstract</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We construct families of circles in the plane such that their tangency graphs have arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number. This provides a strong negative answer to Ringel’s circle problem (1959). The proof relies on a (multidimensional) version of Gallai’s theorem with polynomial constraints, which we derive from the Hales-Jewett theorem and which may be of independent interest.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the authors.</p>

    <title>TR21-176 |  A super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus | 

	Theodoros Papamakarios</title>
    <summary>We show a quadratic separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus width. We use this gap to get, for the first time, first, a super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus for refuting CNF formulas, and secondly, a quadratic separation between resolution width and monomial space in polynomial calculus with resolution.  Our super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus only applies when clauses are seen as disjunctions of unbounded arity; our examples have linear size cut-free sequent calculus proofs writing, in a particular way, their clauses using binary disjunctions. Interestingly, this shows that the complexity of sequent calculus depends on how disjunctions are represented.</summary>

    <title>Defending the Status Quo</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>When the Wall Street Journal's <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/defending-mathematics-science-stem-equity-education-california-k12-math-matters-11638728196?reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">editorial board</a> and the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/07/hundreds-of-college-professors-blast-woke-math-movement/">New York Post</a> endorse your efforts, that should ring warning bells.</p><p>Several members of the theory and mathematics community and have written and endorsed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">Open Letter on K-12 Mathematics</a> that attacks the proposed revisions to the <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">California Mathematics Framework</a>. I have mixed feelings about these efforts. </p><p>Certainly the CMF has its issues, and the FAQs <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/mathfwfaqs.asp">protest too much</a>. But the letter goes too far in the other direction, arguing mainly for the status quo that worked well for those who signed the letter, very few of which have significant experience in K-12 education. The open letter allows for only incremental change unlikely to lead to any significant improvements.</p><p>Before you sign the letter, take a look at the CMF <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter1.docx">introduction</a></p><p/><blockquote><p>To develop learning that can lead to mathematical power for all California students, the framework has much to correct; the subject and community of mathematics has a history of exclusion and filtering, rather than inclusion and welcoming. There persists a mentality that some people are “bad in math” (or otherwise do not belong), and this mentality pervades many sources and at many levels. Girls and Black and Brown children, notably, represent groups that more often receive messages that they are not capable of high-level mathematics, compared to their White and male counterparts. As early as preschool and kindergarten, research and policy documents use deficit-oriented labels to describe Black and Latinx and low-income children’s mathematical learning and position them as already behind their white and middle-class peers. These signifiers exacerbate and are exacerbated by acceleration programs that stratify mathematics pathways for students as early as sixth grade.</p><p>Students internalize these messages to such a degree that undoing a self-identity that is “bad at math” to one that “loves math” is rare. Before students have opportunities to excel in mathematics, many often self-select out of mathematics because they see no relevance for their learning, and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics.</p></blockquote><p>You may or may not agree with the CMF approach, but it's hard to deny the real challenges they are trying to address and students they are trying to help. If you don't agree with the CMF, work with them to come up with a good alternative that helps create a more inclusive mathematical citizenry. An outright rejection of the approach won't fix problems and probably won't be taken seriously, except from the conservative press.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The holiday season is just around the corner. Best wishes to you and your loved ones in advance from us here at PTReview. This month, we had <s>four</s> five papers in all. To prepare for the festive mood associated with the onset of December, also included are brief updates on the recently disproven implicit graph conjecture. Let’s dig in. <em>(And please, do let us know if we missed your paper)</em>. </p>



<p>(<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Thanks to our readers for pointing out a paper we missed.)</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Downsampling for Testing and Learning in Product Distributions</strong> by Nathaniel Harms, Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07449">arXiv</a>). Contemplating on connections in algorithms used for testing a diverse collection of function properties, this paper provides a unified and generalized view of a technique: which the authors call downsampling. As the paper explains, the name is motivated by analogy to image/signal processing tasks. Very often, these tasks involve two steps. In the first step, you break the input domain into “grid cells”. You use oracle calls to the function to obtain a crude approximation over all these cells.  In the second step, you learn this gridded-up or coarsened function cell-by-cell.</p>



<p>This two-step attack could just be what the doctor ordered for your favorite function property testing problem: in particular, it has been put to work for approximately testing visual properties, approximating distance to monotonicity in high dimensions, testing \(k\)-monotone functions, and more. However, if you wanted to obtain property testers using this approach in the distribution-free setup, your ordeal might be far from over. The unknown distribution your domain is equipped with can mess with geometric arguments your gridding approach hopes to exploit. This is precisely the setup considered in the paper (i.e, distribution-free testing of function properties).</p>



<p>The essence of downsampling, is captured by a slick proposition that prescribes coarsening as your goto weapon if the<br/>1) fraction of cells on which \(f\) is not constant, and<br/>2) a measure of how non-uniform the unknown distribution D your domain is equipped with is </p>



<p>are both small.</p>



<p>Equipped with this machinery,  the paper tackles the task of designing distribution-free testers for boolean monotonicity with the underlying domain being \(\mathbb{R}^d\). The argument is pretty short and improves upon the sample complexity of the corresponding result in the paper by Black-Chakrabarti-Seshadhri. Do check it out, looks like some nice ammo to add to your toolkit.</p>



<p>Let’s stay on board for sublinear time algorithms for gap-edit distance. </p>



<p><strong>Gap Edit Distance via Non-Adaptive Queries: Simple and Optimal</strong> by Elazar Goldenberg, Tomasz Kociumaka, Robert Krauthgamer, Barna Saha (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12706">arXiv</a>). The edit distance problem needs no introduction. This paper studies the problem of approximating edit distance in sublinear time. In particular, this is formalized by introducing the gapped version of the problem. This entails the following computational task: Fix \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) and some \(c &gt; 0\). Given a pair \(x, y\) of strings over a finite alphabet, decide whether the edit distance between \(x,y\) is at most \(k\) or whether it is at least \(k^c\). This paper resolves the non-adaptive query complexity of edit distance and proves that the above gapped version can be decided in at most \(O\left(\frac{n}{k^{c – 1/2}}\right)\) queries. The paper also proves that this bound is almost optimal up to some polylog factors.</p>



<p/>



<p>Next up, we have <em>time-optimal</em> algorithms for maximum matching and vertex cover! Sweet, right?</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Time-Optimal Sublinear Algorithms for Matching and Vertex Cover</strong> by Soheil Behnezhad (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02942">arXiv</a>). This paper gives algorithms for the classic problem of estimating the size of vertex cover and maximum matching in graphs in sublinear time (in both adjacency matrix and adjacency list models). This is another nice read for the holiday season — after all the paper obtains time-optimal algorithms (up to polylog factors) in both of these models for a multiplicative-additive \((2, \varepsilon n)\) algorithms. Let me set up some historical context to appreciate the maximum matching result better.</p>



<p>In a classic work, Parnas and Ron gave sublinear time algorithms that obtain a \((2,  \varepsilon  n)\) estimate to the size of a maximum matching in a graph using query access to the adjacency list in sublinear time. Their sublinear time algorithm is inspired by ideas with roots in distributed algorithms. In particular, their algorithm returns in time<br/>\(\Delta^{O(\log {\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon}})}\) (where \(\Delta = \Delta(G)\) denotes the degree bound) an estimate \(\text{EST}\) to the size of the max-matching where \(OPT \leq \text{EST} \leq 2 \cdot OPT + \varepsilon  n\). Unfortunately, algorithms in this Parnas-Ron Framework must necessarily suffer a quasi-polynomial running time because of lower bounds from distributed algorithms. Using a randomized greedy approach to estimating the size of a maximum matching, Yoshida, Yamamoto, and Ito gave the first algorithm which returned a \((2,  \varepsilon n)\)-estimate to maximum matching in time \(poly(\Delta/\varepsilon)\). This is where the story essentially froze — though there were results that improved the dependence on \(\Delta\) to \(O(\Delta^2)\). Unfortunately, this is not truly sublinear for large \(\Delta\). In another direction, Kapralov-Mitrovic-Norouzi Fard-Tardos gave an algorithm that estimates the maximum matching size in time \(O(\Delta)\) (which is truly sublinear) but it no longer guarantees a \((2,  \varepsilon  n)\)-approximation and instead returns a \((O(1),  \varepsilon  n)\)-approximation. The current paper, as remarked above achieves the best of both worlds.</p>



<p/>



<!-- <p>Next up, a graph mining paper which explains why some heuristics work on real world graphs.</p> -->



<!-- <p> <strong>FPT Algorithms for Finding Near-Cliques in [latex]c[/latex]-Closed Graphs</strong> by Balaram Behera, Edin Husić, Shweta Jain, Tim Roughgarden, C. Seshadhri (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09768">arXiv</a>). Let us introduce the cast of characters this paper talks about. You call a graph [latex]c[/latex]-closed if any two non-adjacent vertices in your graph have at most [latex]c-1[/latex], common neighbors. The main theorem of the paper presents an FPT style algorithm which on input a [latex]c[/latex]-closed graph [latex]G[/latex] finds in time [latex]O(n^{2d+4} \cdot 4^c)[/latex] the entire list of all maximal induced subgraphs with small degeneracy. The heart of this paper is an alternative proof of a previous result by Fox et al which FPT style enumerates all the maximal cliques in [latex]c[/latex]-closed graphs. The current paper proves this via a backtracking approach that finds cliques and can be used for clique enumeration. The authors make the case that their proofs give mathematical justification for the empirical success of backtracking-based heuristics in mining real-life social networks.</p> -->



<p/>



<p/>



<p>Final stop, updates on the implicit graph conjecture.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>The Implicit Graph Conjecture is False</strong> by Hamed Hatami, Pooya Hatami (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13198">arXiv</a>). While not a property testing paper per se, it is always good to see an old conjecture resolved one way or the other. In this paper, the Hatami brothers (Pooya and Hamed) refute a three decade old conjecture — the one mentioned in the title. Here is a brief history. Sampath Kannan, Moni Naor and Steven Rudich defined the notion of implicit representation of graphs. Take a family of \(\mathcal{F}\) of graphs and consider a \(n\) vertex graph \(G \in \mathcal{F}\). You say this family admits an efficient implicit representation if there exists an assignment of \(O(\log n)\) length labels to all the vertices in \(V(G)\) such that the adjacencies between every pair of vertices is a function of the labels of the corresponding pair. Crucially, the labeling function may depend on the family, but not on individual graphs in the family. What is cool about families admitting such an efficient implicit representation, is that the number of \(n\)-vertex graphs in this family cannot be any bigger than \(2^{O(n \log n)}\) — that is such families have at most factorial growth rate. Implicit graph conjecture asserts that for every hereditary graph family, the converse also holds. Namely, if the hereditary family has at most factorial growth rate, then the family admits efficient implicit representations. The key, as shown in this paper (which spans all of six pages!) is to choose as your hereditary graph class, the closure of a random collection of graphs. The authors show that now your hand is forced and your representation will no longer be efficient. However, annoyingly, your hereditary graph class need not have a factorial growth rate as taking the closure of a random collection expands to contain all graphs and has growth rate \(2^{\Omega(n^2)}\). The cool thing is, you can avoid this issue by choosing a random collection of slightly sparse random graphs (with \(n^{2-\varepsilon}\) edges). Interestingly, this gives you enough ammo to finally control the growth rate which in turn allows the authors to slay this conjecture.</p>



<p>(<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Omitted Stop, added retroactively). </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating von Neumann entropy</strong> by Tom Gur, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Sathyawageeswar Subramanian (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11139">arXiv</a>). This paper presents quantum algorithms for the problem of obtaining multiplicative estimates of the Shannon entropy of the familiar classical distributions and the more exotic von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum systems. In particular, the paper presents an \(\widetilde{O}(n^{\frac{1+\eta }{2\gamma^2 }})\)-query quantum algorithm that achieves a \(\gamma\)-multiplicative approximation algorithm for the Shannon Entropy of an input distribution \(\mathbf{p}\) supported on a universe of size \(n\) where \(H(\mathbf{p}) \geq \gamma/\eta\). As if this were not already cool enough, the paper also presents sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating Von Neumann Entropy as well. This is supplemented by a lower bound of \(\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{3 \gamma^2}})\) queries for achieving a \(\gamma\)-factor approximation for any of these two kinds of entropies. </p></div>

    <title>Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Clause for Complexity Theorists, If you Only Believe</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Guest Post by Hunter Monroe)
   

In this  guest post and <a href="https://speedupblogger.wordpress.com/2021/12/05/unifying-conjectures-on-complexity-and-noncomputability/">discussion paper</a>, I present a remarkable set of structurally similar conjectures which, if you only believe them, conjure up a dream world for theorists by asserting a new form of diagonalization based on naturally nonrelativizing facts invoking a deep linkage to underlying noncomputable languages. These conjectures, all stronger than the things to be proved, imply that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse because the arithmetic hierarchy does not collapse, and P≠NP≠coNP. The diagonalizations imply the existence of hard instances, with the result that many complexity classes have speedup, including the Π side of PH, and proof speedup for tautologies stems from proof speedup for arithmetic. These conjectures do two things: (1) let us explore a hypothetical world where many open problems about uniform complexity classes are resolved and consider steps beyond e.g. to circuit complexity, and (2) reduce numerous open questions to a single plausible claim about how Turing machines have limited information about noncomputable languages. This would potentially allow a slew of open questions to be resolved at once with a skeleton key.<p>The following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3765">conjecture</a> implying $\textbf{P!=NP}$ is remarkable: it hints at a deeper, unnoticed relationship between complexity and noncomputability; it is <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/scan10.pdf">equivalent</a> to speedup for all paddable $\textbf{coNP}$-complete languages and in proof length for tautologies; tweaked versions would separate other complexity classes; and if true it is a nonrelativizing fact.</p><p/>



Conjecture: (*) For any deterministic TM $M$ accepting the $\textbf{coNP}$-complete language ``nondeterministic TM $N$ on input $x$ does not halt within $t$ steps'' ($\texttt{coBHP}$), there exists a $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ ($N'$ does not halt on $x'$, ever) with $M$'s running time $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by any polynomial.

<p/>

If true, (*) is a nonrelativizing fact; there is no hard $\langle N, x\rangle$ for $M$ with an exponential time oracle. The noncomputable language $\texttt{coHP}$ potentially explains why (*) is true, by analogy with this trivial theorem:

<p/>


Theorem. For any $M$ accepting $\texttt{coBHP}$, there exists some non-halting $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ with $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by a constant.

<p/>


Otherwise, $M$ would accept $\texttt{coHP}$ and have too much information about a non-c.e. language; (*) is just a stronger version. In the extreme, any $M$ is completely ignorant about some $\langle N',x'\rangle$ and requires on the order of $2^t$ steps to rule out every potentially halting branch.  Tweaking (*) yields conjectures implying that $\textbf{PH}$ does not collapse:

<p/>


Conjectures: For any $M^{\Pi^p_i}$ that accepts $\Pi^p_{i+1}=\{\langle N^{\Pi^p_i},x,1^t\rangle|$ $N^{\Pi^p_i}$ does not halt on input $x$ in $t$ steps$\}$, there is a non-halting $\langle N'^{\Pi^p_i},x'\rangle\in \Pi_i$ with $M^{\Pi^p_i}$'s running time not bounded by any polynomial.

<p/>


By invoking every level $\Pi_i$ of the arithmetic hierarchy ($\textbf{AH}$), these conjectures state that the noncollapse $\textbf{PH}$ is due to the noncollapse of $\textbf{AH}$. The conjecture (*) can be calibrated depending on the desired separation to equip $M$ with an oracle or nondeterminism or constrain its resources, to choose a resource-bounded complete problem and underlying non-c.e. language, and to fine tune how hard a hard instance needs to be.

<p/>


Proof speedup for tautologies (equivalent to (*)) may stem from the proof speedup for arithmetic that occurs when adding undecidable statements as new axioms, allowing new theorems to be proved and shortening the proof of existing theorems. This literature translates any arithmetic theorem free of existential quantifiers into a tautology by replacing $k$-bit numbers with $k$ Boolean variables. The analogy with (*) suggests this stronger conjecture may in fact also be equivalent:

<p/>


Conjecture: The following two statements are equivalent: (1) there is no optimal propositional proof system; and (2) Any propositional proof system $P$ is outperformed by a sufficiently powerful conservative extension $T$ of the Peano arithmetic, and $T$ can be improved further by adding any undecidable statement in $T$ as a new axiom.

<p/>


So (*) is a Swiss army knife for generating conjectures that give us a vision of a world in which answering essentially one question would serve as a skeleton key that unlocks many open problems.</div>

    <title>TR21-174 |  Sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating von Neumann entropy | 

	Sathyawageeswar Subramanian, 

	Tom Gur, 

	Min-Hsiu Hsieh</title>
    <summary>Entropy is a fundamental property of both classical and quantum systems, spanning myriad theoretical and practical applications in physics and computer science. We study the problem of obtaining estimates to within a multiplicative factor $\gamma&gt;1$ of the Shannon entropy of probability distributions and the von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum states. Our main results are:

       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the Shannon entropy $H(\mathbf{p})$ of a classical probability distribution $\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\ldots,p_n)$;
       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac12+\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ of a density matrix $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$.

    In both cases, the input is assumed to have entropy bounded away from zero by a quantity determined by the parameter $\eta&gt;0$, since, as we prove, no polynomial query algorithm can multiplicatively approximate the entropy of distributions with arbitrarily low entropy. In addition, we provide $\Omega\left(n^{\frac{1}{3\gamma^2}}\right)$ lower bounds on the query complexity of $\gamma$-multiplicative estimation of Shannon and von Neumann entropies.

    We work with the quantum purified query access model, which can handle both classical probability distributions and mixed quantum states, and is the most general input model considered in the literature.</summary>
