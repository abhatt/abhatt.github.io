    <title>TR21-045 |  Reconstruction Algorithms for Low-Rank Tensors and Depth-3 Multilinear Circuits | 

	Vishwas Bhargava, 

	Shubhangi Saraf, 

	Ilya Volkovich</title>
    <summary>We give new and efficient black-box reconstruction algorithms for some classes of depth-$3$ arithmetic circuits. As a consequence, we obtain the first efficient algorithm for computing the tensor rank and for finding the optimal tensor decomposition as a sum of rank-one tensors when then input is a {\it constant-rank} tensor. More specifically, we provide efficient learning algorithms that run in randomized polynomial time over general fields and in deterministic polynomial time over $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb C$ for the following classes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\it Set-multilinear depth-$3$ circuits of constant top fan-in ($\Sigma\Pi\Sigma_{{\sqcup_j X_j}}(k)$ circuits)}. As a consequence of our algorithm, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm for tensor rank computation and optimal tensor decomposition of constant-rank tensors. This result holds for $d$ dimensional tensors for any $d$, but is interesting even for $d=3$.
    \item {\it Sums of powers of constantly many linear forms ($\Sigma\!\wedge\!\Sigma(k)$ circuits)}.  As a consequence we obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm for tensor rank computation and optimal tensor decomposition of constant-rank symmetric tensors.
    \item {\it Multilinear depth-3 circuits of constant top fan-in (multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma(k)$ circuits)}. Our algorithm works over all fields of characteristic 0 or large enough characteristic. Prior to our work the only efficient algorithms known were over polynomially-sized finite fields \cite{KarninShpilka09}. 
\end{enumerate}
Prior to our work, the only polynomial-time or even subexponential-time algorithms known (deterministic or randomized) for subclasses of $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma(k)$ circuits that also work over large/infinite fields were for the setting when the top fan-in $k$ is at most $2$ \cite{Sin16, Sin20}.</summary>

    <title>TR21-044 |  SAT-based Circuit Local Improvement | 

	Alexander Kulikov, 

	Nikita Slezkin</title>
    <summary>Finding exact circuit size is a notorious optimization problem in practice. Whereas modern computers and algorithmic techniques allow to find a circuit of size seven in blink of an eye, it may take more than a week to search for a circuit of size thirteen. One of the reasons of this behavior is that the search space is enormous: the number of circuits of size $s$ is $s^{\Theta(s)}$, the number of Boolean functions on $n$ variables is $2^{2^n}$.

In this paper, we explore the following natural heuristic idea for decreasing the size of a given circuit: go through all its subcircuits of moderate size and check whether any of them can be improved by reducing to SAT. This may be viewed as a local search approach: we search for a smaller circuit in a ball around a given circuit. We report the results of experiments with various symmetric functions.</summary>

dual tree, we prove a combinatorial analog of the classic Helmholz-Hodge
decomposition of a smooth vector field. Specifically, we show that for every
polyhedral complex, $K$, and every dimension, $p$, there is a partition of the
set of $p$-cells into a maximal $p$-tree, a maximal $p$-cotree, and a
collection of $p$-cells whose cardinality is the $p$-th Betti number of $K$.
Given an ordering of the $p$-cells, this tri-partition is unique, and it can be
computed by a matrix reduction algorithm that also constructs canonical bases
of cycle and boundary groups.

    <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for 2-Dimensional Knapsack: Packing into Multiple L-Shapes, Spirals, and More</title>

knapsack and a collection of $n$ rectangular items with integer sizes and
profits. Our goal is to find the most profitable subset of items that can be
packed non-overlappingly into the knapsack. The currently best known
polynomial-time approximation factor for 2DK is $17/9+\varepsilon&lt;1.89$ and
there is a $(3/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm if we are allowed to
rotate items by 90 degrees~{[}G\'alvez et al., FOCS 2017{]}. In this paper, we
give $(4/3+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms in polynomial time for both
cases, assuming that all input data are {integers polynomially bounded in $n$}.
</p>
<p>G\'alvez et al.'s algorithm for 2DK partitions the knapsack into a constant
number of rectangular regions plus \emph{one} L-shaped region and packs items
into those {in a structured way}. We generalize this approach by allowing up to
a \emph{constant} number of {\emph{more general}} regions that can have the
shape of an L, a U, a Z, a spiral, and more, and therefore obtain an improved
approximation ratio. {In particular, we present an algorithm that computes the
essentially optimal structured packing into these regions. }

    <title>Nearest-Neighbor Queries in Customizable Contraction Hierarchies and Applications</title>

planning frameworks in practice, due to their simplicity and versatility. In
this work, we present a novel algorithm for finding k-nearest neighbors in
customizable contraction hierarchies by systematically exploring the associated
separator decomposition tree. Compared to previous bucket-based approaches, our
algorithm requires much less target-dependent preprocessing effort. Moreover,
we use our novel approach in two concrete applications. The first application
are online k-closest point-of-interest queries, where the points of interest
are only revealed at query time. We achieve query times of about 25
milliseconds on a continental road network, which is fast enough for
interactive systems. The second application is travel demand generation. We
show how to accelerate a recently introduced travel demand generator by a
factor of more than 50 using our novel nearest-neighbor algorithm.

    <title>Comparative Design-Choice Analysis of Color Refinement Algorithms Beyond the Worst Case</title>

well as practice. It has further applications in machine learning and in
computational problems from linear algebra. While tight lower bounds for the
worst case complexity are known [Berkholz, Bonsma, Grohe, ESA2013] no
comparative analysis of design choices for color refinement algorithms is
available. We devise two models within which we can compare color refinement
algorithms using formal methods, an online model and an approximation model. We
use these to show that no online algorithm is competitive beyond a logarithmic
factor and no algorithm can approximate the optimal color refinement splitting
scheme beyond a logarithmic factor. We also directly compare strategies used in
practice showing that, on some graphs, queue based strategies outperform stack
based ones by a logarithmic factor and vice versa. Similar results hold for
strategies based on priority queues.

The
climate change and the growth of urban areas may further increase the
probability of incidence of large-scale fires. The risk of fire can be lowered
with preventive measures. Among them, firefighting lines are used to stop the
fire from spreading beyond them. Due to high costs of installation and
maintenance, their placement must be carefully planned. In this work, we
address the wildfire management problem from a theoretical point of view and
define a risk function to model the fire diffusion phenomena. The land is
modeled by a mixed graph in which vertices are areas subject to fire with a
certain probability while edges model the probability of fire spreading from
one area to another. To reduce the risk, we introduce the {\sc Windy Firebreak
Location} problem that addresses the optimal positioning of firefighting lines
under budget constraints. We study the complexity of the problem and prove its
hardness even when the graph is planar, bipartite, with maximum degree four and
the propagation probabilities are equal to one. We also show an efficient
polynomial time algorithm for particular instances on trees.

    <title>Regularized Non-monotone Submodular Maximization</title>

non-monotone submodular function subject to various constraints, i.e., $\max \{
g(A) - \ell(A) : A \in \mathcal{F} \}$, where $g \colon 2^\Omega \to
\mathbb{R}_+$ is a non-monotone submodular function, $\ell \colon 2^\Omega \to
\mathbb{R}_+$ is a normalized modular function and $\mathcal{F}$ is the
constraint set. Though the objective function $f := g - \ell$ is still
submodular, the fact that $f$ could potentially take on negative values
prevents the existing methods for submodular maximization from providing a
constant approximation ratio for the regularized submodular maximization
problem. To overcome the obstacle, we propose several algorithms which can
provide a relatively weak approximation guarantee for maximizing regularized
non-monotone submodular functions. More specifically, we propose a continuous
greedy algorithm for the relaxation of maximizing $g - \ell$ subject to a
matroid constraint. Then, the pipage rounding procedure can produce an integral
solution $S$ such that $\mathbb{E} [g(S) - \ell(S)] \geq e^{-1}g(OPT) -
\ell(OPT) - O(\epsilon)$. Moreover, we present a much faster algorithm for
maximizing $g - \ell$ subject to a cardinality constraint, which can output a
solution $S$ with $\mathbb{E} [g(S) - \ell(S)] \geq (e^{-1} - \epsilon) g(OPT)
- \ell(OPT)$ using $O(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2} \ln \frac 1\epsilon)$ value oracle
queries. We also consider the unconstrained maximization problem and give an
algorithm which can return a solution $S$ with $\mathbb{E} [g(S) - \ell(S)]
\geq e^{-1} g(OPT) - \ell(OPT)$ using $O(n)$ value oracle queries.

    <title>Lower bound the T-count via unitary stabilizer nullity</title>

bounds on the non-Clifford resources for fault-tolerant quantum computation.
First, we introduce the stabilizer nullity of an arbitrary multi-qubit unitary,
which is based on the subgroup of the quotient Pauli group associated with the
unitary. This unitary stabilizer nullity extends the state stabilizer nullity
by Beverland et al. to a dynamic version. We in particular show this magic
measure has desirable properties such as sub-additivity under composition and
additivity under tensor product. Second, we prove that a given unitary's
stabilizer nullity is a lower bound for the T-count, utilizing the above
properties in gate synthesis. Third, we compare the state and the unitary
stabilizer nullity, proving that the lower bounds for the T-count obtained by
the unitary stabilizer nullity are never less than the state stabilizer
nullity. Moreover, we show an explicit $n$-qubit unitary family of unitary
stabilizer nullity $2n$, which implies that its T-count is at least $2n$. This
gives an example where the bounds derived by the unitary stabilizer nullity
strictly outperform the state stabilizer nullity by a factor of $2$. We further
connect the unitary stabilizer nullity and the state stabilizer nullity with
auxiliary systems, showing that adding auxiliary systems and choosing proper
stabilizer states can strictly improving the lower bound obtained by the state
stabilizer nullity.

images, per-pixel accuracy is not the only metric of concern. Topological
correctness, such as vessel connectivity and membrane closure, is crucial for
downstream analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a new approach to train
deep image segmentation networks for better topological accuracy. In
particular, leveraging the power of discrete Morse theory (DMT), we identify
global structures, including 1D skeletons and 2D patches, which are important
for topological accuracy. Trained with a novel loss based on these global
structures, the network performance is significantly improved especially near
topologically challenging locations (such as weak spots of connections and
membranes). On diverse datasets, our method achieves superior performance on
both the DICE score and topological metrics.

degree and weak local limit. The threshold for the existence of a giant
strongly connected component, as well as the asymptotic fraction of nodes with
giant fan-in or giant fan-out are local, in the sense that they are the same
for two sequences with the same weak local limit. The digraph has a bow-tie
structure, with all but a vanishing fraction of nodes lying either in the
unique strongly connected giant and its fan-in and fan-out, or in sets with
small fan-in and small fan-out. All local quantities are expressed in terms of
percolation on the limiting rooted graph, without any structural assumptions on
the limit, allowing, in particular, for non tree-like limits.
</p>
<p>In the course of proving these results, we prove that for unoriented
percolation, there is a unique giant above criticality, whose size and critical
threshold are again local. An application of our methods shows that the
critical threshold for bond percolation and random digraphs on preferential
attachment graphs is $0$.

    <title>Compact enumeration for scheduling one machine</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/v/Vakhania:Nodari.html">Nodari Vakhania</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09900">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A strongly NP-hard scheduling problem in which non-simultaneously released
jobs with delivery times are to be scheduled on a single machine with the
objective to minimize the maximum job full completion time is considered. We
describe an exact implicit enumeration algorithm (IEA) and a polynomial-time
approximation scheme (PTAS) for the single-machine environment. Although the
worst-case complexity analysis of IEA yields a factor of $\nu!$, $\nu&gt;n$, large
sets of the permutations of the critical jobs can be discarded by incorporating
a heuristic search strategy, in which the permutations of the so-called
critical jobs are considered in a special priority order. Not less importantly,
in practice, the number $\nu$ turns out to be several times smaller than the
total number of jobs $n$, and it becomes smaller when $n$ increases. The above
characteristics also apply to the proposed PTAS, which worst-case time
complexity can be expressed as $O(\kappa!\kappa k n \log n)$, where $\kappa$ is
the number of the long critical jobs ($\kappa&lt;&lt;\nu$) and the corresponding
approximation factor is $1+1/k$, where $\kappa&lt;k$. We show that the probability
that a considerable number of permutations (far less than $\kappa!$) are
enumerated is close to 0. Hence, with a high probability, the running time of
PTAS is fully polynomial.

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">For years, I’d sometimes hear discussions about the ethics of quantum computing research. Quantum ethics!

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>For years, I’d sometimes hear discussions about the <em>ethics</em> of quantum computing research.  Quantum ethics!</p>



<p>When the debates weren’t purely semantic, over the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">propriety</a> of terms like “quantum supremacy” or “ancilla qubit,” they were always about chin-strokers like “but what if cracking RSA encryption gives governments more power to surveil their citizens?  or what if only a few big countries or companies get quantum computers, thereby widening the divide between haves and have-nots?”  Which, OK, conceivably these will someday be issues.  But, besides barely depending on any specific facts about quantum computing, these debates always struck me as oddly <em>safe</em>, because the moral dilemmas were so hypothetical and far removed from us in time.</p>



<p>I confess I may have even occasionally poked fun when asked to expound on quantum ethics.  I may have commented that quantum computers probably won’t kill anyone unless a dilution refrigerator tips over onto their head.  I may have asked forgiveness for feeding custom-designed oracles to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP">BQP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QMA">QMA</a>, without first consulting an ethics committee about the long-term effects on those complexity classes.</p>



<p>Now fate has punished me for my flippancy.  These days, I really <em>do</em> feel like quantum computing research has become an ethical minefield—but not for any of the reasons mentioned previously.  What’s new is that millions of dollars are now potentially available to quantum computing researchers, along with equity, stock options, and whatever else causes “ka-ching” sound effects and bulging eyes with dollar signs.  And in many cases, to have a shot at such riches, all an expert needs to do is profess optimism that quantum computing will have revolutionary, world-changing applications and have them <em>soon</em>.  Or at least, not object too strongly when others say that.</p>



<p>Some of today’s rhetoric will of course remind people of the D-Wave saga, which first brought this blog to prominence when it began in earnest in 2007.  Quantum computers, we hear now as then, will soon leave the Earth’s fastest supercomputers in the dust.  They’re going to harness superposition to try all the exponentially many possible solutions at once.  They’ll crack the Traveling Salesman Problem, and will transform machine learning and AI beyond recognition.  Meanwhile, simulations of quantum systems will be key to solving global warming and cancer.</p>



<p>Despite the parallels, though, this new gold rush <em>doesn’t</em> feel to me like the D-Wave one, which seems in retrospect like just a little dry run.  If I had to articulate what’s new in one sentence, it’s that this time “the call is coming from inside the house.”  Many of the companies making wildly overhyped claims are recognized leaders of the field.  They have brilliant quantum computing theorists and experimentalists on their staff with impeccable research records.  Some of those researchers are among my best friends.  And even when I wince at the claims of near-term applications, in many cases (especially with quantum simulation) the claims aren’t <em>obviously</em> false—we won’t know for certain until we try it and see!  It’s genuinely gotten harder to draw the line between defensible optimism and exaggerations verging on fraud.</p>



<p>Indeed, this time around virtually <em>everyone</em> in QC is “complicit” to a greater or lesser degree.  I, too, have accepted compensation to consult on quantum computing topics, to give talks at hedge funds, and in a few cases to serve as a scientific adviser to quantum computing startups.  I tell myself that, by 2021 standards, this stuff is all trivial chump change—a few thousands of dollars here or there, to expound on the same themes that I already discuss free of charge on this blog.  I actually get paid to <em>dispel</em> hype, rather than propagate it!  I tell myself that I’ve turned my back on the orders of magnitude more money available to those willing to hitch their scientific reputations to the aspirations of this or that specific QC company.  (Yes, this blog, and my desire to preserve its intellectual independence and credibility, might well be costing me millions!)</p>



<p>But, OK, some would argue that accepting <em>any</em> money from QC companies or QC investors just puts you at the top of a slope with unabashed snake-oil salesmen at the bottom.  With the commercialization of our field that started around 2015, there’s no bright line anymore marking the boundary between pure scientific curiosity and the pursuit of filthy lucre; it’s all just points along a continuum.  I’m not sure that these people are wrong.</p>



<p>As some of you might’ve seen already, IonQ, the trapped-ion QC startup that originated from the University of Maryland, is poised to have the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ionq-m-a-dmy-technology/quantum-computing-provider-ionq-to-go-public-via-2-billion-spac-deal-idUSKBN2B013Z">first-ever quantum computing IPO</a>—a so-called “SPAC IPO,” which while I’m a financial ignoramus, apparently involves merging with a shell company and thereby bypassing the SEC’s normal IPO rules.  Supposedly they’re seeking $650 million in new funding and a $2 billion market cap.  If you want to see what IonQ is saying about QC to prospective investors, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e33152a051d2e7588f7571c/t/60459578b8c075444a656357/1615173012167/IonQ+Investor+Presentation+030721+vFF.pdf">click here</a>.  Lacking any choice in the matter, I’ll probably say more about these developments in a future post.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://psiquantum.com/">PsiQuantum</a>, the Palo-Alto-based optical QC startup, has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5af3039-abbf-4b25-92e2-c40e5957c8cd">said</a> that it’s soon going to leave “stealth mode.”  And Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Honeywell, and other big players continue making large investments in QC—treating it, at least rhetorically, not at all like blue-sky basic research, but like a central part of their future business plans.</p>



<p>All of these companies have produced or funded excellent QC research.  And of course, they’re all heterogeneous, composed of individuals who might vehemently disagree with each other about the near- or long-term prospects of QC.  And yet all of them have, at various times, inspired reflections in me like the ones in this post.</p>



<p>I regret that this post has no clear conclusion.  I’m still hashing things out, solicing thoughts from my readers and friends.  Speaking of which: this coming Monday, March 22, at 8-10pm US Eastern time, I’ve decided to hold a discussion around these issues on <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a>—my “grand debut” on that app, and an opportunity to see whether I like it or not!  My friend Adam Brown will moderate the discussion; other likely participants will be John Horgan, George Musser, Michael Nielsen, and Matjaž Leonardis.  If you’re on Clubhouse, I hope to see you there!</p></div>

Daniela Kühn is the Mason Professor in Mathematics at the University of Birmingham. She works in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. She has many honors, including giving an invited lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2014.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we should look at a new result of hers.</p>
<p>
By the way, as I wrote this draft, I was excited to see that it was the second time we highlighted a researcher from Bi*ngham*. <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com">Previously</a> we highlighted Jessica Fridrich, from Binghamton University. OK, they are different places, in different countries, but the closeness in edit distance caught my eye.</p>
<p>
Kühn says <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/maths/kuhn-daniela.aspx">here</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Recently I have focused on sufficient conditions for Hamilton cycles in directed graphs, i.e. cycles which contain all the vertices of the directed graph. It is unlikely that there is a good characterization of all (directed) graphs containing a Hamilton cycle since the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete. So it is natural to ask for sufficient conditions for the existence of a Hamilton cycle. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here is her <a href="https://silo.tips/download/hamiltonian-degree-sequences-in-digraphs">paper</a> on degree sequences on directed graphs that force Hamilton cycles. It is joint with Deryk Osthus and Andrew Treglown. </p>

Paul Erdős is known for his conjectures as well as his countless results. Here are two of his open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conjectures_by_Paul_Erdos">ones</a> that are directly about graphs: </p>
<ol>
<li>The Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture on coloring unions of cliques.
</li><li>The Erdős-Hajnal conjecture that in a family of graphs defined by an excluded induced subgraph, every graph has either a large clique or a large independent set.
</li></ol>
<p>Of course math is tricky: A conjecture like the—</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Erdős-Szekeres conjecture on the number of points needed to ensure that a point set contains a large convex polygon. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>—could still be about graphs. Consider the graph that is <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\dots}"/></p>
<p>
Well, the conjecture (1) is now claimed to be solved, and so the list of open conjectures is one less. Kühn with co-authors Dong Yeap Kang, Tom Kelly, Abhishek Methuku, and Deryk Osthus have claimed to resolve it. I have no reason to doubt these top researchers—it’s just until it is refereed. Their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04698.pdf">paper</a> is cleverly titled: A Proof Of The Erdős-Faber-Lovász Conjecture. </p>

This conjecture, now almost 50 years old, states that a graph that consists of complete graphs of size <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> that barely overlap can be colored with <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> colors. Here barely overlap is they have no edge in common. </p>
<p>
That is: If <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/> complete graphs, each having exactly <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/> vertices, have the property that every pair of complete graphs has at most one shared vertex, then the union of the graphs can be properly colored with <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/> colors. The following picture should help you understand the conjecture:</p>

The conjecture can be stated various ways:<br/>

<p>
The chromatic index of a hypergraph <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{H}"/> is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{H}"/> so that any two edges that share a vertex have different colors.</p>
<p/><h2> Previous Results </h2><p/>
<p>
While Kühn’s paper solves the conjecture, there were many partial results before. These prefer to view the conjecture as one about hypergraphs. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A linear hypergraph (also known as partial linear space) is a hypergraph with the property that every two hyperedges have at most one vertex in common. A hypergraph is said to be uniform if all of its hyperedges have the same number of vertices as each other.

In this language, the Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture states that, given any <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>-uniform linear hypergraph with <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> hyperedges, one may <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>-color the vertices such that each hyperedge has one vertex of each color.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
A simple hypergraph is a hypergraph in which at most one hyperedge connects any pair of vertices and there are no hyperedges of size at most one. In the graph coloring formulation of the Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture, it is safe to remove vertices that belong to a single clique, as their coloring presents no difficulty; once this is done, the hypergraph that has a vertex for each clique, and a hyperedge for each graph vertex, forms a simple hypergraph. And, the hypergraph dual of vertex coloring is edge coloring. Thus, the Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture is equivalent to the statement that any simple hypergraph with <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> vertices has chromatic index (edge coloring number) at most <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>. </em>

    <title>TR21-043 |  Promise Problems Meet Pseudodeterminism | 

	Peter Dixon, 

	A.  Pavan, 

	N. V. Vinodchandran</title>
    <summary>The  Acceptance Probability Estimation Problem (APEP) is to additively approximate the acceptance probability of a Boolean circuit. This problem admits a probabilistic approximation scheme. A central question is whether we can design a pseudodeterministic approximation algorithm for this problem: a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a canonical approximation with high probability. Recently, it was shown that such an algorithm would imply that every approximation algorithm can be made pseudodeterministic (Dixon, Pavan, Vinodchandran; (ITCS 2021).    

The main conceptual contribution of this work is to establish that the existence of a pseudodeterministic algorithm for APEP is fundamentally connected to the relationship between probabilistic promise classes and the corresponding standard complexity classes. In particular, we show the following equivalence:  every promise problem in PromiseBPP has a solution in BPP if and only if APEP has a pseudodeterministic algorithm. Based on this intuition, we show that pseudodeterministic algorithms for APEP  can shed light on a few central topics in complexity theory such as circuit lowerbounds, probabilistic hierarchy theorems, and multi-pseudodeterminism.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In Rome we have an expression, <em>mai una gioia</em> (literally, “never (a moment of) joy”) that applies well to the present times. Yesterday, there was, finally, something to be joyous about: the announcement that two of my heroes, Laszlo Lovasz and Avi Wigderson, will share the 2021 Abel Prize, one of the highest honors of mathematics.</p>
<p>The reader can find a very good article about them on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/avi-wigderson-and-laszlo-lovasz-win-abel-prize-20210317/">Quanta Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of talking about their greatest accomplishment, here I would like to recall two beautiful and somewhat related results, that admit a short treatment.</p>
<p><span id="more-4504"/></p>
<p>Avi’s first paper was on the 3-coloring problem. He described a polynomial time algorithm that, given a 3-colorable graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, finds a valid coloring of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with <img alt="{O(\sqrt n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors, where <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the number of vertices. The starting point is that if every vertex in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> had degree <img alt="{\leq \sqrt n -1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cleq+%5Csqrt+n+-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then there is an easy way to color the graph with <img alt="{\sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors (look at the vertices in any order, choose for each vertex a color not already used for the neighbors that have already been considered).</p>
<p>What if there is some vertex <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of degree <img alt="{\geq \sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgeq+%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? Well, and this is the idea of the paper, the <em>neighbors of <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> must induce a bipartite subgraph</em>, so we can color the neighbors of <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with 2 colors in a way that is consistent with all the edges between neighbors of <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then remove the neighbors of <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and continue with the rest of the graph, committing to never use those two colors again. Every time we do this, we consume two colors but we get rid of <img alt="{\geq \sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgeq+%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> vertices, so this costs us at most <img alt="{2\sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors. When we are done, all remaining vertices have degree <img alt="{\leq \sqrt n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cleq+%5Csqrt+n-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and we just need <img alt="{\sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> more colors as observed above.</p>
<p>In total, we used at most <img alt="{3\sqrt n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors.</p>
<p>This remained the state of the art for approximate graph coloring for a few years, until Avrim Blum improved the bound for 3-colorable graphs to <img alt="{O(n^{0.4})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B0.4%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and then to <img alt="{O(n^{3/8})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B3%2F8%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors, using more sophisticated combinatorial arguments. Later, Karger, Motwani and Sudan devised an approximation algorithm that uses <img alt="{\tilde O(n^{1/4})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+O%28n%5E%7B1%2F4%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors to color 3-colorable graphs, and is based on a semidefinite programming relaxation of the coloring problem, which is related to the Lovasz <em>theta function</em>. It is still open whether there is a polynomial time algorithm that uses <img alt="{n^{o(1)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> colors.</p>
<p>The Lovasz theta function <img alt="{\theta (G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta+%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a convex relaxation of the maximum independent set problem in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. It is, or it can be formulated as, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the maximum independent set problem, and so it can be computed (up to arbitrarily good accuracy) in polynomial time.</p>
<p>Lovasz defined the theta function to study the <em>Shannon capacity of a graph</em>. This is a question that arises when one wants to find error-correcting codes for a channel that may introduce errors. Suppose that the channel carries an element of an alphabet <img alt="{V}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of size <img alt="{n=|V|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D%7CV%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and that certain pairs of alphabet elements can be “confused” by the channel, meaning that for certain pairs <img alt="{\{ a,b \}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B+a%2Cb+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> the channel may output <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> given <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or viceversa. If we construct the graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> whose vertex set is <img alt="{V}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and whose edges are the pairs of “confusable” pairs, then an independent set in this graph gives a set of length-1 codewords that are not confusable, and <img alt="{\log_2 \alpha(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog_2+%5Calpha%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="{\alpha(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the size of a maximal independent set in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, is the number of bits that we can transmit in an errorless way by making one use of the channel. If we can access the channel <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> times, then an errorless code is an independent set in <img alt="{G^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the graph that has vertex set <img alt="{V^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and such that <img alt="{((a_1,\ldots,a_k),(b_1,\ldots,b_k))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%28a_1%2C%5Cldots%2Ca_k%29%2C%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_k%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an edge if and only if all the pairs <img alt="{(a_i,b_i)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a_i%2Cb_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are edges of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The number of bits of information per channel use that we can send is</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac 1k \log \alpha(G^k) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac+1k+%5Clog+%5Calpha%28G%5Ek%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> and so we are interested in</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} (\alpha (G^k))^{1/k} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clim_%7Bk%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D+%28%5Calpha+%28G%5Ek%29%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> Nicely, we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \theta (G^k) = (\theta(G))^k " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Ctheta+%28G%5Ek%29+%3D+%28%5Ctheta%28G%29%29%5Ek+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> so we have</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \theta(G) \geq \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} (\alpha (G^k))^{1/k} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Ctheta%28G%29+%5Cgeq+%5Clim_%7Bk%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D+%28%5Calpha+%28G%5Ek%29%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> and the theta function provides an upper bound to the Shannon capacity of a graph.</p>
<p>If we compute <img alt="{\theta (\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta+%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="{\bar G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar+G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the complement of the graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (that is, the graph whose edges are all the non-edges of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), then we see that <img alt="{\theta(\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a relaxation of the maximum clique problem in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Remarkably, <img alt="{\theta(\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is also a <em>lower bound</em> to the chromatic number of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and so it is <em>sandwiched</em> between the clique number and the chromatic number. Don Knuth has used this fact as a starting point for a wonderful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9312214">49-page treatise</a> on convex relaxations of the chromatic number and the clique number; here we will see a quick proof of this fact.</p>
<p>As you can see in Knuth’s survey, there are several equivalent ways to define the theta function. Below we define <img alt="{\theta(\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as a natural semidefinite programming relaxation of the maximum clique problem (we have a variable <img alt="{x_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> plus one variable <img alt="{x_v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_v%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for every vertex <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; all variables are vectors).</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle \begin{array}{lr} \max \sum_{v\in V} || x_v||^2\\ s.t.\\ ||x_0||^2 = 1\\ \langle x_0,x_v \rangle = ||x_v||^2 &amp; \forall v\in V\\ \langle x_u,x_v \rangle = 0 &amp; \forall u\neq v: (u,v) \not\in E\\ \end{array}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Blr%7D+%5Cmax+%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+V%7D+%7C%7C+x_v%7C%7C%5E2%5C%5C+s.t.%5C%5C+%7C%7Cx_0%7C%7C%5E2+%3D+1%5C%5C+%5Clangle+x_0%2Cx_v+%5Crangle+%3D+%7C%7Cx_v%7C%7C%5E2+%26+%5Cforall+v%5Cin+V%5C%5C+%5Clangle+x_u%2Cx_v+%5Crangle+%3D+0+%26+%5Cforall+u%5Cneq+v%3A+%28u%2Cv%29+%5Cnot%5Cin+E%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Barray%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>To see that it is a relaxation, given a clique <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, let <img alt="{x_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be any unit vector, and let <img alt="{x_v = x_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_v+%3D+x_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="{v\in K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%5Cin+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{x_v = {\bf 0}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_v+%3D+%7B%5Cbf+0%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="{v\not\in K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%5Cnot%5Cin+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We satisfy all constraints and the objective function is <img alt="{|K|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CK%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>If we write the semidefinite dual of the above relaxation, we can see that we get a minimization problem which is a relaxation of the chromatic number problem (and which is equivalent to the relaxation used by Karger, Motwani and Sudan to improve on Avi’s result on 3-coloring), so that the “sandwich theorem” follows from weak duality.</p>
<p>The reader should try to write down the semidefinite dual and reason about why it relaxes the chromatic number problem. Below, we collapse the construction of the dual, the way of embedding colorings into dual solutions, and the proof of weak duality for semidefinite programming, into a short but mystifying “sum of squares” proof.</p>
<p>Suppose that <img alt="{V = \{ v_1,\ldots,v_n \}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV+%3D+%5C%7B+v_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cv_n+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and let <img alt="{x_0,x_{v_1},\ldots,x_{v_n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%2Cx_%7Bv_1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7Bv_n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be a feasible solution to the max clique relaxation defined above. Suppose that the graph is <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-colorable and let <img alt="{(C_1,\ldots,C_k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28C_1%2C%5Cldots%2CC_k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be a partition of <img alt="{V}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> into color classes. We have</p>

<p> so that the objective function always satisfies</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{v\in V} ||x_v||^2 \leq k " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+V%7D+%7C%7Cx_v%7C%7C%5E2+%5Cleq+k+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> In particular, this is true for an optimal solution <img alt="{x_0,x_{v_1},\ldots,x_{v_k}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%2Cx_%7Bv_1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_%7Bv_k%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and for an optimal coloring, so we have that <img alt="{\theta(\bar G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%28%5Cbar+G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is upper bounded by the chromatic number of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as promised.</p>
<p>Above, we used various properties of feasible solutions, such as <img alt="{||x_0||^2 = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%7Cx_0%7C%7C%5E2+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{\langle x_0, x_v \rangle = ||x_v||^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+x_0%2C+x_v+%5Crangle+%3D+%7C%7Cx_v%7C%7C%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{u,v \in C_i } \langle x_u , x_v \rangle = \sum_{v\in C_i} || x_v||^2 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bu%2Cv+%5Cin+C_i+%7D+%5Clangle+x_u+%2C+x_v+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bv%5Cin+C_i%7D+%7C%7C+x_v%7C%7C%5E2+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p> which follows from the fact that each color class is an independent set, and so all inner products <img alt="{\langle x_u, x_v \rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+x_u%2C+x_v+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="{u,v \in C_i, u\neq v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%2Cv+%5Cin+C_i%2C+u%5Cneq+v%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> have to be equal to zero, because <img alt="{(u,v) \not\in E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28u%2Cv%29+%5Cnot%5Cin+E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Many of you will have seen the happy news today that Avi Wigderson and László Lovász <a href="https://www.abelprize.no/c76389/seksjon/vis.html?tid=76390&amp;strukt_tid=76389">share this year’s Abel Prize</a> (which now contends with the Fields Medal for the highest award in pure math).  This is only the second time that the Abel Prize has been given wholly or partly for work in theoretical computer science, after <a href="https://www.abelprize.no/c54147/seksjon/vis.html?tid=54148">Szemerédi</a> in 2012.  See also the articles in <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/avi-wigderson-and-laszlo-lovasz-win-abel-prize-20210317/">Quanta</a></em> or the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/science/abel-prize-mathematics.html">NYT</a>, which actually say most of what I would’ve said for a lay audience about Wigderson’s and Lovász’s most famous research results and their importance (except, no, Avi hasn’t <em>yet</em> proved P=BPP, just taken some major steps toward it…).</p>



<p>On a personal note, Avi was both my and my wife Dana’s postdoctoral advisor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  He’s been an <em>unbelievably</em> important mentor to both of us, as he’s been for dozens of others in the CS theory community.  Back in 2007, I also had the privilege of working closely with Avi for months on our <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/alg.pdf">Algebrization</a> paper.  Now would be a fine time to revisit <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2925">Avi’s Permanent Impact on Me</a> (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLxC3rGeWBI">watch the YouTube video</a>), which is the talk I gave at IAS in 2016 on the occasion of Avi’s 60th birthday.</p>



<p>Huge congratulations to both Avi and László!</p></div>

More from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/science/abel-prize-mathematics.html">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/avi-wigderson-and-laszlo-lovasz-win-abel-prize-20210317/">Quanta Magazine</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/17/cheerful-news-in-difficult-times-the-abel-prize-is-awarded-to-laszlo-lovasz-and-avi-wigderson/">Gil Kalai</a>.

I lived in a dorm Berkeley rented at Mills College during my <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/04/one-miserable-year.html">crazy year there</a>.</p><p>I've got mixed emotions about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/obituaries/james-levine-dead.html">death of James Levine</a>. What he did musically with the Metropolitan opera and orchestra was nothing short of incredible. What he did to the young people he abused is inexcusable. I remember watching a Met taped videocast of Die Walküre with my daughter, enjoying the production but telling her "Do you realize we are watching an opera composed by an anti-Semite and conducted by a child molester?"  Can you separate art from artist?</p></div>

<p>The Abel Prize was awarded earlier today to László Lovász and Avi Wigderson</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>“for their foundational contributions to theoretical computer science and discrete </em><em>mathematics, and their leading role in shaping them into central fields of modern </em><em>mathematics.”</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to Laci and Avi, to their families, and to the communities of theoretical computer science and combinatorics. Let me quote one more sentence from the citation:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366;"><em>“They have both made fundamental contributions to understanding randomness in computation and in exploring the boundaries of efficient computation.” </em></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Who are in the picture?</p>
<p><strong>Answers:</strong> 1) (Graduating from the Technion) Baruch Schieber, Avi, Oded Goldreich, and David Peleg. 2) (Highschool (?)

<p>
Today we want to share the experience we had with him this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.</p>

Here is my best reconstruction of what happened:</p>

It was Tuesday, already St. Patrick’s Day in Ireland, and Ken and I were on a Zoom connection working late. We had agreed to skip any post highlighting Neil. We intended to highlight another female mathematician or computer scientist. And Neil is definitely not a female.</p>
<p>
We never know in advance whether or when Neil is coming, but this time we took some steps. First, I am not where I was, and I made the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/03/17/leprechauns-will-find-you/">finding</a> task harder. Kathryn set up mirrors in my new study, since leprechauns fear being held by a stare. Ken is where he’s always been, but being still a few days from his first vaccination, knew Neil would respect the CDC guidelines.</p>
<p>
We thought all was well and were discussing Hilbert’s Tenth until Ken spotted the puff of green smoke in a mirror behind me. Before he could warn me I heard the familiar voice to my side:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Top of the evening to ye.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I might have let him take off his mask and get comfortable, but instead I retorted, “Neil, thanks for visiting, but Ken and I have other plans. This whole month is dedicated to honor female researchers. So nice to see you as always, but …”</p>
<p>
Neil smiled—we could tell that through his mask—and said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Well, we could talk about a certain female Leprechaun—one who just solved a big problem in complexity. A problem that rhymes with “slower hounds in crime.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Neil’s Dilemma </h2><p/>
<p>
I was doubly confused: once by the cryptic rhyme, but then because I realized Neil—masked or not—was simply, provably <b>lying</b>. I hesitated to confront Neil because I recalled a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/274015958551660685/">book</a> titled <em>Leprechauns Never Lie</em>, but Ken flashed the proof by sharing his screen over Zoom:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Neil, there <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/no-female-leprechauns_n_1355121">are no</a> female leprechauns. We all <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/03/16/leprechauns-go-universal/">discussed</a> this two St. Patrick’s Days ago. Quoting my link: <i>there is no record in Irish folklore of leprechauns having a female counterpart in their ranks or even a solid record of how they procreate or reproduce.</i>” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken and I realized there was more than just the truth or female researchers at stake: a leprechaun caught in transgression must surrender his treasure. <em>His</em> treasure. But that was bound to make Neil extra tricky.</p>
<p>
Neil was right on that wavelength, because his first words in reply were:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Before we proceed, there is a matter about my pot of gold that we must resolve. And it will tie to the larger matter at hand. I need expert help, and ye be the two best I know to ask.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pot.png?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18352" height="120" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pot.png?resize=120%2C120&amp;ssl=1" width="120"/></a></p>
<p>
What would Neil need to ask <em>us</em>? We had always tried to pin him down into telling us the answer to P=NP. Remember, a leprechaun cannot lie, so his answer would rule. So we said, “what do you need to ask?”</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I need to ask you about the meaning of P=NP.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Neil’s Question </h2><p/>
<p>
I bid Neil sit down and remove his mask to puff his pipe. I started to give the same answer I’ve given in countless classrooms: “P=NP means that a certain big class of problems could all be solved by an algorithm that runs in polynomial time. Polynomial time means…” But Ken cut in more pointedly:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Neil, why do <b>you</b> need to know about P=NP? And to know <b>what</b> about it?” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Neil puffed on his pipe and gave what we could tell was an honest answer:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “We Leprechauns have started thinking about going modern—belonging to the 21st century. I plan on getting rid of my pot of gold coins and going into Bitcoins. Those pots are heavy to lug for us wee folk. But to judge if it be safe in our world, we need to know the gist and risks in your world.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I switched gears and said the gist is that Bitcoin is based on a technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> that creates an unambiguous single history of recorded transactions, including how the coin was earned in the first place. The history does not need to be maintained by any trusted party—it is decentralized, and any party can access it to provide a proof of a record. Ah, but if P=NP…</p>
<p>
Ken cut in: “If P <em>effectively</em> equals NP. Not the <img alt="{n^{100}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B100%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n^{100}}"/> time for SAT or the huge constants from forbidden-minor sets kind of P=NP. If you can be really efficient at it then you can spoof a proof of an alternative history of records, one to your gain, or certainly put confidence in the other side’s version of events in doubt. Actually, something weaker than P=NP suffices.” We were next going to educate Neil on crypto, but he cut us off.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “We ken that </em>cheana féin<em>—well already. But what if your world have <b>no unambiguous single histories</b> to begin with? How déan that change the effective meaning of P=NP?” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Law and Lore </h2><p/>
<p>
The essence of Neil’s question escaped us at first. We replied that the notion of “history” involved was like a computation by a deterministic Turing machine <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M}"/>, and time is uniquely defined by its sequence of configurations <img alt="{I \vdash_M J \vdash_M K \vdash_M\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI+%5Cvdash_M+J+%5Cvdash_M+K+%5Cvdash_M%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{I \vdash_M J \vdash_M K \vdash_M\dots}"/> Ah, Neil replied, cannot there be a <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K}"/> that is reached by two separate paths, <img alt="{J \vdash_M K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ+%5Cvdash_M+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J \vdash_M K}"/> and <img alt="{J' \vdash_M K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27+%5Cvdash_M+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J' \vdash_M K}"/>? If you are at <img alt="{I}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{I}"/> and yet to go to <img alt="{J}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J}"/> you may have no inkling of <img alt="{J'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J'}"/> at present—your present.</p>
<p>
Ken cut in by saying that every computation can be performed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing">reversible</a> Turing machine <img alt="{M'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M'}"/>—so that there is only one possible past history—and that <img alt="{M'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M'}"/> is built from <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M}"/> by propagating part of the computation’s history somewhat as blockchain does. But that did not help our argument with Neil. When Ken brought up the reversibility of quantum computation, Neil was ready with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_histories">Consistent Histories</a> interpretation of quantum mechanics. The determinism of quantum evolution is at a “bird’s eye” level higher up, whereas in our “frog’s eye” experience the theory gives us probabilities over alternative histories <img alt="{J}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J}"/> and <img alt="{J'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J'}"/>, and <i>consistency</i> rather than <i>unique actuality</i> is the criterion for their viability.</p>
<p>
At this point I started to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_the_stone#Origin">kick a stone</a> at Neil about there being just one flesh-and-blood real world, with natural laws and a unique history, but his next words cut to the quick:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “On what basis then did ye dun me for speaking o’ female leprechauns? On the basis of <b>lore</b>, ye said. But is that as unchanging as the stone ye would kick at me?” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken got what Neil was saying and flashed a topical item on his Zoom screen:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lynettewukie.png?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18353" height="245" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lynettewukie.png?resize=550%2C245&amp;ssl=1" width="550"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
“This came <em>after</em> our discussion two years <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/03/16/leprechauns-go-universal/">ago</a>—in which you referenced Notre Dame—but maybe you are right that its significance is <em>before</em>.”</p>
<p>
I told Neil I still don’t agree about histories, but I withdrew our claim on his gold. Ken showed his face back on Zoom and was looking impatient so I gave him the floor.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “What Neil is on about is that many things we’d consider aspects of Leprechaun World are really theorized properties of our world. So we must ask, what if they are just one world?</em></p><em>
<p>
Take Bitcoin. Now it’s obvious why Neil and friends want to get involved with Bitcoin. There are so many more ways to play tricks with it than with pots of physical gold. We wrote <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/03/17/leprechauns-stay-home/">last year</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/03/17/leprechauns-are-tricky/">many</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2017/03/17/leprechauns-are-multiplying/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2016/03/17/happy-st-patricks-day-2/">before</a> about the gaming and crypto tricks they can play. </p>
</em><p><em>
But it’s nothing that we can’t do ourselves. So leprechauns make their pots of gold vanish? We’ve done that via Bitcoin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html">quite</a> to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/uk-man-makes-last-ditch-effort-to-recover-lost-bitcoin-hard-drive.html">perfection</a>—hundreds of millions of dollars poof!, no leprechauns involved.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Neil’s Slower Hounds </h2><p/>
<p>
Ken was about to say that this was the larger context of Neil’s question about P=NP but I recalled the second thing Neil said at the start and wanted something in return for letting go his gold. “Neil—I can grant female leprechauns but you said something else: that one proved a breakthrough in complexity. You said it rhymed with “slower hounds in crime”—ah, <em>lower bounds on time</em>. Neil puffed and said, </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Aye.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Can you tell us what she proved? We answered your question—and since you raised this to begin with, it’s only fair.” Ken chimed in by asking, “no one we know in our field is a leprechaun, right?”</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I cannae tell ye in the here of now, for a reason that ye conceded to me. Ye will appreciate something from <img alt="{J'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J'}"/> when ye reach <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K}"/> from <img alt="{J}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{J}"/>. So I shall leave ye do what ye be doing.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Neil turned as if about to wisp away, but a cry from me stopped him: “No final trick this time?” He gave us both a look that was sad and loving at the same time, something we didn’t know leprechauns could do. But he said,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “No trick that ye not be increasingly doing by yourselves.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And with that he departed in a flash. The flash kicked onto my screen where Ken still was. In Ken’s place was an image I recognized as from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry">Bayeux</a> <a href="http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost11/Bayeux/bay_tama.html">Tapestry</a>—that great record of history a millennium ago—until I looked a little closer.</p>

    <title>TR21-042 |  Strong Parallel Repetition for Unique Games on Small Set Expanders | 

	Dana Moshkovitz</title>
    <summary>We show that NP-hardness of approximating Boolean unique games on small set expanders can be amplified to the full Unique Games Conjecture on small set expanders. 
The latter conjecture is known to imply hardness results for problems like Balanced-Separator, Minimum-Linear-Rearrangement and Small-Set-Expansion that are not known under the Unique Games Conjecture.
Our result follows from: (1) A transformation that fortifies any unique game on a small set expander. (2) An improved parallel repetition theorem for fortified games on small set expanders. 
Our approach avoids the known limitation on strong parallel repetition of unique games by enlarging the alphabet considerably before repetition. The limitation does not hold for unique games with a sufficiently large alphabet. 
Prior to this work, parallel repetition from fortification was only known for projection games, and seemed hopeless for unique games. 
Perhaps surprisingly, the idea for fortification of unique games comes from a reduction of Raghavendra and Steurer from Small-Set-Expansion to Unique Games.</summary>

    <p>Since I saw it <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/03/22/uci-ecological-preserve.html">a year ago</a> and again this week, I wondered: how can I see Los Angeles from my neighborhood, 65km away?

    <title>TR21-041 |  An Efficient Coding Theorem via Probabilistic Representations and its Applications | 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira</title>
    <summary>A probabilistic representation of a string $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ is given by the code of a randomized algorithm that outputs $x$ with high probability [Oliveira, ICALP 2019]. We employ probabilistic representations to establish the first unconditional Coding Theorem in time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. More precisely, we show that if a distribution ensemble $\mathcal{D}_m$ can be uniformly sampled in time $T(m)$ and generates a string $x \in \{0,1\}^*$ with probability at least $\delta$, then $x$ admits a time-bounded probabilistic representation of complexity $O(\log(1/\delta) + \log (T) + \log(m))$. Under mild assumptions, a representation of this form can be  computed from $x$ and the code of the sampler in time polynomial in $n = |x|$. 
		
We derive consequences of this result relevant to the study of data compression, pseudodeterministic algorithms, time hierarchies for sampling distributions, and complexity lower bounds. In particular, we describe an instance-based search-to-decision reduction for Levin's Kt complexity [Levin, Information and Control 1984] and its probabilistic analogue rKt [Oliveira, ICALP 2019]. As a consequence, if a string $x$ admits a succinct time-bounded representation, then a near-optimal representation can be generated from $x$ with high probability in polynomial time. This partially addresses in a time-bounded setting a question from [Levin, Information and Control 1984] on the efficiency of computing an  optimal encoding of a string.</summary>

    <title>TR21-040 |  Majority vs. Approximate Linear Sum and Average-Case Complexity Below NC1 | 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Xin Lyu, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira</title>
    <summary>We develop a general framework that characterizes strong average-case lower bounds against circuit classes $\mathcal{C}$ contained in $\mathrm{NC}^1$, such as $\mathrm{AC}^0[\oplus]$ and $\mathrm{ACC}^0$. We apply this framework to show:

- Generic seed reduction: Pseudorandom generators (PRGs) against $\mathcal{C}$ of seed length $\leq n -1$ and error $\varepsilon(n) = n^{-\omega(1)}$ can be converted into PRGs of sub-polynomial seed length.

- Hardness under natural distributions: If $\mathrm{E}$ (deterministic exponential time) is average-case hard against $\mathcal{C}$ under some distribution, then $\mathrm{E}$ is average-case hard against $\mathcal{C}$ under the uniform distribution.

- Equivalence between worst-case and average-case hardness: Worst-case lower bounds against $\mathrm{MAJ} \circ \mathcal{C}$ for problems in $E$ are equivalent to strong average-case lower bounds against $\mathcal{C}$. This can be seen as a certain converse to the Discriminator Lemma [Hajnal et al., JCSS'93].

These results were not known to hold for circuit classes that do not compute majority. Additionally, we prove that classical and recent approaches to worst-case lower bounds against $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ via communication lower bounds for NOF multi-party  protocols [Hastad and Goldmann, CC'91; Razborov and Wigderson, IPL'93] and Torus polynomials degree lower bounds [Bhrushundi et al., ITCS'19] also imply strong average-case hardness against $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ under the uniform distribution.

Crucial to these results is the use of non-black-box hardness amplification techniques and the interplay between Majority ($\mathrm{MAJ}$) and Approximate Linear Sum ($\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$) gates. Roughly speaking, while a $\mathrm{MAJ}$ gate outputs $1$ when the sum of the $m$ input bits is at least $m/2$, a $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ gate computes a real-valued bounded weighted sum of the input bits and outputs $1$ (resp. $0$) if the sum is close to $1$ (resp. close to $0$), with the promise that one of the two cases always holds. As part of our framework, we explore ideas introduced in [Chen and Ren, STOC'20] to show that, for the purpose of proving lower bounds, a top layer $MAJ$ gate is equivalent to a (weaker) $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ gate. Motivated by this result, we extend the algorithmic method and establish stronger lower bounds against bounded-depth circuits with layers of $\mathrm{MAJ}$ and $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ gates. Among them, we prove that:
    
- Lower bound: $\mathrm{NQP}$ does not admit fixed quasi-polynomial size $\mathrm{MAJ} \circ \widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}} \circ \mathrm{ACC}^0 \circ \mathrm{THR}$ circuits.

This is the first explicit lower bound against circuits with distinct layers of $\mathrm{MAJ}$, $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$, and $\mathrm{THR}$ gates. Consequently, if the aforementioned equivalence between $\mathrm{MAJ}$ and $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ as a top gate can be extended to intermediate layers, long sought-after lower bounds against the class $\mathrm{THR} \circ \mathrm{THR}$ of depth-$2$ polynomial-size threshold circuits would follow.</summary>

    <title>TR21-039 |  Pseudodeterministic Algorithms and the Structure of Probabilistic Time | 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira, 

	Rahul Santhanam</title>
    <summary>We connect the study of pseudodeterministic algorithms to two major open problems about the structural complexity of $BPTIME$: proving hierarchy theorems and showing the existence of complete problems. Our main contributions can be summarised as follows.

1. A new pseudorandom generator and its consequences: We build on techniques developed to prove hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time with advice (Fortnow and Santhanam, FOCS 2004) to construct the first unconditional pseudorandom generator of polynomial stretch computable in pseudodeterministic polynomial time (with one bit of advice) that is secure infinitely often against polynomial-time computations.  As an application of this construction, we obtain new results about the complexity of generating and representing prime numbers. For instance, we show unconditionally for each $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ that infinitely many primes $p_n$ have a succinct representation in the following sense: there is a fixed probabilistic polynomial time algorithm that generates $p_n$ with high probability from its succinct representation of size $O(|p_n|^{\varepsilon})$. This offers an exponential improvement over the running time of previous results, and shows that infinitely many primes have succinct and efficient representations. 
		
2. Structural results for probabilistic time from pseudodeterministic algorithms: Oliveira and Santhanam (STOC 2017) established unconditionally that there is a pseudodeterministic algorithm for the Circuit Acceptance Probability Problem ($CAPP$) that runs in sub-exponential time and is correct with high probability over any samplable distribution on circuits on infinitely many input lengths. We show that improving  this running time or obtaining a result that holds for every large input length would imply new time hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time. In addition, we prove that a worst-case polynomial-time pseudodeterministic algorithm for $CAPP$ would imply that $BPP$ has complete problems.
		
3. Equivalence between pseudodeterministic constructions and hierarchies: We establish an equivalence between a certain explicit pseudodeterministic construction problem and the existence of strong hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time. More precisely, we show that pseudodeterministically constructing in exponential time strings of large $rKt$ complexity (Oliveira, ICALP 2019) is possible if and only if for every constructive function $T(n) \leq \exp(o(\exp(n)))$ we have $BPTIME[poly(T)] \not\subseteq i.o.BPTIME[T]/\log T$.

More generally, these results suggest new approaches for designing pseudodeterministic algorithms for search problems and for unveiling the structure of probabilistic time.</summary>

	Alessandro Chiesa,

	Nicholas Spooner, 

	Mark Zhandry</title>
    <summary>We prove that Kilian's four-message succinct argument system is post-quantum secure in the standard model when instantiated with any probabilistically checkable proof and any collapsing hash function (which in turn exist based on the post-quantum hardness of Learning with Errors). 

At the heart of our proof is a new "measure-and-repair" quantum rewinding procedure that achieves asymptotically optimal knowledge error.</summary>

Emma Haruka Iwao set an official Guinness world record in 2019 by calculating pi to <b>31,415,926,535,897</b> digits. If she had calculated it to <b>62,831,853,071,795</b> digits, she might still hold that <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66179-most-accurate-value-of-pi">record</a> today.</p>
<p>
Today, Pi Day (3/14), we ask why <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\pi}"/> was affixed to the value <b>3.141592653589793…</b><br/>
<span id="more-18335"/></p>
<p>
The main alternatives are the values we currently call <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2\pi}"/> and <img alt="{\frac{\pi}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\frac{\pi}{2}}"/>. Neither would have caused any extra difficulty for Iwao. The methods she used, including the <a href="http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/">y-cruncher</a> implementation of the fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm">algorithm</a> of David and Gregory Chudnovsky, could adapt immediately to a factor of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2}"/> either way. </p>
<p>
Two things that stand out to us from Iwao’s <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/most-calculated-digits-pi/">story</a> told on Google’s blogs, besides her commanding the power of Google’s cloud services to manage 170 terabytes of data over 121 days for the calculation, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>She was inspired while growing up in Japan by the current record holders being Japanese professors, one of whom she later worked for as a student.
</li><li>There was a quicker checking phase for the final product—in particular, for the 8,956,768,817,536 new digits. This used a mixture of two versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe_formula">BBP</a> method, which we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/07/14/making-an-algorithm-an-algorithm-bbp/">covered</a> a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/03/15/cooks-class-contains-pi/">few</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/10/16/one-mans-floor-is-another-mans-ceiling/">times</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The new <a href="https://blog.timothymullican.com/calculating-pi-my-attempt-breaking-pi-record">record</a> of 50 trillion digits by Timothy Mullican have been added to Iwao’s available for <a href="https://pi.delivery/">delivery</a> by Google. We do not know the extent to which they are <em>concretely</em> pseudorandom, despite coming from a simple rule, but that extent would be shared equally by <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2\pi}"/> and <img alt="{\frac{\pi}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\frac{\pi}{2}}"/>.</p>
<p/><h2> Why This Value? </h2><p/>
<p>
Giorgia Fortuna in 2015 wrote a long <a href="https://blog.wolfram.com/2015/06/28/2-pi-or-not-2-pi/">article</a> on the Wolfram blog about <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\pi}"/> versus <img alt="{\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau}"/>, where <img alt="{\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau}"/> is a suggested symbol for <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2\pi}"/>, which equals <b>6.2831853071795…</b> Her extensive analysis of formulas in the literature shows that the benefit of simplifying mathematical and scientific formulas that involve <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2\pi}"/> by the single symbol <img alt="{\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau}"/> would be minimal, and more than offset by formulas that would incur <img alt="{\tau/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau/2}"/>. Our blogging friend Bill Gasarch has <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2007/08/is-pi-defined-in-best-way.html">written</a> <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/07/2pi-day-other-holiday-possibilities.html">about</a> the value of <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\pi}"/> and expressed opinions in support of <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2\pi}"/> as “the” value.</p>
<p>
We want to pose a different question, one suggested to me today by a reference to the 3rd-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Hui's_pi_algorithm">algorithm</a> of the Chinese mathematician Liu Hui, which efficiently generated values far more precise than what was known in the west: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Why did several separate cultures fix upon the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, rather than the ratio of the circumference to the radius, or the diameter to half the circumference? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The last ratio, <b>1.5707963267948966…</b>, strikes us as the most natural to think of in the great outdoors: You have a choice of rowing across a circular pond or walking around. How much more distance does the latter involve?</p>
<p>
We don’t know of a name for partisans of <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2\pi}"/>, but those of <img alt="{\frac{\pi}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\frac{\pi}{2}}"/> would have a natural moniker:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Sesqui<b>pi</b>dalians. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This branches off the word <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sesquipedalian">sesquipedalian</a> in an appropriate way, since <em>sesqui-</em> is Latin for one-and-a-half (as in “sesquicentennial”) and <img alt="{\frac{\pi}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\frac{\pi}{2}}"/> is near <img alt="{1.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1.5}"/>. But that line of thinking led us to wonder about a possible answer to the historical puzzle:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Did the ancients favor 3.14… because it was the closest to an integer of three main options? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
Is there any merit to our historical question? We leave it as a riddle until the next Pi Day—or at least until 6/28/2021.  Note also our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/06/15/honor-thy-fathers-correctly/">query</a> about whether the Indian mathematician Aryabhata favored <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2\pi}"/> as the number of note.</p>
<p>
[some word and format tweaks, added note on Aryabhata]</p></font></font></div>

    <title>TR21-037 |  Separating ABPs and Some Structured Formulas in the Non-Commutative Setting | 

	Prerona Chatterjee</title>
    <summary>The motivating question for this work is a long standing open problem, posed by Nisan (1991), regarding the relative powers of algebraic branching programs (ABPs) and formulas in the non-commutative setting. Even though the general question continues to remain open, we make some progress towards its resolution. To that effect, we generalise the notion of ordered polynomials in the non-commutative setting (defined by Hrubes, Wigderson and Yehudayoff (2011)) to define abecedarian polynomials and models that naturally compute them.
		
Our main contribution is a possible new approach towards separating formulas and ABPs in the non-commutative setting, via lower bounds against abecedarian formulas. In particular, we show the following.
	
There is an explicit $n$-variate degree $d$ abecedarian polynomial $f_{n,d}(x)$ such that 
1. $f_{n, d}(x)$ can be computed by an abecedarian ABP of size O(nd);
2. any abecedarian formula computing $f_{n, \log n}(x)$ must have size that is super-polynomial in $n$.

We also show that a  super-polynomial lower bound against abecedarian formulas for $f_{\log n, n}(x)$ would separate the powers of formulas and ABPs in the non-commutative setting.</summary>

    <title>TR21-036 |  Ideal-theoretic Explanation of Capacity-achieving Decoding | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	Madhu Sudan, 

	Siddharth Bhandari, 

	Prahladh Harsha</title>
    <summary>In this work, we present an abstract framework for some algebraic error-correcting codes with the aim of capturing codes that are list-decodable to capacity, along with their decoding algorithm. In the polynomial ideal framework, a code is specified by some ideals in a polynomial ring, messages are polynomials and their encoding is the residue modulo the ideals. We present an alternate way of viewing this class of codes in terms of linear operators, and show that this alternate view makes their algorithmic list-decodability amenable to analysis.

Our framework leads to a new class of codes that we call {\em affine Folded Reed-Solomon codes} (which are themselves a special case of the broader class we explore). These codes are common generalizations of the well-studied Folded Reed-Solomon codes and Multiplicity codes, while also capturing the less-studied Additive Folded Reed-Solomon codes as well as a large family of codes that were not previously known/studied. 

More significantly our framework also captures the algorithmic list-decodability of the constituent codes. Specifically, we present a unified view of the decoding algorithm for ideal-theoretic codes and show that the decodability reduces to the analysis of the distance of some related codes. We show that good bounds on this distance lead to capacity-achieving performance of the underlying code, providing a unifying explanation of known capacity-achieving results. In the specific case of affine Folded Reed-Solomon codes, our framework shows that they are list-decodable up to capacity (for appropriate setting of the parameters), thereby unifying the previous results for Folded Reed-Solomon, Multiplicity and Additive Folded Reed-Solomon codes.</summary>

Marta Sved was a Hungarian mathematician who in 1930 moved to Down Under and became a teacher of math at the University of Adelaide. Over fifty years later, in 1985, Sved got a PhD. Clearly Liebman’s quote applies to Sved’s pursuit of a PhD. </p>
<p>
Today I cannot resist talking about a particular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191325/http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Sved50816668.pdf">paper</a> of hers in the Mathematics Magazine—Volume 63 Number 1, February 1990: </p>

<p>
Mathematics Magazine is a reviewed journal that focuses on exposition, history, and connections to other parts of math. I am a longtime reader of this journal. I have been getting this and other similar math mag’s for years. I am sure I saw this paper and the theorem. I did not see any reason to be overly excited by the result. However, the theorem plays a critical role in solving a long time open problem.</p>
<p>
Note, this paper did not make the cover, but I believe it should have. To see why we must look at the famous Hilbert Tenth Problem. </p>
<p/><h2> Hilbert’s Tenth </h2><p/>
<p>
Recall this is the problem: Given a polynomial equation 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  P(x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots) = 0 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++P%28x_1%2Cx_2%2Cx_3%2C%5Cdots%29+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  P(x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots) = 0 "/></p>
<p>over the integers, decide if there is a solution over the integers. This was famously proved to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem">undecidable</a> by the combined work of Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam, and Julia Robinson, and was completed by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970. </p>
<p>
Davis, Putnam, and Robinson proved this first for exponential equations—they allowed <img alt="{x^y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x^y}"/>. Later, Matiyasevich showed how to express exponentiation in by polynomials—this completed the proof. </p>
<p>
Solving a famous open problem only increases our interest in related questions. One class of questions involved replacing the integers by other rings. One of the major questions is what happens if we ask for solutions to </p>

<p>over the rationals? This is currently open—see our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/08/07/hilberts-tenth-over-the-rationals/">posted</a> on this and two <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/07/19/hilberts-10-5th-problem/">related</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/19/diophantine-equations/">ones</a>, plus a topical <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/subrings.pdf">paper</a> by Bjorn Poonen, for some comments. </p>
<p/><h2> Hilbert Tenth Over Rationals </h2><p/>
<p>
Following the history of the classic version of Hilbert’s Tenth, Mihai Prunescu proved: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> It is undecidable to determine whether an exponential equation in many variables is solvable over the rationals. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This just appeared as <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/issue/E4FD92AFC9B9DE3E9855EEAFAF14A924"> The Exponential Diophantine Problem For Rationals</a> in the current issue of the JSL: </p>

<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/13/hilberts-tenth-again/jsl/" rel="attachment wp-att-18309"><img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-18309" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jsl.jpg?w=200&amp;ssl=1"/></a></p>
<p>
It is a short paper—two pages. The key is it shows that it is possible to define the integers by an exponential equation over the rationals. Is there a Matiyasevich out there who will remove the need for exponentials? </p>
<p/><h2> Using Exponentials over the Rationals </h2><p/>
<p>
Prunescu uses the following equation: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x^y = y^x. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x^y = y^x. "/></p>
<p>The solutions of this equation form a single parameterized family, and allow one to achieve the needed task:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Define the natural numbers from the rational solutions to this equation.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 2</b> <em> Suppose that <img alt="{0 &lt; x &lt; y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%3C+x+%3C+y%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{0 &lt; x &lt; y}"/> are rationals so that <img alt="{x^y = y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x^y = y^x}"/>. Then for some integer <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n&gt;0}"/> 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x = (1+1/n)^n \text{ and } y = (1+1/n)^{n+1}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%3D+%281%2B1%2Fn%29%5En+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+y+%3D+%281%2B1%2Fn%29%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x = (1+1/n)^n \text{ and } y = (1+1/n)^{n+1}. "/></p>
</em><p><em>Moreover, every <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n&gt;0}"/> arises this way. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
His proof outline is to suppose that <img alt="{x^y = y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x^y = y^x}"/> for rationals <img alt="{0 &lt; x &lt; y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%3C+x+%3C+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{0 &lt; x &lt; y}"/>. Then by the lemma we can recover the <i>integer</i> <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> using only addition and multiplication. 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  y/x = 1 + 1/n, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y%2Fx+%3D+1+%2B+1%2Fn%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  y/x = 1 + 1/n, "/></p>
<p>for some <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>. Thus, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  n = \frac{x}{y-x}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++n+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%7D%7By-x%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  n = \frac{x}{y-x}."/></p>
<p>This is an amazing trick—in my opinion. </p>
<p>
Prunescu deserves a tip-of-the-hat for this insight. At the high level he is using this: Suppose that <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x,y}"/> rationals satisfy an equation 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = 0. "/></p>
<p>Then there is a rational operation on <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{y}"/> that recovers a unique integer <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n&gt;0}"/>. Moreover, for any <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n&gt;0}"/> there are rational solutions <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x,y}"/> that yield <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>. This allows him to prove that exponential equations over the rationals is undecidable. </p>
<p/><h2> The Lemma </h2><p/>
<p>
Prunescu needs the above lemma. He does not prove it, but says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The equation <img alt="{x^y = y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x^y = y^x}"/> for rationals was studied by Christian Goldbach and Leonhard Euler—as stated in Leonhard Dickson’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-Theory-Numbers-Vol-Diophantine/dp/0821819356">book</a>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The results had been available for a long time—the book was published over a hundred years ago in 1920.</p>
<p>
It is interesting to ask why it took so long to realize the connection? I looked at Dickson’s book and found the reference not so clean. I then did a Google search for results on the equation: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x^y = y^x. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x^y = y^x. "/></p>
<p>The search found that Sved proved in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191325/http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Sved50816668.pdf">paper</a> in the Mathematics Magazine—Volume 63 Number 1, February 1990 the following: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 3</b> <em> Suppose that <img alt="{0 &lt; x &lt; y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%3C+x+%3C+y%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{0 &lt; x &lt; y}"/> are rationals so that <img alt="{x^y = y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x^y = y^x}"/>. Then for some integer <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n&gt;0}"/> 	</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>Moreover, every <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n&gt;0}"/> arises this way. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
That is, Sved proved the key lemma in full detail in 1990. Thus over thirty years ago, in an available journal, the exact lemma needed was available. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Why did so all of us miss that Sved’s analysis of the equation <img alt="{x^y=y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey%3Dy%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x^y=y^x}"/> could be used to solve an open problem. One that was open for decades? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps it says that Prunescu’s insight was indeed surprising. Perhaps. It does raise questions about improving his theorem. For example: Can a similar theorem be proved with only exponentials of the form 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  2^x, 3^x, \dots? " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5Ex%2C+3%5Ex%2C+%5Cdots%3F+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  2^x, 3^x, \dots? "/></p>
<p>This would improve the undecidability theorem a bit.</p>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
Perhaps we also should look at results from not top “professional” journals. Hmmm I think I will start looking at them with a new eye. How about you?</p>

    <title>TR21-035 |  Amortized Circuit Complexity, Formal Complexity Measures, and Catalytic Algorithms | 

	Robert Robere, 

	Jeroen Zuiddam</title>
    <summary>We study the amortized circuit complexity of boolean functions.
	
Given a circuit model $\mathcal{F}$ and a boolean function $f : \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, the $\mathcal{F}$-amortized circuit complexity is defined to be the size of the smallest circuit that outputs $m$ copies of $f$ (evaluated on the same input), divided by $m$, as $m \rightarrow \infty$. We prove a general duality theorem that characterizes the amortized circuit complexity in terms of "formal complexity measures". More precisely, we prove that the amortized circuit complexity in any circuit model composed out of gates from a finite set is equal to the pointwise maximum of the family of "formal complexity measures" associated with $\mathcal{F}$. Our duality theorem captures many of the formal complexity measures that have been previously studied in the literature for proving lower bounds (such as formula complexity measures, submodular complexity measures, and branching program complexity measures), and thus gives a characterization of formal complexity measures in terms of circuit complexity. We also introduce and investigate a related notion of catalytic circuit complexity, which we show is "intermediate" between amortized circuit complexity and standard circuit complexity, and which we also characterize (now, as the best integer solution to a linear program). 

Finally, using our new duality theorem as a guide, we strengthen the known upper bounds for non-uniform catalytic space, introduced by Buhrman et. al (this is related to, but not the same as, as our notion of catalytic circuit size). Potechin proved that for any boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, there is a catalytic branching program computing $m = 2^{2^n}-1$ copies of $f$ with total size $O(mn)$ --- that is, linear size per copy --- refuting a conjecture of Girard, Koucky and McKenzie. Potechin then asked if the number of copies $m$ can be reduced while retaining the amortized upper bound. We show that the answer is yes: if $f$ has degree $d$ when represented as polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_2$, then there is a catalytic branching program computing $m = 2^{n \choose \leq d}$ copies of $f$ with total size $O(mn)$.</summary>

    <title>Cake Cutting in Overtime</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There's a new <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/baltimore-ravens-coach-john-harbaugh-overtime-rule">proposal out of Baltimore</a> for a new way to handle overtime in National Football League games. This post is about American Football, soccer has its own overtime issues we won't talk about here.</p><p>Instead of randomly choosing who gets the ball, which gives an advantage to the team on offense, the Raven's coach John Harbaugh suggests a "spot and choose" rule based on cake cutting. One team picks a starting position and the other team decides whether to be on offense or defense.</p><p>Sounds intriguing but there's a problem. In cake cutting, if you cut off a crumb, everyone would definitely choose the rest of the cake. But in football suppose the spotting team chose the offensive's team one-yard line (99 yards needed for a touchdown). For spot and choose to work the one-yard line would have to be an obvious choice for defense. But many teams might still choose starting at the one-year line on offense. There's a chance you can march down the field and if not you can always punt it away. So the team that gets to choose whether to be on offense could get an advantage no matter what the spotting team did.</p><p>I still like the idea of "spot and choose". Maybe you let the first team choose not only the yard line but what down to start. Because no one would start at their one yard line at 4th down.</p><p>Are there variations for spot and choose in other sports? I like using game theory to figure out how to play actual games. </p></div>

    <title>Beyond log-concave sampling (Part 3)</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2020/09/19/beyondlogconvavesampling">first post</a> of this series, we introduced the challenges of sampling distributions beyond log-concavity. In <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2021/03/01/beyondlogconcave2/">Part 2</a> we tackled sampling from <em>multimodal</em> distributions: a typical obstacle occuring in problems involving statistical inference and posterior sampling in generative models. In this (final) post of the series, we consider sampling in the presence of <em>manifold structure in the level sets of the distribution</em> – which also frequently manifests in the same settings. It will cover the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05576">Fast convergence for Langevin diffusion with matrix manifold structure</a> by Ankur Moitra and Andrej Risteski .</p>

<h1 id="sampling-with-matrix-manifold-structure">Sampling with matrix manifold structure</h1>

<p>The structure on the distribution we consider in this post is <em>manifolds</em> of equiprobable points: this is natural, for instance, in the presence of invariances in data (e.g. rotations of images). It can also appear in neural-network based probabilistic models due to natural invariances they encode (e.g., scaling invariances in ReLU-based networks).</p>

<!--[HL: would it be better to start with the decomposition theorem, to parallel the first section?]
[AR: let me try this first, we can reorganize. I think this is better to motivate the assumption somewhat]-->

<p>At the level of techniques, the starting point for our results is a close connection between the geometry, more precisely <em>Ricci curvature</em> of a manifold, and the mixing time of Brownian motion on a manifold. The following theorem holds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (Bakry and Émery ‘85, informal)</strong>: If the manifold $M$ has  positive Ricci curvature, Brownian motion on the manifold mixes rapidly in $\chi^2$ divergence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will explain the notions from differential geometry shortly, but first we sketch our results, and how they use this machinery. We present two results: the first is a “meta”-theorem that provides a generic decomposition framework, and the second is an instantiation of this framework for a natural family of problems that exhibit manifold structure: posteriors for matrix factorization, sensing, and completion. 
<!--a sampling version of matrix factorization--></p>

<h2 id="a-general-manifold-decomposition-framework">A general manifold decomposition framework</h2>

<p>Our first result is a general decomposition framework for analyzing mixing time of Langevin in the presence of manifolds of equiprobable points.</p>

<p>To motivate the result, note that if we consider the distribution $p_{\beta}(x) \propto e^{-\beta f(x)}$, for large (but finite) $\beta$, the Langevin chain corresponding to that distribution, started close to a manifold of local minima, will tend to stay close to (but not on!) it for a long time. See the figure below for an illustration. This, we will state a “robust” version of the above manifold result, for a chain that’s allowed to go off the manifold.</p>

<center>
<img src="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/single_manifold.gif" width="300"/>
</center>

<p>We show the following statement. (Recall that a bounded Poincaré constant corresponds to rapid mixing for Langevin. See the <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2020/09/19/beyondlogconvavesampling">first post</a> for a refresher.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 1 (Moitra and Risteski ‘20, informal)</strong>: 
Suppose the Langevin chain corresponding to $p(x) \propto e^{-f(x)}$ is initialized close to a manifold $M$ satisfying the following two properties: 
<br/><br/>
(1) It stays in some neighborhood $D$ of the manifold $M$ with large probability for a long time. 
<br/><br/>
(2) $D$ can be partitioned into manifolds $M^{\Delta}$ satisfying: 
<br/><br/>
(2.1) The conditional distribution of $p$ restricted to $M^{\Delta}$ has a upper bounded Poincare constant. 
<br/><br/>
(2.2) The marginal distribution over $\Delta$ has a upper bounded Poincare constant. 
<br/><br/>
(2.3) The conditional probability distribution over $M^{\Delta}$ does not “change too quickly” as $\Delta$ changes.
<br/><br/>
Then Langevin mixes quickly to a distribution close to the conditional distribution of $p$ restricted to $D$.</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/partition_illustration.gif"/>
</center>

<p>While the above theorem is a bit of a mouthful (even very informally stated) and requires a choice of partitioning of $D$ to be “instantiated”, it’s quite natural to think of it as an analogue of local convergence results for gradient descent in optimization. Namely, it gives geometric conditions under which Langevin started near a manifold mixes to the “local” stationary distribution (i.e. the conditional distribution $p$ restricted to $D$).</p>

<p>The proof of the theorem uses similar decomposition ideas as result on sampling multimodal distributions from the <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2021/03/01/beyondlogconcave2/">previous post</a>, albeit is complicated by measure theoretic arguments. Namely, the manifolds $M^{\Delta}$ have technically zero measure under the distribution $p$, so care must be taken with how the “projected” and “restricted” chain are defined—the key tool for this is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_coarea_formula#:~:text=In%20Riemannian%20geometry%2C%20the%20smooth,with%20integrals%20over%20their%20codomains.&amp;text=%2C%20i.e.%20the%20determinant%20of%20the,orthogonal%20complement%20of%20its%20kernel.">co-area formula</a>.</p>

<p>The challenge in using the above framework is instantiating the decomposition: namely, the choice of the partition of $D$ into manifolds $M^{\Delta}$. In the next section, we show how this can be done for posteriors in problems like matrix factorization/sensing/completion.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-factorization-and-relatives">Matrix factorization (and relatives)</h2>

<p>To instantiate the above framework in a natural setting, we consider distributions exhibiting invariance under orthogonal transformations. Namely, we consider distributions of the type</p>

\[p: \mathbb{R}^{d \times k} \to \mathbb{R}, \hspace{0.5cm} p(X) \propto e^{-\beta \| \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b \|^2_2}\]

<p>where $b \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a fixed vector and $\mathcal{A}$ is an operator that returns a $m$-dimensional vector given a $d \times d$ matrix. For this distribution, we have $p(X) = p(XO)$ for any orthogonal matrix $O$, since $XX^T = XO (XO)^T$ . Depending on the choice of $\mathcal{A}$, we can easily recover some familiar functions inside the exponential: e.g. the $l_2$ losses for (low-rank) matrix factorization, matrix sensing and matrix completion. These losses received a lot of attention as simple examples of objectives that are non-convex but can still be optimized using gradient descent. (See e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00708">Ge et al. ‘17</a>.)</p>

<p>These distributions also have a very natural statistical motivation. Namely, consider the distribution over $m$-dimensional vectors, such that</p>

\[b = \mathcal{A}(XX^T) + n, \hspace{0.5cm} n \sim N\left(0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{\beta}}I\right).\]

<p>Then, the distribution $p(X) \propto e^{-\beta  | \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b |^2_2 }$ can be viewed as the posterior distribution over $X$ with a uniform prior. Thus, sampling from these distributions can be seen as the distributional analogue of problems like matrix factorization/sensing/completion, the difference being that we are not merely trying to find the <em>most likely</em> matrix $X$, but also trying to sample from the posterior.</p>

<p>We will consider the case when $\beta$ is sufficiently large (in particular, $\beta = \Omega(\mbox{poly}(d))$: in this case, the distribution $p$ will concentrate over two (separated) manifolds: $E_1 = \{X_0 R: R \mbox{ is orthogonal with det 1}\}$ and $E_2 = \{X_0 R: R \mbox{ is orthogonal with det }-1\}$, where $X_0$ is any fixed minimizer of $| \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b |^2_2$. Hence, when started near one of these manifolds, we expect Langevin to stay close to it for a long time (see figure below).</p>

<center>
<img src="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/langevin_matrix.gif" width="500"/>
</center>

<p>We show:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 2 (Moitra and Risteski ‘20, informal)</strong>: Let $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to matrix factorization, sensing or completion under standard parameter assumptions for these problems. Let $\beta = \Omega(\mbox{poly}(d))$. 
If initialized close to one of $E_i, i \in \{1, 2\}$, after a polynomial number of steps the discretized Langevin dynamics will converge to a distribution that is close in total variation distance
to p(X) when restricted to a neighborhood of $E_i$.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--Let $\beta=\Omega(\mbox{poly}(d), \log (1/\delta)⁡)$ and let $p^i(X) \propto p(𝑋)$, if $\|X −\Pi_{E_i}(𝑋)\|_2<\|X − \Pi_{E_{2−i}}(X)\|_2$ and $p^i (X)=0$ otherwise. 
Then, Langevin diffusion initialized $O(\sigma_{\min}(M)⁡/k)$ close to $E_i$ run for t steps samples from distribution $p_t$, s.t. 
$$ \chi^2(p_t, p^i ) \leq \delta + e^{−𝑡/C}, 𝐶=O\left(\frac{\beta}{(k \sigma_{\min}⁡(M))}\right) $$-->

<p>We remark that the closeness condition for the first step is easy to ensure using existing results on gradient-descent based optimization for these objectives. It’s also easy to use the above result to sample approximately from the distribution $p$ itself, rather than only the “local” distributions $p^i$ – this is due to the fact that the distribution $p$ looks like the “disjoint union” of the distributions $p^1$ and $p^2$.</p>

<p>Before we describe the main elements of the proof, we review some concepts from differential geometry.</p>

<h2 id="extremely-brief-intro-to-differential-geometry">(Extremely) brief intro to differential geometry</h2>

<p>We won’t do a full primer on differential geometry in this blog post, but we will briefly informally describe some of the relevant concepts. See Section 5 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05576">our paper</a> for an intro to differential geometry (written with a computer science reader in mind, so more easy-going than a differential geometry textbook).</p>

<p>Recall, the <em>tangent</em> space at $x$, denoted by $T_x M$, is the set of all derivatives $v$ of a curve passing through $x$.<!-- the exponential map at a point $x$ in direction $v \in T_x M$, denoted by $\exp_x(v)$ is the movement of $x$ along the *geodesic* (i.e. shortest path curve) at $x$ for one unit of time (note this curve is unique). See the left part of the figure below.--><!-- To explain Ricci curvature, consider first the intuitive concept of curvature: Euclidean space has zero curvature, while the sphere has positive curvature because it "folds into itself." One way to capture this is by looking at the volume of a geodesic ball around a point: the sphere's positive curvature causes the volume to be *less* than the volume in Euclidean space. We can take this change in volume as the *definition* of curvature.--> The <em>Ricci curvature</em> at a point $x$, in direction $v \in T_x M$, denoted $\mbox{Ric}_x(v)$, captures the second-order term in the rate of change of volumes of sets in a small neighborhood around $x$, as the points in the set are moved along the geodesic (i.e. shortest path curve) in direction $v$ (or more precisely, each point $y$ in the set is moved along the geodesic in the direction of the parallel transport of $v$ at $y$; see the right part of the figure below from <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aspm/1543086328">(Ollivier 2010)</a>). A Ricci curvature of $0$ preserves volumes (think: a plane), a Ricci curvature $&gt;0$ shrinks volume (think: a sphere), and a Ricci curvature $&lt;0$ expands volume (think: a hyperbola).</p>

<center>

</center>

<!--Slightly more mathematically, it's relatively easy to understand the Ricci curvature when we have a parametrized manifold. The curvature of the manifold should be intuitively captured by the second-order behavior of the parametrization. Namely, consider a manifold parametrized locally as
$$\phi: T_x M \to T_x M \times N_x M, \phi(z) = x + (z, g(z))$$ 
where $N_xM$ is the *normal* space at $x$, the subspace orthogonal to $T_xM$. 
Then, the Hessian viewed as the quadratic form $\nabla^2 g: T_x M \times T_x M \to N_x M$ is called the *second fundamental form* and denoted as $\mathrm{I\!I}_x$. If $\{e_i\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $T_x M$, the Ricci curvature in a direction $v \in T_x M$ is then:
$$\mbox{Ric}(v) = \sum_i \langle \mathrm{I\!I}(u,u), \mathrm{I\!I}(e_i, e_i) \rangle - \|\mathrm{I\!I}(u,e_i)\|^2$$ 
-->

<p>The connections between curvature and mixing time of diffiusions is rather deep and we won’t attempt to convey it fully in a blog post - the definitive reference is <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-00227-9">Analysis and Geometry of Markov Diffusion Operators</a> by Bakry, Gentil and Ledoux. The main idea is that mixing time can be bounded by how long it takes for random walks starting at different locations to “join together,” and positive curvature brings them together faster.
<!-- A small gesture towards these connections can be conveyed through a popular coupling for Brownian motion called a *reflection coupling*.--></p>

<p>To make this formal, we define a <em>coupling</em> of two random variables $X, Y$ to be any random variable $W = (X’,Y’)$ such that the marginal distribution of the coordinates $X’$ and $Y’$ are the same as the distributions of $X$ and $Y$. It’s well known that the convergence time of a random walk in total variation distance can be upper bounded by the expected time until two coupled copies of the walk join. On the plane, a canonical coupling (the <em>reflection coupling</em>) between two Brownian motions can be constructed by reflecting the move of the second process through the perpendicular bisector between the locations of the two processes (see figure below). On a positively curved manifold (like a sphere), an analogous reflection can be defined, and the curvature only brings the two processes closer faster.</p>

<center>
<img src="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/reflection.jpg" width="500"/>
</center>

<p>As a final tool, our proof uses a very important theorem due to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870876800023">Milnor</a> about manifolds with algebraic structure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (Milnor ‘76, informal)</strong>: The Ricci curvature of a Lie group equipped with a left-invariant metric is non-negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a pinch, a Lie group is a group that also is a smooth manifold, and furthermore, the group operations result in a smooth transformation on the manifold - so that the “geometry” and “algebra” combine together. A metric is left-invariant for the group if acting on the left by any group element leaves the metric “unchanged”.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-the-decomposition-framework">Implementing the decomposition framework</h2>

<p>To apply the framework we sketched out as part of Theorem 1, we need to verify the conditions of the Theorem.</p>

<p>To prove <strong>Condition 1</strong>, we need to show that for large $\beta$, the random walk stays near to the manifold it’s been initialized close to. The main tools for this are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4%27s_lemma">Ito’s lemma</a>, local convexity of the function $| \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b |_2^2$ and basic results in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%E2%80%93Ingersoll%E2%80%93Ross_model">Cox-Ingersoll-Ross</a> processes. Namely, Ito’s lemma (which can be viewed as a “change-of-variables” formula for random variables) allows us to write down a stochastic differential equation for the evolution of the distance of $X$ from the manifold, which turns out to have a “bias” towards small values, due to the local convexity of $| \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b |_2^2$. This can in turn be analyzed approximately as Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process - a well-studied type of non-negative stochastic process.</p>

<p>To prove <strong>Condition 2</strong>, we need to specify the partition of the space around the manifolds $E_i$. Describing the full partition is somewhat technical, but importantly, the manifolds $M^{\Delta}$ have the form $M^{\Delta} = \{\Delta U: U \mbox{ is an orthogonal matrix with det 1}\}$ for some matrix $\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$.</p>

<p>The proof that $M^{\Delta}$ has a good Poincare constant (i.e. Condition 2.1) relies on two ideas: first, $M^{\Delta}$ is a Lie group with group operation $\circ$ defined such that $(\Delta U)   \circ (\Delta V) := \Delta (UV)$, along with a corresponding left-invariant metric - thus, by Milnor’s theorem, it has a non-negative Ricci curvature; second, we can relate the Ricci curvatures with the Euclidean metric to the curvature with the left-invariant metric. The proof that the marginal distribution over $\Delta$ has a good Poincaré constant involves showing that this distribution is approximately log-concave. Finally, the “change-of-conditional-probability” condition (Condition 2.3) can be proved by explicit calculation.</p>

<h1 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h1>

<p>In this series of posts, we surveyed two recent approaches to analyzing Langevin-like sampling algorithms <em>beyond log-concavity</em> - the most natural analogue to non-convexity in the world of sampling/inference. The structures we considered, <em>multi-modality</em> and <em>invariant manifolds</em>, are common in practice in modern machine learning.</p>

<p>Unlike non-convex optimization, provable guarantees for sampling beyond log-concavity is still under-studied and we hope our work will inspire and excite further efforts. For instance, how do we handle modes of different “shape”? Can we handle an exponential number of modes, if they have further structure (e.g., posteriors in concrete latent-variable models like Bayesian networks)? Can we handle more complex manifold structure (e.g. the matrix distributions we considered for <em>any</em> $\beta$)?</p></div>
