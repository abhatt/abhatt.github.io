<blockquote><p>Abstract: MIP* denotes the class of problems that admit interactive proofs with quantum entangled provers. It has been an outstanding question to characterize the complexity of MIP*. Most notably, there was no known computable upper bound on this class.<br/>
We show that MIP* is equal to the class RE, the set of recursively enumerable languages. In particular, this shows that MIP* contains uncomputable problems. Through a series of known connections, this also yields a negative answer to Connes’ Embedding Problem from the theory of operator algebras. In this talk, I will explain the connection between Connes’ Embedding Problem, quantum information theory, and complexity theory. I will then give an overview of our approach, which involves reducing the Halting Problem to the problem of approximating the entangled value of nonlocal games.<br/>
Joint work with Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, and John Wright.</p></blockquote></div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: We show that it is NP-hard to distinguish CNF formulas that have Resolution refutations of almost linear length from CNF formulas that do not even have weakly exponentially long ones. It follows from this that Resolution is not automatable in polynomial time unless P = NP, or in weakly exponential time unless ETH fails. The proof of this is simple enough that all its ideas can be explained in a talk. Along the way, I will try to explain the process of discovery that led us to the result. This is joint work with Moritz Müller.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In a <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">previous post</a> I reported on the beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">recent result</a> by Natarajan and Wright showing the astounding power of multi-prover interactive proofs with quantum provers sharing entanglement: in letters, <img alt="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEEXP%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}"/>. In this post I want to report on follow-up work with Ji, Natarajan, Wright, and Yuen, that we just posted to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">arXiv</a>. This time however I will tell the story from a personal point of view, with all the caveats that this implies: the “hard science” will be limited (but there could be a hint as to how “science”, to use a big word, “progresses”, to use an ill-defined one), the story is far too long, and it might be mostly of interest to me only. It’s a one-sided story, but that has to be. (In particular below I may at times attribute credit in the form “X had this idea”. This is my recollection only, and it is likely to be inaccurate. Certainly I am ignoring a lot of important threads.) I wrote this because I enjoyed recollecting some of the best moments in the story just as much as some the hardest; it is fun to look back and find meanings in ideas that initially appeared disconnected. Think of it as an example of how different lines of work can come together in unexpected ways; a case for open-ended research. It’s also an antidote against despair that I am preparing for myself: whenever I feel I’ve been stuck on a project for far too long, I’ll come back to this post and ask myself if it’s been 14 years yet — if not, then press on.</p>
<p>It likely comes as a surprise to me only that I am no longer fresh out of the cradle. My academic life started in earnest some 14 years ago, when in the Spring of 2006 I completed my Masters thesis in Computer Science under the supervision of Julia Kempe, at Orsay in France. I had met Julia the previous term: her class on quantum computing was, by far, the best-taught and most exciting course in the Masters program I was attending, and she had gotten me instantly hooked. Julia agreed to supervise my thesis, and suggested that I look into some interesting recent result by Stephanie Wehner that linked the study of entanglement and nonlocality in quantum mechanics to complexity-theoretic questions about interactive proof systems (specifically, this was Stephanie’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508201">paper</a> showing that <img alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BQIP%7D%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}"/>).</p>
<p>At the time the topic was very new. It had been initiated the previous year with a beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404076">paper</a> by Cleve et al. (that I have recommended to many a student since!). It was a perfect fit for me: the mathematical aspects of complexity theory and quantum computing connected to my undergraduate background, while the relative concreteness of quantum mechanics (it is a physical theory after all) spoke to my desire for real-world connection (not “impact” or even “application” — just “connection”). Once I got myself up to speed in the area (which consisted of three papers: the two I already mentioned, together with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0102013">paper</a> by Kobayashi and Matsumoto where they studied interactive proofs with quantum messages), Julia suggested looking into the the “entangled-prover” class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> introduced in the aforementioned paper by Cleve et al. Nothing was known about this class! Nothing besides the trivial inclusion of single-prover interactive proofs, IP, and the containment in…ALL, the trivial class that contains all languages.<br/>
Yet the characterization MIP=NEXP of its classical counterpart by Babai et al. in the 1990s had led to one of the most productive lines of work in complexity of the past few decades, through the PCP theorem and its use from hardness of approximation to efficient cryptographic schemes. Surely, studying <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> had to be a productive direction? In spite of its well-established connection to classical complexity theory, via the formalism of interactive proofs, this was a real gamble. The study of entanglement from the complexity-theoretic perspective was entirely new, and bound to be fraught with difficulty; very few results were available and the existing lines of works, from the foundations of nonlocality to more recent endeavors in device-independent cryptography, provided little other starting point than strong evidence that even the simplest examples came with many unanswered questions. But my mentor was fearless, and far from a novice in terms of defraying new areas, having done pioneering work in areas ranging from quantum random walks to Hamiltonian complexity through adiabatic computation. Surely this would lead to something?</p>
<p>It certainly did. More sleepless nights than papers, clearly, but then the opposite would only indicate dullness. Julia’s question led to far more unexpected consequences than I, or I believe she, could have imagined at the time. I am writing this post to celebrate, in a personal way, the latest step in 15 years of research by dozens of researchers: today my co-authors and I uploaded to the quant-ph arXiv what we consider a complete characterization of the power of entangled-prover interactive proof systems by proving the equality <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}"/>, the class of all recursively enumerable languages (a complete problem for RE is the halting problem). Without goign too much into the result itself (if you’re interested, we have a long introduction waiting for you), and since this is a personal blog, I will continue on with some personal thoughts about the path that got us there.</p>
<p>When Julia &amp; I started working on the question, our main source of inspiration were the results by Cleve et al. showing that the nonlocal correlations of entanglement had interesting consequences when seen through the lens of interactive proof systems in complexity theory. Since the EPR paper a lot of work in understanding entanglement had already been accomplished in the Physics community, most notably by Mermin, Peres, Bell, and more recently the works in device-indepent quantum cryptography by Acin, Pironio, Scarani and many others stimulated by Ekert’s proposal for quantum key distribution and Mayers and Yao’s idea for “device-independent cryptography”. By then we certainly knew that “spooky action-at-a-distance” did not entail any faster-than-light communication, and indeed was not really “action-at-a-distance” in the first place but merely “correlation-at-a-distance”. What Cleve et al. recognized is that these “spooky correlations-at-a-distance” were sufficiently special so as to not only give numerically different values in “Bell inequalities”, the tool invented by Bell to evidence nonlocality in quantum mechanics, but also have some potentially profound consequences in complexity theory. In particular, examples such as the “Magic Square game” demonstrated that enough correlation could be gained from entanglement so as to defeat basic proof systems whose soundness relied only on the absence of communication between the provers, an assumption that until then had been wrongly equated with the assumption that any computation performed by the provers could be modeled entirely locally. I think that the fallacy of this implicit assumption came as a surprise to complexity theorists, who may still not have entirely internalized it. Yet the perfect quantum strategy for the Magic Square game provides a very concrete “counter-example” to the soundness of the “clause-vs-variable” game for 3SAT. Indeed this game, a reformulation by Aravind and Cleve-Mermin of a Bell Inequality discovered by Mermin and Peres in 1990, can be easily re-framed as a 3SAT system of equations that is <em>not</em> satisfiable and yet is such that the associated two-player clause-vs-variable game has a <em>perfect</em> quantum strategy. It is this observation, made in the paper by Cleve et al., that gave the first strong hint that the use of entanglement in interactive proof systems could make many classical results in the area go awry.</p>
<p>By importing the study of non-locality into complexity theory Cleve et al. immediately brought it into the realm of asymptotic analysis. Complexity theorists don’t study fixed objects, they study families of objects that tend to have a uniform underlying structure and whose interesting properties manifest themselves “in the limit”. As a result of this new perspective focus shifted from the study of single games or correlations to infinite families thereof. Some of the early successes of this translation include the “unbounded violations” that arose from translating asymptotic separations in communication complexity to the language of Bell inequalities and correlations (e.g. this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5043">paper</a>). These early successes attracted the attention of some physicists working in foundations as well as some mathematical physicists, leading to a productive exploration that combined tools from quantum information, functional analysis and complexity theory.</p>
<p>The initial observations made by Cleve et al. had pointed to <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> as a possibly interesting complexity class to study. Rather amazingly, nothing was known about it! They had shown that under strong restrictions on the verifier’s predicate (it should be an XOR of two answer bits), a collapse took place: by the work of Hastad, XOR-MIP equals NEXP, but <img alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}"/> is included in EXP. This seemed very fortuitous (the inclusion is proved via a connection with semidefinite programming that seems tied to the structure of XOR-MIP protocols): could entanglement induce a collapse of the entire, unrestricted class? We thought (at this point mostly Julia thought, because I had no clue) that this ought not to be the case, and so we set ourselves to show that the equality <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}"/>, that would directly parallel Babai et al.’s characterization MIP=NEXP, holds. We tried to show this by introducing techniques to “immunize” games against entanglement: modify an interactive proof system so that its structure makes it “resistant” to the kind of “nonlocal powers” that can be used to defeat the clause-vs-variable game (witness the Magic Square). This was partially successful, and led to one of the papers I am most proud of — I am proud of it because I think it introduced elementary techniques (such as the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality — inside joke — more seriously, basic things such as “prover-switching”, “commutation tests”, etc.) that are now routine manipulations in the area. The paper was a hard sell! It’s good to remember the first rejections we received. They were not unjustified: the main point of criticism was that we were only able to establish a hardness result for exponentially small completeness-soundness gap. A result for such a small gap in the classical setting follows directly from a very elementary analysis based on the Cook-Levin theorem. So then why did we have to write so many pages (and so many applications of Cauchy-Schwarz!) to arrive at basically the same result (with a <img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>)?</p>
<p>Eventually we got lucky and the paper was accepted to a conference. But the real problem, of establishing any non-trivial lower bound on the class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> with constant (or, in the absence of any parallel repetition theorem, inverse-polynomial) completeness-soundness gap, remained. By that time I had transitioned from a Masters student in France to a graduate student in Berkeley, and the problem (pre-)occupied me during some of the most difficult years of my Ph.D. I fully remember spending my first year entirely thinking about this (oh and sure, that systems class I had to pass to satisfy the Berkeley requirements), and then my second year — yet, getting nowhere. (I checked the arXiv to make sure I’m not making this up: two full years, no posts.) I am forever grateful to my fellow student Anindya De for having taken me out of the cycle of torture by knocking on my door with one of the most interesting questions I have studied, that led me into quantum cryptography and quickly resulted in an enjoyable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4680">paper</a>. It was good to feel productive again! (Though the paper had fun reactions as well: after putting it on the arXiv we quickly heard from experts in the area that we had solved an irrelevant problem, and that we better learn about information theory — which we did, eventually leading to another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5514">paper</a>, etc.) The project had distracted me and I set interactive proofs aside; clearly, I was stuck.</p>
<p>About a year later I visited IQC in Waterloo. I don’t remember in what context the visit took place. What I do remember is a meeting in the office of Tsuyoshi Ito, at the time a postdoctoral scholar at IQC. Tsuyoshi asked me to explain our result with Julia. He then asked a very pointed question: the bedrock for the classical analysis of interactive proof systems is the “linearity test” of Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld (BLR). Is there any sense in which we could devise a quantum version of that test?</p>
<p>What a question! This was great. At first it seemed fruitless: in what sense could one argue that quantum provers apply a “linear function”? Sure, quantum mechanics is linear, but that is besides the point. The linearity is a property of the prover’s answers as a function of their question. So what to make of the quantum state, the inherent randomness, etc.?</p>
<p>It took us a few months to figure it out. Once we got there however, the answer was relatively simple — the prover should be making a question-independent measurement that returns a linear function that it applies to its question in order to obtain the answer returned to the verifier — and it opened the path to our subsequent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">paper</a> showing that the inclusion of NEXP in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> indeed holds. Tsuyoshi’s question about linearity testing had allowed us to make the connection with PCP techniques; from there to MIP=NEXP there was only one step to make, which is to analyze multi-linearity testing. That step was suggested by my Ph.D. advisor, Umesh Vazirani, who was well aware of the many pathways towards the classical PCP theorem, since the theorem had been obtained in great part by his former student Sanjeev Arora. It took a lot of technical work, yet conceptually a single question from my co-author had sufficed to take me out of a 3-year slumber.</p>
<p>This was in 2012, and I thought we were done. For some reason the converse inclusion, of <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> in NEXP, seemed to resist our efforts, but surely it couldn’t resist much longer. Navascues et al. had introduced a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that seemed to give the right answer (technically they could only show convergence to a relaxation, the commuting value, but that seemed like a technicality; in particular, the values coincide when restricted to finite-dimensional strategies, which is all we computer scientists cared about). There were no convergence bounds on the hierarchy, yet at the same time commutative SDP hierarchies were being used to obtain very strong results in combinatorial optimization, and it seemed like it would only be a matter of time before someone came up with an analysis of the quantum case. (I had been trying to solve a related “dimension reduction problem” with Oded Regev for years, and we were making no progress; yet it seemed <em>someone</em> ought to!)</p>
<p>In Spring 2014 during an open questions session at a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/qhc2014-1">workshop</a> at the Simons Institute in Berkeley Dorit Aharonov suggested that I ask the question of the possible inclusion of QMA-EXP, the exponential-sized-proofs analogue of QMA, in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. A stronger result than the inclusion of NEXP (under assumptions), wouldn’t it be a more natural “fully quantum” analogue of MIP=NEXP? Dorit’s suggestion was motivated by research on the “quantum PCP theorem”, that aims to establish similar hardness results in the realm of the local Hamiltonian problem; see e.g. <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/quantum-pcp-conjectures/">this post</a> for the connection. I had no idea how to approach the question — I also didn’t really believe the answer could be positive — but what can you do, if Dorit asks you something… So I reluctantly went to the board and asked the question. Joe Fitzsimons was in the audience, and he immediately picked it up! Joe had the fantastic ideas of using quantum error-correction, or more specifically secret-sharing, to distribute a quantum proof among the provers. His enthusiasm overcame my skepticism, and we eventually <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0260">showed</a> the desired inclusion. Maybe <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> <em>was</em> bigger than <img alt="{\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{NEXP}}"/> after all.</p>
<p>Our result, however, had a similar deficiency as the one with Julia, in that the completeness-soundness gap was exponentially small. Obtaining a result with a constant gap took 3 years of couple more years of work and the fantastic energy and insights of a Ph.D. student at MIT, Anand Natarajan. Anand is the first person I know of to have had the courage to dive in to the most technical aspects of the analysis of the aforementioned results, while also bringing in the insights of a “true quantum information theorist” that were supported by Anand’s background in Physics and upbringing in the group of Aram Harrow at MIT. (In contrast I think of myself more as a “raw” mathematician; I don’t really understand quantum states other than as psd matrices…not that I understand math either of course; I suppose I’m some kind of a half-baked mish-mash.) Anand had many ideas but one of the most beautiful ones led to what he poetically called the “Pauli braiding test”, a “truly quantum” analogue of the BLR linearity test that amounts to doing <em>two</em> linearity tests in conjugate bases and piecing the results together into a robust test for <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-qubit entanglement (I wrote about our work on this <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/pauli-braiding/">here</a>).</p>
<p>At approximately the same time Zhengfeng Ji had another wonderful idea, that was in some sense orthogonal to our work. (My interpretation of) Zhengfeng’s idea is that one can see an interactive proof system as a computation (verifier-prover-verifier) and use Kitaev’s circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction to transform the entire computation into a “quantum CSP” (in the same sense that the local Hamiltonian problem is a quantum analogue of classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSP)) that could then itself be verified by a quantum multi-prover interactive proof system…with exponential gains in efficiency! Zhengfeng’s result implied an exponential improvement in complexity compared to the result by Julia and myself, showing inclusion of NEEXP, instead of NEXP, in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. However, Zhengfeng’s technique suffered from the same exponentially small completeness-soundness gap as we had, so that the best lower bound on <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> per se remained NEXP.</p>
<p>Both works led to follow-ups. With Natarajan we promoted the Pauli braiding test into a “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">quantum low-degree test</a>” that allowed us to show the inclusion of QMA-EXP into <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>, with constant gap, thereby finally answering the question posed by Aharonov 4 years after it was asked. (I should also say that by then all results on <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> started relying on a sequence of parallel repetition results shown by Bavarian, Yuen, and others; I am skipping this part.) In parallel, with Ji, Fitzsimons, and Yuen we showed that Ji’s compression technique could be “iterated” an arbitrary number of times. In fact, by going back to “first principles” and representing verifiers uniformly as Turing machines we realized that the compression technique could be used iteratively to (up to small caveats) give a new proof of the fact (first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08618">shown</a> by Slofstra using an embedding theorem for finitely presented group) that the zero-gap version of <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> contains the halting problem. In particular, the entangled value is uncomputable! This was not the first time that uncomputability crops in to a natural problem in quantum computing (e.g. the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04573">spectral gap paper</a>), yet it still surprises when it shows up. Uncomputable! How can anything be uncomputable!</p>
<p>As we were wrapping up our paper Henry Yuen realized that our “iterated compression of interactive proof systems” was likely optimal, in the following sense. Even a mild improvement of the technique, in the form of a slower closing of the completeness-soundness gap through compression, would yield a much stronger result: undecidability of the constant-gap class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. It was already known by work of Navascues et al., Fritz, and others, that such a result would have, if not surprising, certainly consequences that seemed like they would be taking us out of our depth. In particular, undecidability of any language in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> would imply a negative resolution to a series of equivalent conjectures in functional analysis, from Tsirelson’s problem to Connes’ Embedding Conjecture through Kirchberg’s QWEP conjecture. While we liked our result, I don’t think that we believed it could resolve any conjecture(s) in functional analysis.</p>
<p>So we moved on. At least I moved on, I did some cryptography for a change. But Anand Natarajan and his co-author John Wright did not stop there. They had the last major insight in this story, which underlies their recent STOC best paper described in the previous <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">post</a>. Briefly, they were able to combine the two lines of work, by Natarajan &amp; myself on low-degree testing and by Ji et al. on compression, to obtain a compression that is specially tailored to the existing <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> protocol for NEXP and compresses that protocol without reducing its completeness-soundness gap. This then let them show Ji’s result that <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> contains NEEXP, but this time with constant gap! The result received well-deserved attention. In particular, it is the first in this line of works to not suffer from any caveats (such as a closing gap, or randomized reductions, or some kind of “unfair” tweak on the model that one could attribute the gain in power to), and it implies an unconditional separation between MIP and <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>.</p>
<p>As they were putting the last touches on their result, suddenly something happened, which is that a path towards a much bigger result opened up. What Natarajan &amp; Wright had achieved is a one-step gapless compression. In our iterated compression paper we had observed that iterated gapless compression would lead to <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}"/>, implying negative answers to the aforementioned conjectures. So then?</p>
<p>I suppose it took some more work, but in some way all the ideas had been laid out in the previous 15 years of work in the complexity of quantum interactive proof systems; we just had to put it together. And so a decade after the characterization <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4737">QIP = PSPACE</a> of single-prover quantum interactive proof systems, we have arrived at a characterization of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems, <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}"/>. With one author in common between the two papers: congratulations Zhengfeng!</p>
<p>Even though we just posted a paper, in a sense there is much more left to do. I am hopeful that our complexity-theoretic result will attract enough interest from the mathematicians’ community, and especially operator algebraists, for whom CEP is a central problem, that some of them will be willing to devote time to understanding the result. I also recognize that much effort is needed on our own side to make it accessible in the first place! I don’t doubt that eventually complexity theory will not be needed to obtain the purely mathematical consequences; yet I am hopeful that some of the ideas may eventually find their way into the construction of interesting mathematical objects (such as, who knows, a non-hyperlinear group).</p>
<p>That was a good Masters project…thanks Julia!</p></div>

(Note that this is a weaker, aka safer, hypothesis than the standard SETH.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Quantum algorithms for edit distance?</h2>
<p>One way to try to circumvent the computational barriers is by approximation algorithms (see my <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/07/20/approximating-edit-distance/">blog post</a>). A different approach is to go with quantum algorithms: Grover’s search can solve NC-SAT in <img alt="2^{n/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="2^{n/2}"/> time. Even those of us less skeptic than <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/">Gil Kalai</a> can probably agree that quadratic quantum speedups won’t be practical anytime soon. But in theory, I find the question of whether we can design subquadratic quantum algorithms for edit distance very interesting (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04178">[BEG+18]</a>).</p>
<p>Alas, even with the power of quantum computers we don’t know any truly subquadratic algorithms for computing LCS/ED. On the other hand, it is not clear how to rule out even linear-time algorithms. A few weeks ago, Buhrman, Patro, and Speelman, posted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05686">paper</a> that gives a <img alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n^{3/2}"/> quantum <em>query complexity </em>lower bound for LCS/ED.</p>
<blockquote><p>Open Problem: Close the <img alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n^{3/2}"/> vs <img alt="n^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n^2"/> gap for quantum query complexity of ED/LCS.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is “query complexity” of ED/LCS? Buhrman et al. consider the following query model: In LCS, we want a <strong>maximum monotone matching</strong> between the characters of the two strings, where we can match two characters if they’re identical. Now suppose that in the query complexity problem we still want to find a maximum monotone matching, but instead of the character-equality graph (which is a union of disjoint cliques), we have an arbitrary bipartite graph, and <strong>given a pair of vertices, the oracle tells you if there is an edge between them</strong>.</p>
<p>This model may seem a bit counter-intuitive at first since the graphs may not correspond to any pair of strings; and indeed other models have been considered before <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=321922">[UAH76]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4033">[AKO10]</a>. But it turns out that this model is well-motivated by the NC-SETH lower bound (see discussion below).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The ultimate hardness hypothesis</h2>
<p>What does the <img alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n^{3/2}"/> query complexity lower bound mean for algorithms on actual strings? Instead of a black box oracle, our algorithms have access to an NC-circuit that implements it. Intuitively, we don’t know how to do very much with white box circuits, so it seems plausible to hypothesize that the running time will be lower bound by the query complexity. In some sense, this is a special case of the following <em>ultimate hardness hypothesis </em>that unifies a lot of the computational hardness assumptions that we like to assume but have no idea how to prove (e.g. P!=NP, P!=BQP, NC-SETH, FP!=PPAD, etc):</p>
<blockquote><p>[Ultimate Hardness Hypothesis] For every problem, the white-box computational complexity is lower bounded by the black-box query complexity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In communication complexity similar statements are known and are called simulation/lifting theorems (see e.g. <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~mika/thesis.pdf">Mika’s thesis</a>). For computational complexity, there are obvious counter examples such as “decide if the oracle can be implemented by a small circuit”. So it only makes sense to continue to assume the ultimate hardness hypothesis for “reasonable problems” instead of “every problem”.</p>
<p>But Burhman et al. identify the following variant of the ultimate hardness hypothesis which I find very interesting. It is defined with respect to a function <img alt="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7B2%5En%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}"/> which takes as input the truth-table of a circuit and outputs True or False. Roughly, they hypothesize that:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Burhman et al.-QSETH, paraphrased] For <em>every</em> <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="T"/>, deciding if <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="T"/> is true or false is as hard whether we’re given the actual circuit, or only the guarantee that the oracle is implemented by a small circuit”</p></blockquote>
<p>At a first read, I thought that arguments a-la impossibility of obfuscation <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2001/21390001.pdf">[BGI+01]</a> should refute this hypothesis, but a few weeks later I still don’t know how to prove it. Do you?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A tip for the upcoming holidays</h2>
<p>During my postdoc, I worked on the quantum query complexity of ED/LCS with Shalev Ben-David, Rolando La Placa, and John Wright. I was a bit bummed to find out that we got scooped by Buhrman et al, but I know of at least 3 other groups that were also scooped by the same paper, so at least we’re in good company <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>
<p>At the time, a fellow postdoc from Psychology asked me what I was working on. I resisted the temptation to try to explain the various quantum variants of NC-SETH, and instead told him I was working on “DNA sequencing with quantum computers”. His reaction was priceless. Regardless of what you’re actually working on, try this line during the holidays when your relatives ask you about your work.</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Peer review is the backbone of scholarly research. It is however faced with a number of challenges (or “demons”) which cause unfairness to authors, and degrade the overall quality of the process. This talk will present principled and practical approaches to battle these demons in peer review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subjectivity: How to ensure that all papers are judged by the same yardstick?</li>
<li>Mis-calibration: How to use ratings in presence of arbitrary or adversarial mis-calibration?</li>
<li>Bias: How to rigorously test for existence of (gender/fame/race/…) biases in peer review?</li>
<li>Strategic behavior: How to insulate peer review from strategic behavior of author-reviewers?</li>
<li>Noise: How to assign reviewers to papers to simultaneously ensure fair and accurate evaluations in the presence of review noise?</li>
</ol>
<p>The work uses tools from social choice theory, statistics and learning theory, information theory, game theory and decision theory. No prior knowledge on these topics will be assumed.</p></blockquote>

<div>We prove bounds on the generalization error of convolutional networks. The bounds are characterized in terms of the training loss, the number of parameters, the Lipschitz constant of the loss, and the distance of the initial and final weights. The bounds are independent of the number of pixels in the input, as well as the width and height of hidden feature maps. These are the first bounds for DNNs with such guarantees.  We present experiments with CIFAR-10, varying hyperparameters of a deep convolutional network, comparing our bounds with practical generalization gaps.</div>

<p>Existing techniques for derandomizing algorithms based on circuit lower bounds yield a large polynomial slowdown in running time. We show that assuming exponential lower bounds against nondeterministic circuits, we can convert any randomized algorithm running in time T to a deterministic one running in time nearly T^2. Under complexity-theoretic assumptions, such a slowdown is nearly optimal.</p>
<p>In this talk I will concentrate on the role of error-correcting codes in those techniques. We will see which properties of error-correcting codes are useful for constructing pseudorandomness primitives sufficient for derandomization, where they came short of achieving better slowdown, and how we can overcome that.</p>

<div> There are many basic problems over sequences. For example, computing the edit distance between two sequences, detecting how RNA sequences fold, finding the distance between a sequence and a language (collection of sequences), understanding how disbalanced a parenthesis sequence is. They have natural applications in various areas including computational biology, natural language processing, compiler optimization, and data cleaning. The last few years have seen a plethora of results where new faster algorithms have been developed for these problems with various trade-offs between approximation (quality of solution) and running time (scalability). In this talk, I will present some of the tools that have been developed from my work related to these problems. Depending on time and audience choices, we will cover one or more of the following.</div>
<div/>
<div>(i) A random walk based technique useful to measure how disbalanced a parenthesis sequence is, which has also been useful for streaming computation of edit distance.</div>
<div/>
<div>(ii) A dependent rounding technique that gives nearly optimal result in nearly optimal time for estimating distance between a sequence and a language, which can also be used to speed up other polynomial time problems, such as the all pairs shortest path computation on graphs.</div>
<div/>
<div>(iii) An amnesic dynamic programming technique that gives significantly faster approximation algorithm for RNA-folding, which can also be useful for many dynamic programming based problems that have Lipschitz property (most sequence problems have it).</div>
<div/>
<div>(iv) An elimination of shortest path technique that gives sublinear time algorithms for estimating edit distance for certain regimes of edit distance.</div>

<div>The audience is encouraged to pick their favorite and convey that to the speaker at or before (by email) the talk.</div>

<p><em>Local Computation Algorithms</em></p>
<p>Consider a setting in which inputs to and outputs from a computational problem are so large, that there is not time to read them in their entirety.   However, if one is only interested in small parts of the output at any given time, is it really necessary to solve the entire computational problem? Is it even necessary to view the whole input? We survey recent work in the model of  “local computation algorithms” which for a given input, supports queries by a user to values of specified bits of a legal output.  The goal is to design local computation algorithms in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order to determine the value of any single bit of the output. Though this model describes sequential computations, techniques from local distributed algorithms have been extremely important in designing efficient local computation algorithms. In this talk, we describe results on a variety of problems for which sublinear time and space local computation algorithms have been developed — we will give special focus to finding maximal independent sets and sparse spanning graphs.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>by Naman Agarwal, Karan Singh and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">this paper</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05062">this paper</a>. </em></p>
<p>The mainstream thought in classical control operates under the simplifying principle that nature evolves according to well-specified dynamics perturbed by i.i.d. Gaussian noise, a field called <b>Optimal Control</b>. While this principle has proven very successful in some real world systems, it does not lend itself to the construction of truly <b>robust</b> controllers. In the real world one can expect all sorts of deviations from this setting, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherent correlations between perturbations across time due to the environment.</li>
<li>Modeling misspecification, which can introduce unforeseeable, non-stochastic deviations from the assumed dynamics.</li>
<li>Completely adversarial perturbations introduced by a malicious entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, in the world of classical supervised learning, the presence of the above factors has led to the adoption of <a href="https://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">online learning</a> in lieu of statistical learning, which allows for robust noise models and game-theoretic / strategic learning. A natural question arises: <i>what is the analogue of online learning and worst-case regret in robust control? </i></p>
<h2>Linear Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control</h2>
<p>Dynamical systems constitute the formalism to describe time-dependent, dynamic real-world phenomenon, ranging from fluid flow through a pipe, the movement of a pendulum, to the change of weather. The archetypal example here is a linear dynamical system, which permits a particularly intuitive interpretation as a (configurable) vector field (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system">wikipedia</a>):</p>
<p><img alt="" height="158" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null.png?w=624&amp;h=158" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>A linear dynamical system (LDS) posits the state of a system evolves via the following dynamical relation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+Ax_t+%2B+Bu_t+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t"/></p>

<p>Here <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t"/> represents the state of the system, <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> represents a control input and <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> is a perturbation introduced to the dynamics, for the time step t. The vector fields above illustrate the behavior of the system for a few different choices of A, when the control input <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> is set to zero. The control inputs, when correctly chosen, can modify the dynamics to induce a particular desired behavior. For example, controlling the thermostat in a data center to achieve a particular temperature, applying a force to a pendulum to keep it upright, or driving a drone to a destination.</p>
<p>The goal of the controller is to produce a sequence of control actions <img alt="u_1 \ldots u_T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_1+%5Cldots+u_T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_1 \ldots u_T"/> aimed at minimizing the cumulative loss <img alt="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_t+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)"/>. In classical control the loss functions are convex quadratics and known ahead of time. However, in the quest for more robust controllers, henceforth we will consider a broader class of general (possibly non-quadratic) convex cost functions, which may be adversarially chosen, and only be revealed online per-time-step to the controller.</p>
<h2>Previous notions: LQR and H-infinity control</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most fundamental setting in control theory is a LDS is with quadratic costs <img alt="c_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t"/> and i.i.d Gaussian perturbations <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>. The solution known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear&#x2013;quadratic_regulator">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a>, derived by solving the Riccati equation, is well understood and corresponds to a linear policy (i.e. the control input is a linear function of the state).</p>
<p>The assumption of i.i.d perturbations has been relaxed in classical control theory, with the introduction of a min-max notion, in a subfield known as <a href="https://stephentu.github.io/blog/h-infinity-control/2018/07/01/hinf-optimal-control-dynamic-games.html"><img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control</a>. Informally, the idea behind <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control is to design a controller which performs well against <i>all </i>sequences of bounded perturbations. There are two shortcomings of this approach; firstly computing such a controller can be a difficult optimization problem in itself. While a closed form for such a controller is known for linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, no such form is known when costs can be non-quadratic. Secondly and perhaps more importantly, the min-max notion is non-adaptive and hence often too pessimistic. It is possible that during the execution of the system, nature produces a <i>benign (predictable)</i> sequence of perturbations (say, for instance, the perturbations are, in truth, highly correlated). The <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> controller in this setting could be overly pessimistic and lead to a higher cost than what could be achieved via a potentially more adaptive controller. This motivates our approach of minimizing regret, which we describe next.</p>
<h2>A less pessimistic metric: Policy regret</h2>
<p>Our starting point for more robust control is regret minimization in games. Regret minimization is a well-accepted metric in online learning, and we consider applying it to online control.</p>
<p>Formally, we measure the efficacy of a controller through the following notion of <i>policy </i>regret.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BRegret%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bt%7D+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29+-+%5Cmin_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bstable+%7D+K%7D+c_t%28x_t%28K%29%2C+-Kx_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)"/></p>
<p>Here in, <img alt="x_t(K)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t%28K%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t(K)"/> represents the state encountered when executing the linear policy $K$. In particular, the second term represents the total cost paid by the best(in hindsight) stable linear policy had it executed in the system facing the same sequence of perturbations as the controller. In this regard the above notion of regret is <b>counterfactual</b> and hence more challenging than the more common stateless notion of regret.<br/>
(Remark: a <span style="font-weight: 400;">stable linear policy K is one which ensures that the spectral radius of  A-BK is strictly less than one. For a formal quantitative definition, please see the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, the choice of comparing to a linear policy is made keeping tractability in mind. Note that this nevertheless generalizes the standard Linear Quadratic Regulator and <img alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="H_{\infty}"/> control on Linear Dynamical Systems, as the optimal choice of controllers in those settings is indeed a linear policy (if the cost functions are quadratic, our setting allows more general loss functions).</p>
<p>Algorithms which achieve low regret on the above objective are naturally adaptive as they perform as well as the best controller (upto a negligible additive regret) oblivious to whether the sequence is <i>friendly </i>or <i>adversarial. </i></p>
<h2>A new type of controller</h2>
<p>In successive recent works (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1] </a>and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05062">[2]</a>), we show that the above notion of policy regret is tractable and can be sublinear (even logarithmic under certain conditions). Using a new parameterization for controller that we detail next, we obtain the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Robustness to Adversarial Perturbations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1]</a>) – </b>For arbitrary, but bounded, perturbations $w_t$, which may even be chosen adversarially, we provide an efficient algorithm that achieves regret of <b><img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/></b>.</li>
<li><b>Fast Rates under Stochastic Perturbations (</b>[2]<b>) – </b>Further, for strongly convex costs, and i.i.d. perturbations, we give an efficient algorithm with a poly-logarithmic (in T) regret guarantee.</li>
</ul>
<p>The former result is the first such result to establish vanishing average regret in an online setting for control with adversarial perturbations. The latter result offers a significant improvement over the work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07104">Cohen et al. </a>who established a rate of <img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/> in a similar (stochastic) setting.</p>
<p>We assume that the dynamical system i.e. (A,B) is completely known to us and the state is fully observable. These assumptions have been eliminated in further work with our collaborators, and will be a subject of a future blog post. We now describe the core ideas which go into achieving both our results.</p>
<h2>The Gradient Perturbation Controller</h2>
<p>Consider how the choice of the linear controller determines the control input.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="120" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-1.png?w=624&amp;h=120" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>The above display demonstrates that the action, state, and hence the cost are <b>non-convex</b> functions of the linear controller K. The first piece of our result evades this lack of convexity by over-parametrization, ie. relaxing the notion of a linear policy as described next.</p>
<p>In place of learning a direct representation of a linear controller K, we learn a sequence of matrices <img alt="M_1, M_2 \ldots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%2C+M_2+%5Cldots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="M_1, M_2 \ldots "/> which represent the dependence of <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> on <img alt="w_{t - i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_%7Bt+-+i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_{t - i}"/> under the execution of some linear policy. Schematically, we parameterize our policy as follows</p>
<p><img alt="" height="62" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-2.png?w=624&amp;h=62" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Note that, the assumption that the dynamics is known permits the exact inference of <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>’s and thereby making the execution of such a controller possible. While the choice of the controller ensures that control inputs are linear in <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/>, the superposition principle for linear dynamical systems ensures that the state sequence too is linear in the same variables. Therefore, the cost of execution of such a controller parameterized via <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/> is convex and we can hope to learn them using standard techniques like Gradient Descent. Observe that, by construction, it is possible to emulate the behavior any linear controller K by a suitable choice of <img alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_i\}"/>’s.</p>
<p>There are two barriers though. First, the number of parameters grows with time $T$ and so can regret and running time. Secondly, since there is a state, the decision a controller makes at a particular instance affects the future. We deal with these two problems formally in the paper and show how they may be circumvented. One of the important techniques we use is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Online Convex Optimization with Memory</a>.</p>
<p>With all the core components in place, we provide a brief specification of our algorithm. Let’s fix some memory length H, and a time step t. Define a proxy cost as</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)"/> =</p>
</td>
<td>Cost Paid at Time t, had we execute the policy <img alt="\{M_1, \ldots M_H\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{M_1, \ldots M_H\}"/> for t-H steps, with the system reset to 0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The algorithm now as suggested by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Anava, Hazan and Manor</a>, is to take a gradient step on the above proxy.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="29" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-3.png?w=624&amp;h=29" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>The above algorithm achieves <img alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{T})"/> regret against <b>worst-case</b> noise. For the full proof and the precise derivation of the algorithm, check out the paper.</p>
<h2>Achieving Logarithmic Regret</h2>
<p>Algorithms for (state-less) online learning often enjoy logarithmic regret guarantees in the presence of strongly convex loss functions. Prima facie, one could hope that for dynamical systems with strongly convex costs, such a stronger regret guarantee would hold. The cautionary note here is that <b>strong convexity of the cost <img alt="c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(x_t, u_t)"/> in the control input does not imply strong convexity in the controller representation</b>.,</p>
<p>In fact, the strong convexity of our proxy cost function <img alt="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)"/> in its natural parameterization over M’s is further hindered by the fact that the space of M’s constitutes a highly over-parametrized representation (say, vs. K). Indeed in the case of adversarial perturbations, it is easy to construct a case where the strong convexity does not transfer over from the control to the controller.</p>
<p>In a future blog post we detail how this technical difficulty can be overcome using the natural gradient method, giving rise to a logarithmic regret algorithm for control.</p>
<h2>Experimental Validation</h2>
<p>Below we provide empirical evaluations of the GPC controller in various scenarios, demonstrating it is indeed more robust to correlated noise than previous notions. <b>(All the plots below are produced by a new research-first control and time series library in the works — Alpha version scheduled to be released soon! STAY TUNED!!!) </b></p>
<p>To start, let’s reproduce the classical setting of controlling an LDS with i.i.d. Gaussian noise. Here, the LQR program is <i>optimal</i>. Yet, the plot below attests that our new control methodology offers a slightly suboptimal, yet comparable, performance. This observation also underlines the message the the proposed controller tracks the optimal controller without any foreknowledge of the structure of the perturbations. Here, for example, GPC is not made aware of the i.i.d. nature of the perturbations.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-4.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Moving on to correlated perturbations across time, a simple such setting is when the perturbations are drawn from a Gaussian Random Walk (as opposed to independent Gaussians). Note that here it is possible to derive the <i>optimal </i>controller via the separation principle. Here is the performance plot:</p>
<h1><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-5.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></h1>
<p>Note that the default LQR controller performs much worse, where as GPC is able to track the performance of the optimal controller quite closely. Next up, <b>sinusoidal noise</b>:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="205" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-6.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" width="624"/></p>
<p>Here the full power of regret minimization is exhibited as the consecutive samples of the sine function are very correlated, yet predictable. GPC vastly outperforms LQR as one would expect. But, is this fundamentally a hard setting? What would happen if we use the H-infinity controller, or, god forbid, no control at all? We see this in the next plot (on the log-linear scale):</p>
<p><img alt="" height="202" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-7.png?w=624&amp;h=202" title="" width="624"/></p>
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>We have surveyed a new family of controls that are fundamentally different than classical optimal control: they are adaptive and attain regret guarantees vs. adversarial noise. Their preliminary experimental tests seem quite promising.</p>
<p>In the coming posts we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain how GPC can obtain the first logarithmic regret in the tracking/Kalman setting,</li>
<li>Reveal our new research-first library for control / time-series prediction,</li>
<li>Tackle more general settings.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Stay tuned! Preferably using the GPC… <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></h1>

    <title>TOC for Society</title>
    <summary>I am delighted that the Symposium on Foundations of Responsible Computing (FORC) is on its way. This is a new forum that will host mathematical research in computation and society, under an inclusive umbrella. A major purpose is to give a home and to nurture the growing community within the Theory of Computing and neighboring fields whose research is focused on the societal impact of computing. This vision is shared by many in this area, and I am very proud of the remarkable list of steering committee members that have volunteered to create and promote the new conference. The call for papers for FORC 2020 is out. The PC chair, Aaron Roth, has done a remarkable job forming a strong program committee, and we are off to a great start. Please consider sending your research papers and looking forward to seeing many of you at FORC 2020 in the beginning of June at Harvard.</summary>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: In the <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="n"/>-dimensional hypercube graph, one can easily choose half of the vertices such that they induce an empty graph. However, having even just one more vertex would cause the induced subgraph to contain a vertex of degree at least <img alt="\sqrt{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\sqrt{n}"/>. This result is best possible, and improves a logarithmic lower bound shown by Chung, Furedi, Graham and Seymour in 1988. In this talk we will discuss a very short algebraic proof of it.</p>
<p>As a direct corollary of this purely combinatorial result, the sensitivity and degree of every boolean function are polynomially related. This solves an outstanding foundational problem in theoretical computer science, the Sensitivity Conjecture of Nisan and Szegedy.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: A sunflower with <img alt="r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="r"/> petals is a collection of <img alt="r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="r"/> sets so that the intersection of each pair is equal to the intersection of all. Erdos and Rado in 1960 proved the sunflower lemma: for any fixed <img alt="r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="r"/>, any family of sets of size <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="w"/>, with at least about <img alt="w^w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%5Ew&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="w^w"/> sets, must contain a sunflower. The famous sunflower conjecture is that the bound on the number of sets can be improved to <img alt="c^w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5Ew&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="c^w"/> for some constant <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="c"/>. Despite much research, the best bounds until recently were all of the order of <img alt="w^{cw}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%5E%7Bcw%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="w^{cw}"/> for some constant c. In this work, we improve the bounds to about <img alt="(\log w)^w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Clog+w%29%5Ew&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="(\log w)^w"/>.</p>
<p>There are two main ideas that underlie our result. The first is a structure vs pseudo-randomness paradigm, a commonly used paradigm in combinatorics. This allows us to either exploit structure in the given family of sets, or otherwise to assume that it is pseudo-random in a certain way. The second is a duality between families of sets and DNFs (Disjunctive Normal Forms). DNFs are widely studied in theoretical computer science. One of the central results about them is the switching lemma, which shows that DNFs simplify under random restriction. We show that when restricted to pseudo-random DNFs, much milder random restrictions are sufficient to simplify their structure.</p>

Notable examples include randomness extraction and privacy amplification, secret sharing, secure multiparty computation and proof systems, private-information retrieval and locally decodable codes, authentication codes and non-malleable codes, differential privacy, quantum information processing, and information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security. See https://itcrypto.github.io for more information. ITC replaces the International Conference on Information Theoretic Security (ICITS), which was dedicated to the same topic and ran 2005-2017.

<div>Deal friends,</div>
<div/>
<div>We are happy to announce the birth of a new conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography (ITC). Information-theoretic cryptography studies security in the presence of computationally unbounded adversaries and covers a wide array of topics at the intersection of cryptography, coding theory, information-theory and theory of computation. Notable examples include randomness extraction and privacy amplification, secret sharing, secure multiparty computation and proof systems, private-information retrieval and locally decodable codes, authentication codes and non-malleable codes, differential privacy, quantum information processing, and information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security. See <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io</a> for more information.</div>
<p>ITC replaces the International Conference on Information Theoretic Security (ICITS), which was dedicated to the same topic and ran 2005-2017. ITC can be seen as a reboot of ICITS with a new name, a new steering committee and a renewed excitement.  (beware: there is  a fake website for ICITS 2019 created by a known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fraudulent organization</a>)</p>
<div/>
<div>The conference will have two tracks: a conference track and  a “greatest hits” track. The conference track will operate like a traditional conference with the usual review process and published proceedings. The “greatest hits” track consists of invited talks (not included in the proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in the area. We solicit nominations for “greatest hits” talks from the community.<p/>
<p>The first ITC conference will take place in Boston, MA on June 17-19, 2020 (just before STOC).  The submission deadline for ITC 2020 is Dec 16, 2019 and the call for papers (including a nomination procedure for the greatest hits track) is available here:  <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html</a></p>
<p>Please submit your best work to ITC 2020! We hope to see many of you there!</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The next TCS+ talk will take place this coming Wednesday, September 25th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC). <strong>Mark Sellke</strong> from Stanford will speak about “<em>Chasing Convex Bodies</em>” (abstract below).</p>
<p>Please make sure you reserve a spot for your group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: I will explain our recent understanding of the chasing convex bodies problem posed by Friedman and Linial in 1991. In this problem, an online player receives a request sequence <img alt="K_1,\dots,K_T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_1%2C%5Cdots%2CK_T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="K_1,\dots,K_T"/> of convex sets in <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="d"/> dimensional space and moves his position online into each requested set. The player’s movement cost is the length of the resulting path. Chasing convex bodies asks if there an online algorithm with cost competitive against the offline optimal path. This is both an challenging metrical task system and (equivalent to) a competitive analysis view on online convex optimization.</p>
<p>This problem was open for <img alt="d&gt;2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3E2&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="d&gt;2"/> until last year but has recently been solved twice. The first solution gives a <img alt="2^{O(d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7BO%28d%29%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="2^{O(d)}"/> competitive algorithm while the second gives a nearly optimal <img alt="\min(d,\sqrt(d\log(T)))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin%28d%2C%5Csqrt%28d%5Clog%28T%29%29%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\min(d,\sqrt(d\log(T)))"/> competitive algorithm for <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="T"/> requests. The latter result is based on the Steiner point, which is the exact optimal solution to a related geometric problem called Lipschitz selection and dates from 1840. In the talk, I will briefly outline the first solution and fully explain the second.</p>
<p>Partially based on joint works with Sébastien Bubeck, Bo’az Klartag, Yin Tat Lee, and Yuanzhi Li.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>by Nataly Brukhim, Naman Agarwal and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">this paper</a> </em></p>
<p>In a famous 1906 competition at a local fair in Plymouth, England, participants were asked to guess the weight of an ox. Out of a crowd of hundreds, no one came close to the ox’s actual weight, but the average of all guesses was almost correct. How is it that combining the opinions of laymen can somehow arrive at highly reasoned decisions, despite the weak judgment of individual members? This concept of harnessing wisdom from weak rules of thumb to form a highly accurate prediction rule, is the basis of ensemble methods and <b>boosting</b>. Boosting is a theoretically sound methodology that has transformed machine learning across a variety of applications; in classification and regression tasks, online learning, and many more.</p>
<p>In the case of online learning, examples for training a predictor are not available in advance, but are revealed one at a time. Online boosting combines a set of online prediction rules, or <i>weak learners. </i>At every time step, each weak learner outputs a prediction, suffers some loss and is then updated accordingly. The performance of an online learner is measured using the <i>regret</i> criterion, which compares the accumulated loss over time with that of the best fixed decision in hindsight. A <i>Boosting</i> algorithm can choose which examples are fed to each of the weak learners, as well as the losses they incur. Intuitively, the online booster can encourage some weak learners to become really good in predicting certain common cases, while allowing others to focus on edge cases that are harder to predict. Overall, the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/beygelzimer15.pdf">online</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04820">boosting</a> framework can achieve low regret guarantees based on the learners’ individual regret values.</p>
<p>However, online learning can become more challenging when our actions have consequences on the environment. This can be illustrated with the following experiment: imagine learning to balance a long pole on your hand. When you move your hand slightly, the pole tilts. You then move your hand in the opposite direction, and it bounces back and tilts to the other side. One jerk the wrong way might have you struggling for a good few seconds to rebalance. In other words, a <u>sequence of decisions</u> you made earlier determines whether or not the pole is balanced at any given time, rather than the single decision you make at that point.<img alt="" class=" aligncenter" height="129" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.jpeg?w=136&amp;h=129" title="" width="136"/></p>
<p>More generally, consider cases when our environment has a <b>state, </b>and is in some sense “remembering” our past choices. A stateful framework, able to model a wide range of such phenomena, is a <i>dynamical system</i>. A dynamical system can be thought of as a function that determines, given the current state, what the state of the system will be in the next time step. Think of the physical dynamics that determines our pole’s position based on sequential hand movements. Other intuitive examples are the fluctuations of stock prices in the stock market, or the local weather temperatures; these can all be modeled with dynamical systems.</p>
<p>So how can boosting help us make better predictions for a dynamical system? In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">recent work</a> we propose an algorithm, which we refer to as DynaBoost, that achieves this goal. In the paper we provide theoretical regret bounds, as well as an empirical evaluation in a variety of applications, such as online control and time-series prediction.</p>
<p><b>Learning for Online Control</b></p>
<p>Control theory is a field of applied mathematics that deals with the control of various physical processes and engineering systems. The objective is to design an action rule, or <i>controller</i>, for a dynamical system such that steady state values are achieved quickly, and the system maintains stability.</p>
<p>Consider a simple Linear Dynamical System (LDS):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+A+x_t+%2B+B+u_t+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t + w_t"/></p>
<p>where <img alt="x_t,u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t%2Cu_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t,u_t"/> are the state and control values at time t, respectively. Assume a known transition dynamics specified by the matrices A and B, and an arbitrary disturbance to the system given by <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>. The goal of the controller is to minimize a convex cost function <img alt="c_t(x_t,u_t)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28x_t%2Cu_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_t(x_t,u_t)"/>.</p>
<p>A provably optimal controller for the Gaussian noise case (where <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> are normally distributed) and when the cost functions are quadratic, is the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). LQR computes a pre-fixed matrix K such that <img alt="u_t^{LQR} = K x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BLQR%7D+%3D+K+x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t^{LQR} = K x_t"/>. In other words, LQR computes a linear controller – which linearly maps the state into a control at every time step.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/agarwal19c/agarwal19c.pdf">recent advancement</a> in online control considers <i>arbitrary</i> disturbances, as opposed to normally distributed noise. In this more general setting, there is no closed form for the optimal controller. Instead, it is proposed to use a weighted sum of previously observed noises, i.e., <img alt="u_t^{WL} = K x_t + \sum_{i=1}^H M_i w_{t-i} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BWL%7D+%3D+K+x_t+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EH+M_i+w_%7Bt-i%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t^{WL} = K x_t + \sum_{i=1}^H M_i w_{t-i} "/> , where <img alt="M_1,...,M_H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%2C...%2CM_H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="M_1,...,M_H"/> are learned parameters, updated in an online fashion. This method is shown to attain vanishing average regret compared to the best fixed linear controller in hindsight, and is applicable for general convex cost functions as opposed to only quadratics.</p>
<p>Crucially, the state-dependent term <img alt="Kx_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Kx_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="Kx_t"/> is not learned. Since the learned parameters of the above controller therefore considers only a fixed number of recent disturbances, we can apply existing <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">online convex optimization</a> techniques developed for <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6025-online-learning-for-adversaries-with-memory-price-of-past-mistakes">learning with loss functions that have bounded memory</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Boosting for Online Control</strong></p>
<p>Using the insights described above to remove state in online control, we can now use techniques from online boosting. DynaBoost maintains multiple copies of the base-controller above, with each copy corresponding to one stage in boosting. At every time step, the control <img alt="u_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t"/> is obtained from a convex combination of the base-controllers’ outputs <img alt="u_t^{WL(1)},...,u_t^{WL(N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BWL%281%29%7D%2C...%2Cu_t%5E%7BWL%28N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_t^{WL(1)},...,u_t^{WL(N)}"/>. To update each base-controller’s parameters, DynaBoost feeds each controller with a <i>residual</i> <i>proxy </i>cost function, and seeks to obtain a minimizing point in the direction of the residual loss function’s gradient. Stability ensures that minimizing regret over the proxy costs (which have finite memory) suffices to minimize overall regret. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">our paper</a> for the detailed description of the algorithm and its regret guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>Sanity check experiment</strong></p>
<p>We first conducted experiments for the standard LQR setting with i.i.d. Gaussian noise and known dynamics. We applied our boosting method to the non-optimal controller with learned parameters (Control-WL), and we observe that boosting improves its loss and achieves near-optimal performance (here the optimal controller is given by the fixed LQR solution). We have tested an LDS of different dimensions <img alt="d = 1,10,100" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%3D+1%2C10%2C100&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="d = 1,10,100"/>, and averaged results over multiple runs.</p>

<p>When the disturbances are not independently drawn, the LQR controller is not guaranteed to perform optimally. We experimented with two LDS settings with correlated disturbances in which (a) the disturbances <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/> are generated from a Gaussian random-walk, and (b) where they are generated by a sine function applied to the time index. In these cases, boosted controllers perform better compared to the “weak” learned controller, and can also outperform the fixed LQR solution. We have also tested a Recurrent Neural Network, and observed that boosting is effective for RNNs as well.</p>

<p><strong>Inverted Pendulum experiment</strong></p>
<p>A more challenging experiment with a non-linear dynamical system is the Inverted Pendulum experiment. This is very similar to the pole balancing example we discussed above, and is a standard benchmark for control methods. The goal is to balance the inverted pendulum by applying torque that will stabilize it in a vertically upright position, in the presence of noise. In our experiments, we used correlated disturbances from a Gaussian random-walk. We follow the dynamics implemented in <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a>, and test the performance of different controllers: LQR, a learned controller, and boosting. The video below visualizes this experiment:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"/>
<p>When averaging the loss value over multiple experiment runs, we get the following plot:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="276" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-2.png?w=369&amp;h=276" title="" width="369"/></p>
<p>It can be seen that the learned controller performs much better than the LQR in the presence of correlated noise, and that boosting can improve its stability and achieve lower average loss.</p>
<p><b>Boosting for Time-Series Prediction</b></p>
<p>Similarly to the control setting, in time-series prediction tasks it is sufficient to use fixed horizons, and online boosting can be efficiently applied here as well. In time-series prediction, the data is often assumed to be generated from an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="x_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j w_j + w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Ek+%5Calpha_i+x_%7Bt-i%7D+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Eq+%5Cbeta_j+w_j+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j w_j + w_t"/></p>
<p>In words, each data point <img alt="x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_t"/> is given by a weighted sum of previous points, previous noises and a new noise term <img alt="w_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="w_t"/>, where <img alt="\alpha,\beta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%2C%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\alpha,\beta"/> are the coefficients vectors.</p>
<p>To test our boosting method, We experimented with 4 simulated settings: 1) normally distributed noises, 2) coefficients of the dynamical system slowly change over time, 3) a single, abrupt, change of the coefficients, and, 4) correlated noise: Gaussian random walk.</p>
<p>The weak learners tested here are the ARMA-ONS (online newton step) and ARMA-OGD (online gradient descent) algorithms for time-series prediction (See <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Anava13.pdf">this</a> paper for more details). We applied our boosting method, as well as a fast version of it, which applies to quadratic loss functions (we used squared difference in this case).</p>
<p><i><b>1) Gaussian Noise </b></i> <i><b>2) Changing Coefficients</b></i></p>
<p><img alt="" height="217" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-3.png?w=289&amp;h=217" title="" width="289"/><img alt="" height="217" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-4.png?w=289&amp;h=217" title="" width="289"/><img alt="" height="218" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-5.png?w=292&amp;h=218" title="" width="292"/><img alt="" height="217" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-6.png?w=290&amp;h=217" title="" width="290"/></p>
<p><i><b>3) Abrupt Change </b></i> <i><b>4) Correlated Noise</b></i></p>
<p>We can see in the plots above that all weak learners’ loss values (red) can be improved by online boosting methods (blue). A similar observation arises when experimenting with real-world data; we experimented with the Air Quality dataset from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI Machine Learning repository</a>, that contains hourly averaged measurements of air quality properties from an Italian city throughout one year, as measured by chemical sensors. We apply similar weak learners to this task, as well as our boosting algorithms. Here we again obtain better averaged losses for boosted methods (blue) compared to the baselines (red).</p>

<p>On the Importance of Disciplinary Pride for Multidisciplinary Collaboration</p>
<p>I am a big fan of collaborations, even if they <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2014/07/01/collaboration-competition-and-competition-within-collaboration/">come with their own challenges</a>. I always got further and enjoyed research much more because of my collaborators. I’m forever indebted to so many colleagues and dear, dear friends. Each and every one of them was better than me in some ways. To contribute, I had to remember my own strengths and bring them to the table. The premise of this post is that the same holds for collaboration between fields. It should be read as a call for theoreticians to bring the tools and the powerful way of thinking of TOC into collaborations. We shouldn’t be blind to the limitation of our field but obsessing on those limitations is misguided and would only limit our impact. Instead we should bring our best and trust on the other disciplines we collaborate with to do the same (allowing each to complement and compensate for the other).</p>
<p>The context in which these thoughts came to my mind is Algorithmic Fairness. In this and other areas on the interface between society and computing, true <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/11/01/simons-cluster-on-algorithmic-fairness/">collaboration is vital</a>. Not surprisingly, attending multidisciplinary programs on Algorithm Fairness, is a major part of my professional activities these days. And I love it – I get to learn so much from people and disciplines that have been thinking about fairness for many decades and centuries. In addition, the Humanities are simply splendid. Multidisciplinary collaborations come with even more challenges than other collaborations: the language, tools and perspectives are different. But for exactly the same reasons they can be even more rewarding. Nevertheless, my fear and the reason for this post is that my less experienced TOC colleagues might come out from those interdisciplinary meetings frustrated and might lose confidence in what TOC can contribute. It feels to me that <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PDF/toc-sp2.pdf">old lessons</a> about the value of TOC need to be learned again. There is a lot to be proud of, and holding to this pride would in fact make us better collaborators not worse.</p>
<p>In the context of Algorithmic Fairness, we should definitely acknowledge (as we often do) that science exists within political structures, that algorithms are not objective and that mathematical definitions cannot replace social norms as expressed by policy makers. But let’s not take these as excuses for inaction and let’s not withdraw to the role of spectators. In this era of algorithms, other disciplines need us just as much as we need them .</p>

To celebrate summer, I’ve compiled lecture notes from the graduate course COS 598D, a.k.a. “<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/optimization4machinelearning/home">optimization for machine learning</a>“.</p>
<p>The course is an aftermath of a few lectures and summer school tutorials given in various locations, in which  lectures goal of the course was to present the most useful methods and ideas in a rigorous-but-not-tedious way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for a mathematically-prepared undergraduate student, and/or researcher beginning their endeavor into machine learning.</li>
<li>Focus on the important: we start with stochastic gradient descent for training deep neural networks.</li>
<li>Bring out the main ideas: i.e. projection-free methods, second-order optimization, the three main acceleration techniques, qualitatively discuss the advantages and applicability of each.</li>
<li>*short* proofs, that everyone can follow and extend in their future research. I prefer being off by a constant/log factor from the best known bound with a more insightful proof.</li>
<li>Not loose track of the goal: generalization/regret, rather than final accuracy. This means we talked about online learning, generalization and precision issues in ML.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most recent version can be downloaded here:<br/>

<p>This is still work in progress, please feel free to send me typos/corrections, as well as other topics you’d like to see (on my todos already: lower bounds, quasi-convexity, and the homotopy method).</p>
<p>Note: zero-order/bandit optimization is an obvious topic that’s not address. The reason is purely subjective – it appears as a chapter in <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">this textbook</a> (that also started as lecture notes!).</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>by <a href="http://www.abbyvansoest.com/">Abby van Soest</a> and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690">this paper</a> </em></p>
<p>When humans interact with the environment, we receive a series of signals that indicate the value of our actions. We know that chocolate tastes good, sunburns feel bad, and certain actions generate praise or disapproval from others. Generally speaking, we learn from these signals and adapt our behavior in order to get more positive “rewards” and fewer negative ones.</p>
<p><i>Reinforcement learning</i> (RL) is a sub-field of machine learning that formally models this setting of learning through interaction in a reactive environment. In RL, we have an <b>agent</b> and an <b>environment</b>. The agent observes its position (or “state”) in the environment and takes actions that transition it to a new state. The environment looks at an agent’s state and hands out rewards based on a hidden set of criteria.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="145" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null.png?w=360&amp;h=145" title="" width="360"/></p>
<p><i>Source: <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf">Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction</a>. Sutton &amp; Barto, 2017.</i></p>
<p>Typically, the goal of RL is for the agent to learn behavior that maximizes<i> </i>the total reward it receives from the environment. This methodology has led to some notable successes: machines have learned how to<a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/"> play Atari games</a>, how to <a href="https://sigmoidal.io/alphago-how-it-uses-reinforcement-learning-to-beat-go-masters/">beat human masters</a> of Go, and how to write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224704/ai-machine-learning-language-models-read-write-openai-gpt2">long-form responses</a> to an essay prompt.</p>
<h2>But what can we learn without an external reward signal?</h2>
<p>It seems like a paradoxical question to ask, given that RL is all about rewards. But even though the reward paradigm is fundamentally flexible in many ways, it is also brittle and limits the agent’s ability to learn about its environment. This is due to several reasons. First, a reward signal directs the agents towards a single specific goal that may not generalize. Second, the reward signal may be sparse and uninformative, as we illustrate below.</p>
<p>Imagine that you want a robot to learn to navigate through the following maze.</p>
<p><b>Case 1: Sparse Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 when it exits the maze, and a reward of 0 everywhere else. The agent doesn’t learn anything until it stumbles upon the exit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Clear reward signals are not always available.</p>
<p><b>Case 2: Misleading Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 at the entrance and a reward of +10 at the exit. The agent incorrectly learns to sit at the entrance because it hasn’t explored its environment sufficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Rewards can <i>prevent</i> discovery of the full environment.</p>
<p>These issues are easy to overcome in the small maze on the left. But what about the maze on the right? As the size of the environment grows, it’ll get harder and harder to find the correct solution — the intractability of the problem scales exponentially.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="238" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/image.png?w=244&amp;h=238" title="" width="244"/><img alt="pasted image 0.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pasted-image-0.png?w=1100"/></p>
<p>So what we find is that there is power<i> </i>in being able to learn effectively in the <b>absence</b> of rewards. This intuition is supported by a body of research that shows learning fails when rewards aren’t dense or are <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa09/readings/NgHaradaRussell-shaping-ICML1999.pdf">poorly shaped</a>; and fixing these problems can require substantial engineering effort.</p>
<p>By enabling agents to discover the environment without the requirement of a reward signal, we create a more<b> flexible and generalizable</b> form of reinforcement learning. This framework can be considered a form of “unsupervised” RL. Rather than relying on explicit and inherently limited signals (or “labels”), we can deal with a broad, unlabelled pool of data. Learning from this pool facilitates a more general extraction of knowledge from the environment.</p>
<h2>Our new approach: Maximum Entropy</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690">recent work</a>, we propose finding a policy that maximizes entropy (which we refer to as a MaxEnt policy), or another related and concave function of the distribution. This objective is reward-independent and favors exploration.</p>
<p>In the video below, a two-dimensional cheetah robot learns to run backwards and forwards, move its legs fast and in all different directions, and even do flips. The cheetah doesn’t have access to any external rewards; it only uses signals from the MaxEnt policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="video-player" id="v-ro0BDWO4-1" style="width: 1100px; height: 620px;">
</div>
<p>Entropy is a function of the distribution over states. A high entropy distribution visits all states with near-equal frequency — it’s a <i>uniform</i> distribution. On the other hand, a low entropy distribution is biased toward visiting some states more frequently than others. (In the maze example, a low entropy distribution would result from the agent sitting at the entrance of the maze forever.)</p>
<p><img alt="slAdX3I4FcseBWeJbioHb_g.png" class=" size-full wp-image-129 aligncenter" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/sladx3i4fcsebwejbiohb_g.png?w=1100"/></p>
<p>So given that policy <img alt="\pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\pi"/> creates a distribution <img alt="d_\pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="d_\pi"/> over states, the problem we are hoping to solve is:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%5E%2A+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmax_%7B%5Cpi%7D+%5Ctext%7Bentropy%7D%28d_%5Cpi%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) "/></p>
<p>When we know all the states, actions, and dynamics of a given environment, finding the policy with maximum entropy is a concave optimization problem. This type of problem can be easily and exactly solved by convex programming.</p>
<p>But we very rarely have all that knowledge available to use. In practice, one of several complications usually arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>The states are <b>non-linearly approximated </b>by a neural network or some other function approximator.</li>
<li>The transition dynamics are unknown.</li>
<li>The state space is intractably large. (As an interesting example, the game of Go has more than<b> one googol or <img alt="10^{100}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B100%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="10^{100}"/></b> possible states. That’s more than the number of atoms in the universe, according to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html">this blog</a> from 2016, and definitely more than can fit on a computer.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In such cases, the problem of finding a max-entropy policy becomes non-convex and computationally hard.</p>
<p>So what to do? If we look at many practical RL problems (Atari, OpenAI Gym), we see that there are many known, efficient solvers that can construct an optimal (or nearly-optimal) policy when they are <i>given a reward signal</i>.</p>
<p>We thus consider an <i>oracle model</i>: let’s assume that we have access to one of these solvers, so that we can pass it an explicit reward vector and receive an optimal policy in return. Can we now maximize entropy in a provably efficient way? In other words, is it possible to reduce this high complexity optimization problem to that of “standard” RL?</p>
<p>Our approach does exactly that! It is based on the Frank-Wolfe method. This is a gradient-based optimization algorithm that is particularly suited for oracle-based optimization. Instead of moving in the direction of the steepest decline of the objective function, the Frank-Wolfe method iteratively moves in the direction of the optimal point in the direction of the gradient. This is depicted below (and deserves a separate post…). The Frank-Wolfe method is a projection-free algorithm, see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GIDnw7T-NT4Do3eC0B5kYJlzwOs6nzIO/view">this exposition</a> about its theoretical properties.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="345" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/unnamed-file.png?w=616&amp;h=345" title="" width="616"/></p>
<p>For the exact specification of the algorithm and its performance guarantee, see<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690"> our paper</a>.</p>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>To complement the theory, we also created some experiments to test the MaxEnt algorithm on simulated robotic locomotion tasks (<a href="https://github.com/abbyvansoest/maxent/tree/refactor">open source code available here</a>). We used test environments from <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py">Mujoco</a> and trained MaxEnt experts for various environments.</p>
<p>These are some results from the Humanoid experiment, where the agent is a human-like bipedal robot. The behavior of the MaxEnt agent (blue) is baselined against a random agent (orange), who explores by sampling randomly from the environment. This random approach is often used in practice for epsilon-greedy RL exploration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="332" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null-1.png?w=442&amp;h=332" title="" width="442"/></p>
<p>In this figure, we see that over the course of 25 epochs, the MaxEnt agent progressively increases the total entropy over the state space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="345" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null-2.png?w=460&amp;h=345" title="" width="460"/></p>
<p>Here, we see a visualization of the Humanoid’s coverage of the $xy$-plane, where the shown plane is of size 40-by-40. After one epoch, there is <b>minimal</b> coverage of the area. But by the 5th, 10th, and 15th epoch, we see that the agent has learned to visit all the different states in the plane, obtaining full and nearly uniform coverage of the grid!</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>[05/25/19 Update: Kevin Hartnett has a nice article at Quanta explaining Natarajan &amp; Wright’s result in slightly more layman terms than I’d be able to…see here: <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-expand-the-frontier-of-verifiable-knowledge-20190523/">Computer Scientists Expand the Frontier of Verifiable Knowledge</a>]</em></p>
<p>The study of entanglement through the length of interactive proof systems has been one of the most productive applications of complexity theory to the physical sciences that I know of. Last week Anand Natarajan and John Wright, postdoctoral scholars at Caltech and MIT respectively, added a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">major stone</a> to this line of work. Anand &amp; John (hereafter “NW”) establish the following wild claim: it is possible for a classical polynomial-time verifier to decide membership in any language in <em>non-deterministic doubly exponential time</em> by asking questions to two infinitely powerful, but untrusted, provers sharing entanglement. In symbols, NEEXP <img alt="{\subseteq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csubseteq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\subseteq}"/> MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>! (The last symbol is for emphasis — no, we don’t have an MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>! class — yet.)</p>
<p>What is amazing about this result is the formidable gap between the complexity of the verifier and the complexity of the language being verified. We know since the 90s that the use of interaction and randomness can greatly expand the power of polynomial-time verifiers, from NP to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=146609">PSPACE</a> (with a single prover) and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2794945">NEXP</a> (with two provers). As a result of the work of Natarajan and Wright, we now know that yet an additional ingredient, the use of <em>entanglement</em> between the provers, can be leveraged by the verifier — the same verifier as in the previous results, a classical randomized polynomial-time machine — to obtain an exponential increase in its verification power. Randomness and interaction brought us one exponential; entanglement gives us another.</p>
<p>To gain intuition for the result consider first the structure of a classical two-prover one-round interactive proof system for non-deterministic doubly exponential time, with exponential-time verifier. Cutting some corners, such a protocol can be obtained by “scaling up” a standard two-prover protocol for non-deterministic singly exponential time. In the protocol, the verifier would sample a pair of exponential-length questions <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/>, send <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> to each prover, receive answers <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>, and perform an exponential-time computation that verifies some predicate about <img alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}"/>.</p>
<p>How can entanglement help design an <em>exponentially more efficient</em> protocol? At first it may seem like a polynomial-time verifier has no way to even get started: if it can only communicate polynomial-length messages with the provers, how can it leverage their power? And indeed, if the provers are classical, it can’t: it is known that even with a polynomial number of provers, and polynomially many rounds of interaction, a polynomial-time verifier cannot decide any language beyond NEXP.</p>
<p>But the provers in the NW protocol are not classical. They can share entanglement. How can the verifier exploit this to its advantage? The key property that is needed is know as the <em>rigidity</em> of entanglement. In words, rigidity is the idea that by verifying the presence of certain statistical correlations between the provers’ questions and answers the verifier can determine precisely (up to a local change of basis) the quantum state and measurements that the provers must have been using to generate their answers. The most famous example of rigidity is the <em>CHSH game</em>: as already shown by <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/AIHPA_1988__49_2_215_0/">Werner and Summers</a> in 1982, the CHSH game can only be optimally, or even near-optimally, won by measuring a maximally entangled state using two mutually unbiased bases for each player. No other state or measurements will do, unless they trivially imply an EPR pair and mutually unbiased bases (such as a state that is the tensor product of an EPR pair with an additional entangled state).</p>
<p>Rigidity gives the verifier control over the provers’ use of their entanglement. The simplest use of this is for the verifier to force the provers to share a certain number <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> of EPR pairs and measure them to obtain identical uniformly distributed <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-bit strings. Such a test for <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> EPR pairs can be constructed from <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> CHSH games. In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">paper</a> with Natarajan we give a more efficient test that only requires questions and answers of length that is poly-logarithmic in <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>. Interestingly, the test is built on classical machinery — the low-degree test — that plays a central role in the analysis of some classical multi-prover proof systems for NEXP.</p>
<p>At this point we have made an inch of progress: it is possible for a polynomial-time (in <img alt="{n=\log N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D%5Clog+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n=\log N}"/>) verifier to “command” two quantum provers sharing entanglement to share <img alt="{N=2^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3D2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N=2^n}"/> EPR pairs, and measure them in identical bases to obtain identical uniformly random <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-bit strings. What is this useful for? Not much — yet. But here comes the main insight in NW: suppose we could similarly force the provers to generate, not identical uniformly random strings, but a pair of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-bit strings <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> that is distributed as a pair of questions from the verifier in the aforementioned interactive proof system for NEEXP with exponential-time (in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>) verifier. Then we could use a polynomial-time (in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>) verifier to “command” the provers to generate their exponentially-long questions <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> by themselves. The provers would then compute answers <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(A,B)}"/> as in the NEEXP protocol. Finally, they would prove to the verifier, using a polynomial interaction, that <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(A,B)}"/> is a valid pair of answers to the pair of questions <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> — indeed, the latter verification is an NEXP problem, hence can be verified using a protocol with polynomial-time verifier.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy? Yes. But they did it! Of course there are many issues with the brief summary above — for example, how does the verifier even know the questions <img alt="{X,Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%2CY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X,Y}"/> sampled by the provers? The answer is that it doesn’t need to know the entire question; only that it was sampled correctly, and that the quadruple <img alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}"/> satisfies the verification predicate of the exponential-time verifier. This can be verified using a polynomial-time interactive proof.</p>
<p>Diving in, the most interesting insight in the NW construction is what they call “introspection”. What makes multi-prover proof systems powerful is the ability for the verifier to send correlated questions to the provers, in a way such that each prover has only partial information about the other’s question — informally, the verifier plays a variant of prisonner’s dilemma with the provers. In particular, any interesting distribution <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> will have the property that <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> are not fully correlated. For a concrete example think of the “planes-vs-lines” distribution, where <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> is a uniformly random plane and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> a uniformly random line in <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>. The aforementioned test for <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> EPR pairs can be used to force both provers to sample the same uniformly random plane <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>. But how does the verifier ensure that one of the provers “forgets” parts of the plane, to only remember a uniformly random line <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> that is contained in it? NW’s insight is that the information present in a quantum state — such as the prover’s half-EPR pairs — can be “erased” by commanding the prover to perform a measurement in the <em>wrong</em> basis — a basis that is mutually unbiased with the basis used by the other prover to obtain its share of the query. Building on this idea, NW develop a battery of delicate tests that provide the verifier the ability to control precisely what information gets distributed to each prover. This allows a polynomial-time verifier to perfectly simulate the local environment that the exponential-time verifier would have created for the provers in a protocol for NEEXP, thus simulating the latter protocol with exponentially less resources.</p>
<p>One of the aspects of the NW result I like best is that they showed how the “history state barrier” could be overcome. Previous works attempting to establish strong lower bounds on the class MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>, such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12166">paper</a> by Yuen et al., relies on a compression technique that requires the provers to share a history state of the computation performed by a larger protocol. Unfortunately, history states are very non-robust, and as a result such works only succeeded in developing protocols with vanishing completeness-soundness gap. NW entirely bypass the use of history states, and this allows them to maintain a constant gap.</p>
<p>Seven years ago Tsuyoshi Ito and I showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">MIP<img alt="{}^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7D%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{}^\star"/> contains NEXP</a>. At the time, we thought this may be the end of the story — although it seemed challenging, surely someone would eventually prove a matching upper bound. Natarajan and Wright have defeated this expectation by showing that MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/> contains NEEXP. What next? NEEEXP? The halting problem? I hope to make this the topic of a future post.</p></div>

    <title>The dynamics of Lagrange and Hamilton</title>
    <summary>In 1788, Lagrange presented a set of equations of motion that, unlike Newtonian mechanics, are independent of the choice of coordinates of the physical system, and ultimately led to the formulation of general relativity. Hamilton came up with a different set of equations of motion in 1833 that arguably led to the development of quantum mechanics. […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In 1788, Lagrange presented a set of equations of motion that, unlike Newtonian mechanics, are independent of the choice of coordinates of the physical system, and ultimately led to the formulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Hilbert_action">general relativity</a>. Hamilton came up with a different set of equations of motion in 1833 that arguably led to the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)">quantum mechanics</a>. Remarkably, in classical mechanics, these sets of equations turn out to be <em>equivalent</em> via a beautiful duality due to <strong>Legendre</strong>.</p>

<p>Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics have inspired several promising optimization and sampling algorithms such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04245.pdf">first-order methods in optimization</a>,  <a href="http://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/12/19/markov_chain_monte_carlo.html">Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a> (see also this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08898">paper</a> that will appear in NIPS 2018). Legendre duality also appears in convex optimization as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenchel%27s_duality_theorem">Fenchel</a> <a href="https://nisheethvishnoi.wordpress.com/convex-optimization/">duality</a>.  <a href="https://nisheethvishnoi.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/lagrangehamiltonian.pdf" title="LagrangeHamiltonian">This</a> note, written primarily for optimization folks, introduces Lagrangian dynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics, and proves the duality that connects them.</p>
<p>I hope that these fundamental ideas inspire you as well to think about optimization from a physics perspective!</p>
