    <title>Manufacturability Oriented Model Correction and Build Direction Optimization for Additive Manufacturing</title>

for a given additive manufacturing (AM) process. Different AM technologies,
process parameters or materials introduce geometric constraints on what is
manufacturable or not. Given an input 3D model and minimum printable feature
size dictated by the manufacturing process characteristics and parameters, our
algorithm generates a corrected geometry that is printable with the intended AM
process. A key issue in model correction for manufacturability is the
identification of critical features that are affected by the printing process.
To address this challenge, we propose a topology aware approach to construct
the allowable space for a print head to traverse during the 3D printing
process. Combined with our build orientation optimization algorithm, the amount
of modifications performed on the shape is kept at minimum while providing an
accurate approximation of the as-manufactured part. We demonstrate our method
on a variety of 3D models and validate it by 3D printing the results.

    <title>A New Deterministic Algorithm for Dynamic Set Cover</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1569542400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bhattacharya:Sayan.html">Sayan Bhattacharya</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Henzinger:Monika.html">Monika Henzinger</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nanongkai:Danupon.html">Danupon Nanongkai</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11600">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present a deterministic dynamic algorithm for maintaining a
$(1+\epsilon)f$-approximate minimum cost set cover with
$O(f\log(Cn)/\epsilon^2)$ amortized update time, when the input set system is
undergoing element insertions and deletions. Here, $n$ denotes the number of
elements, each element appears in at most $f$ sets, and the cost of each set
lies in the range $[1/C, 1]$. Our result, together with that of Gupta et al.
[STOC`17], implies that there is a deterministic algorithm for this problem
with $O(f\log(Cn))$ amortized update time and $O(\min(\log n,
f))$-approximation ratio, which nearly matches the polynomial-time hardness of
approximation for minimum set cover in the static setting. Our update time is
only $O(\log (Cn))$ away from a trivial lower bound.
</p>
<p>Prior to our work, the previous best approximation ratio guaranteed by
deterministic algorithms was $O(f^2)$, which was due to Bhattacharya et al.
[ICALP`15]. In contrast, the only result that guaranteed $O(f)$-approximation
was obtained very recently by Abboud et al. [STOC`19], who designed a dynamic
algorithm with $(1+\epsilon)f$-approximation ratio and $O(f^2 \log n/\epsilon)$
amortized update time. Besides the extra $O(f)$ factor in the update time
compared to our and Gupta et al.'s results, the Abboud et al. algorithm is
randomized, and works only when the adversary is oblivious and the sets are
unweighted (each set has the same cost).
</p>
<p>We achieve our result via the primal-dual approach, by maintaining a
fractional packing solution as a dual certificate. Unlike previous primal-dual
algorithms that try to satisfy some local constraints for individual sets at
all time, our algorithm basically waits until the dual solution changes
significantly globally, and fixes the solution only where the fix is needed.

class of Flajolet-Martin algorithms (FMa), and provide a exact analytical
confidence interval for the number $F_0$ of distinct elements in a stream,
based on Chernoff bounds. The class of FMa has reached a significant popularity
in bigdata stream learning, and the attention of the literature has mainly been
based on algorithmic aspects, basically complexity optimality, while the
statistical analysis of these class of algorithms has been often faced
heuristically. The analysis provided here shows a deep connections with special
mathematical functions and with extreme value theory. The latter connection may
help in explaining heuristic considerations, while the first opens many
numerical issues, faced at the end of the present paper. Finally, MonteCarlo
simulations are provided to support our analytical choice in this context.

probability distributions over some alphabet. We revisit the Weighted Shortest
Common Supersequence (WSCS) problem, introduced by Amir et al. [SPIRE 2011],
that is, the SCS problem on weighted strings. In the WSCS problem, we are given
two weighted strings $W_1$ and $W_2$ and a threshold $\mathit{Freq}$ on
probability, and we are asked to compute the shortest (standard) string $S$
such that both $W_1$ and $W_2$ match subsequences of $S$ (not necessarily the
same) with probability at least $\mathit{Freq}$. Amir et al. showed that this
problem is NP-complete if the probabilities, including the threshold
$\mathit{Freq}$, are represented by their logarithms (encoded in binary). We
present an algorithm that solves the WSCS problem for two weighted strings of
length $n$ over a constant-sized alphabet in $\mathcal{O}(n^2\sqrt{z} \log{z})$
time. Notably, our upper bound matches known conditional lower bounds stating
that the WSCS problem cannot be solved in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ time
or in $\mathcal{O}^*(z^{0.5-\varepsilon})$ time unless there is a breakthrough
improving upon long-standing upper bounds for fundamental NP-hard problems
(CNF-SAT and Subset Sum, respectively). We also discover a fundamental
difference between the WSCS problem and the Weighted Longest Common Subsequence
(WLCS) problem, introduced by Amir et al. [JDA 2010]. We show that the WLCS
problem cannot be solved in $\mathcal{O}(n^{f(z)})$ time, for any function
$f(z)$, unless $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{NP}$.

\emph{submodular optimization} and \emph{online learning}. Submodular functions
play a vital role in modelling cost functions that naturally arise in many
areas of discrete optimization. These functions have been studied under various
models of computation. Independently, submodularity has been considered in
continuous domains. In fact, many problems arising in machine learning and
statistics have been modelled using continuous DR-submodular functions. In this
work, we are study the problem of maximizing \textit{non-monotone} continuous
DR-submodular functions within the framework of online learning. We provide
three main results.
</p>
<p>First, we present an online algorithm (in full-information setting) that
achieves an approximation guarantee (depending on the search space) for the
problem of maximizing non-monotone continuous DR-submodular functions over a
\emph{general} convex domain. To best of our knowledge, no prior approximation
algorithm in full-information setting was known for the non-monotone continuous
DR submodular functions even for the \emph{down-closed} convex domain.
</p>
<p>Second, we show that the online stochastic mirror ascent algorithm (in full
information setting) achieves an improved approximation ratio of $(1/4)$ for
maximizing the non-monotone continuous DR-submodular functions over a
\emph{down-closed} convex domain.
</p>
<p>At last, we extend our second result to the bandit setting where we present
the first approximation guarantee of $(1/4)$. To best of our knowledge, no
approximation algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization was known in
the bandit setting.

the early 1990s. Since then, dozens of algorithms for computing various types
of quasiperiodicity were proposed. Our work is a step towards answering the
question: "Which algorithm for computing quasiperiods to choose in practice?".
The central notions of quasiperiodicity are covers and seeds. We implement
algorithms for computing covers and seeds in the original and in new simplified
versions and compare their efficiency on various types of data. We also discuss
other known types of quasiperiodicity, distinguish partial covers as currently
the most promising for large real-world data, and check their effectiveness
using real-world data.

    <title>A common approximation framework for the early work, the late work, and resource leveling problems with unit time jobs</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Peter Gyorgyi, Tamas Kis <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11086">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the approximability of two related machine scheduling problems. In
the late work minimization problem, there are identical parallel machines and
the jobs have a common due date. The objective is to minimize the late work,
defined as the sum of the portion of the jobs done after the due date. A
related problem is the maximization of the early work, defined as the sum of
the portion of the jobs done before the due date. We describe a polynomial time
approximation scheme for the early work maximization problem, and we extended
it to the late work minimization problem after shifting the objective function
by a positive value that depends on the problem data. We also prove an
inapproximability result for the latter problem if the objective function is
shifted by a constant which does not depend on the input. These results remain
valid even if the number of the jobs assigned to the same machine is bounded.
This leads to an extension of our approximation scheme to some variants of the
resource leveling problem, for which no approximation algorithms were known.

Aram Harrow, Avinatan Hassidim, and Seth Lloyd are quantum stars who have done many other things as well. They are jointly famous for their 2009 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3171.pdf">paper</a>, “Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations.”</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss an aspect of their paper that speaks to a wider context.</p>
<p>
The paper by Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd addresses a fundamental problem: given an <img alt="{N \times N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%5Ctimes+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N \times N}"/> matrix <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and an <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-vector <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b}"/>, solve <img alt="{Ax = b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAx+%3D+b%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Ax = b}"/>. This is called the Linear Systems Problem (LSP). They say in their abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Here, we exhibit a quantum algorithm for this task that runs in <img alt="{poly(log N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bpoly%28log+N%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{poly(log N)}"/> time, an exponential improvement over the best classical algorithm. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
What strikes us is what HHL meant by “this task” in their abstract. It is not LSP. Indeed, it can’t be LSP. They want to do it with a number <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> of qubits that is <img alt="{\ll N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cll+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ll N}"/>. But the solution <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is a length-<img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> vector, which in general has at least <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> bits of information. No matter how much you entangle and wrangle, you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo's_theorem#Comments_and_remarks">cannot</a> extract more than <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> bits of information out of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> qubits. So even if <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> is <img alt="{O(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n)}"/>-sparse in some sense, and ignoring the issue of the time it would take to output the <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> entries of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>, you can’t solve LSP with fewer qubits to get all of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> in the first place. </p>
<p>
The problem they solve has been given its own name in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08227.pdf">subsequent</a> <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf">treatments</a>, including a 2015 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02306.pdf">paper</a> by Andrew Childs, Robin Kothari, and Rolando Somma that greatly improved the time to achieve <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/> precision:</p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> It’s a Changed Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What a solution to QLSP gives you is not <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> but a quantum state <img alt="{|\xi\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{|\xi\rangle}"/> that approximates the unit-vector multiple of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. As HHL say earlier in their abstract, this changed problem is useful if what you really want is not <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> but some other value <img alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x)}"/> derived from <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. They say for example that desired information could come from a quantum measurement of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>—that is, of <img alt="{|\xi\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{|\xi\rangle}"/>. </p>
<p>
This blog did have a 2012 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/a-lazy-approach-to-problem-solving/">post</a> on “lazy problem solving” that included the quip: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The idea is that when we solve a system <img alt="{Ax = b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAx+%3D+b%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Ax = b}"/> for <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>, it is likely that we do not really want <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>.

The question we plan to address is, are there algorithms that can do this faster than solving the entire linear system? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Ironically, the problem we suggested there, which is computing <img alt="{\sum_i x_i^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csum_i+x_i%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sum_i x_i^2}"/> up to multiplicative error <img alt="{1 \pm \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1 \pm \epsilon}"/>, is destroyed by normalizing <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> into a quantum state <img alt="{|\xi\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{|\xi\rangle}"/>. Oh well. But <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/problems-not-algorithms/">other</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/shifts-in-algorithm-design/">posts</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/transcomputational-problems/">have</a> considered changing the objectives of algorithms. But the general idea involved in the formulation of QLSP strikes us anew—and in ways different from Scott Aaronson’s caveats in a wonderful <a href="https://scottaaronson.com/papers/qml.pdf">review</a> he wrote of HHL titled, “Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms: Read the Fine Print.” </p>
<p>
Going from LSP to QLSP switches the problem and enables showing that a quantum algorithm can solve the switched problem much faster than before. Very nice: HHL and its followups deserving of myriad citations. Scott’s review frames the question of whether the switch is fair from a practical perspective, including the restrictions on <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b}"/>. Perhaps the jury is still out on this: we’ve mentioned several times the nifty <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04271">result</a> by Ewin Tang that found a quick classical solution to a <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/8/238339-the-algorithm-that-changed-quantum-machine-learning/fulltext">problem</a> downstream of HHL that had been thought to require quantum. But switching a problem for research is fair—we do this all time in theory. We hope that the modified problem helps us understand the original problem. Let’s look at some examples.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ketted Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We think the general recipe will be clear from a couple more examples. The first one seems not to be the same as what is called “QSAT” <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.6161.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/108412">here</a>. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> “Ketted SAT”: Given a CNF formula <img alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi}"/> with <img alt="{2^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^n}"/> variables but <img alt="{n^{O(1)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^{O(1)}}"/>-sized clauses, and <img alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0}"/>, output a quantum state <img alt="{|\xi\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{|\xi\rangle}"/> such that for some satisfying assignment <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>, <img alt="{||\;|\xi\rangle - |\frac{x}{||x||_2}\rangle ||_2 \leq \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%7C%5C%3B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle+-+%7C%5Cfrac%7Bx%7D%7B%7C%7Cx%7C%7C_2%7D%5Crangle+%7C%7C_2+%5Cleq+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{||\;|\xi\rangle - |\frac{x}{||x||_2}\rangle ||_2 \leq \epsilon}"/>. </p>
<p>
We still suspect this is known at least implicitly in the context of interactive proofs and PCPs and error-correcting codes. In that context, the idea of getting an assignment within distance <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/> of a satisfying one might make sense. For other purposes it is not so useful—e.g., it might not help utiliize the self-reducibility structure of SAT. It may simply be equivalent to known succinct-SAT problems after applying the coding used to obtain <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/PAPERS/holographic.pdf">holographic proofs</a>, but we don’t immediately see it.</p>
<p>
Note that the fact of <img alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi}"/> being in CNF with small clause size (which can even be constant) mirrors the sparseness condition on <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> that is usually assumed in cases of HHL. So the analogy to QLSP holds up there. At least “ketted SAT” is a different problem.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> “Ketted Factoring”: Given a really large integer <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/>, output a quantum state <img alt="{|\pi\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cpi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{|\pi\rangle}"/> such that for some nontrivial (prime) factor <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> of <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/>, <img alt="{||\;|\pi\rangle - k(p)|| &lt; \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%7C%5C%3B%7C%5Cpi%5Crangle+-+k%28p%29%7C%7C+%3C+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{||\;|\pi\rangle - k(p)|| &lt; \epsilon}"/>, where <img alt="{k(p) = \sum_{i: bin(p,i) = 1} |i\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%28p%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3A+bin%28p%2Ci%29+%3D+1%7D+%7Ci%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k(p) = \sum_{i: bin(p,i) = 1} |i\rangle}"/>.</p>
<p>
We can suppose that we have oracle lookup to bits of <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/>, so that all the bits can be placed into quantum superposition. We could alternatively encode <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/> as the quantum state <img alt="{k(M) = \sum_{i: bin(N,i) = 1} |i\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%28M%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3A+bin%28N%2Ci%29+%3D+1%7D+%7Ci%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k(M) = \sum_{i: bin(N,i) = 1} |i\rangle}"/>, but then the problem might not be well-defined because <img alt="{k(M)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%28M%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k(M)}"/> cannot retain all info about <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/>. </p>
<p>
This is not in the shadow of Shor’s algorithm because that needs <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/> to have <img alt="{O(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n)}"/> digits in order eventually to get a factor exactly. The quantumized version applies when <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/> is really big. Again, it is not clear that the solutions <img alt="{|\pi\rangle}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cpi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{|\pi\rangle}"/> would be useful for things like breaking cryptosystems. They might represent points of cryptographic weakness in some detailed sense. In any event, it’s a different problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> More General Changed Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
With all of these there are questions about how far the change reflects on the original problem, but at least the change generated substantial research and interesting new angles.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> The Goldbach problem </h3><p/>
<p><i>Every even number is the sum of two primes</i> <img alt="{~\rightarrow~}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7E%5Crightarrow%7E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{~\rightarrow~}"/> <i>Every even number is the sum of two almost-primes</i>.</p>
<p>
A number is an almost prime if it is a prime or a product of at most two primes. This is a quite useful result, but not what we really believe is true.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> P=NP </h3><p/>
<p><i><img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> not equal to <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/></i> <img alt="{~\rightarrow~}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7E%5Crightarrow%7E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{~\rightarrow~}"/> <i><img alt="{\mathsf{P}^{A}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5E%7BA%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}^{A}}"/> not equal to <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}^{A}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5E%7BA%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}^{A}}"/></i>.</p>
<p>
This says that if we relativize to some oracle <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>, then <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> and <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> are not equal. This is a famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine">result</a> of Theodore Baker, John Gill, and Robert Solovay. It sheds light on the structure of algorithms, but does not rule out that <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> could still equal <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> The Collatz Problem </h3><p/>
<p><i>The <img alt="{3x+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3x+1}"/> problem.</i></p>
<p>
Let <img alt="{Col(N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BCol%28N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Col(N)}"/> be <img alt="{N/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N/2}"/> when <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> is even, and <img alt="{(3N+1)/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%283N%2B1%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(3N+1)/2}"/> when <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> is odd. The problem is whether the orbit 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  N \rightarrow Col(N) \rightarrow Col^{2}(N) \rightarrow \dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++N+%5Crightarrow+Col%28N%29+%5Crightarrow+Col%5E%7B2%7D%28N%29+%5Crightarrow+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  N \rightarrow Col(N) \rightarrow Col^{2}(N) \rightarrow \dots "/></p>
<p>reaches <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> for all positive integers <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>. The change is:</p>
<p>
<i>All positive integers</i> <img alt="{~\rightarrow~}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7E%5Crightarrow%7E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{~\rightarrow~}"/> <i>Almost all</i>.</p>
<p>
Actually, Terence Tao got a cool result this year only by making a second change. In his <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03562.pdf">paper</a> “Almost All Orbits Of The Collatz Map Attain Almost Bounded Values” he proves that <img alt="{Colmin (N) &lt; f(n) }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BColmin+%28N%29+%3C+f%28n%29+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Colmin (N) &lt; f(n) }"/> for almost all <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> and any <img alt="{f(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(n)}"/> that tends to infinity. Thus 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(n) = \log \log \log \log N " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28n%29+%3D+%5Clog+%5Clog+%5Clog+%5Clog+N+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  f(n) = \log \log \log \log N "/></p>
<p>is fine. Here <img alt="{Colmin(N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BColmin%28N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Colmin(N)}"/> is the smallest integer that is reached in the orbit of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>. It is scary how hard this is to prove.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Explicit Hard Boolean Functions </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
Find explicit boolean functions with non-linear boolean complexity.</p>
<p>
<i>Boolean complexity with negation</i> <img alt="{~\rightarrow~}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7E%5Crightarrow%7E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{~\rightarrow~}"/> <i>Boolean complexity without negation.</i> </p>
<p>
These are the seminal results on monotone boolean complexity. They came up two years ago in an abortive attempt to prove <img alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}"/>, which we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/08/17/on-the-edge-of-eclipses-and-pnp/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Quantum Supremacy </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
We come full circle back to quantum computing. This week there has been much hubbub over a prematurely-released <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/h9oBikj/quantum-supremacy-using-a-programmable-superconducting-processor.pdf">announcement</a> that Google researchers have built a quantum device able to complete probabilistic searches that are not feasible by any classical computer. If one goes back to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5813.pdf">origins</a> of the <a href="https://quantumfrontiers.com/2012/07/22/supremacy-now/">term</a> “quantum supremacy” in 2012, before Google’s approach was conceived in 2015, one can say the change is:</p>
<p>
<i>specific physical simulation or complexity-based problems</i> <img alt="{~\rightarrow~}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7E%5Crightarrow%7E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{~\rightarrow~}"/> <i>randomized problems</i>.</p>
<p>
Scott has a great <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">post</a> with preliminary descriptions and evaluations, and we confess to adapting the following telegraphic evocation of how it works from Ryan O’Donnell and others in the comments section: Given a randomly-generated probability distribution <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/> on <img alt="{\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{0,1\}^n}"/>, call <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> “<img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/>-heavy” if <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/> gives it probability <img alt="{b/2^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%2F2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b/2^n}"/> for some fixed <img alt="{b &gt; 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%3E+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b &gt; 1}"/>. Even given <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/> in white-box form via an <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-qubit quantum circuit <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> with randomly placed gates, it is evidently hard (compare <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04402.pdf">this</a>) for a classical computer to find heavy strings with frequency <img alt="{&gt; 1/e + \delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3E+1%2Fe+%2B+%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{&gt; 1/e + \delta}"/>, concretely for <img alt="{n = 53}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+53%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 53}"/>. Google’s quantum machine, which is effectively programmed by the user presenting the random <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/>, can however find heavy strings with frequency <img alt="{1/e + \Delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Fe+%2B+%5CDelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1/e + \Delta}"/> with a highly significant separation between <img alt="{\Delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CDelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Delta}"/> and <img alt="{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta}"/>. We surmise that exhaustive tests over classical circuits trying the search at smaller values of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> have witnessed the smaller <img alt="{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta}"/> value at those <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>.</p>
<p>
Again, this approach is different from demonstrating a specific computable function to separate classical and quantum and from the instances considered in the concluding <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/quantum-supremacy-or-classical-control/">post</a>, with “supremacy” in its title, of our eight-part series in 2012 between Gil Kalai and, yes, Aram Harrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is our general notion of “ketted problems” useful? Ketted SAT and Factoring lack the natural continuity in (Q)LSP, but at least for SAT it can be grafted on by composing the formula with an error-correcting code. There is still the issue of being able to extract less classical information from the ketted approximations.</p>
<p>
We note a theory <a href="https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/190928-ntd2paul">workshop</a> being held this Saturday at UW Seattle in honor of Paul Beame’s 60th birthday. We congratulate Paul on both.</p>

    <title>Quantum Supremacy</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By now you've probably heard the rumors of Google achieving quantum supremacy. I don't have inside information outside of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">Scott's blog post</a> but it looks like the news should be <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/10/embargoed-science.html">embargoed</a> until the release of a Science or Nature paper. These things usually happen on a Tuesday and you'd think they would avoid the news of the Nobel Prize announcements October 7-14.<br/>
<br/>
Since for now the Google paper doesn't officially exist, we live in an era of Classical Dominance. Any problem that can be solved on a quantum computer today, can be solved just as fast or faster on a traditional computer. Quantum Supremacy, despite its lofty name, is just the negation of Classical Dominance, that there is some problem that a current quantum machine can solve that all our regular machines would require a considerably longer time to solve. This isn't a formal mathematical or scientific definition, so one can debate when or if we cross this threshold and I'm sure <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">people will</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Quantum Supremacy might not even be a monotone concept. Future classical algorithms might solve the problem quickly, leading us back to Classical Dominance but leaving open the possibility of returning to Quantum Supremacy with another problem.<br/>
<br/>
Quantum Supremacy is a long way from Quantum Usefulness, where quantum machines can solve problems we care about faster that traditional machines. Quantum computing will truly reach its potential when we can run general quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm to factor products of large primes. We'll probably never see Quantum Dominance where classical transistors go the way of vacuum tubes.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, quantum supremacy is an important step and whether or not you think Google has gotten there, I'm sure it's an incredible achievement of science and engineering.</div>

patterns from a given dictionary $\mathcal{D}$ in fragments of a given string
$T$ of length $n$. The dictionary is internal in the sense that each pattern in
$\mathcal{D}$ is given as a fragment of $T$. This way, $\mathcal{D}$ takes
space proportional to the number of patterns $d=|\mathcal{D}|$ rather than
their total length, which could be $\Theta(n\cdot d)$.
</p>
<p>In particular, we consider the following types of queries: reporting and
counting all occurrences of patterns from $\mathcal{D}$ in a fragment $T[i..j]$
and reporting distinct patterns from $\mathcal{D}$ that occur in $T[i..j]$. We
show how to construct, in $\mathcal{O}((n+d) \log^{\mathcal{O}(1)} n)$ time, a
data structure that answers each of these queries in time
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\mathcal{O}(1)} n+|output|)$.
</p>
<p>The case of counting patterns is much more involved and needs a combination
of a locally consistent parsing with orthogonal range searching. Reporting
distinct patterns, on the other hand, uses the structure of maximal repetitions
in strings. Finally, we provide tight---up to subpolynomial factors---upper and
lower bounds for the case of a dynamic dictionary.

system which consists of multiple UAV base stations (BSs) cooperating the
terrestrial BSs. In such a heterogeneous network, for cellular operators, the
problem is how to determine the appropriate number, locations, and altitudes of
UAV-BSs to improve the system sumrate as well as satisfy the demands of
arbitrarily flash crowds on data rates. We propose a data-driven 3D placement
of UAV-BSs for providing an effective placement result with a feasible
computational cost. The proposed algorithm searches for the appropriate number,
location, coverage, and altitude of each UAV-BS in the serving area with the
maximized system sumrate in polynomial time so as to guarantee the minimum data
rate requirement of UE. The simulation results show that the proposed approach
can improve system sumrate in comparison with the case without UAV-BSs.

    <title>Classical algorithms for quantum mean values</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bravyi:Sergey.html">Sergey Bravyi</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Gosset:David.html">David Gosset</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Movassagh:Ramis.html">Ramis Movassagh</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11485">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the task of estimating the expectation value of an $n$-qubit
tensor product observable $O_1\otimes O_2\otimes \cdots \otimes O_n$ in the
output state of a shallow quantum circuit. This task is a cornerstone of
variational quantum algorithms for optimization, machine learning, and the
simulation of quantum many-body systems. Here we study its computational
complexity for constant-depth quantum circuits and three types of single-qubit
observables $O_j$ which are (a) close to the identity, (b) positive
semidefinite, (c) arbitrary. It is shown that the mean value problem admits a
classical approximation algorithm with runtime scaling as $\mathrm{poly}(n)$
and $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}$ in cases (a,b) respectively. In case (c) we give
a linear-time algorithm for geometrically local circuits on a two-dimensional
grid. The mean value is approximated with a small relative error in case (a),
while in cases (b,c) we satisfy a less demanding additive error bound. The
algorithms are based on (respectively) Barvinok's polynomial interpolation
method, a polynomial approximation for the OR function arising from quantum
query complexity, and a Monte Carlo method combined with Matrix Product State
techniques. We also prove a technical lemma characterizing a zero-free region
for certain polynomials associated with a quantum circuit, which may be of
independent interest.

In addition, the PhD student will also study a case of chronically ill individuals, where the data is from the same types of technologies, but can be used for a different purpose, to support decision-making processes in healthcare. In these cases the where the stakeholders are patients , that gather data that which can be used by medical staff to support their decision-making process, and by researchers. Furthermore, we will apply machine learning and advanced analytics to discover patterns that can on the one hand help athletes enhance their performance and on the other hand detect warning signs for the chronically ill. In addition, on the topic of learning from data and designing, and developing platforms for health and wellbeing purposes, the PhD student will also work with a case on new ways of screening for breast cancer.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Information about the department and the university</span></b><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"/></div><div><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">You will join us at the Department of Computer Science, Reykjavík University.

    <title>TR19-128 |  Lower Bounds for (Non-monotone) Comparator Circuits | 

	Anna Gal, 

	Robert Robere</title>
    <summary>Comparator circuits are a natural circuit model for studying the concept of bounded fan-out computations, which intuitively corresponds to whether or not a computational model can make "copies" of intermediate computational steps. Comparator circuits are believed to be weaker than general Boolean circuits, but they can simulate Branching Programs and Boolean formulas. In this paper we prove the first superlinear lower bounds in the general (non-monotone) version of this model for an explicitly defined function. More precisely, we prove that the $n$-bit Element Distinctness function requires $\Omega( (n/ \log n)^{3/2})$ size comparator circuits.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>[The following is a guest post by Benny Applebaum announcing a new conference on information theoretic cryptography – an area with both beautiful math and important applications. –Boaz] </em></p>



<p>Deal friends,<br/>We are happy to announce the birth of a new conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography (ITC). Information-theoretic cryptography studies security in the presence of computationally unbounded adversaries and covers a wide array of topics at the intersection of cryptography, coding theory, information-theory and theory of computation. Notable examples include randomness extraction and privacy amplification, secret sharing, secure multiparty computation and proof systems, private-information retrieval and locally decodable codes, authentication codes and non-malleable codes, differential privacy, quantum information processing, and information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security. See <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io</a> for more information. </p>



<p>ITC replaces the International Conference on Information Theoretic Security (ICITS), which was dedicated to the same topic and ran 2005-2017. ITC can be seen as a reboot of ICITS with a new name, a new steering committee and a renewed excitement.  (beware: there is  a fake website for ICITS 2019 created by a known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">fraudulent organization</a>)  </p>



<p>The conference will have two tracks: a conference track and  a “greatest hits” track. The conference track will operate like a traditional conference with the usual review process and published proceedings. The “greatest hits” track consists of invited talks (not included in the proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in the area. We solicit nominations for “greatest hits” talks from the community.</p>



<p>The first ITC conference will take place in Boston, MA on June 17-19, 2020 (just before STOC).  The submission deadline for ITC 2020 is Dec 16, 2019 and the call for papers (including a nomination procedure for the greatest hits track) is available here:  <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html</a></p>



<p>Please submit your best work to ITC 2020! We hope to see many of you there!</p>



<p>best regards,The Steering Committee:  Benny Applebaum (Chair), Ivan Damgård , Yevgeniy Dodis,  Yuval Ishai, Ueli Maurer,  Kobbi Nissim, Krzysztof Pietrzak, Manoj Prabhakaran, Adam Smith, Yael Tauman Kalai, Stefano Tessaro, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Hoeteck Wee, Daniel Wichs, Mary Wootters,  Chaoping Xing, Moti Yung

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>You’ve seen the stories—in the <em>Financial Times</em>, <em>Technology Review</em>, <em>CNET</em>, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, or elsewhere—saying that a group at Google has now achieved quantum computational supremacy with a 53-qubit superconducting device.  While these stories are easy to find, I’m not going to link to them here, for the simple reason that <em>none of them were supposed to exist yet</em>.</p>



<p>As the world now knows, Google is indeed preparing a big announcement about quantum supremacy, to coincide with the publication of its research paper in a high-profile journal (which journal?  you can probably narrow it down to two).  This will hopefully happen within a month.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, though, NASA, which has some contributors to the work, inadvertently posted an outdated version of the Google paper on a public website.  It was there only briefly, but long enough to make it to the <em>Financial Times</em>, my inbox, and millions of other places.  Fact-free pontificating about what it means has predictably proliferated.</p>



<p>The world, it seems, is going to be denied its clean “moon landing” moment, wherein the Extended Church-Turing Thesis gets experimentally obliterated within the space of a press conference.  This is going to be more like the Wright Brothers’ flight—about which rumors and half-truths leaked out in dribs and drabs between 1903 and 1908, the year Will and Orville finally agreed to do public demonstration flights.  (This time around, though, it thankfully won’t take <em>that</em> long to clear everything up!)</p>



<p>I’ve known about what was in the works for a couple months now; it was excruciating not being able to blog about it.  Though sworn to secrecy, I couldn’t resist dropping some hints here and there (did you catch any?)—for example, in my recent <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4301">Bernays Lectures</a> in Zürich, a lecture series whose entire structure built up to the brink of this moment.</p>



<p>This post is not an official announcement or confirmation of anything.  Though the lightning may already be visible, the thunder belongs to the group at Google, at a time and place of its choosing.</p>



<p>Rather, because so much misinformation is swirling around, what I thought I’d do here, in my role as blogger and “public intellectual,” is offer <strong>Scott’s Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ</strong>.  You know, just in case you were randomly curious about the topic of quantum supremacy, or wanted to know what the implications would be if some search engine company based in Mountain View or wherever were <em>hypothetically</em> to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy.</p>



<p>Without further ado, then:</p>



<p><strong>Q1. What is quantum computational supremacy?</strong></p>



<p>Often abbreviated to just “quantum supremacy,” the term refers to the use of a quantum computer to solve <em>some</em> well-defined set of problems that would take orders of magnitude longer to solve with any currently known algorithms running on existing classical computers—and not for incidental reasons, but for reasons of asymptotic quantum complexity.  The emphasis here is on being as sure as possible that the problem <em>really was</em> solved quantumly and <em>really is</em> classically intractable, and ideally achieving the speedup <em>soon</em> (with the noisy, non-universal QCs of the present or very near future).  If the problem is also <em>useful</em> for something, then so much the better, but that’s not at all necessary.  The Wright Flyer and the Fermi pile weren’t useful in themselves.</p>



<p><strong>Q2. If Google has indeed achieved quantum supremacy, does that mean that now <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1175200727385464832">“no code is uncrackable”</a>, as Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang recently tweeted?</strong></p>



<p>No, it doesn’t.  (But I still like Yang’s candidacy.)</p>



<p>There are two issues here.  First, the devices currently being built by Google, IBM, and others have 50-100 qubits and no error-correction.  Running Shor’s algorithm to break the RSA cryptosystem would require several thousand logical qubits.  With known error-correction methods, that could easily translate into <em>millions</em> of physical qubits, and those probably of a higher quality than any that exist today.  I don’t think anyone is close to that, and we have no idea how long it will take.</p>



<p>But the second issue is that, even in a hypothetical future with scalable, error-corrected QCs, on our current understanding they’ll only be able to crack <em>some</em> codes, not all of them.  By an unfortunate coincidence, the public-key codes that they can crack include <em>most</em> of what we currently use to secure the Internet: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, elliptic curve crypto, etc.  But symmetric-key crypto should only be minimally affected.  And there are even candidates for public-key cryptosystems (for example, based on lattices) that no one knows how to break quantumly after 20+ years of trying, and some efforts underway now to start migrating to those systems.  For more, see for example my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3848">letter to Rebecca Goldstein</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Q3. What calculation is Google planning to do, or has it already done, that’s believed to be classically hard?</strong></p>



<p>So, I can tell you, but I’ll feel slightly sheepish doing so.  The calculation is: a “challenger” generates a random quantum circuit C (i.e., a random sequence of 1-qubit and nearest-neighbor 2-qubit gates, of depth perhaps 20, acting on a 2D grid of n = 50 to 60 qubits).  The challenger then sends C to the quantum computer, and asks it apply C to the all-0 initial state, measure the result in the {0,1} basis, send back whatever n-bit string was observed, and repeat some thousands or millions of times.  Finally, using its knowledge of C, the classical challenger applies a statistical test to check whether the outputs are consistent with the QC having done this.</p>



<p>So, this is not a problem like factoring with a single right answer.  The circuit C gives rise to some probability distribution, call it D<sub>C</sub>, over n-bit strings, and the problem is to output samples from that distribution.  In fact, there will typically be 2<sup>n</sup> strings in the support of D<sub>C</sub>—so many that, if the QC is working as expected, the same output will never be observed twice.  A crucial point, though, is that the distribution D<sub>C</sub> is <em>not</em> uniform.  Some strings enjoy constructive interference of amplitudes and therefore have larger probabilities, while others suffer destructive interference and have smaller probabilities.  And even though we’ll only see a number of samples that’s tiny compared to 2<sup>n</sup>, we can <em>check</em> whether the samples preferentially cluster among the strings that are predicted to be likelier, and thereby build up our confidence that something classically intractable is being done.</p>



<p>So, tl;dr, the quantum computer is simply asked to apply a random (but known) sequence of quantum operations—not because we intrinsically care about the result, but because we’re trying to prove that it can beat a classical computer at <em>some</em> well-defined task.</p>



<p><strong>Q4. But if the quantum computer is just executing some random garbage circuit, whose only purpose is to be hard to simulate classically, then who cares?  Isn’t this a big overhyped nothingburger?</strong></p>



<p>No.  As I put it the other day, it’s not an everythingburger, but it’s certainly at least a somethingburger!</p>



<p>It’s like, have a little respect for the immensity of what we’re talking about here, and for the terrifying engineering that’s needed to make it reality.  Before quantum supremacy, by definition, the QC skeptics can all laugh to each other that, for all the billions of dollars spent over 20+ years, <em>still</em> no quantum computer has even once been used to solve any problem faster than your laptop could solve it, or at least not in any way that depended on its being a quantum computer.  In a post-quantum-supremacy world, that’s no longer the case.  A superposition involving 2<sup>50</sup> or 2<sup>60</sup> complex numbers has been computationally harnessed, using time and space resources that are minuscule compared to 2<sup>50</sup> or 2<sup>60</sup>.</p>



<p>I keep bringing up the Wright Flyer only because the chasm between what we’re talking about, and the dismissiveness I’m seeing in some corners of the Internet, is kind of breathtaking to me.  It’s like, if you believed that useful air travel was fundamentally impossible, then seeing a dinky wooden propeller plane keep itself aloft wouldn’t refute your belief … <em>but it sure as hell shouldn’t reassure you either</em>.</p>



<p>Was I right to <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">worry</a>, years ago, that the constant drumbeat of hype about much less significant QC milestones would wear out people’s patience, so that they’d no longer care when something newsworthy finally did happen?</p>



<p><strong>Q5. Years ago, you scolded the masses for being super-excited about D-Wave, and its claims to get huge quantum speedups for optimization problems via quantum annealing.  Today you scold the masses for <em>not</em> being super-excited about quantum supremacy.  Why can’t you stay consistent?</strong></p>



<p>Because my goal is not to move the “excitement level” in some uniformly preferred direction, it’s to be right!  With hindsight, would you say that I was mostly right about D-Wave, even when raining on that particular parade made me unpopular in some circles?  Well, I’m trying to be right about quantum supremacy too.</p>



<p><strong>Q6. If quantum supremacy calculations just involve sampling from probability distributions, how do you check that they were done correctly?</strong></p>



<p>Glad you asked!  This is the subject of a fair amount of theory that I and others developed over the last decade.  I already gave you the short version in my answer to Q3: you check by doing statistics on the samples that the QC returned, to verify that they’re preferentially clustered in the “peaks” of the chaotic probability distribution D<sub>C</sub>.  One convenient way of doing this, which Google calls the “linear cross-entropy test,” is simply to sum up Pr[C outputs s<sub>i</sub>] over all the samples s<sub>1</sub>,…,s<sub>k</sub> that the QC returned, and then to declare the test a “success” if and only if the sum exceeds some threshold—say, bk/2<sup>n</sup>, for some constant b strictly between 1 and 2.</p>



<p>Admittedly, in order to apply this test, you need to <em>calculate</em> the probabilities Pr[C outputs s<sub>i</sub>] on your classical computer—and the only known ways to calculate them require brute force and take ~2<sup>n</sup> time.  Is that a showstopper?  No, not if n is 50, and you’re Google and are able to handle numbers like 2<sup>50</sup> (although not 2<sup>1000</sup>, which exceeds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol">googol</a>, har har).  By running a huge cluster of classical cores for (say) a month, you can eventually verify the outputs that your QC produced in a few seconds—while also seeing that the QC was many orders of magnitude faster.  However, this does mean that sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments are almost <em>specifically</em> designed for ~50-qubit devices like the ones being built right now.  Even with 100 qubits, we wouldn’t know how to verify the results using all the classical computing power available on earth.</p>



<p>(Let me stress that this issue is specific to <em>sampling</em> experiments like the ones that are currently being done.  If Shor’s algorithm factored a 2000-digit number, it would be easy to check the result by simply multiplying the claimed factors and running a primality test on them.  Likewise, if a QC were used to simulate some complicated biomolecule, you could check its results by comparing them to experiment.)</p>



<p><strong>Q7. Wait.  If classical computers can only check the results of a quantum supremacy experiment, in a regime where the classical computers can still simulate the experiment (albeit extremely slowly), then how do you get to claim “quantum supremacy”?</strong></p>



<p>Come on.  With a 53-qubit chip, it’s perfectly feasible to see a speedup by a factor of many millions, in a regime where you can still directly verify the outputs, and also to see that the speedup is growing exponentially with the number of qubits, exactly as asymptotic analysis would predict.  This isn’t marginal.</p>



<p><strong>Q8. Is there a mathematical proof that no fast classical algorithm could possibly spoof the results of a sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment?</strong></p>



<p>Not at present.  But that’s not quantum supremacy researchers’ fault!  As long as theoretical computer scientists can’t even prove basic conjectures like P≠NP or P≠PSPACE, there’s no hope of ruling out a fast classical simulation unconditionally.  The best we can hope for are conditional hardness results.  And we have indeed managed to prove some such results—see for example the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3245">BosonSampling paper</a>, or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04402">Bouland et al. paper</a> on average-case #P-hardness of calculating amplitudes in random circuits, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">my paper with Lijie Chen</a> (“Complexity-Theoretic Foundations of Quantum Supremacy Experiments”).  The biggest theoretical open problem in this area, in my opinion, is to prove <em>better</em> conditional hardness results.</p>



<p><strong>Q9. Does sampling-based quantum supremacy have any applications in itself?</strong></p>



<p>When people were first thinking about this subject, it seemed pretty obvious that the answer was “no”!  (I know because I was one of the people.)  Recently, however, the situation has changed—for example, because of my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/certrand2.ppt">certified randomness protocol</a>, which shows how a sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment could almost immediately be repurposed to generate bits that can be <em>proven to be random</em> to a skeptical third party (under computational assumptions).  This, in turn, has possible applications to proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and other cryptographic protocols.  I’m hopeful that more such applications will be discovered in the near future.</p>



<p><strong>Q10. If the quantum supremacy experiments are just generating random bits, isn’t that uninteresting?  Isn’t it trivial to convert qubits into random bits, just by measuring them?</strong></p>



<p>The key is that a quantum supremacy experiment doesn’t generate <em>uniform</em> random bits.  Instead, it samples from some complicated, correlated probability distribution over 50- or 60-bit strings.  In my certified randomness protocol, the deviations from uniformity play a central role in how the QC convinces a classical skeptic that it really <em>was</em> sampling the bits randomly, rather than in some secretly deterministic way (e.g., using a pseudorandom generator).</p>



<p><strong>Q11. Haven’t decades of quantum-mechanical experiments–for example, the ones that violated the Bell inequality–already demonstrated quantum supremacy?</strong></p>



<p>This is purely a confusion over words.  Those other experiments demonstrated other forms of “quantum supremacy”: for example, in the case of Bell inequality violations, what you could call “quantum correlational supremacy.”  They did not demonstrate quantum <em>computational</em> supremacy, meaning doing something that’s infeasible to simulate using a classical computer (where the classical simulation has no restrictions of spatial locality or anything else of that kind).  Today, when people use the phrase “quantum supremacy,” it’s generally short for quantum computational supremacy.  </p>



<p><strong>Q12. Even so, there are countless examples of materials and chemical reactions that are hard to classically simulate, as well as special-purpose quantum simulators (like those of Lukin’s group at Harvard).  Why don’t these already count as quantum computational supremacy?</strong></p>



<p>Under some people’s definitions of “quantum computational supremacy,” they do!  The key difference with Google’s effort is that they have a <em>fully programmable </em>device—one that you can program with an arbitrary sequence of nearest-neighbor 2-qubit gates, just by sending the appropriate signals from your classical computer.</p>



<p>In other words, it’s no longer open to the QC skeptics to sneer that, sure, there are quantum systems that are hard to simulate classically, but that’s just because <em>nature</em> is hard to simulate, and you don’t get to arbitrarily redefine whatever random chemical you find in the wild to be a “computer for simulating itself.”  Under any sane definition, the superconducting devices that Google, IBM, and others are now building are indeed “computers.”</p>



<p><strong>Q13. Did you (Scott Aaronson) invent the concept of quantum supremacy?</strong></p>



<p>No.  I did play some role in developing it, which led to Sabine Hossenfelder among others <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/06/quantum-supremacy-what-is-it-and-what.html">generously overcrediting me</a> for the whole idea.  The term “quantum supremacy” was coined by John Preskill in 2012, though in some sense the core concept goes back to the beginnings of quantum computing itself in the early 1980s.  In 1994, the use of Shor’s algorithm to factor a huge number became the quantum supremacy experiment <em>par excellence</em>—albeit, one that’s still (in 2019) much too hard to perform.</p>



<p>The key idea of instead demonstrating quantum supremacy using a <em>sampling problem</em> was, as far as I know, first suggested by Barbara Terhal and David DiVincenzo, in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205133">farsighted paper</a> from 2002.  The “modern” push for sampling-based supremacy experiments started around 2011, when Alex Arkhipov and I published our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3245">paper on BosonSampling</a>, and (independently of us) Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd published their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1407">paper on the commuting Hamiltonians model</a>.  These papers showed, not only that “simple,” non-universal quantum systems can solve apparently-hard sampling problems, but also that an efficient classical algorithm for the same sampling problems would imply a collapse of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_hierarchy">polynomial hierarchy</a>.  Arkhipov and I also made a start toward arguing that even the <em>approximate</em> versions of quantum sampling problems can be classically hard.</p>



<p>As far as I know, the idea of “Random Circuit Sampling”—that is, generating your hard sampling problem by just picking a random sequence of 2-qubit gates in (say) a superconducting architecture—originated in an email thread that I started in December 2015, which also included John Martinis, Hartmut Neven, Sergio Boixo, Ashley Montanaro, Michael Bremner, Richard Jozsa, Aram Harrow, Greg Kuperberg, and others.  The thread was entitled “Hard sampling problems with 40 qubits,” and my email began “Sorry for the spam.”  I then discussed some advantages and disadvantages of three options for demonstrating sampling-based quantum supremacy: (1) random circuits, (2) commuting Hamiltonians, and (3) BosonSampling.  After Greg Kuperberg chimed in to support option (1), a consensus quickly formed among the participants that (1) was indeed the best option from an engineering standpoint—and that, if the theoretical analysis wasn’t yet satisfactory for (1), then that was something we could remedy.</p>



<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> Sergio Boixo tells me that, internally, the Google group had been considering the idea of random circuit sampling since February 2015, even before my email thread.  This doesn’t surprise me: while there are lots of details that had to be worked out, the idea itself is an extremely natural one.]</p>



<p>After that, the Google group did a huge amount of analysis of random circuit sampling, both theoretical and numerical, while <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">Lijie Chen and I</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04402">Bouland et al.</a> supplied different forms of complexity-theoretic evidence for the problem’s classical hardness.</p>



<p><strong>Q14. If quantum supremacy was achieved, what would it mean for the QC skeptics?</strong></p>



<p>I wouldn’t want to be them right now!  They could retreat to the position that <em>of course</em> quantum supremacy is possible (who ever claimed that it wasn’t? surely not them!), that the real issue has always been quantum error-correction.  And indeed, some of them have consistently maintained that position all along.  But others, including my good friend Gil Kalai, are <strong>on record, right here on this blog</strong> predicting that even quantum supremacy can never be achieved for fundamental reasons.  I won’t let them wiggle out of it now.</p>



<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> As many of you will have seen, Gil Kalai has <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">taken the position</a> that the Google result won’t stand and will need to be retracted.  He asked for more data: specifically, a complete histogram of the output probabilities for a smaller number of qubits.  This turns out to be already available, in a <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06678">Science</a></em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06678"> paper from 2018</a>.]</p>



<p><strong>Q15. What’s next?</strong></p>



<p><em>If</em> it’s achieved quantum supremacy, then I think the Google group already has the requisite hardware to demonstrate my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/certrand2.ppt">protocol for generating certified random bits</a>.  And that’s indeed one of the very next things they’re planning to do.</p>



<p>[<strong>Addendum:</strong> Also, of course, the evidence for quantum supremacy itself can be made stronger and various loopholes closed—for example, by improving the fidelity so that fewer samples need to be taken (something that Umesh Vazirani tells me he’d like to see), by having the circuit C be generated and the outputs verified by a skeptic external to Google. and simply by letting more time pass, so outsiders can have a crack at simulating the results classically.  My personal guess is that the basic picture is going to stand, but just like with the first experiments that claimed to violate the Bell inequality, there’s still plenty of room to force the skeptics into a tinier corner.]</p>



<p>Beyond that, one obvious next milestone would be to use a programmable QC, with (say) 50-100 qubits, to do some <em>useful quantum simulation</em> (say, of a condensed-matter system) much faster than any known classical method could do it.  A second obvious milestone would be to demonstrate the use of quantum error-correction, to keep an encoded qubit alive for longer than the underlying physical qubits remain alive.  There’s no doubt that Google, IBM, and the other players will now be racing toward both of these milestones.</p>



<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> Steve Girvin reminds me that the Yale group <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04768">has already achieved</a> quantum error-correction “beyond the break-even point,” albeit in a bosonic system rather than superconducting qubits.  So perhaps a better way to phrase the next milestone would be: achieve quantum computational supremacy <em>and</em> useful quantum error-correction in one and the same system.]</p></div>

    <title>Applicants to Grad School are too good. Here is why this might be a problem.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sitting around with three faculty we had the following conversation<br/>
<br/>
ALICE: When I applied to grad school in 1980 they saw a strong math major (that is, I had good grades in hard math courses) but very little programming or any sort of computer science. That kind of person would NOT be admitted today since there are plenty of strong math majors who ALSO have the Comp Sci chops.<br/>
<br/>
BOB: When I applied to grad school I was a comp sci major but my grades were not that good- A's in system courses, B's and even some C's in math. But I did a Security project that lead to a paper that got into a (minor) systems workshop. Two of my letters bragged a lot about that. (How do I know that? Don't ask.) So I got into grad school in 1989.  That kind of person would NOT be admitted today since there are plenty of people who have papers in minor conferences whose grades ARE good in stuff other than their area.<br/>
<br/>
CAROL: In 1975 I was an English major at Harvard. The summer between my junior and senior year I took a programming course over the summer and did very well and liked it. I then took some math.  Then I worked in industry at a computer scientist for 5 years. Then I applied to grad school and they liked my unusual background. Plus I did well on the GRE's. Letters from my boss at work helped me, I don't think they would count letters from industry now. They took a chance on me, and it paid off (I got a PhD) but I don't think they would let someone like me in now since they don't have to take a chance. They can admit people who have done research, have solid backgrounds, and hence are not taking a chance. The irony is that some of those don't finish anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) Are Alice, Bob, and Carol right that they wouldn't be admitted to grad school now?  I think they are with a caveat- they might end up in a lower tier grad school then they did end up in. Also, Alice and Bob I am more certain would not end up in the top tier grad schools they did since they can be compared DIRECTLY to other applicants,<br/>
where as Carol might be more orthogonal.<br/>
<br/>
2) I have a sense (backed up my no data) that we are accepting fewer unusual cases than we used to (not just UMCP but across the country) because too many of the applicants are the standard very-good-on-paper applicants. Even the on-paper is not quite fair- they ARE very good for real.<br/>
<br/>
3) Assume we are taking less unusual cases. Is that bad? I think so as people with different backgrounds (Carol especially) add to the diversity of trains of thought in a program, and that is surely a good thing.  If EVERY students is a strong comp sci major who has done some research, there is a blandness to that.<br/>
<br/>
4) What to do about this? First off, determine if this is really a problem. If it is then perhaps when looking at grad school applicants have some sensitivity to this issue.<br/>
<br/>
5) For grad school admissions I am speculating. For REU admissions (I have run an REU program for the last 7 years and do all of the admissions myself) I can speak with more experience. The students who apply have gotten better over time and this IS cause for celebration; however, it has made taking unusual cases harder. <br/>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div>A new conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography is starting next year. It is about topics that I have always been fond of, a former student of mine is in the steering committee, and an academic grandchild of mine is in the program committee of the inaugural conference, so I am very happy to pass along the following announcement from Benny Applebaum.</div>
<div/>
<div/>
<div>
<hr/>
</div>
<div/>
<div>Dear friends,</div>
<div/>
<div>We are happy to announce the birth of a new conference on <span class="il">Information</span>-Theoretic Cryptography (ITC). <span class="il">Information</span>-theoretic cryptography studies security in the presence of computationally unbounded adversaries and covers a wide array of topics at the intersection of cryptography, coding theory, <span class="il">information</span>-theory and theory of computation. Notable examples include randomness extraction and privacy amplification, secret sharing, secure multiparty computation and proof systems, private-<span class="il">information</span> retrieval and locally decodable codes, authentication codes and non-malleable codes, differential privacy, quantum <span class="il">information</span> processing, and <span class="il">information</span>-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security. See <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io</a> for more <span class="il">information</span>.</div>
<p>ITC replaces the International Conference on <span class="il">Information</span> Theoretic Security (ICITS), which was dedicated to the same topic and ran 2005-2017. ITC can be seen as a reboot of ICITS with a new name, a new steering committee and a renewed excitement.  (beware: there is  a fake website for ICITS 2019 created by a known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fraudulent organization</a>)</p>
<div/>
<div>The conference will have two tracks: a conference track and  a “greatest hits” track. The conference track will operate like a traditional conference with the usual review process and published proceedings. The “greatest hits” track consists of invited talks (not included in the proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in the area. We solicit nominations for “greatest hits” talks from the community.<p/>
<p>The first ITC conference will take place in Boston, MA on June 17-19, 2020 (just before STOC).  The submission deadline for ITC 2020 is Dec 16, 2019 and the call for papers (including a nomination procedure for the greatest hits track) is available here:  <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html</a></p>
<p>Please submit your best work to ITC 2020! We hope to see many of you there!</p>
</div>
<div>best regards,</div>
<div>The Steering Committee:  Benny Applebaum (Chair), Ivan Damgård , Yevgeniy Dodis,  Yuval Ishai, Ueli Maurer,  Kobbi Nissim, Krzysztof Pietrzak, Manoj Prabhakaran, Adam Smith, Yael Tauman Kalai, Stefano Tessaro, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Hoeteck Wee, Daniel Wichs, Mary Wootters,  Chaoping Xing, Moti Yung</div></div>

<h3>Recent quantum computer news</h3>
<p>You already heard by now that Google (informally) announced it achieved the milestone of “quantum supremacy” on a 53 qubit quantum computer. IBM announced launching in October a quantum computer also on 53 of qubits.  Google’s claim of quantum supremacy is given in two papers from August that were accidentally leaked to the public. Here are links to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19lv8p1fB47z1pEZVlfDXhop082Lc-kdD/view">short main paper</a> and to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7_CzhOF7wruqU_TKltM2f8haZ_R3aNb/view">long supplementary paper</a>. The paper correctly characterizes achieving quantum supremacy as an achievement of the highest caliber.</p>
<p>Putting 50+ qubits together and allowing good quality quantum gates to operate on them is a big deal. So, in my view, Google and IBM’s  noisy quantum circuits represent a remarkable achievement. Of course, the big question is if they can do some interesting computation reliably, but bringing us to the place that this can be tested at all is, in my view, a big deal!</p>
<p>Of course, demonstrating quantum supremacy is even a much bigger deal, but I expect that Google’s claim <strong>will not stand</strong>. As you know, I expect that quantum supremacy cannot be achieved at all. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/21/the-argument-against-quantum-computers-a-cern-colloquium-and-a-new-paper/">this post</a>, this <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/main-pr.pdf">paper A</a>, this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">paper B</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/cern.pptx">these slides of my recent lecture at CERN</a>.)  My specific concerns expressed in this post are, of course, related to my overall skeptic stance as well as to some technical points that I made in my papers, but they could (and should) have also been made by responsible quantum computer believers.</p>
<h3>Achieving quantum supremacy via sampling</h3>
<p>In the last decade there were several suggestions to demonstrate the computational superior power of quantum circuits via sampling tasks. The computer creates (approximately) a probability distribution <strong>D</strong> on 0-1 strings of length n (or other combinatorial objects) that we have good computational complexity reasons to think that classical computers cannot achieve. In our case, <strong>D</strong> is the probability distribution obtained by measuring the outcome of a fixed pseudo-random quantum circuit.</p>
<p>By creating a 0-1 distribution we mean sampling sufficiently many times from that distribution <strong>D</strong> so it allows us to show that the sampled distribution is close enough to <strong>D</strong>. Because of the imperfection (noise) of qubits and gates (and perhaps some additional sources of noise) we actually do not sample from <strong>D</strong> but from another distribution <strong>D’</strong>. However if <strong>D’</strong> is close enough to <strong>D</strong>, the conclusion that classical computers cannot efficiently sample according to <strong>D’</strong> is plausible.</p>
<h3>How to run supremacy sampling experiment</h3>
<p>You compare the distribution <strong>E</strong> obtained by the experiment to the ideal distribution <strong>D </strong>for increasingly larger values of n. If there  is a good match this supports your supremacy claims.</p>
<p>There are two important caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>A single run of the quantum computer gives you only one sample from <strong>D’ </strong>so to get a meaningful description of the target distribution you need to have many samples.</li>
<li>Computing the ideal distribution <strong>D</strong> is computationally hard so as <em>n</em> increases you need a bigger and bigger computational effort to compute <strong>D</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Still, if you can show that <strong>D’</strong> is close enough to <strong>D</strong> before you reach the supremacy regime, and you can carry out the sampling in the supremacy regime then this gives you good reason to think that your experiments in the supremacy regime demonstrate “quantum supremacy”.</p>
<h3>Earlier experiments</h3>
<p>The Google group itself ran this experiment for 9 qubits <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06678">in 2017</a>. One concern I have with this experiment is that I did not see quantitative data indicating how close <strong>D’</strong> is to <strong>D</strong>. Those are distributions on 512 strings that can be described very accurately.  (There were also some boson sampling experiments with 6 bosons and 2 modes and 5 bosons with 5 modes. In this case, supremacy requires something like 50 bosons with 100 modes.)</p>
<h3>The twist in Google’s approach</h3>
<p>The twist in Google’s approach is that they try to compute <strong>D’</strong> based mainly on the 1-qubit and 2-qubit (and readout errors) errors and then run an experiment on 53 qubits where they can neither compute <strong>D</strong> nor verify that they sample from <strong>D’</strong>. In fact they sample <img alt="10^7" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E7&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="10^7"/> samples from 0-1 strings of length 53 so this is probably much too sparse to distinguish between <strong>D</strong> and the uniform distribution even if we have unlimited computational power. (Actually as several people mentioned the last sentence is incorrect.)</p>
<h3>The missing part in the experiment.</h3>
<p>The obvious missing part in the experiment is to run the experiment on random circuits with 9-25 qubits and to test the research assumption about <strong>D’</strong>. I find it a bit surprising that apparently this was not carried out. What is needed is experiments to understand probability distributions obtained by  pseudorandom circuits on 9-, 15-, 20-, 25- qubits. How close they are to the ideal distribution D and how robust they are (namely, what is the gap between experimental distributions for two samples obtained by two runs of the experiment.)</p>
<p>Actually, as I noted in the introduction to <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/main-pr.pdf">Paper A</a> (subsection on near term plans for “quantum supremacy” and  Figure 3), you can bring the hypothesis of quantum supremacy via pseudo-random circuits into test already in the 10-30 qubit regime without even building 53- or 72- qubit devices. (I can certainly see the importance in building larger circuits that are necessary for good quality error correcting codes.)</p>
<h3>The main potential mistake and the matter of correlation.</h3>
<p>Let me also indicate what is a potential mistake in the computation of <strong>D’ </strong>relying just on the behavior of qubits and gates. This is related to correlated (2-qubit gate) errors that I studied mainly before 2014.</p>
<p>The general picture regarding correlated qubit errors is the following:</p>
<p>(1) Errors for gated qubits (for a CNOT gate) are (substantially) positively correlated.</p>
<p>Here, you can think about the extreme form of “bad” noise where with a small probability t  both gated qubits are corrupted and with probability (1-t) nothing happens. (“Good” noise is when each qubit is corrupted with probability t, independently. Real life 2-qubit noise is a certain mixture of good and bad noise.)</p>
<p>(2) Therefore, (unless you are below the threshold level and apply quantum fault tolerance scheme) qubits in cat states that were created indirectly will have correlated noise of this kind.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore (and going from (2) to (3) is a mathematical part) probability distributions described by pseudorandom circuits will have a strong effect of synchronized errors.</p>
<p>What is most devastating about correlated errors is that the accumulated error-rate in terms of qubit errors becomes quadratic in the number of rounds instead of linear. See Remark 4.2 about “model error-rate” and “effective error-rate” in <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/main-pr.pdf">Paper A</a>.</p>
<h3>My predictions.</h3>
<p>Let me mention that Paper B describes fairly detailed predictions about  probability distributions obtained by  pseudo-random circuits and these predictions can be tested in the 9-25 qubits range. In particular, they suggest that robust outcomes will be easy to simulate classically, as they belong to a very low level (<strong>LDP</strong>) computational complexity class,  and that noise sensitivity will lead to chaotic outcomes which are far from the ideal distribution.</p>
<h3>A problem with the supremacy statements itself.</h3>
<blockquote><p>On Google Cloud servers, we estimate that performing the same task for m = 20 with 0.1% fidelity using the SFA algorithm would cost 50 trillion core-hours and consume 1 petawatt hour of energy. To put this in perspective, it took 600 seconds to sample the circuit on the quantum processor 3 million times, where sampling time is limited by control hardware communications; in fact, the net quantum processor time is only about 30 seconds.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not clear where these fantastic numbers come from. They  refer to a specific algorithm and there might be some vague reason to think that this algorithm cannot be improved for D or near by distributions. But, for example,  for the probability distribution I predict this algorithm is extremely inefficient and the sampling can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<h3>Distance-3 surface code</h3>
<p>In 2013 I was one of the organizers of a conference <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/qstart/">Qstart</a> celebrating our then new Quantum Science Center. John Martinis gave a lecture where he mentioned building distance-3 surface codes on 20+ qubits as a (then) near term task. My argument against quantum computers does not give a definite prediction whether  distance-3 surface codes are within or beyond reach and it would be interesting to examine it.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>It looks that Martinis’ groups announcement of supremacy, while based on a remarkable experimental progress,  was premature and in my view it is mistaken. (To be fair, the papers themselves were prematurely released.) This post was also written rather quickly so I will certainly have to think about matters further, perhaps also in view of more careful reading of the papers, some comments by members of the Google group themselves and other people, and also Scott Aaronson promised to write about it.</p>

<h2>Two papers by Jeff Kahn and Jinyoung Park</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04283">The number of maximal independent sets in the Hamming cube</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Let <img alt="Q_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="Q_n"/> be the <em>n</em>-dimensional Hamming cube and <img alt="N=2^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3D2%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N=2^n"/>. We prove that the number of maximal independent sets in <img alt="Q_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="Q_n"/> is asymptotically <img alt="2n2^{N/4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n2%5E%7BN%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2n2^{N/4}"/>,<br/>
as was conjectured by Ilinca and the first author in connection with a question of Duffus, Frankl and Rödl.<br/>
The value is a natural lower bound derived from a connection between maximal independent sets and induced matchings. The proof that it is also an upper bound draws on various tools, among them “stability” results for maximal independent set counts and old and new results on isoperimetric behavior in <img alt="Q_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="Q_n"/>.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04274">An isoperimetric inequality for the Hamming cube and some consequences</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> (Slightly modified.)</p>
<p>Our basic result, an isoperimetric inequality for Hamming cube <img alt="Q_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="Q_n"/>, can be written:<br/>
<img alt="\int h_A^\beta d\mu \ge 2 \mu(A)(1-\mu(A))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cint+h_A%5E%5Cbeta+d%5Cmu+%5Cge+2+%5Cmu%28A%29%281-%5Cmu%28A%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\int h_A^\beta d\mu \ge 2 \mu(A)(1-\mu(A))"/>.<br/>
Here <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mu"/> is uniform measure on <img alt="V={0,1}^n(=V(Q_n)); \beta=log_2(3/2);" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%3D%7B0%2C1%7D%5En%28%3DV%28Q_n%29%29%3B+%5Cbeta%3Dlog_2%283%2F2%29%3B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="V={0,1}^n(=V(Q_n)); \beta=log_2(3/2);"/> and, for <img alt="S\subset V" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5Csubset+V&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S\subset V"/> and <img alt="x\in V" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin+V&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x\in V"/>, <img alt="h_S(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_S%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="h_S(x)"/> is zero if <img alt="x \notin S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cnotin+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x \notin S"/>, and <img alt="h_S(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_S%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="h_S(x)"/> is the number of neighbors of <img alt="a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="a"/> not in <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/>, if <img alt="x \in S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x \in S"/>. (where <img alt="d_T(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_T%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d_T(x)"/> is the number of neighbors of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x"/> in <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="T"/>).</p>
<p>This implies inequalities involving mixtures of edge and vertex boundaries, with related stability results, and suggests some more general possibilities. One application, a stability result for the set of edges connecting two disjoint subsets of V of size roughly |V|/2, is a key step in showing that the number of maximal independent sets in <img alt="Q_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="Q_n"/> is <img alt="(1+o(1))2n\exp_2[2^{n-2}]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2Bo%281%29%292n%5Cexp_2%5B2%5E%7Bn-2%7D%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(1+o(1))2n\exp_2[2^{n-2}]"/> This asymptotic statement, whose proof will appear separately, was the original motivation for the present work.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Counting independent sets in graphs and hypergraphs and related things.</h3>
<p>Asymptotic enumeration of independent sets (and number of colorings)  in various graph is a big topic with very remarkable techniques and methods, and there are quite a few results when the graph in question is that of the discrete <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/>-cube. The maximal size of an independent set is <img alt="2^{n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^{n-1}"/> and you may recall that the recently solved (by Hao Huang) <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/amazing-hao-huang-proved-the-sensitivity-conjecture/">sensitivity conjecture</a> ask for the properties of an induced subgraph on <img alt="2^{n-1}+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn-1%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^{n-1}+1"/> vertices.</p>
<p>How many independent sets are there? Well, we can consider all the subsets of the two independent sets of size <img alt="2^{n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^{n-1}"/> so this gives us <img alt="2\cdot 2^{2^{n-1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ccdot+2%5E%7B2%5E%7Bn-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2\cdot 2^{2^{n-1}}"/>.  Korshunov and Sapozhenko proved in 1983 that the number is <img alt="2\sqrt e" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Csqrt+e&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2\sqrt e"/><img alt="(1+o(1))2^{2^{n-1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2Bo%281%29%292%5E%7B2%5E%7Bn-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(1+o(1))2^{2^{n-1}}"/>, and here is a link to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01991.pdf">a paper of Galvin</a> describing a beautiful proof by  Sapozhenko for this result. As an exercise you can try to figure out where the <img alt="2 \sqrt e" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Csqrt+e&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2 \sqrt e"/> term comes from.</p>
<p>Now, lets talk about maximal independent sets.  The Kahn-Park asymptotic formula <img alt="2n2^{N/4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n2%5E%7BN%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2n2^{N/4}"/> is very clean: try to figure the lower bound!</p>
<p>Two related results in this spirit: Erdos, Kleitman and Rothschild (1976): triangle-free graphs are almost always bipartite. The solution of Dedekind’s problem on the number antichains of subsets of an <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/>-elemet set by Korshunov (1980) and by Sapozhenko (1991).</p>
<h3>Talagrand’s inequality and the Kahn-Park inequality.</h3>
<p>Let <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> be a subset of the vertices of the discrete <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/>-cube. For every vertex <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x"/> in <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> we define <img alt="h_A(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_A%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="h_A(x)"/> as the number of neighbors of <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x"/> that are not in <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/>. We define <img alt="h_A(x)=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_A%28x%29%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="h_A(x)=0"/> if <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x"/> does not belong to <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/>. (<img alt="h_A(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_A%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="h_A(x)"/> is a variation on the sensitivity function of <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/>.)</p>
<p>Recall that <img alt="\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mu"/> denote the uniform probability measure on the discrete cube. A classic discrete isoperimetric inequality that goes back (in a stronger form) to Harper and others asserts that</p>
<p><img alt="\int h_A(x) d\mu \ge 2 \mu(A)(1-\mu(A))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cint+h_A%28x%29+d%5Cmu+%5Cge+2+%5Cmu%28A%29%281-%5Cmu%28A%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\int h_A(x) d\mu \ge 2 \mu(A)(1-\mu(A))"/></p>
<p>(The left hand side is 1/2 times the average sensitivity aka total influence of <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/>.)</p>
<p>Talagrand proved that <img alt="\int h_A^{1/2}(x) d\mu \ge \sqrt 2 \mu(A)(1-\mu(A))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cint+h_A%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%28x%29+d%5Cmu+%5Cge+%5Csqrt+2+%5Cmu%28A%29%281-%5Cmu%28A%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\int h_A^{1/2}(x) d\mu \ge \sqrt 2 \mu(A)(1-\mu(A))"/>. This result is sharp up to some multiplicative constant both for subcubes and for Hamming balls. We discussed Talagrand’s result <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/new-isoperimetric-results-for-testing-monotonicity/">in this post</a>.</p>
<p>Let <img alt="\beta=log_2(3/2)= .585..." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%3Dlog_2%283%2F2%29%3D+.585...&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\beta=log_2(3/2)= .585..."/>. Kahn and Park proved that</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="\int h_A^{\beta}(x) d\mu \ge 2 \mu(A)(1-\mu(A))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cint+h_A%5E%7B%5Cbeta%7D%28x%29+d%5Cmu+%5Cge+2+%5Cmu%28A%29%281-%5Cmu%28A%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\int h_A^{\beta}(x) d\mu \ge 2 \mu(A)(1-\mu(A))"/></p>
<p>Note that the exponent is higher than Talagrand’s exponent. The new inequality is sharp on the nose for subcubes of codimension one and two. <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Let’s check it</strong></span>: for codimension 1, $h_A$ is constant 1 on <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/>, so <img alt="\int h_A^{\beta}(x) d\mu" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cint+h_A%5E%7B%5Cbeta%7D%28x%29+d%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\int h_A^{\beta}(x) d\mu"/> is 1/2 for every <img alt="\beta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\beta"/> and this equals <img alt="2 \mu(A) (1-\mu (A))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cmu%28A%29+%281-%5Cmu+%28A%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2 \mu(A) (1-\mu (A))"/>. When <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> is a codimension 2 subcube,  $h_A$ is constant 2 on <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/>. Now, by the definition of $\beta$,  <img alt="2^\beta = 3/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%5Cbeta+%3D+3%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^\beta = 3/2"/>. Thus, <img alt="\int h_A^{\beta}(x) d\mu=\frac {1}{4} \frac {3}{2}=\frac{3}{8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cint+h_A%5E%7B%5Cbeta%7D%28x%29+d%5Cmu%3D%5Cfrac+%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%5Cfrac+%7B3%7D%7B2%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\int h_A^{\beta}(x) d\mu=\frac {1}{4} \frac {3}{2}=\frac{3}{8}"/> and <img alt="2 \mu(A) (1-\mu (A))=2 \frac {1}{4} \frac{3}{4}=\frac{3}{8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cmu%28A%29+%281-%5Cmu+%28A%29%29%3D2+%5Cfrac+%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2 \mu(A) (1-\mu (A))=2 \frac {1}{4} \frac{3}{4}=\frac{3}{8}"/>, <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>walla!</strong></span></p>

    <title>TR19-127 |  Local Proofs Approaching the Witness Length | 

	Ron Rothblum, 

	Noga Ron-Zewi</title>
    <summary>Interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) are a hybrid between interactive proofs and PCPs. In an IOP the prover is allowed to interact with a verifier (like in an interactive proof) by sending relatively long messages to the verifier, who in turn is only allowed to query a few of the bits that were sent (like in a PCP).

In this work we construct, for a large class of NP relations, IOPs in which the communication complexity approaches the witness length. More precisely, for any NP relation for which membership can be decided in polynomial-time and bounded polynomial space (e.g., SAT, Hamiltonicity, Clique, Vertex-Cover, etc.) and for any constant $\gamma&gt;0$, we construct an IOP with communication complexity $(1+\gamma) \cdot n$, where $n$ is the original witness length. The number of rounds as well as the number of queries made by the IOP verifier are constant.

This result improves over prior works on short IOPs/PCPs in two ways. First, the communication complexity in these short IOPs is proportional to the complexity of verifying the NP witness, which can be polynomially larger than the witness size. Second, even ignoring the difference between witness length and non-deterministic verification time, prior works incur (at the very least) a large constant multiplicative overhead to the communication complexity.

In particular, as a special case, we also obtain an IOP for Circuit-SAT with rate approaching 1: the communication complexity is $(1+\gamma) \cdot t$, for circuits of size $t$ and any constant $\gamma&gt;0$. This improves upon the prior state-of-the-art work of Ben Sasson et-al (ICALP, 2017) who construct an IOP for Circuit-SAT with rate that is a small (unspecified) constant bounded away from 0.

Our proof leverages recent constructions of high-rate locally testable tensor codes. In particular, we bypass the barrier imposed by the low rate of multiplication codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon, Reed-Muller or AG codes) - a core component in all known short PCP/IOP constructions.</summary>

    <title>Changing Times</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An old friend from college sent me an e-mail, and it got me thinking.  When I was an undergraduate at Harvard some significant number of years ago, I took the graduate level algorithms course offered by Michael Rabin and the graduate level complexity course by Les Valiant.  There were maybe a half dozen people in each of the classes.  (They were great classes, of course. But CS at Harvard back then was really, really small.) <br/><br/>This semester, I'm teaching the graduate level course on randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis.  Right now, the enrollment is 74 students;  well more than half are undergraduates.  Somehow, that says something to me -- about how the field has grown, and in at least some regards how Harvard has changed.  And about how much more prepared students are these days for these kinds of classes.  (Knowledge or probability is much more prevalent.)  Class sizes have been creeping up for so long that while it's noticeable year-to-year, it's much more stark and remarkable when I think back to my own time in college. <br/><br/>Of course, it's also on my mind because it's a pain teaching a graduate class that large.  But it's a pain I can live with -- if I didn't like teaching, I wouldn't have become a professor.  And it's gratifying, if not a little bit shocking, that there's this kind of interest in the subject I really love, that I've been excited by for decades. <br/><br/><br/></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My vision is blurry right now, because yesterday I had a procedure called <a href="https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/corneal-cross-linking-for-keratoconus#1">corneal cross-linking</a>, intended to prevent further deterioration of my eyes as I get older.  But I can see clearly enough to tap out a post with random thoughts about the world.</p>



<p>I’m happy that the Netanyahu era might <em>finally</em> be ending in Israel, after which Netanyahu will hopefully face some long-delayed justice for his eye-popping corruption.  If only there were a realistic prospect of Trump facing similar justice.  I wish Benny Gantz success in putting together a coalition.</p>



<p>I’m happy that my two least favorite candidates, Bill de Blasio and Kirsten Gillibrand, have now both dropped out of the Democratic primary.  Biden, Booker, Warren, Yang—I could enthusiastically support pretty much <em>any</em> of them, if they looked like they had a good chance to defeat Twitler.  Let’s hope.</p>



<p>Most importantly, I wish to register my full-throated support for the climate strikes taking place today all over the world, including here in Austin.  My daughter Lily, age 6, is old enough to understand the basics of what’s happening and to worry about her future.  I urge the climate strikers to keep their eyes on things that will actually make a difference (building new nuclear plants, carbon taxes, geoengineering) and ignore what won’t (banning plastic straws).</p>



<p>As for Greta Thunberg: she is, or is trying to be, the real-life version of the Comet King from <a href="http://unsongbook.com/">Unsong</a>.  You can make fun of her, ask what standing or expertise she has as some random 16-year-old to lead a worldwide movement.  But I suspect that this is <em>always</em> what it looks like when someone takes something that’s known to (almost) all, and then makes it <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410">common knowledge</a>.  If civilization makes it to the 22nd century at all, then in whatever form it still exists, I can easily imagine that it will have more statues of Greta than of MLK or Gandhi.</p>



<p>On a completely unrelated and much less important note, John Horgan has a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/is-mathematics-like-science-pluralistic/">post about “pluralism in math”</a> that includes some comments by me.</p>



<p>Oh, and on the quantum supremacy front—I foresee some big news very soon.  You know which blog to watch for more.</p></div>

    <title>TR19-126 |  Near Coverings and Cosystolic Expansion -- an example of topological property testing | 

	Irit Dinur, 

	Roy Meshulam</title>
    <summary>We study the stability of covers of simplicial complexes. Given a map f:Y?X that satisfies almost all of the local conditions of being a cover, is it close to being a genuine cover of X? Complexes X for which this holds are called cover-stable. We show that this is equivalent to X being a cosystolic expander with respect to non-abelian coefficients. This gives a new combinatorial-topological interpretation to cosystolic expansion which is a well studied notion of high dimensional expansion. As an example, we show that the 2-dimensional spherical building A3(????q) is cover-stable. We view this work as a possibly first example of "topological property testing", where one is interested in studying stability of a topological notion that is naturally defined by local conditions.</summary>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: I will explain our recent understanding of the chasing convex bodies problem posed by Friedman and Linial in 1991. In this problem, an online player receives a request sequence <img alt="K_1,\dots,K_T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_1%2C%5Cdots%2CK_T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="K_1,\dots,K_T"/> of convex sets in <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="d"/> dimensional space and moves his position online into each requested set. The player’s movement cost is the length of the resulting path. Chasing convex bodies asks if there an online algorithm with cost competitive against the offline optimal path. This is both an challenging metrical task system and (equivalent to) a competitive analysis view on online convex optimization.</p>
<p>This problem was open for <img alt="d&gt;2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3E2&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="d&gt;2"/> until last year but has recently been solved twice. The first solution gives a <img alt="2^{O(d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7BO%28d%29%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="2^{O(d)}"/> competitive algorithm while the second gives a nearly optimal <img alt="\min(d,\sqrt(d\log(T)))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin%28d%2C%5Csqrt%28d%5Clog%28T%29%29%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\min(d,\sqrt(d\log(T)))"/> competitive algorithm for <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="T"/> requests. The latter result is based on the Steiner point, which is the exact optimal solution to a related geometric problem called Lipschitz selection and dates from 1840. In the talk, I will briefly outline the first solution and fully explain the second.</p>
<p>Partially based on joint works with Sébastien Bubeck, Bo’az Klartag, Yin Tat Lee, and Yuanzhi Li.</p></blockquote>

    <title>TR19-125 |  Hardness Amplification of Optimization Problems 	 | 

	Elazar Goldenberg, 

	Karthik  C. S.</title>
    <summary>In this paper, we prove a general hardness amplification scheme for optimization problems based on the technique of direct products.
  
We say that an optimization problem $\Pi$ is direct product feasible if it is possible to efficiently aggregate any $k$ instances of $\Pi$ and form one large instance of $\Pi$ such that given an optimal feasible solution to the larger instance, we can efficiently find optimal feasible solutions to all the $k$ smaller instances. Given a direct product feasible optimization problem $\Pi$, our hardness amplification theorem may be informally stated as follows:
  
If there is a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over instances of $\Pi$ of size $n$ such that every randomized algorithm running in time $t(n)$ fails to solve $\Pi$ on $\frac{1}{\alpha(n)}$ fraction of inputs sampled from $\mathcal{D}$, then, assuming some relationships on $\alpha(n)$ and $t(n)$, there is a distribution $\mathcal{D}'$ over instances of $\Pi$ of size $O(n\cdot \alpha(n))$ such that every randomized algorithm running in time $\frac{t(n)}{poly(\alpha(n))}$ fails to solve $\Pi$ on $\frac{99}{100}$ fraction of inputs sampled from $\mathcal{D}'$.
  
As a consequence of the above theorem, we show hardness amplification of problems in various classes such as NP-hard problems like Max-Clique, Knapsack, and Max-SAT, problems in P such as Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance, Matrix Multiplication, and even problems in TFNP such as Factoring and computing Nash equilibrium.</summary>

    <title>TR19-124 |  Testing Odd Direct Sums Using High Dimensional Expanders | 

	Roy Gotlib, 

	Tali Kaufman</title>
    <summary>In this work, using methods from high dimensional expansion, we show that the property of $k$-direct-sum is testable for odd values of $k$ . Previous work of Kaufman and Lubotzky could inherently deal only with the case that $k$ is even, using a reduction to linearity testing.
Interestingly, our work is the first to combine the topological notion of high dimensional expansion (called co-systolic expansion) with the combinatorial/spectral notion of high dimensional expansion (called colorful expansion) to obtain the result.

The classical $k$-direct-sum problem applies to the complete complex; Namely it considers a function defined over all $k$-subsets of some $n$ sized universe. Our result here applies to any collection of $k$-subsets of an $n$-universe, assuming this collection of subsets forms a high dimensional expander.</summary>
