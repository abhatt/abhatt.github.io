    <title>TR20-178 |  Reciprocal Inputs in Arithmetic and Tropical Circuits | 

	Stasys Jukna, 

	Hannes Seiwert, 

	Igor Sergeev</title>
    <summary>It is known that the size of monotone arithmetic $(+,\ast)$ circuits can be  exponentially decreased by allowing just one division  "at the very end," at the output gate. A natural question is: can the size of $(+,\ast)$ circuits be substantially  reduced if we allow divisions "at the very beginning," that is, if besides  nonnegative real constants and variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, the circuits can also use their reciprocals $1/x_1,\ldots,1/x_n$ as inputs. We answer this question in the negative: the gain in circuit size is  then always at most quadratic.


Over tropical $(\min,+)$ and $(\max,+)$ semirings, division turns into subtraction; so, reciprocal inputs are then $-x_1,\ldots,-x_n$.  We give the same negative answer also for tropical circuits. The question of whether reciprocal inputs can substantially speed up tropical $(\min,+,\max)$ circuits, using both $\min$ and $\max$ gates, remains open.</summary>

    <title>James Randi, Magicians-Author-Skeptic, passed away at the age of 92</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><br/></p><p>James The Amazing Randi died on October 20, 2020, at the age of 92. He is survived by</p><p>his husband Jose Alvarez.  His Wikipedia page is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi">here</a></p><div> </div><div>A few Randi Points:</div><div><br/></div><div><div><br/></div><div>0) Wikipedia lists his careers as Magician, Author, Skeptic. I didn't know that skeptic was a career.</div><div><br/></div><div>1) Randi debunked many paranormal claims, though he did not like the term <i>debunke</i>r. He preferred <i>investigator</i>.</div><div><br/></div><div>2) Martin Gardner and James Randi founded the</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.</i></div><div><br/></div><div>which publishes</div><div><br/></div><div><i>The Skeptical Inquirer</i>: see <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwuL_8BRCXARIsAGiC51AlnsnROpbKH-O1K-3WoumIXHGLAACCVDxByb2lFy0rkKunUHblUOAaAmUmEALw_wcB">here</a>  </div></div><div><br/></div><div><div><br/></div><div>3) The internet is both a place where unchecked claims of paranormal activity (and more dangerous lies) can grow faster than in an earlier time, but also a place where magazines like The Skeptical Inquirer, and fact-checking websites, can help check the unchecked claims. What is winning? I leave that as an exercise for the reader. </div><div><br/></div><div>4) I suspect most (all?) people reading this blog do not believe in astrology, UFO's, ESP, or other crank theories. Hence I was surprised to read that Alan Turing thought the evidence for  ESP was <i>overwhelming. </i>This was mentioned in passing in his paper on The Turing Test (called there <i>The</i> <i>Imitation Game</i>) as something the Turing Test will have to account for. I've tried to find out why he believed this, without success. Some websites mentioned that belief in the paranormal was more... normal in those days. One suggested that after the counter-intuitive theories of quantum mechanics and relatively were out there, other counter-intuitive theories took hold, like ESP.  Even so, what was the evidence he was referring to?</div><div><br/></div><div>5) Claims that<i>  I was abducted by a UFO</i> or <i>I saw a UFO</i> have decreased since people now have cell phones so ALWAYS have a way to take pictures. Also rumors like (I had heard this one)</div><div><br/></div><div><i>There is an alternative ending to the movie BLAH which made is way to a few DVDs by mistake.</i></div><div><br/></div><div>are no longer made since IF true you could EASILY produce evidence of such (post to you tube or elsewhere).</div><div><br/></div><div>6) The term<i> skeptic</i> just means someone who doubts something, and is not necc a positive things.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>I am a skeptic when it comes go Global Warming</i></div><div><br/></div><div>being one example.</div></div><div><br/></div><div><div>Randi largely debunked things that were obviously false and not-political. (That the very existence of Global Warming is political is  appalling. At some future point the question of whether or not we ever got to the moon will be political: Something done by big government that worked is impossible, hence it did not happen. See Scott's Blog on disbelief that we ever went to the moon <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4267">here</a>. And people like Randi will need to debunk the notion that the moon landing was faked.) </div><div><br/></div><div>7) Back to Turing- There is a large diff between believing in ESP and believing in astrology.</div><div><br/></div><div>For ESP Turing mentioned <i>overwhelming evidence. </i> While he was WRONG, he did see the need to HAVE evidence. And note that ESP CAN be tested and found to NOT be true. Also note that it is plausible (though I really doubt it) that some humans somehow have some level of ESP. Astrology has NO redeeming value or hope whatsoever. (I am reminded that in Martin Gardner's book <i>Fads and Fallacies in the name of science </i>he noted that most people would say things like `YES, I liked your debunking of A, but you are wrong about B--- B is for real!')</div><div><br/></div><div>UFO's: I do not believe that aliens have come here and abducted people or left crop circles or anything of the sort. The intelligent question of  <i>is there intelligent life in the universe  </i>is quite another matter.</div><div><br/></div><div>7) When I saw magicians as a kid (1960's) I knew that it was all tricks- though very skillful tricks which were impressive. Sometimes they would indicate that it was <i>real magic </i>but I did not know what they meant. Since then I have learned that in an earlier time it was common that magicians claimed they used  <i>real magic</i>.  I still don't quite know what that means, which is just as well since it does not exist.</div><div><br/></div><div>8) Randi has been sued by people whose tricks he has debunked. Randi seems to have always won.  I say <i>seems to </i> since legal cases are not as clear cut as mathematics.  I also looked up Uri Geller. He has sued A LOT of people, and not just people who deny his claims. Thinks like using his likeness  without permission  (he may have a point there). Very hard to tell how he is doing on balance.</div><div><br/></div><div>9) According to Wikipedia Randi dropped out of High School. I assume he learned A LOT on his own.</div><div><br/></div><div>(Trivia-- who was the last president who did not have a college degree? I will answer at the end.)</div><div><br/></div><div>10) This seems like a paradox... or something (quoted from Wikipedia):</div></div><div><br/></div><div><div>BEGIN</div><div><br/></div><div>Randi has been accused of actually using <i>psychic powers</i> to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud.  Randi said: "<i>Yes, indeed</i>, <i>I'm a trickste</i>r, <i>I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery</i>. The professor shouted back:</div><div><br/></div><div><i>That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it.</i></div><div><br/></div><div>A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena.  When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: "<i>I think</i> <i>Randi may be a </i><i>psychic and doesn't realize it</i>." Randi consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.</div><div><br/></div><div>END</div><div><br/></div><div>Reminds me of <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2013/06/fraud-or-not.html">this</a> blog entry where I speculate about someone who codes up a great new classical  factoring algorithm and claims he has a quantum computer, or someone who has a working quantum computer and claims its a great new classical factoring algorithm. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>11) The last president who did not have a college degree: Harry Truman.</div></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div>

    <title>Group-level Fairness Maximization in Online Bipartite Matching</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1606694400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Ma:Will.html">Will Ma</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/x/Xu:Pan.html">Pan Xu</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13908">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In typical online matching problems, the goal is to maximize the number of
matches. This paper studies online bipartite matching from the perspective of
group-level fairness, and the goal is to balance the number of matches made
across different groups of online nodes. We assume that an online node's group
belongings are revealed upon arrival, and measure performance based on the
group with the smallest fraction of its nodes matched at the end. We
distinguish between two different objectives: long-run fairness, where the
algorithm is audited for its fairness over many realizations from the same
instance; and short-run fairness, where the algorithm is audited for its
fairness on a single realization.
</p>
<p>We focus on the known-IID model of online arrivals and analyze, under both
objectives, the competitive ratio for two classes of algorithms: non-rejecting
algorithms, which must match an online node as long as a neighbor is available;
and general online algorithms, which are allowed to reject online nodes to
improve fairness. For long-run fairness, we analyze two online algorithms
(sampling and pooling) which establish asymptotic optimality across many
different regimes (no specialized supplies, no rare demand types, or imbalanced
supply/demand). By contrast, outside all of these regimes, we show that the
competitive ratio for online algorithms is between 0.632 and 0.732. For
short-run fairness, we focus on the case of a complete bipartite graph and show
that the competitive ratio for online algorithms is between 0.863 and 0.942; we
also derive a probabilistic rejection algorithm which is asymptotically optimal
as total demand increases.

detection of non-overlapping ellipses from edge points. The new methods include
a robust Monte Carlo-based approach for detecting points following elliptical
patterns; process to detect non-overlapping ellipses from edge points; and
procedure to detect cylinders from three-dimensional point clouds. The proposed
methods were compared with established state-of-the-art methods, using
simulated and real-world datasets, through the design of four sets of original
experiments. It was found that the proposed robust ellipse detection was
superior to the popular least median of squares method in both simulated and
real-world datasets. The proposed process for detecting non-overlapping
ellipses outperformed two established edge chaining/following methods, proposed
by Fornaciari and Patraucean, in images. The proposed cylinder extraction
method identified all detectable mechanical pipes in real-world point clouds.
The results show promise for the application of the proposed methods for
automatic extraction of circular targets from images and mechanical pipes from
point clouds.

    <title>Near-Optimal Algorithms for Reachability, Strongly-Connected Components and Shortest Paths in Partially Dynamic Digraphs</title>

algorithmic graph problems where graphs are directed and partially dynamic,
i.e. undergo either a sequence of edge insertions or deletions:
</p>
<p>- Single-Source Reachability (SSR),
</p>
<p>- Strongly-Connected Components (SCCs), and
</p>
<p>- Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP).
</p>
<p>These problems have recently received an extraordinary amount of attention
due to their role as subproblems in various more complex and notoriously hard
graph problems, especially to compute flows, bipartite matchings and cuts.
</p>
<p>Our techniques lead to the first near-optimal data structures for these
problems in various different settings. Letting $n$ denote the number of
vertices in the graph and by $m$ the maximum number of edges in any version of
the graph, we obtain
</p>
<p>- the first randomized data structure to maintain SSR and SCCs in
near-optimal total update time $\tilde{O}(m)$ in a graph undergoing edge
deletions.
</p>
<p>- the first randomized data structure to maintain SSSP in partially dynamic
graphs in total update time $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ which is near-optimal in dense
graphs.
</p>
<p>- the first deterministic data structures for SSR and SCC for graphs
undergoing edge deletions, and for SSSP in partially dynamic graphs that
improve upon the $O(mn)$ total update time by Even and Shiloach from 1981 that
is often considered to be a fundamental barrier.

flow path networks with parametric weights. We are given a dynamic flow network
consisting of an undirected path with positive edge lengths, positive edge
capacities, and nonnegative vertex weights. A path can be considered as a road,
an edge length as the distance along the road and a vertex weight as the number
of people at the site. An edge capacity limits the number of people that can
enter the edge per unit time. We consider the problem of locating a sink in the
network, to which all the people evacuate from the vertices as quickly as
possible. In our model, each weight is represented by a linear function in a
common parameter $t$, and the decision maker who determines the location of a
sink does not know the value of $t$. We formulate the sink location problem
under such uncertainty as the minmax regret problem. Given $t$ and a sink
location $x$, the cost of $x$ under $t$ is the sum of arrival times at $x$ for
all the people determined by $t$. The regret for $x$ under $t$ is the gap
between the cost of $x$ under $t$ and the optimal cost under $t$. The task of
the problem is formulated as the one to find a sink location that minimizes the
maximum regret over all $t$. For the problem, we propose an $O(n^4
2^{\alpha(n)} \alpha(n) \log n)$ time algorithm where $n$ is the number of
vertices in the network and $\alpha(\cdot)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.
Also for the special case in which every edge has the same capacity, we show
that the complexity can be reduced to $O(n^3 2^{\alpha(n)} \alpha(n) \log n)$.

the ReLU activation function; these networks are simply weighted sums (that may
include negative coefficients) of ReLUs. Our goal is to output a depth-2 neural
network that minimizes the square loss with respect to a given training set. We
prove that this problem is NP-hard already for a network with a single ReLU. We
also prove NP-hardness for outputting a weighted sum of $k$ ReLUs minimizing
the squared error (for $k&gt;1$) even in the realizable setting (i.e., when the
labels are consistent with an unknown depth-2 ReLU network). We are also able
to obtain lower bounds on the running time in terms of the desired additive
error $\epsilon$. To obtain our lower bounds, we use the Gap Exponential Time
Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) as well as a new hypothesis regarding the hardness of
approximating the well known Densest $\kappa$-Subgraph problem in
subexponential time (these hypotheses are used separately in proving different
lower bounds). For example, we prove that under reasonable hardness
assumptions, any proper learning algorithm for finding the best fitting ReLU
must run in time exponential in $1/\epsilon^2$. Together with a previous work
regarding improperly learning a ReLU (Goel et al., COLT'17), this implies the
first separation between proper and improper algorithms for learning a ReLU. We
also study the problem of properly learning a depth-2 network of ReLUs with
bounded weights giving new (worst-case) upper bounds on the running time needed
to learn such networks both in the realizable and agnostic settings. Our upper
bounds on the running time essentially matches our lower bounds in terms of the
dependency on $\epsilon$.

a vertex sparsifier with $O(k^3)$ vertices via the theory of representative
families on matroids. Since their breakthrough result in 2012, no improvement
upon the $O(k^3)$ bound has been found.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we interpret Kratsch and Wahlstr\"om's result through the lens
of Bollob\'as's Two-Families Theorem from extremal combinatorics. This new
perspective allows us to close the gap for directed acyclic graphs and obtain a
tight bound of $\Theta(k^2)$. Central to our approach is the concept of
skew-symmetry from extremal combinatorics, and we derive a similar theory for
the representation of skew-symmetric families that may have future
applications.

to reduce the size of existing coresets by suggesting the first $O(\log(m))$

to the existing $\exp(m)$ solution. We then project the points on these lines
and prove that for a sufficiently large $m$ we obtain a coreset for projective

understood as individual "probabilities" -- what is the probability of 5-year
survival after cancer diagnosis? -- and which increasingly form the basis for
life-altering decisions. Drawing on an understanding of computational
indistinguishability developed in complexity theory and cryptography, we
introduce Outcome Indistinguishability. Predictors that are Outcome
Indistinguishable yield a generative model for outcomes that cannot be
efficiently refuted on the basis of the real-life observations produced by
Nature. We investigate a hierarchy of Outcome Indistinguishability definitions,
whose stringency increases with the degree to which distinguishers may access
the predictor in question. Our findings reveal that Outcome
Indistinguishability behaves qualitatively differently than previously studied
notions of indistinguishability. First, we provide constructions at all levels
of the hierarchy. Then, leveraging recently-developed machinery for proving
average-case fine-grained hardness, we obtain lower bounds on the complexity of
the more stringent forms of Outcome Indistinguishability. This hardness result
provides the first scientific grounds for the political argument that, when
inspecting algorithmic risk prediction instruments, auditors should be granted
oracle access to the algorithm, not simply historical predictions.

This is one of the most well-studied algorithmic graph problems, with many theoretical and practical applications. We focus on solving this problem when the input $G$ has {\em bounded degeneracy}. This is a rich family of graphs, containing all graphs without a fixed minor (e.g. planar graphs), as well as graphs generated by various random processes (e.g. preferential attachment graphs). We say that $H$ is {\em easy} if there is a linear-time algorithm for counting the number of copies of $H$ in an input $G$ of bounded degeneracy. A seminal result of Chiba and Nishizeki from '85 states that every $H$ on at most 4 vertices is easy. Bera, Pashanasangi, and Seshadhri recently extended this to all $H$ on 5 vertices, and further proved that for every $k &gt; 5$ there is a $k$-vertex $H$ which is not easy. They left open the natural problem of characterizing all easy graphs $H$. 
		
Bressan has recently introduced a framework for counting subgraphs in degenerate graphs, from which one can extract a sufficient condition for a graph $H$ to be  easy. Here we show that this sufficient condition is also necessary, thus fully answering the Bera--Pashanasangi--Seshadhri problem. We further resolve two closely related problems; namely characterizing the graphs that are easy with respect to counting induced copies, and with respect to counting homomorphisms. Our proofs rely on several novel approaches for proving hardness results in the context of subgraph-counting.</summary>

    <title>Study of a triangular bottle</title>
    <summary>We acquired this small blue glass bottle nearly 15 years ago, as a prop for a Harry Potter themed birthday party. For much of the time since then it’s been decorating our bathroom window with several other blue bottles. Like most bottles these days, it’s molded rather than blown, but a little roughly so the welding seams are more visible than they usually are on wine or liquor bottles.</summary>

<p>As you can see, it has an unusual triangular cross-section. The final image, with a Reuleaux triangle overlaid, shows that the curvature of this cross-section is less than a Reuleaux triangle would have. I don’t think its outline was chosen with any particular mathematics in mind, but only (as so many other curved triangles) to make an interesting shape.</p>

<p/><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In 1973, Brown, Erdős and Sós proved that if <img alt="\cal H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccal+H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\cal H"/> is a 3-uniform hypergraph on <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> vertices which contains no triangulation of the sphere, then <img alt="\cal H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccal+H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\cal H"/>  has at most <img alt="O(n^{5/2})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B5%2F2%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="O(n^{5/2})"/> edges, and this bound is the best possible up to a constant factor. Resolving a conjecture of Linial, also reiterated by Keevash, Long, Narayanan, and Scott, we show that the same result holds for triangulations of the torus. Furthermore, we extend our result to every closed orientable surface <img alt="\cal S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccal+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\cal S"/>.</p> <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Remarks:</strong> </span></p> <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1) When <img alt="\cal S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccal+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\cal S"/> is fixed Nati proved that there is a simplicial complex with <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> vertices and <img alt="c n^{5/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+n%5E%7B5%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="c n^{5/2}"/> 2-faces that does not contain a triangulation of <img alt="\cal S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccal+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\cal S"/>. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) It is not known if there is an example with <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> vertices and <img alt="c n^{5/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+n%5E%7B5%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="c n^{5/2}"/> 2-faces which does not contain a triangulation of any orientable closed surface <img alt="\cal S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccal+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\cal S"/>. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We can ask the same question also for pseudomanifolds.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Our first main result is a uniform bound, in every dimension <img alt="k \in \mathbb N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k \in \mathbb N"/>, on the topological Turán numbers of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-dimensional simplicial complexes: for each <img alt="k \in \mathbb N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k \in \mathbb N"/>, there is a <img alt="\lambda_k \ge k^{-2k^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_k+%5Cge+k%5E%7B-2k%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\lambda_k \ge k^{-2k^2}"/> such that for any <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-dimensional simplicial complex <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="S"/>, every <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-complex on <img alt="n \ge n_0(S)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cge+n_0%28S%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n \ge n_0(S)"/> vertices with at least <img alt="n^{k+1-\lambda_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bk%2B1-%5Clambda_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n^{k+1-\lambda_k}"/>  facets contains a homeomorphic copy of S.</p>
<p>This was previously known only in dimensions one and two, both by highly dimension-specific arguments: the existence of <img alt="\lambda_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\lambda_1"/> is a result of Mader from 1967, and the existence of <img alt="\lambda_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\lambda_2"/> was suggested by Linial in 2006 and recently proved by Keevash-Long-Narayanan-Scott.</p>
<p>Jason Long, Bhargav Narayanan, and Corrine Yap deduce this theorem  from a very interesting purely combinatorial result about trace-bounded hypergraphs.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the aforementioned paper Peter Keevash, Jason Long, Bhargav Narayanan, and Alex Scott: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02657">A universal exponent for homeomorphs</a>. The main theorem asserts that <img alt="\lambda_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\lambda_2"/> can be taken to be <strong>14/5</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me also mention a 2018 result by  Agelos Georgakopoulos, John Haslegrave, Richard Montgomery, and Bhargav Narayanan  in their 2018 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06864">Spanning surfaces in 3-graphs</a> where they prove a topological extension of Dirac’s theorem about Hamiltonian cycles in graphs proposed by Gowers in 2005.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Finally, finding the correct value for <img alt="\lambda_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\lambda_k"/> would be very interesting.</span></p></div>

    <title>Can implicit regularization in deep learning be explained by norms?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This post is based on my <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06398.pdf">recent paper</a> with <a href="https://noamrazin.github.io/">Noam Razin</a> (to appear at NeurIPS 2020), studying the question of whether norms can explain implicit regularization in deep learning.
TL;DR: we argue they cannot.</p>

<h2 id="implicit-regularization--norm-minimization">Implicit regularization = norm minimization?</h2>

<p>Understanding the implicit regularization induced by gradient-based optimization is possibly the biggest challenge facing theoretical deep learning these days.
In classical machine learning we typically regularize via norms, so it seems only natural to hope that in deep learning something similar is happening under the hood, i.e. the implicit regularization strives to find minimal norm solutions.
This is actually the case in the simple setting of overparameterized linear regression $-$ there, by a folklore analysis (cf. <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy8gdB9xx">Zhang et al. 2017</a>), gradient descent (and any other reasonable gradient-based optimizer) initialized at zero is known to converge to the minimal Euclidean norm solution.
A spur of recent works (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06398.pdf">our paper</a> for a thorough review) has shown that for various other models an analogous result holds, i.e. gradient descent (when initialized appropriately) converges to solutions that minimize a certain (model-dependent) norm.
On the other hand, as discussed last year in posts by <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/06/03/trajectories/">Sanjeev</a> as well as <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/07/10/trajectories-linear-nets/">Wei and myself</a>, mounting theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that it may not be possible to generally describe implicit regularization in deep learning as minimization of norms.
Which is it then?</p>

<h2 id="a-standard-test-bed-matrix-factorization">A standard test-bed: matrix factorization</h2>

<p>A standard test-bed for theoretically studying implicit regularization in deep learning is <em>matrix factorization</em> $-$ matrix completion via linear neural networks.
Wei and I already presented this model in our <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/07/10/trajectories-linear-nets/">previous post</a>, but for self-containedness I will do so again here.</p>

<p>In <em>matrix completion</em>, we are given entries $\{ M_{i, j} : (i, j) \in \Omega \}$ of an unknown matrix $M$, and our job is to recover the remaining entries.
This can be seen as a supervised learning (regression) problem, where the training examples are the observed entries of $M$, the model is a matrix $W$ trained with the loss:
[
\qquad \ell(W) = \sum\nolimits_{(i, j) \in \Omega} (W_{i, j} - M_{i, j})^2 ~, \qquad\qquad \color{purple}{\text{(1)}}
]
and generalization corresponds to how similar $W$ is to $M$ in the unobserved locations.
In order for the problem to be well-posed, we have to assume something about $M$ (otherwise the unobserved locations can hold any values, and guaranteeing generalization is impossible).
The standard assumption (which has many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_completion#Applications">practical applications</a>) is that $M$ has low rank, meaning the goal is to find, among all global minima of the loss $\ell(W)$, one with minimal rank.
The classic algorithm for achieving this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Schatten_norms"><em>nuclear norm</em></a> minimization $-$ a convex program which, given enough observed entries and under certain technical assumptions (“incoherence”), recovers $M$ exactly (cf. <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/MatrixCompletion.pdf">Candes and Recht</a>).</p>

<p>Matrix factorization represents an alternative, deep learning approach to matrix completion.
The idea is to use a <em>linear neural network</em> (fully-connected neural network with linear activation), and optimize the resulting objective via gradient descent (GD).
More specifically, rather than working with the loss $\ell(W)$ directly, we choose a depth $L \in \mathbb{N}$, and run GD on the <em>overparameterized objective</em>:
[
\phi ( W_1 , W_2 , \ldots , W_L ) := \ell ( W_L W_{L - 1} \cdots W_1) ~. ~~\qquad~ \color{purple}{\text{(2)}}
]
Our solution to the matrix completion problem is then:
[
\qquad\qquad W_{L : 1} := W_L W_{L - 1} \cdots W_1 ~, \qquad\qquad\qquad \color{purple}{\text{(3)}}
] 
which we refer to as the <em>product matrix</em>.
While (for $L \geq 2$) it is possible to constrain the rank of $W_{L : 1}$ by limiting dimensions of the parameter matrices $\{ W_j \}_j$, from an implicit regularization standpoint, the case of interest is where rank is unconstrained (i.e. dimensions of $\{ W_j \}_j$ are large enough for $W_{L : 1}$ to take on any value).
In this case there is <em>no explicit regularization</em>, and the kind of solution GD will converge to is determined implicitly by the parameterization.
The degenerate case $L = 1$ is obviously uninteresting (nothing is learned in the unobserved locations), but what happens when depth is added ($L \geq 2$)?</p>

<p>In their <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/58191d2a914c6dae66371c9dcdc91b41-Paper.pdf">NeurIPS 2017 paper</a>, Gunasekar et al. showed empirically that with depth $L = 2$, if GD is run with small learning rate starting from near-zero initialization, then the implicit regularization in matrix factorization tends to produce low-rank solutions (yielding good generalization under the standard assumption of $M$ having low rank).
They conjectured that behind the scenes, what takes place is the classic nuclear norm minimization algorithm:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Conjecture 1 (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7195-implicit-regularization-in-matrix-factorization.pdf">Gunasekar et al. 2017</a>; informally stated):</strong>
GD (with small learning rate and near-zero initialization) over a depth $L = 2$ matrix factorization finds solution with minimum nuclear norm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, they were able to prove the conjecture in a certain restricted setting, and others (e.g. <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v75/li18a/li18a.pdf">Li et al. 2018</a>) later derived proofs for additional specific cases.</p>

<p>Two years after Conjecture 1 was made, in a <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c0c783b5fc0d7d808f1d14a6e9c8280d-Paper.pdf">NeurIPS 2019 paper</a> with Sanjeev, Wei and Yuping Luo, we presented empirical and theoretical evidence (see <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/07/10/trajectories-linear-nets/">previous blog post</a> for details) which led us to hypothesize the opposite, namely, that for any depth $L \geq 2$, the implicit regularization in matrix factorization can <em>not</em> be described as minimization of a norm:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Conjecture 2 (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c0c783b5fc0d7d808f1d14a6e9c8280d-Paper.pdf">Arora et al. 2019</a>; informally stated):</strong>
Given a depth $L \geq 2$ matrix factorization, for any norm $\|{\cdot}\|$, there exist matrix completion tasks on which GD (with small learning rate and near-zero initialization) finds solution that does not minimize $\|{\cdot}\|$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to technical subtleties in their formal statements, Conjectures 1 and 2 do not necessarily contradict.
However, they represent opposite views on the question of whether or not norms can explain implicit regularization in matrix factorization.
The goal of my recent work with <a href="https://noamrazin.github.io/">Noam</a> was to resolve this open question.</p>

<h2 id="implicit-regularization-can-drive-all-norms-to-infinity">Implicit regularization can drive all norms to infinity</h2>

<p>The main result in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06398.pdf">paper</a> is a proof that there exist simple matrix completion settings where the implicit regularization in matrix factorization drives <strong><em>all norms towards infinity</em></strong>.
By this we affirm Conjecture 2, and in fact go beyond it in the following sense:
<em>(i)</em> not only is each norm disqualified by some setting, but there are actually settings that jointly disqualify all norms;
and
<em>(ii)</em> not only are norms not necessarily minimized, but they can grow towards infinity.</p>

<p>The idea behind our analysis is remarkably simple.
We prove the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (informally stated):</strong>
During GD over matrix factorization (i.e. over $\phi ( W_1 , W_2 , \ldots , W_L)$ defined by Equations $\color{purple}{\text(1)}$ and $\color{purple}{\text(2)}$), if learning rate is sufficiently small and initialization sufficiently close to the origin, then the determinant of the product matrix $W_{1: L}$ (Equation $\color{purple}{\text(3)}$) doesn’t change sign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A corollary is that if $\det ( W_{L : 1} )$ is positive at initialization (an event whose probability is $0.5$ under any reasonable initialization scheme), then it stays that way throughout.
This seemingly benign observation has far-reaching implications.
As a simple example, consider the following matrix completion problem ($*$ here stands for unobserved entry):
[
\qquad\qquad
\begin{pmatrix}
* &amp; 1 \newline
1 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}
~. \qquad\qquad \color{purple}{\text{(4)}}
]
Every solution to this problem, i.e. every matrix that agrees with its observations, must have determinant $-1$.
It is therefore only logical to expect that when solving the problem using matrix factorization, the determinant of the product matrix $W_{L : 1}$ will converge to $-1$.
On the other hand, we know that (with probability $0.5$ over initialization) $\det ( W_{L : 1} )$ is always positive, so what is going on?
This conundrum can only mean one thing $-$ as $W_{L : 1}$ fits the observations, its value in the unobserved location (i.e. $(W_{L : 1})_{11}$) diverges to infinity, which implies that <em>all norms grow to infinity!</em></p>

<p>The above idea goes way beyond the simple example given in Equation $\color{purple}{\text(4)}$.
We use it to prove that in a wide array of matrix completion settings, the implicit regularization in matrix factorization leads norms to <em>increase</em>.
We also demonstrate it empirically, showing that in such settings unobserved entries grow during optimization.
Here’s the result of an experiment with the setting of Equation $\color{purple}{\text(4)}$:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<br/>
<i><b>Figure 1:</b> 
Solving matrix completion problem defined by Equation $\color{purple}{\text(4)}$ using matrix factorization leads absolute value of unobserved entry to increase (which in turn means norms increase) as loss decreases.
</i>
</div>

<h2 id="what-is-happening-then">What is happening then?</h2>

<p>If the implicit regularization in matrix factorization is not minimizing a norm, what is it doing?
While a complete theoretical characterization is still lacking, there are signs that a potentially useful interpretation is <strong><em>minimization of rank</em></strong>.
In our aforementioned <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c0c783b5fc0d7d808f1d14a6e9c8280d-Paper.pdf">NeurIPS 2019 paper</a>, we derived a dynamical characterization (and showed supporting experiments) suggesting that matrix factorization is implicitly conducting some kind of greedy low-rank search (see <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/07/10/trajectories-linear-nets/">previous blog post</a> for details).
This phenomenon actually facilitated a new autoencoding architecture suggested in a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00679.pdf">empirical paper</a> (to appear at NeurIPS 2020) by Yann LeCun and his team at Facebook AI.
Going back to the example in Equation $\color{purple}{\text(4)}$, notice that in this matrix completion problem all solutions have rank $2$, but it is possible to essentially minimize rank to $1$ by taking (absolute value of) unobserved entry to infinity.
As we’ve seen, this is exactly what the implicit regularization in matrix factorization does!</p>

<p>Intrigued by the rank minimization viewpoint, <a href="https://noamrazin.github.io/">Noam</a> and I empirically explored an extension of matrix factorization to <em>tensor factorization</em>.
Tensors can be thought of as high dimensional arrays, and they admit natural factorizations similarly to matrices (two dimensional arrays).
We found that on the task of <em>tensor completion</em> (defined analogously to matrix completion $-$ see Equation $\color{purple}{\text(1)}$ and surrounding text), GD on a tensor factorization tends to produce solutions with low rank, where rank is defined in the context of tensors (for a formal definition, and a general intro to tensors and their factorizations, see this <a href="http://www.kolda.net/publication/TensorReview.pdf">excellent survey</a> by Kolda and Bader).
That is, just like in matrix factorization, the implicit regularization in tensor factorization also strives to minimize rank!
Here’s a representative result from one of our experiments:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/reg_dl_not_norm_tf_exp.png" style="width: 700px;"/>
<br/>
<i><b>Figure 2:</b> 
In analogy with matrix factorization, the implicit regularization of tensor factorization (high dimensional extension) strives to find a low (tensor) rank solution.
Plots show reconstruction error and (tensor) rank of final solution on multiple tensor completion problems differing in the number of observations.
GD over tensor factorization is compared against "linear" method $-$ GD over direct parameterization of tensor initialized at zero (this is equivalent to fitting observations while placing zeros in unobserved locations).
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
</div>

<p>So what can tensor factorizations tell us about deep learning?
It turns out that, similarly to how matrix factorizations correspond to prediction of matrix entries via linear neural networks, tensor factorizations can be seen as prediction of tensor entries with a certain type of <em>non-linear</em> neural networks, named <em>convolutional arithmetic circuits</em> (in my PhD I worked a lot on analyzing the expressive power of these models, as well as showing that they work well in practice $-$ see this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02302.pdf">survey</a> for a soft overview).</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/reg_dl_not_norm_mf_lnn_tf_cac.png" style="width: 900px;"/>
<br/>
<i><b>Figure 3:</b> 
The equivalence between matrix factorizations and linear neural networks extends to an equivalence between tensor factorizations and a certain type of non-linear neural networks named convolutional arithmetic circuits.
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
</div>

<p>Analogously to how the input-output mapping of a linear neural network can be thought of as a matrix, that of a convolutional
arithmetic circuit is naturally represented by a tensor.
The experiment reported in Figure 2 (and similar ones presented in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06398.pdf">our paper</a>) thus provides a second example of a neural network architecture whose implicit regularization strives to lower a notion of rank for its input-output mapping.
This leads us to believe that implicit rank minimization may be a general phenomenon, and developing notions of rank for input-output mappings of contemporary models may be key to explaining generalization in deep learning.</p>

    <summary>Prediction algorithms assign numbers to individuals that are popularly understood as individual ``probabilities''---what is the probability of 5-year survival after cancer diagnosis?---and which increasingly form the basis for life-altering decisions. Drawing on an understanding of computational indistinguishability developed in complexity theory and cryptography, we introduce Outcome Indistinguishability. Predictors that are Outcome Indistinguishable yield a generative model for outcomes that cannot be efficiently refuted on the basis of the real-life observations produced by Nature.

We investigate a hierarchy of Outcome Indistinguishability definitions, whose stringency increases with the degree to which distinguishers may access the predictor in question. Our findings reveal that Outcome Indistinguishability behaves qualitatively differently than previously studied notions of indistinguishability. First, we provide constructions at all levels of the hierarchy. Then, leveraging recently-developed machinery for proving average-case fine-grained hardness, we obtain lower bounds on the complexity of the more stringent forms of Outcome Indistinguishability. This hardness result provides the first scientific grounds for the political argument that, when inspecting algorithmic risk prediction instruments, auditors should be granted oracle access to the algorithm, not simply historical predictions.</summary>

It only takes 2 or 3 minutes to fill out (I just did).<br/></li><li>Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy5fvwdw8x4">podcast</a> that I recently did with UT Austin undergraduate Dwarkesh Patel.  (As usual, I recommend 2x speed to compensate for my verbal tics.)<br/></li><li>Feel free to use the comments on this post to talk about recent progress in quantum computing or computational complexity!  Like, I dunno, a <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09495.pdf">(sub)exponential black-box speedup for the adiabatic algorithm</a>, or <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12277.pdf">anti-concentration for log-depth random quantum circuits</a>, or an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10908.pdf">improved shadow tomography procedure</a>, or a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03185.pdf">quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations</a>, or a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09093">barrier to proving strong 3-party parallel repetition</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11514.pdf">equivalence of one-way functions and time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10837">turning any hard-on-average NP problem into one that’s guaranteed to have solutions</a>.<br/></li><li>It’s funny how quantum computing, P vs. NP, and so forth can come to feel like just an utterly mundane day job, not something anyone outside a small circle could possibly want to talk about while the fate of civilization hangs in the balance.  Sometimes it takes my readers to remind me that not only are these topics what brought most of you here in the first place, they’re also awesome!  So, I’ll mark that down as one more thing to be thankful for.</li></ol>

<p/>



<p>A task force has been convened by CATCS to investigate possible<br/>approaches to modifying aspects of the TCS community, especially our<br/>publishing culture, to enhance connections with other areas of CS and<br/>be as welcoming as possible to a broad range of contributions within<br/>theory. This committee will collect and synthesize feedback from the<br/>community via the questionnaire on <a href="https://tinyurl.com/tcs-connections" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/tcs-connections</a> then make suggestions. <br/><br/>Since adjusting conference formats may help with this, we would like to get<br/>a general idea of community opinion on format choices. If you have<br/>some opinions you would like to share, please use this form. Though<br/>the questions below focus primarily on FOCS/STOC, we are welcome to<br/>receiving any and all suggestions that would make the TCS community as<br/>broad and well-connected to other areas of TCS as possible (see the<br/>last question of the survey).</p>



<p>Task force members:<br/>Ken Clarkson (IBM Research)<br/>Sandy Irani (UC Irvine)<br/>Bobby Kleinberg (Cornell)<br/>Adam Klivans (UT Austin)<br/>Ravi Kumar (Google)<br/>Jelani Nelson (UC Berkeley)<br/>Yuval Rabani (Hebrew University)</p></div>

<p>On November, 2020  we had a very nice open problem session in our weekly combinatorics seminar at HUJI.  So I thought to have a series of posts to describe you the problems presented there.  This is the first post in the series. Later I will add a link to the zoom recording of the session, and to a writeup of all the problems.</p>
<p>While talking on open problems let me mention that in connection with the <a href="http://umn.edu/~shopkins/OPAC">OPAC 2020 conference</a> (now delayed to May 2021),  a <a href="https://realopacblog.wordpress.com/">community blog</a> to discuss open problems in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>algebraic combinatorics</strong></span> was created. Everybody is invited to check out the problems posted there, to subscribe, and to contribute their own problems. And, of course, to solve the problems! The list of problems so far is impressive.</p>
<h2>Nati’s problem</h2>
<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Given a 2-manifold <img alt="M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="M"/> what is the the number of 2-faces for a 2-dimensional simplicial complex S on n vertices that guarantee that S contains a triangulation of M?</p>
<p>The case that <img alt="M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="M"/> is a triangulation of a two dimensional sphere goes back to a theorem of Brown, Erdos and Sos. They proved that the answer is <img alt="Cn^{5/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Cn%5E%7B5%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="Cn^{5/2}"/>. Nati proved that the lower bound applies for every 2-manifold <img alt="M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="M"/>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> Given a k-complex S, how many facets can a  k-complex on n vertices have if it contains no topological copy of S? (Topological copy = homeomorphic image)</p>
<p>Nati mentioned some further background and <strong>recent progress</strong> regarding these problems and I will mention them in a separate post.</p>
<h2>“High dimensional combinatorics”</h2>
<p>Problems 1 and 2 are parts of “Linial’s programme” of studying systematically “high dimensional combinatorics”.  Here are links to a few papers, slides of talks and videotaped talks. Among the highlights of this theory are the study, starting with a paper by Linial and Roy Meshulam of the Erdos-Renyi model for simplicial complexes (which is closely related to high dimensional expanders), the study of high dimensional permutations, and high dimensional tournaments.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Galileo Galileo has many self-appointed intellectual heirs these days. Whether it’s a claim that the <a href="https://twitter.com/KlasfeldReports/status/1331275065061761025?s=20">election has been stolen</a>, that <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/04/19/fatal-flaws-in-stanford-study-of-coronavirus-prevalence/">COVID-19 is less fatal than the flu</a>, that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/24/opinions/climate-apocalypse-talking-to-skeptics-sutter-kirk/index.html">climate change</a> or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/11/darwin-day/">evolution </a>are hoaxes, or that <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm">P=NP</a>, we keep hearing from people considering themselves as bold truth-tellers railing against conventional wisdom. We are encouraged to “teach the debate” and that if only paid attention, we will see that their Tweet, declaration, or arxiv paper contains an irrefutable proof of their assertions.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/26/ted-cruz-invokes-galileo-to-defend-his-climate-skepticism-and-historians-arent-happy/">words of Ted Cruz</a>, <em>“They brand you a heretic. Today, the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers. It used to be [that] it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier”</em>. </p>



<p>Of course by Galileo’s time it was well known that the earth was spherical, and Magellan circumnavigated the earth more than 40 years before Galileo was born. But putting aside Cruz’s confusion of flat earth and geocentrism, the story of heliocentric theory is not one  of an outsider railing against the scientific mainstream. Galileo himself was a chaired professor of mathematics at the University of Padua, and later philosopher and mathematician to the grand duke of Tuscany. He was very much part of the scientific establishment of his time. Moreover, though Galileo did provide important evidence for heliocentrism, he was not the only one doing so. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/galileo-kepler-iya/">Kepler</a> found a heliocentric model with elliptical orbits that actually made correct predictions, and, though it took a decade or so, Kepler’s book eventually became the standard textbook for astronomy.</p>



<p>My point in this post is not to rehash the history of heliocentrism or Galileo but rather to call out a misconception which, to use Sean Carrol’s phrasing, amounts to valorization of puzzle-solving over wisdom.</p>

<p>It is tempting to think that an argument, regardless whether it comes from an expert or a random person on Twitter, can be presented in a self-contained way and judged on its merits. However, this is not how things work in any interesting setting. Even in the case of a purported P vs NP proof, there is background knowledge on computational complexity without which it would be hard to spot holes in the argument. This is doubly so for any claim involving empirical facts, whether it’s about elections, infections, climate etc. It is not possible to evaluate such claims without context, and to get this context you need to turn to the experts that have studied the topic.</p>



<p>I have written before in <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/04/04/in-defense-of-expertise/">defense of expertise</a> (see also <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/04/09/experts-shmexperts/">here</a>) but Carroll puts it very well. Another way to say it is that the operational interpretation of the common refrain</p>



<p><em>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence </em></p>



<p>is</p>



<p><em>Treat claims conforming to conventional wisdom with charity, and claims disputing it with skepticism.</em></p>



<p>(There is a question of how to define “conventional wisdom” but interestingly there is usually agreement in practice by both sides. Most “deniers” of various sorts are proud of going against conventional wisdom, but don’t acknowledge that this means they are more likely to be wrong.)</p>



<p>As an example, even if someone has expertise in analytic number theory, and so presumably has plenty of so-called “puzzle-solving intelligence”, that doesn’t mean that they can evaluate <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/11/22/williams-math-professor-investigating-voter-fraud-in-pennsylvania-finds-no-evidence/">a statistical claim</a> on election fraud and their analysis should be considered <a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/elections/federal-election-commission-chairman-trump-campaign-bringing-legitimate">evidence</a> (apparently at this point the number theorist himself  <a href="https://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/local/williams-prof-disavows-own-finding-of-mishandled-gop-ballots/article_9cfd4228-2e03-11eb-b2ac-bb9c8b2bfa7f.html">agrees</a>). We can try to read and debunk what they wrote, or we can assume that if there was evidence for large-scale fraud, then the president of the United States and his well-funded campaign would have managed to find actual statisticians and experts on election to make the case.</p>



<p>There can be debate if Trump’s attempt to overthrow the election should be considered as dangerous or merely absurd, but the constant attacks on the very notions of truth, science, and expertise are causing far-reaching harm. </p>



<p>(H/T:<a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5106"> Scott Aaronson</a>, who makes a similar point around the election conspiracies.)</p></div>

<p/>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> we are organizing a new mentorship program for women in machine learning. Please consider applying as a mentor, mentee, or both at <a href="https://www.wiml-t.org/mentoring-program">https://www.wiml-t.org/mentoring-program</a>. </p>



<h1>What is WIML-T?</h1>



<p><a href="https://wimlworkshop.org/">Women in machine learning </a>(or WiML for short) was established more than ten years ago, and its main goals are to <strong>1.</strong> Increase the number of women in machine learning <strong>2.</strong> Help women in machine learning succeed professionally <strong>3. </strong>Increase the impact of women in machine learning in the community. Towards this goal, they create different opportunities for women to showcase their work. Chief among them is the annual Women in Machine Learning (WiML) Workshop, typically co-located with NeurIPS, which presents women’s cutting-edge research. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.wiml-t.org/home">Women in machine learning theory</a> (or WiML-T for short) shares the same goals as WiML but focuses on the smaller learning theory community. The vision of WiML-T is to give visibility and legitimacy to under-represented groups in learning theory, to create stronger bonds within the community and beyond, and to provide support and advice. As part of this vision, we have decided to facilitate a mentoring program that will connect women and non-binary researchers who are newer to learning theory with more experienced mentors.  </p>



<h1>Why mentorship?</h1>



<p>Mentoring programs have been shown to greatly help underrepresented communities develop [1]. More resources on mentoring can be found on the website of Stanford’s Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab and on <a href="http://www.wiml-t.org">our website</a>. Mentoring creates strong bonds of trust within the community, it helps mentees find career advice and connections, and it helps mentors grow their leadership skills while keeping in touch with the newcomers of the community.  We hope that creating a world-wide program will also help reduce inequality between less privileged areas and the most famous institutions. Indeed, it is a well-known fact that the more competitive a career path, the less diverse it is, due in part to network effects from which under-represented groups are excluded. We believe that uniting individuals from these groups (i.e. women, non-binary people, persons of color and other minorities) will help reduce these effects and contribute to finding solutions to the community’s problems. </p>



<p><strong>Why be a mentor?  </strong></p>



<p>Remember the beginning of your research journey, with all the difficulties, uncertainties, and unanswered questions? This is your chance to give all the advice you wish you got, and make an impact on a future colleague. As a mentor you will be a role model and help the young generation of researchers in learning theory. You will help them develop and enhance their careers by giving them the support they need. Need more reasons to mentor? It will grow your leadership skills, self-confidence, communication skills, and you will feel happier after you help others. </p>



<p><strong>Who can be a mentor?</strong> </p>



<p>Nearly everyone who has some experience in academia or industry can be a mentor. It can be interesting for an undergrad student to receive advice from senior PhD students or postdocs who have recently had to reflect about career decisions and can share knowledge about their work environment. We indeed expect the most senior researchers to apply as mentors, but we would also like to encourage PhDs and postdocs to consider mentoring (while possibly having a mentor as well!).    </p>



<p><strong>Can men mentor? </strong></p>



<p>We thank everyone who wants to help the community!  </p>



<p>We will prioritize women mentors as they can give their unique perspective, BUT, we acknowledge that there might be a limited number of mentors. To mitigate this issue, we will be happy to pair male mentors provided the mentee agrees.</p>



<p><strong>Why be a mentee?</strong>   </p>



<p>Having a mentor is one of the best ways to get external career advice, to get some feedback from someone with a possibly similar background. Managing to find one’s way into academia or science is not easy. It can be even harder for under-represented groups who may lack role models within their institution, or who may not connect with common advice that implicitly assumes or relies on some class privilege. Having a mentor can help you navigate professional and personal issues that men may not always have. It is also a way to get connected to other members of the community, or have second opinions on research strategies.   </p>



<h1>Timeline</h1>



<ul><li>The program launched on October 29 2020 and will run on a continuous basis.</li><li>We will start with pairings of mentors and mentees in December 2020. This process can take a few months.  </li><li>Frequency of the meetings: totally depends on the mentor and mentee. It can be either weekly meetings or once every two months or anything in between. </li><li>Duration of the mentorship: totally depends on the mentor and mentee. It can be a few months, a year, or even more. </li></ul>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on <strong>Friday, Dec 04</strong>th at <strong>10:00 AM Pacific Time</strong> (13:00 Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC, 23:30 Indian Time).  <strong>Adam Smith</strong> from <strong>Boston University</strong> will speak about “<strong>When is Memorization of Irrelevant Training Data Necessary for High-Accuracy Learning?</strong>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Modern machine learning models are complex, and frequently encode surprising amounts of information about individual inputs. In extreme cases, complex models appear to memorize entire input examples, including seemingly irrelevant information (social security numbers from text, for example). In this paper, we aim to understand whether this sort of memorization is necessary for accurate learning. We describe natural prediction problems in which every sufficiently accurate training algorithm must encode, in the prediction model, essentially all the information about a large subset of its training examples. This remains true even when the examples are high-dimensional and have entropy much higher than the sample size, and even when most of that information is ultimately irrelevant to the task at hand. Further, our results do not depend on the training algorithm or the class of models used for learning.</p>



<p>Our problems are simple and fairly natural variants of the next-symbol prediction and the cluster labeling tasks. These tasks can be seen as abstractions of image- and text-related prediction problems. To establish our results, we reduce from a family of one-way communication problems for which we prove new information complexity lower bounds.</p>

    <title>TR20-175 |  Fourier conjectures, correlation bounds, and Majority | 

	Emanuele Viola</title>
    <summary>Recently several conjectures were made regarding the Fourier spectrum of low-degree polynomials. We show that these conjectures imply new correlation bounds for functions related to Majority. Then we prove several new results on correlation bounds which aim to, but don't, resolve the conjectures. In particular, we prove several new results on Majority which are of independent interest and complement Smolensky's classic result.</summary>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">For the past month, I’ve been reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to my 7-year-old daughter Lily. Is she too young for it?

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>For the past month, I’ve been reading <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> to my 7-year-old daughter Lily.  Is she too young for it?  Is there a danger that she’ll slip up and say the n-word in school?  I guess so, maybe.  But I found it worthwhile just for the understanding that lit up her face when she realized what it meant that Huck would help Jim escape slavery even though Huck really, genuinely believed that he’d burn in hell for it.</p>



<p><em>Huck Finn</em> has been one of my favorite books since I was just slightly older than Lily.  It’s the greatest statement by one of history’s greatest writers about human stupidity and gullibility and evil and greed, but also about the power of seeing what’s right in front of your nose to counteract those forces.  (It’s also a go-to source for details of 19<sup>th</sup>-century river navigation.)  It rocks.</p>



<p>The other day, after we finished a chapter, I asked Lily whether she thought that injustice against Black people in America ended with the abolition of slavery.  No, she replied.  I asked: how much longer did it continue for?  She said she didn’t know.  So I said: if I told you that once, people in charge of an American election tried to throw away millions of votes that came from places where Black people lived—supposedly because some numbers didn’t exactly add up, except they didn’t care about similar numbers not adding up in places where White people lived—how long ago would she guess that happened?  100 years ago?  50 years?  She didn’t know.  So I showed her the news from the last hour.</p>



<p>These past few weeks, my comment queue has filled with missives, most of which I’ve declined to publish, about the giant conspiracy involving George Soros and Venezuela and dead people, which fabricated the overwhelmingly Democratic votes from overwhelmingly Democratic cities like Philadelphia and Milwaukee and Detroit (though for some reason, they weren’t <em>quite</em> as overwhelmingly Democratic as in other recent elections), while for some reason declining to help Democrats in downballot races.  Always, these commenters confidently insist, <em>I’m</em> the Pravda-reading brainwashed dupe, <em>I’m</em> the unreasonable one, if I don’t accept this.</p>



<p>This is the literal meaning of “gaslighting”: the intentional construction of an alternate reality so insistently as to make the sane doubt their sanity.  It occurred to me: <em>Huck Finn</em> could be read as an extended fable about gaslighting.  The Grangerfords make their deadly feud with the Shepherdsons seem normal and natural.  The fraudulent King and Duke make Huck salute them as royalty.  Tom convinces Huck that the former’s harebrained schemes for freeing Jim are just the way it’s done, and Huck is an idiot for preferring the simplistic approach of just freeing him.  And of course, the entire culture gaslights Huck that good is evil and evil is good.  Huck doesn’t fight the gaslighting as hard as we’d like him to, but he develops as a character to the extent he does.</p>



<p>Today, the Confederacy—which, as we’ve learned the past five years, never died, and is as alive and angry now as it was in Twain’s time—is trying to win by gaslighting what it couldn’t win at Antietam and Gettysburg and Vicksburg.  It’s betting that if it just insists, adamantly enough, that someone who lost an election by hundreds of thousands of votes spread across multiple states actually won the election, then it can bend the universe to its will.</p>



<p>Glued to the news, listening to Giuliani and McEnany and so on, reading the Trump campaign’s legal briefs, I keep asking myself one question: <em>do they actually believe this shit?</em>  Some of the only insight I got about that question came from a <a href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/reflections-on-the-late-election">long piece</a> by Curtis Yarvin a.k.a. Mencius Moldbug, who’s been called one of the leading thinkers of neoreaction and who sometimes responds to this blog.  Esoterically, Yarvin says that he actually <em>prefers</em> a Biden victory, but only because Trump has proven himself unworthy by submitting himself to nerdy electoral rules rather than simply seizing power.  (If that’s not <em>quite</em> what Yarvin meant—well, I’m about as competent to render his irony-soaked meanings in plain language as I’d be to render Heidegger or Judith Butler!)</p>



<p>As for whether the election was “fraudulent,” here’s Yarvin’s key passage:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The fundamental purpose of a democratic election is to test the strength of the sides in a civil conflict, without anyone actually getting hurt. The majority wins because the strongest side would win … But this guess is much better if it actually measures humans who are both willing and able to walk down the street and show up. Anyone who cannot show up at the booth is unlikely to show up for the civil war. This is one of many reasons that an in-person election is a more <em>accurate</em> election. (If voters could be qualified by <em>physique</em>, it would be even more accurate) … My sense is that in many urban communities, voting by proxy in some sense is the norm. The people whose names are on the ballots really exist; and almost all of them actually did support China Joe. Or at least, preferred him. The extent to which they perform any tangible political action, including physically going to the booth, is very low; so is their engagement with the political system. They do not watch much CNN. The demand for records of their engagement is very high, because each such datum cancels out some huge, heavily-armed redneck with a bass boat. This is why, in the data, these cities look politics-obsessed, but photos of the polling places look empty. Most votes from these communities are in some sense “organized” … Whether or not such a design constitutes “fraud” is the judge’s <em>de gustibus</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Did you catch that?  Somehow, Yarvin manages to insinuate that votes for Biden are plausibly fraudulent and plausibly shouldn’t count—at least <em>if</em> they were cast by mail, in “many urban communities” (which ones?), during a pandemic—even as Yarvin glaincingly acknowledges that the votes in question actually exist and are actually associated with Biden-preferring legal voters.  This is gaslighting in pure, abstract form, unalloyed with the laughable claims about Hugo Chávez or Dominion Voting Systems.</p>



<p>What I find terrifying about gaslighting is that it’s so <em>effective</em>.  In response to this post, I’ll again get long, erudite comments making the case that up is down, turkeys are mammals, and Trump won in a landslide.  And simply to <em>read</em> and <em>understand</em> those comments, some part of me will need to entertain the idea that they might be right.  Much like with Bigfoot theories, this will be purely a function of the effort the writers put in, not of any merit to the thesis.</p>



<p>And there’s a second thing I find terrifying about gaslighting.  Namely:<strong> it turns me into an ally of the SneerClubbers.</strong>  Like them, I feel barely any space left for rational discussion or argument.  Like them, I find it difficult to think of an appropriate response to Trumpian conspiracy theorists except to ridicule them, shame them as racists, and try to mute their influence.  Notably, public shaming (“[t]he Trump stain, the stain of racism that you, William Hartmann and Monica Palmer, have covered yourself in, is going to follow you throughout history”) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebGOe2zHbLc">seems to have actually worked last week</a> to get the Wayne County Board of Canvassers to back down and certify the votes from Detroit.  So why not try more of it?</p>



<p>Of course, even if I agree with the wokeists that there’s a line beyond which rational discussion can’t reach, I radically disagree with them about the line’s <em>whereabouts</em>.  Here, for example, I try to draw mine generously enough to include any Republicans willing to stand up, however feebly, against the Trump cult, whereas the wokeists draw their line so narrowly as to exclude most <em>Democrats</em> (!).</p>



<p>There’s a more fundamental difference as well: the wokeists define their worldview in opposition to the patriarchy, the white male power structure, or whatever else is preventing utopia.  I, taking inspiration from Huck, define my moral worldview in opposition to gaslighting itself, whatever its source, and in favor of acknowledging obvious realities (<em>especially</em> realities about any harm we might be causing others).  Thus, it’s not just that I see no tension between opposing the excesses of the woke and opposing Trump’s attempted <em>putsch</em>—rather, it’s that my opposition to both comes from exactly the same source.  It’s a source that, at least in me, often runs dry of courage, but I’ve found <em>Huck Finn</em> to be helpful in replenishing it, and for that I’m grateful.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Endnote:</span></strong> There are, of course, many <em>actual</em> security problems with the way we vote in the US, and there are computer scientists who’ve studied those problems for decades, rather than suddenly getting selectively interested in November 2020.  If you’re interested, see <a href="https://josephhall.org/papers/Experts-Statement-on-the-US-2020-General-Election-16NOV2020-1057.pdf">this letter</a> (“Scientists say no credible evidence of computer fraud in the 2020 election outcome, but policymakers must work with experts to improve confidence”), which was signed by 59 of the leading figures in computer security, including Ron Rivest, Bruce Schneier, Hovav Shacham, Dan Wallach, Ed Felten, David Dill, and my childhood best friend Alex Halderman.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> I just noticed <a href="https://twitter.com/seanmcarroll/status/1330573317627998208">this Twitter thread</a> by friend-of-the-blog Sean Carroll, which says a lot of what I was trying to say here.</p></div>

    <title>Fun with birthdays, inspired by Nov 20</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> On Nov 20, 2020  the Google Doodle was of Benoit Mandelbrot for his 96th birthday. Why have a Doodle on his 96th bday? Anyway, the Doodle is <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/benoit-mandelbrots-96th-birthday">here</a>.  </p><p>On Nov 20, 2020 I read that Joe Biden turned 78. Why no Google Doodle of him? Maybe when he's 96. </p><p>This got me thinking of who else might have a Nov 20 birthday. I found the following (`found' is not quite right as I will explain later).</p><p>In order of age. </p><p>Benoit Mandelbrot: Dead at 85, would have been 96</p><p>Bobby Kennedy: Dead at 43, would have been 95.</p><p>Sergei Novikov: 82 years old. (Won Fields Medal in 1970 and did work on Solitons)</p><p>Dick Smothers: 80 years old (Tommy Smothers is not his twin, Tommy  is 3 years older) </p><p>Joe Biden, 78 years old (in most crowds he would be an old-timer, but in this crowd he is the baby of the bunch- though there is a reason for that as you will see later)</p><p>There are more Nov 20 famous people (famous to someone- I have not heard of most of them) <a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/november20.html">here</a></p><p>Some thoughts on all of this trivia</p><p>1) I keep a list of famous (to me) people over 80 (though if I look someone up who is not quite 80 I may put him on the list anyway, as is the case for Biden and Trump) so if they die I won't be one of those people saying `<i>I thought they were already dead</i>'.  I then began putting people on it who were  already dead so I could find matching bdays. Hence it was easy to find Nov 20 birthdays of people over 80, and one under. </p><p>2) Mandelbrot is more famous than Novikov since Mandelbrot has those pretty pictures. This is not a criticism of his work. Is it possible to make people who do hard and abstract math more in the public eye? Probably not. </p><p>3) There is an awesome song about the Mandelbrot set (though some of the comments on the you tube video say its the Julia Set, but HEY- if they have math in a song, I am happy and don't get too fussy about how accurate it is- though I would understand if Julia fans are annoyed). The song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIlwFpz9s_I">here</a>. It has 464 likes and 41 dislikes. That always puzzled me- why does it have <i>any</i> dislikes? I've seen really awesome songs still have some dislikes. Well, as Rick Nelson sings in Garden Party (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAHR7_VZdRw">here</a>) ,<i>you</i> <i>can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself.</i> He got 25,000 likes and 702 dislikes. An awesome ratio, but why are there any dislikes? </p><p>4) I don't think Novikov will have a song about his work anytime soon.</p><p>5) Joe Biden has had some novelty songs about him in the past, and will do have more in the future once he is the Whitehouse. (Is the statement `Joe Biden is the president-elect' biased?)</p><p>6) I like the variety of the Nov 20 birthdays: two math, two politics, one entertainment. </p><p>7) I originally thought Nov 20 is NOT special and that most days would have around 5 bdays in my files. but actually no- I did a spot check of Nov 21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 and they are all either 0,1, or 2 bdays. Prob not significant since this is just my small file. OR people avoid having babies close to thanksgiving (not sure of that one, but people DO avoid Feb 29 and Dec 25). </p><p>8) Of more interest are people born the same DAY and YEAR. I have a few of those, but I will point out one relevant to our field:</p><p>Albert Meyer and Art Garfunkel are same DAY and same YEAR.</p><p>(ADDED LATER: Art Garfunekl got a BA in Art History and then an MA in Math Eduacation)</p><p>Most famous SAME DAY and SAME YEAR of all time? I would guess</p><p>Abe Lincoln and Charles Darwin. <br/><br/></p><p>Second place</p><p> Margaret Thatcher and Lenny Bruce.</p><p> (I really doubt that's second place) </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This post is a follow-up on some somewhat off-hand comments that I made <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/">earlier</a> regarding the notion of truth in a “proof-based” discipline such as pure mathematics or theoretical computer science. Since the former is easier to circumscribe and also has a larger literature available on it, for the purposes of the post I will discuss my emerging take on truth in mathematics; what I say applies to TCS as well. (I wasn’t able to find satisfactory writings on the practice of computer science, even more broadly interpreted than just “theory”; any pointers on this are very welcome.) I obviously don’t claim any originality here; I suspect that to some the points I make might be interesting while to others they could feel passé–in the latter case, please help me make progress in the comments!</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/circle.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1273" height="272" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/circle.jpg?w=762" width="261"/></a>A <em>circle</em> is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the figure equal one another. (Euclid, Elements, Book I, Definition 15.)</figure></div>



<p>The question is more interesting than it may seem. First, let’s set aside the Platonician answer that mathematics is about proving statements that apply to abstract objects. None of this makes sense: there is no such thing as an abstract object (What is an “abstract circle?” Euclid’s <em>definition</em> of an abstract circle exists, but that definition has nothing abstract; it is plain English—or well, Greek, which is no better). Neither is there anything fundamentally “true” about the statements that mathematicians make about these objects. This last point is made clear in Voevodsky’s retelling of the story that brought him to start his research program on univalent foundations: see in particular the paragraph starting with “The primary challenge that needed to be addressed” <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2014/voevodsky-origins">here</a>. While a subset of mathematicians has been carefully examining the logical foundations of mathematics and pursuing a program of formalizing these foundations with the goal of automating verification, two facts are historically evident: (1) this formalization has always come <em>after</em> the fact, i.e. first the theorem is proven, and second only is there some attempt at modifying the format of the “proof” so as to reach some abstract “higher standard”; (2) what the higher standard exactly is is a moving target. In other words, mathematicians do whatever it is that they do <em>first</em>, and only <em>after</em> that does some subset of them look back on what has been done and make an attempt to reformulate it in a way that seems more “rigorous” by the standards of the day. And even once this process has been completed (or rather, iterated over a few times), no absolute truth has been obtained; merely, one has gained higher confidence that some set of formal rules can be applied in a certain order to derive one statement for another. In summary, the logical answer “I define as true any statement that can be derived by said rules starting from said axioms” will not satisfy us. (My point is not to criticize this enterprise; only to point that this is not what mathematics is about. I don’t expect any mathematician would disagree.)</p>



<p>Once this point has been cleared we have opened up the possibility for a much richer interpretation of what mathematics is about, what it is that mathematicians do, and what is so special about the role played by the notion of truth in this enterprise.</p>



<h2>The Greeks</h2>



<p>Mathematicians have been around since Greek antiquity. I highly recommend the wonderful book <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511543296">The Shaping of Deduction in Greek Mathematics</a> by Reviel Netz, a historian at Stanford. The book provides a fantastic historical introduction to the birth of modern mathematics, as practiced in the Western world. In this book Netz gives a detailed account of the practice of Greek mathematics that is based on a sometimes almost comical literal reading of the original texts. Netz is not a mathematician, and he takes the Greek writings at face value, without preconceptions as to any deeper meaning, mathematical or otherwise. To see how fantastic an enterprise this might be I highly recommend taking the time to read through a few paragraphs of Euclid’s elements, see e.g. <a href="https://www.claymath.org/library/historical/euclid/index.html">here</a>. (I wasn’t able to find an online version that has clear figures; Netz’ book contains many reproductions and he spends a great deal of time examining their significance as a companion to the text.) Wait, and they called this a <em>proof</em>? </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/phil-2017-0007_05.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1276" height="241" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/phil-2017-0007_05.jpg?w=1024" width="320"/></a>Netz places a particular emphasis on the role of lettered diagrams such as this one in Greek mathematicians’ proofs. This one is taken from Apollonius, as reproduced in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/phil-2017-0007">this book</a>.</figure></div>



<p>What I find most amazing about Netz’ work is that his book makes it absolutely clear that what Greek mathematics did is invent a very special world, with its own set of rules and specifications as to how things should be presented, what counts as valid and what does not, etc; most importantly this set of rules and specifications is absolutely <em>arbitrary</em>. There is nothing <em>universally</em> true about any of the statements made in Euclid’s book ; what there is however, and which is just as important, is a form of <em>self-consistent</em>, <em>self-perpetuating</em> consistency. This is the Greek mathematician’s most important discovery, and most enduring legacy: a system of thought, based on the use of formal rules, such that users of that system of thought can easily and unequivocally agree on the same statements. Netz contrasts this with the political discourse that the Greeks were so famously fond of; while in rhetoric endless arguments can be made in favor or against any given statement, in mathematics once an argument has been made there is no discussing it; either the argument is correct and accepted by all or it is flawed and all will agree on the presence of a flaw. By saying that mathematics does not establish universal truths we do not take away any of the strength of its evident success as a system of thought. </p>



<p>I insist that in the previous sentence by “mathematics” I mean “Greek mathematics.” There is nothing universal about the formal “proof system” used by the Greeks, and in fact that system is arguably quite different from the one used today (contrast a proof in Euclid’s Elements from one in e.g. Kerodon (see figure below); clearly either school would reject the other’s papers!). There is nothing absolutely perfect or even fool-proof about it either; when I write that “either the argument is correct or it is flawed” I do not dismiss the existence of a substantial grey zone in which there might be, and generally is, discussion. (Netz in his presentation makes it plainly obvious that Greek proofs had many “gaps” and that completely arbitrary choices are made as to what is valid and what is not.) The point is that this grey zone is by orders of magnitude smaller than in other disciplines, and this is what makes mathematics special.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/diagram.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1278" height="118" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/diagram.jpg?w=943" width="470"/></a>A lettered diagram taken from the proof of Lemma 3.5.3.11 in <a href="https://kerodon.net/">Kerodon</a>.</figure></div>



<p>Greek mathematics has its limitations. In particular, it seems like they were not able to expand their explorations much beyond geometry; possibly because they did not have a formal way of re-using proofs. Indeed, only propositions from Euclid’s elements were part of the general corpus of “truths” that could be used without justification; any other proof could only appeal to either a statement from the Elements or a statement proved within the same text (as opposed to a statement made by another mathematician). The current system has a much higher level of re-usability, allowing it to much deeper. It is possible that current attempt at formalization will provide yet another layer to this by enabling re-using statements without the mathematician herself even being cognizant of the statement that is being re-used (e.g. the proof assistant would figure out that there is some theorem somewhere that could be useful). </p>



<h2>The moderns</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/qkd.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1280" height="420" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/qkd.jpg?w=831" width="382"/></a>A lettered diagram taken from the proof of security of quantum key distribution in Renner’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0512258">Ph.D. thesis</a>.</figure></div>



<p>Once one has taken this somewhat distanced look at the practice of Greek mathematicians it becomes clear that there is no reason for contemporary practice to escape similar distanciation. As arbitrary as the rules that govern the former might seem now, just as arbitrary our own rules will seem later. The observation prompts us to re-evaluate the notion of proof and truth as follows: <em>The goal of the mathematical proof is to convince the mathematician; a statement is true whenever the mathematician is convinced.</em> I emphasize that the mathematician in this sentence is a human being, not a machine. <br/><br/>Propositions in Euclid’s elements are true because Euclid’s text convinced all other Greek mathematicians that they were true; the same hold of Voevodsky’s univalent foundations. To speak about my personal experience, the point was carried home vividly about a decade ago at the end of an entire afternoon spent sitting by the sea nearby Marseille in the South of France together with an illustrious French operator algebraist. For the whole afternoon I had been trying to explain, of all things, the Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality formulated as a nonlocal game—an elementary construction on which half of my research is based (see <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/tsirelsons-bound/">this post</a> for example, although we  certainly didn’t get that far). To no avail! Alice, Bob, games, the mathematician would have none of it. How could it be so hard? The message I was trying to carry across is bread and butter to quantum information theorists; moreover the language of functional analysis was not foreign to me either and so I believed I ought to have more than it should take to make the explanations clear; in my mind I had a clear theorem, together with an airtight proof, to communicate. Not so: I ended the afternoon defeated, and the point hammered in: as much as we may think that our language is formal, our reasoning rational, our goals clear, as soon as we step out of our self-referential cocoon we have to face the evidence: not so; there is nothing clear, formal, self-evident, in the mathematical truths we take as such. (If you’re not convinced yet, look at the pictures.)</p>



<p>After having read through the viewpoint of a historian on Greek mathematics, it is interesting to come back to the present and read up on the modern mathematician’s own account of their practice. Having delighted in Hardy’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology">A Mathematician’s Apology</a> in my student years I was naturally attracted to Harris’ explicitly referential book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691154237/mathematics-without-apologies">Mathematics Without Apologies</a>. The book aims to provide a personal answer to precisely the same question as Netz’ (“What do pure mathematicians do, and why do they do it?”—first line on back cover), with the essential difference that Harris’ book is written by a contemporary mathematician about the practice of modern mathematics. The perspective taken is thus very different: Harris does not waste a drop of ink to examine the material products of modern mathematics (e.g. printed articles), which naturally from his point of view do not have the least interest besides their mathematical significance; nor does he question the formal system that enables mathematics (he does discuss foundation issues, but these are themselves part of the formal system). </p>



<p>Harris delights in telling us stories about the practice of mathematics from the inside: the way one acquires prestige (he calls it “charisma”), how mathematicians perceive when a mathematical statement is interesting, what drives a mathematician to work on one problem or another, the influence of large research programs such as the Langlands program, etc. Just as Netz, Harris agrees that the proof itself, while an important product of the mathematician’s practice, is not a goal in itself. The goal is to introduce new objects, find relations between them, and build structures that support this exploration (Harris quotes extensively from Grothendieck, a builder of structures if there is any). Crucially the mathematician’s goal is not at all to find <em>truth</em>: her goal is to find <em>beauty</em>. Harris (un-apologetically!) defends the mathematician’s position as playing a privileged and essential role in our (Western) society: mathematics is the rare, if not unique, discipline where thought is valued <em>for itself</em>: not for its consequences or potential applications, nor even for some kind of universal validity or truth that it might reach — for itself, the sheer beauty of it. No apologies. While one might think that the arts are in a similar position, Harris points out that in contemporary discussions about art the notion of beauty has all but disappeared; instead, one talks of society, ecology, politics—all of this is good and important, but it is not about beauty. Mathematics is about exploring the beauty of human thought. This exploration is carried out within the very special, narrow and arbitrary corner that mathematical practice has delineated for itself since the Greeks got us started. And yet does not matter that it is narrow and arbitrary; what matters is that it is purely and uniquely human.</p>



<p>I don’t have a conclusion to give to this post. I suppose it is the kind of digression that one is naturally inclined to make while on <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/announcing-a-short-course-in-paris/">sabbatical</a>. (I was delighted to see Harris reference his time at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris extensively and spend multiple pages gossiping about Ed Frenkel, then a holder of the same FSMP chair I am now occupying.) Certainly it helps to gain a sense of what it is that one is doing. While these explorations destroyed a number of simple comforting myths about what it is that I do every day, in the end I find the void that lies beneath the surface much more appealing; I feel privileged and comforted in my desire to make use of that privilege.</p>



<h2>Post-scriptum</h2>



<p>In addition to the two books referenced in the post there are a couple articles that I found helpful. I am listing them here because I found such writings non-trivial to come by, and so they might be helpful to anyone interested in the topic. I welcome additional references. </p>



<ul><li>Barton, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11858-999-0009-7">Ethnomathematics and Philosophy</a>. This is Barton’s Ph.D. thesis, in which he studies the social emergence of mathematics not as inevitable, but as cultural, yet without negating what is so special about it. .</li><li>Wallet and Neuwirth, <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01943079/">Enquete sur les modes d’existence des etres mathematiques</a> (unfortunately in French only it seems). The authors build on Netz’ work and others to examine the notion of mathematical proof within Latour’s framework of “modes of existence,” which Latour mostly applied to experimental sciences. </li></ul></div>
