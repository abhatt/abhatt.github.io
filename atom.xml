    <title>TR21-139 |  Punctured Large Distance Codes, and Many Reed-Solomon Codes, Achieve List-Decoding Capacity | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Jonathan Mosheiff</title>
    <summary>We prove the existence of Reed-Solomon codes of any desired rate $R \in (0,1)$ that are combinatorially list-decodable up to a radius approaching  $1-R$, which is the information-theoretic limit. This is established by starting with the full-length $[q,k]_q$ Reed-Solomon code over a field $\mathbb{F}_q$ that is polynomially larger than the desired dimension $k$, and "puncturing" it by including $k/R$ randomly chosen codeword positions. 
		
Our puncturing result is more general and applies to any code with large minimum distance: we show that a random rate $R$ puncturing of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear "mother" code whose relative distance is close enough to $1-1/q$ is list-decodable up to a radius approaching the $q$-ary list-decoding capacity bound $h_q^{-1}(1-R)$. In fact, for large $q$, or under a stronger assumption of low-bias of the mother-code, we prove that the threshold rate for list-decodability with a specific list-size (and more generally, any "local" property) of the random puncturing approaches that of fully random linear codes. Thus, all current (and future) list-decodability bounds shown for random linear codes extend automatically to random puncturings of any low-bias (or large alphabet) code. This can be viewed as a general derandomization result applicable to random linear codes. 
		
To obtain our conclusion about Reed-Solomon codes, we establish some hashing properties of field trace maps that allow us to reduce the list-decodability of RS codes to its associated trace (dual-BCH) code, and then apply our puncturing theorem to the latter. Our approach implies, essentially for free, optimal rate list-recoverability of punctured RS codes as well.</summary>

    <title>A complete and continuous map of the Lattice Isometry Space for all 3-dimensional lattices</title>

Lattice Isometry Space (LISP) to the practical case of dimension 3. A periodic
3-dimensional lattice is an infinite set of all integer linear combinations of
basis vectors in Euclidean 3-space. Motivated by crystal structures determined
in a rigid form, we study lattices up to rigid motion or isometry, which is a
composition of translations, rotations and reflections. The resulting space
LISP consists of infinitely many isometry classes of lattices. In dimension 3,
we parameterise this continuous space LISP by six coordinates and introduce new
metrics satisfying the metric axioms and continuity under all perturbations.
This parameterisation helps to visualise hundreds of thousands of real crystal
lattices from the Cambridge Structural Database for the first time.

meaningful (non-linear) low-dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional data.
MDS has a long history in the statistics, machine learning, and graph drawing
communities. In particular, the Kamada-Kawai force-directed graph drawing
method is equivalent to MDS and is one of the most popular ways in practice to
embed graphs into low dimensions. Despite its ubiquity, our theoretical
understanding of MDS remains limited as its objective function is highly
non-convex. In this paper, we prove that minimizing the Kamada-Kawai objective
is NP-hard and give a provable approximation algorithm for optimizing it, which
in particular is a PTAS on low-diameter graphs. We supplement this result with
experiments suggesting possible connections between our greedy approximation
algorithm and gradient-based methods.

genetic material can be represented by leaf-labelled, directed graphs called
phylogenetic networks. A major challenge in the burgeoning area of phylogenetic
networks is to develop algorithms for building such networks by amalgamating
small networks into a single large network. The level of a phylogenetic network
is a measure of its deviation from being a tree; the higher the level of
network, the less treelike it becomes. Various algorithms have been developed
for building level-1 networks from small networks. However, level-1 networks
may not be able to capture the complexity of some data sets. In this paper, we
present a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a rooted binary level-2
phylogenetic network from a collection of 3-leaf networks or trinets. Moreover,
we prove that the algorithm will correctly reconstruct such a network if it is
given all of the trinets in the network as input. The algorithm runs in time
$O(t\cdot n+n^4)$ with $t$ the number of input trinets and $n$ the number of
leaves. We also show that there is a fundamental obstruction to constructing
level-3 networks from trinets, and so new approaches will need to be developed
for constructing level-3 and higher level-networks.

Garey\&amp;Jonhson's book. We are given a grid with $n$ vertical and horizontal
slots and a dictionary with $m$ words and are asked to place words from the
dictionary in the slots so that shared cells are consistent. We attempt to
pinpoint the source of intractability of this problem by taking into account
the structure of the grid graph, which contains a vertex for each slot and an
edge if two slots intersect. Our main approach is to consider the case where
this graph has a tree-like structure. Unfortunately, if we impose the common
rule that words cannot be reused, we show that the problem remains NP-hard even
under very severe structural restrictions. The problem becomes slightly more
tractable if word reuse is allowed, as we obtain an $m^{tw}$ algorithm in this
case, where $tw$ is the treewidth of the grid graph. However, even in this
case, we show that our algorithm cannot be improved. More strongly, we show
that under the ETH the problem cannot be solved in time $m^{o(k)}$, where $k$
is the number of horizontal slots of the instance.
</p>
<p>Motivated by these mostly negative results, we consider the much more
restricted case where the problem is parameterized by the number of slots $n$.
Here, we show that the problem becomes FPT, but the parameter dependence is
exponential in $n^2$. We show that this dependence is also justified: the
existence of an algorithm with running time $2^{o(n^2)}$ would contradict the
randomized ETH. Finally, we consider an optimization version of the problem,
where we seek to place as many words on the grid as possible. Here it is easy
to obtain a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation, even on weighted instances. We show
that this algorithm is also likely to be optimal, as obtaining a better
approximation ratio in polynomial time would contradict the Unique Games
Conjecture.

    <title>Adversarially Robust Coloring for Graph Streams</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1632441600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Chakrabarti:Amit.html">Amit Chakrabarti</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Ghosh:Prantar.html">Prantar Ghosh</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Stoeckl:Manuel.html">Manuel Stoeckl</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11130">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A streaming algorithm is considered to be adversarially robust if it provides
correct outputs with high probability even when the stream updates are chosen
by an adversary who may observe and react to the past outputs of the algorithm.
We grow the burgeoning body of work on such algorithms in a new direction by
studying robust algorithms for the problem of maintaining a valid vertex
coloring of an $n$-vertex graph given as a stream of edges. Following standard
practice, we focus on graphs with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and aim for
colorings using a small number $f(\Delta)$ of colors.
</p>
<p>A recent breakthrough (Assadi, Chen, and Khanna; SODA~2019) shows that in the
standard, non-robust, streaming setting, $(\Delta+1)$-colorings can be obtained
while using only $\widetilde{O}(n)$ space. Here, we prove that an adversarially
robust algorithm running under a similar space bound must spend almost
$\Omega(\Delta^2)$ colors and that robust $O(\Delta)$-coloring requires a
linear amount of space, namely $\Omega(n\Delta)$. We in fact obtain a more
general lower bound, trading off the space usage against the number of colors
used. From a complexity-theoretic standpoint, these lower bounds provide
(i)~the first significant separation between adversarially robust algorithms
and ordinary randomized algorithms for a natural problem on insertion-only
streams and (ii)~the first significant separation between randomized and
deterministic coloring algorithms for graph streams, since deterministic
streaming algorithms are automatically robust.
</p>
<p>We complement our lower bounds with a suite of positive results, giving
adversarially robust coloring algorithms using sublinear space. In particular,
we can maintain an $O(\Delta^2)$-coloring using $\widetilde{O}(n
\sqrt{\Delta})$ space and an $O(\Delta^3)$-coloring using $\widetilde{O}(n)$
space.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a model of privacy-preserving machine learning that has garnered significant interest in recent years due to its rigorous privacy guarantees. An algorithm differentially private if the output is stable under small changes in the input database. While DP has been adopted in a variety of applications, most applications of DP in industry actually satisfy a stronger notion called local differential privacy. In local differential privacy data subjects perturb their data before it reaches the data analyst. While this requires less trust, it comes a substantial cost to accuracy. Recent work of Erlingsson, Feldman, Mironov, Raghunathan, Talwar, and Thakurta [EFMRTT19] demonstrated that random shuffling amplifies differential privacy guarantees of locally randomized data. Such amplification implies substantially stronger privacy guarantees for systems in which data is contributed anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17] and has led to significant interest in the shuffle model of privacy [CSUZZ19, EFMRTT19]. In this talk, we will discuss a new result on privacy amplification by shuffling, which achieves the asymptotically optimal dependence in the local privacy parameter. Our result is based on a new proof strategy which is simpler than previous approaches, and extends to a lightly weaker notion known as approximate differential privacy with nearly the same guarantees.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Vitaly Feldman and Kunal Talwar (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803">https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803</a>).</p></blockquote></div>

    <title>Why Conferences?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>An <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06438">undergrad thesis</a> from North Carolina State University tries to tackle the question as to why computer science has used conferences as its main and most prestigious publication venues. The author Elijah Bouma-Sims gives a synopsis with some interesting follow up conversation in this <a href="https://twitter.com/ElijahBoumaSims/status/1439041100111548419">Twitter thread</a>.</p><p>The upshot is that the conference culture grew organically early in computing and just took hold as the field grew. My personal non-scientific theory is that technology not available to earlier fields, namely jet airplanes, allowed CS to have national and international meetings that researchers could regularly attend. Before that conferences in more established fields like math were held either locally (<a href="http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/sectional.html">AMS sectional meetings</a>) or less often (<a href="https://www.mathunion.org/icm/icm-2022">ICM</a> held every four years), traditions that continue to this day.</p><p>Covid has temporarily suspended fully on-site conferences, and new technologies allow us to have virtual meetings. It's still not clear what will be the new normal for conferences. I hope we get to the model where we have more virtual meetings and rarer in-person meetings that people make more of an effort to attend. Conferences focused on networking instead of publications.</p><p>The culture of conference publications has been slowly changing. Many subfields in CS, though not no much theory, have moved to a hybrid model where papers are submitted to a journal and those accepted are invited to be presented at a conference.</p><p>Conferences used to be the first place you would hear about new results but that's no longer the case. Papers posted on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> get noticed and Google Scholar doesn't distinguished citations to an arXiv paper differently from any other publication venue. </p><p>Now you don't even need a presentation or a paper, just a promise of one. How many of you are excited about linear-size locally testable codes based on a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/breakthroughs-locally-testable-codes-constant-rate-distance-and-locality">talk announcement</a> alone?</p></div>

    <title>Space-Time Tradeoffs for Answering Boolean Conjunctive Queries</title>

conjunctive queries. The goal is to create a data structure in an initial
preprocessing phase and use it for answering (multiple) queries. Previous work
has developed data structures that trade off space usage for answering time and
has proved conditional space lower bounds for queries of practical interest
such as the path and triangle query. However, most of these results cater to
only those queries, lack a comprehensive framework, and are not generalizable.
The isolated treatment of these queries also fails to utilize the connections
with extensive research on related problems within the database community. The
key insight in this work is to exploit the formalism of relational algebra by
casting the problems as answering join queries over a relational database.
Using the notion of boolean {\em adorned queries} and {\em access patterns}, we
propose a unified framework that captures several widely studied algorithmic
problems. Our main contribution is three-fold. First, we present an algorithm
that recovers existing space-time tradeoffs for several problems. The algorithm
is based on an application of the {\em join size bound} to capture the space
usage of our data structure. We combine our data structure with {\em query
decomposition} techniques to further improve the tradeoffs and show that it is
readily extensible to queries with negation. Second, we falsify two conjectures
proposed in the existing literature that relates to the space-time lower bound
for path queries and triangle detection by proposing an unexpectedly better
algorithm. This result opens a new avenue for improving several algorithmic
results that have so far been assumed to be (conditionally) optimal. Finally,
we prove new conditional space-time lower bounds for star and path queries.

this is the first which is not discontinuous in singular cases. We introduce
new continuous coordinates (root products) on the space of lattices and new

    <title>Bounds on approximating Max $k$XOR with quantum and classical local algorithms</title>

$k$XOR, a generalization of two constraint satisfaction problems previously
studied with classical and quantum algorithms (MaxCut and Max E3LIN2). On
instances with either random signs or no overlapping clauses and $D+1$ clauses
per variable, we calculate the average satisfying fraction of the depth-1 QAOA
and compare with a generalization of the local threshold algorithm. Notably,
the quantum algorithm outperforms the threshold algorithm for $k &gt; 4$.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, we highlight potential difficulties for the QAOA to
achieve computational quantum advantage on this problem. We first compute a
tight upper bound on the maximum satisfying fraction of nearly all large random
regular Max $k$XOR instances by numerically calculating the ground state energy
density $P(k)$ of a mean-field $k$-spin glass. The upper bound grows with $k$
much faster than the performance of both one-local algorithms. We also identify
a new obstruction result for low-depth quantum circuits (including the QAOA)
when $k=3$, generalizing a result of Bravyi et al [<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1910.08980">arXiv:1910.08980</a>] when
$k=2$. We conjecture that a similar obstruction exists for all $k$.

new shape design avenues. Unfortunately, these advances have not yet been
accepted by the CAD community because they cannot be integrated into
engineering workflows. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach to
effectively combining geometric primitives and free-form surfaces represented
by implicit surfaces for accurate modeling that preserves interpretability,
enforces consistency, and enables easy manipulation.

Thomas, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Beddar=Wiesing:Silvia.html">Silvia Beddar-Wiesing</a>, Alice Moallemy-Oureh, Rüdiger Nather <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10708">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Graph representations have gained importance in almost every scientific
field, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences and physics to
computer science. In contrast to other data formats, graphs propose the
possibility to model relations between entities. Together with the continuously
rising amount of available data, graphs therefore open up a wide range of
modeling capabilities for theoretical and real-world problems. However, the
modeling possibilities of graphs have not been fully exploited. One reason for
this is that there is neither an easily comprehensible overview of graph types
nor an analysis of their modeling capacities available. As a result, neither
the potential of modeling with certain graph types is exhausted nor higher
modeling freedom and more efficient computing of graphs after transformation to
another graph type is in scope of view of many users. In order to clarify the
modeling possibilities of graphs, we order the different graph types, collate
their memory complexity and provide an expressivity measure on them.
Furthermore, we introduce transformation algorithms between the graph types
from which equal expressivity of all graph types can be inferred, i.e., they
are able to represent the same information or properties respectively. Finally,
we provide a guideline for the question when a graph type transformation is
efficient by defining a cost function dependend on the memory complexity and
the transformation runtime as a decision-making tool.

result. I offer a generalization of this result, something which may be called
machines as programs. Utilizing this insight, I introduce two new Turing
Machines called "Ceiling Machines." The formal ingredients of these two
machines are nearly identical. But there are crucial differences, splitting the
two into a "Higher Ceiling Machine" and a "Lower Ceiling Machine." A potential
graph of state transitions of the Higher Ceiling Machine is then offered. This
graph is termed the "canonically nondeterministic solution" or CNDS, whose
accompanying problem is its own replication, i.e., the problem, "Replicate
CNDS" (whose accompanying algorithm is cast in Martin-L\"of type theory). I
then show that while this graph can be replicated (solved) in polynomial time
by a nondeterministic machine -- of which the Higher Ceiling Machine is a
canonical example -- it cannot be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic
machine, of which the Lower Ceiling Machine is also canonical. It is
consequently proven that P $\neq$ NP.

who are paired for mutual benefit. During the last decade, matching markets
have emerged and grown rapidly through the medium of the Internet. They have
evolved into a new format, called Online Matching Markets (OMMs), with examples
ranging from crowdsourcing to online recommendations to ridesharing. There are
two features distinguishing OMMs from traditional matching markets. One is the
dynamic arrival of one side of the market: we refer to these as online agents
while the rest are offline agents. Examples of online and offline agents
include keywords (online) and sponsors (offline) in Google Advertising; workers
(online) and tasks (offline) in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT); riders (online)
and drivers (offline when restricted to a short time window) in ridesharing.
The second distinguishing feature of OMMs is the real-time decision-making
element. However, studies have shown that the algorithms making decisions in
these OMMs leave disparities in the match rates of offline agents. For example,
tasks in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status rarely get matched to gig
workers, and drivers of certain races/genders get discriminated against in
matchmaking. In this paper, we propose online matching algorithms which
optimize for either individual or group-level fairness among offline agents in
OMMs. We present two linear-programming (LP) based sampling algorithms, which
achieve online competitive ratios at least 0.725 for individual fairness
maximization (IFM) and 0.719 for group fairness maximization (GFM),
respectively. We conduct extensive numerical experiments and results show that
our boosted version of sampling algorithms are not only conceptually easy to
implement but also highly effective in practical instances of
fairness-maximization-related models.

    <title>TR21-138 |  Iterated Lower Bound Formulas: A Diagonalization-Based Approach to Proof Complexity | 

	Rahul Santhanam, 

	Iddo  Tzameret</title>
    <summary>We propose a diagonalization-based approach to several important questions in proof complexity. We illustrate this approach in the context of the algebraic proof system IPS and in the context of propositional proof systems more generally.

We give an explicit sequence of CNF formulas $\{\phi_n\}$ such that VNP$\neq$VP iff there are no polynomial-size IPS proofs for the formulas $\phi_n$. This provides the first natural equivalence between proof complexity lower bounds and standard algebraic complexity lower bounds. Our proof of this fact uses the implication from IPS lower bounds to algebraic complexity lower bounds due to Grochow and Pitassi together with a diagonalization argument: the formulas $\phi_n$ themselves assert the non-existence of short IPS proofs for formulas encoding VNP$\neq$VP at a different input length. Our result also has meta-mathematical implications: it gives evidence for the difficulty of proving strong lower bounds for IPS within IPS.

More generally, for any strong enough propositional proof system $R$ we propose a new explicit hard candidate, the iterated $R$-lower bound formulas, which inductively asserts the non-existence of short $R$ proofs for formulas encoding this same statement at a different input length. We show that these formulas are unconditionally hard for Resolution following recent results of Atserias and Muller and of Garlik. We further give evidence in favour of this hypothesis for other proof systems.</summary>

    <title>All Statistical Models Are Wrong. Are Any Useful?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Though I singled out a mask study <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">in the last post</a>, I’ve had a growing discomfort with statistical modeling and significance more generally. Statistical models explicitly describe the probability of outcomes of experiments in terms of specific variables of individuals from a population. Such statistical models bring with them a host of assumptions and powers. But when are they appropriate for deducing significance of the outcomes of experiments? Here, I’ll argue that they are almost never appropriate in most settings, and, moreover, they can result in confidence intervals that rarely contain the correct parameters.</p>

<p>Note that in order to sample from some population, we need not assume that the population is <em>itself</em> random. An experimenter can choose to sample one individual from a larger pool at random even when the pool is a deterministic collection. Similarly, the experimenter can randomly assign each member of the pool to a group for experimentation even when the pool is deterministic. We need not build a statistical model of our population in order to study it experimentally.</p>

<p>But the convention in much scientific practice entangles the randomness used in survey and experiment design with the randomness of the natural world. The dominant convention in experimental sciences is to assert the existence of a probability distribution from which all observations in an experiment are samples. That is, most analyses begin with the assumption that the population is itself a stochastic entity whose statistical properties can be accurately modeled. Such probabilistic modeling is immediately problematic. We are forced to confront the notion of probability itself. What does the probability of an event mean? Is a Bayesian or Frequentist viewpoint more correct? What does it mean to sample a natural process?</p>

<p>My perspective on the pitfalls of probabilistic modeling has been heavily influenced by the writings of David Freedman. Freedman advocates for a pragmatic approach to statistical modeling. “<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf">Probability is just a property of a mathematical model intended to describe some features of the natural world. For the model to be useful, it must be shown to be in good correspondence with the system it describes.</a>” This is the less pithy, but more prescriptive version of Box’s famous and tiresome aphorism “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”</p>

<p>Model building and validation requires deep domain knowledge for a task at hand. One of my favorite models is Ohm’s law, which states that the current that flows across a conductive material is proportional to the voltage drop across the resistor. Due to thermal noise, the actual model is</p>

\[\small{
  \text{current} = \text{material constant} \times \text{voltage} + \text{noise}}\]

<p>And the noise is Gaussian white noise. This model has been extensively tested and is a foundation of all circuit design. Remarkably, this simple formula describes complex electronic behavior. Physics is full of amazing examples of statistical models that accurately predict the outcome of experiments to a dozen significant figures.</p>

<p>But in biology, medicine, social science, and economics, our models are much less accurate and less grounded in natural laws. Most of the time, models are selected because they are convenient, not because they are plausible, well motivated from phenomenological principles, or even empirically validated. Freedman built a cottage industry around pointing out how poorly motivated many of the common statistical models are.</p>

<p>A particular example called out by Freedman is the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27645896">ubiquitous logistic regression model</a>. Freedman observed that in a variety of randomized control trials, experimenters would “correct” the estimates of their randomized controlled trials by “controlling for fixed effects” with logistic regression. Controlling for fixed effects is pernicious jargon that means “set up a regression problem with all of the variables that one thinks make their effect size look too small, and then solve the regression as an attempt to remove the influence of these variables.” It is most common in observational studies, but many insist it is appropriate in the context of randomized controlled trials as well. This convention of correction persists in the present, and I highlighted similar corrections in my last post. Freedman argues that such corrections are misguided, especially in the context of randomized trials.</p>

<p>To understand the motivation for using logistic in the first place, I need to tell you what an odds ratio is. Experiments are often interested in estimating an odds ratio of particular outcomes. The odds of an outcome is the number of individuals with a positive outcome divided by the number of individuals with a negative outcome. If the odds of winning a lottery are one million to one, that means that for every person that wins, one million people lose.</p>

<p>In the context of randomized experiments, let’s suppose that when given a treatment, M out of N individuals will have a favorable outcome, and without treatment only Q out of N will have a positive outcome Then the odds ratio is simply the ratio of the odds of the outcome with and without treatment</p>

\[\small{
\frac{M}{N-M} \cdot \frac{N-Q}{Q}\,.}\]

<p>When the odds ratio is large, we deem a treatment to be highly effective.</p>

<p>Logistic regression posits that individuals have a vector of features $Z$ that influence the odds of the effectiveness of treatment. Specifically, if $Y$ is the indicator of the desired outcome and $X$ is indicator of treatment, the logistic regression model asserts the log of the odds the outcome is a linear function of the treatment and the selected features. Since the model assumes the population is random, we can write the fraction of individuals with a positive outcome as probability. With this identification, the assumption of logistic regression is</p>

\[\small{
\log  \frac{p(Y=1 | X,Z ) }{ 1-p(Y=1 | X,Z) } = \beta X + \gamma^\top Z + \alpha \,.}\]

<p>This model is convenient if we are interested in odds ratios. In the logistic model, no matter what the covariate $Z$, the odds ratio is</p>

\[\small{
\frac{p(Y=1 | X=1,Z ) } {1-p(Y=1| X=1,Z) }  \cdot \frac{1-p(Y=1 | X=0, Z)}{p(Y=1 | X=0, Z)} = e^\beta\,.}\]

<p>Hence, if we can estimate beta, we can estimate the odds ratio. And if we can estimate the variance of beta, we can compute confidence intervals over our odds ratio estimates.</p>

<p>But all of this assumes that the model is correct! If the logistic model is not correct, then our confidence intervals are meaningless. Or at least, they are not confidence intervals around any true notion of odds ratios.</p>

<p>It’s almost always reasonable to be suspicious of this logistic model. It is first asserting that the odds ratio is a constant for a fixed covariate $Z$. That is, all subjects experience the same proportional effect of treatment. Even less realistically, the model asserts that the outcome is positive for an individual $i$ with treatment value $X_i$ and covariate value $Z_i$ if</p>

\[\small{
  U_i  \leq \alpha + \beta X_i + \gamma^\top Z_i\,,}\]

<p>where $U_i$ is a random variable sampled from the logistic distribution. The model assumes the $U_i$ are independent of the treatment and the covariates, the $U_i$ are independent across all of the individuals, and the $U_i$ have a common logistic distribution. The only thing that differs between treatment and control is the value of the threshold on the left hand side. These are a lot of assumptions, and they are seldom verified or tested in papers where logistic regression is applied.</p>

<p>The question remains: does this matter? Do these modeling assumptions actually affect our inferences about effect size? Freedman provides an elegant argument demonstrating that logistic regression always overestimates the true odds ratio, and sometimes can do so quite poorly. He also shows that simply computing a plugin estimator of the odds ratio with no covariate adjustment at all is consistent in randomized controlled trials. That is, there is no need to adjust for covariates in randomized controlled trials if you want an accurate estimate of the odds ratio. Furthermore, covariate adjustments can lead to significant overestimation of the treatment’s effect size.</p>

<p>Rather than going through Freedman’s theoretical argument, it’s a bit more evocative to give an example. The following is gleaned from a helpful discussion with Joel Middleton. Suppose you sample 10000 children from a larger population where each child in the population has an equal chance of liking and disliking vegetables. We propose a treatment of bribing kids with a cookie to eat their veggies, and randomly assign this treatment to half of the subjects. Left untreated, veggie haters have a 20% probability of finishing their veggies, but veggie lovers have an 80% probability of eating their greens. When bribed with a cookie, veggie haters and veggie lovers have 25% and 85% of eating their vegetables, respectively.</p>

<p>An average child in the study has a probability of 50% of eating their veggies if in control and 55% if in treatment. The log odds ratio is thus</p>

\[\small{
  \log \frac{.55}{1−.55}−\log\frac{.5}{1−.5} \approx 0.2\,.}\]

<p>Now, when you instead run logistic regression, the coefficient of the treatment variable is larger than 0.2. Indeed, <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/argmin.net/code/logistic_logodds_example.ipynb">when I try this in python</a>, running 1000 synthetic experiments, I find that the median point estimate is 0.32, which is, as promised, larger than the true log odds. Even more worrisome is the 95% confidence interval contains 0.2 only 38% of the time. Clearly, the confidence intervals are not accurate when the model is wrong.</p>

<p>When the true effect size is large, this discrepancy between the logistic regression estimate and the true log odds might not be that big a deal: your error bars are wrong, but the effect size is estimated in the correct direction. But the results of such logistic regression analyzes are regularly quoted as estimates of odds ratios (For example, look at any  observational study of vaccine effectiveness). The precision of these estimates is unfortunately lacking and misleading.</p>

<p>Even if the model <em>was</em> true, the same argument shows that the coefficient of the treatment variable overestimates the log-odds. This is demonstrated in the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/argmin.net/code/logistic_logodds_example.ipynb">second example in the python notebook</a>. Even when the model is true, the coefficient of the treatment variable is an overestimate of the true log odds. If the model was true, one could at least say they had constructed a reasonable estimate of the change in odds for an individual under treatment. But if the model is wrong, there’s nothing we can say at all other than we have overestimated the effect size and our error bars might not contain the true odds with any certainty.</p>

<p>So what is the remedy here? The thing is, we already know the answer: if we randomized the assignment, we can estimate log odds by counting the number of positive outcomes under treatment and control, and then just plugging these values into the odds ratio. If you do this, you find an estimate whose median is precisely equal to the true log odds. No covariate adjustment is required.</p>

<p>This is merely one example showing why it is critical to decouple the randomness used to probe a system from the randomness inherent in its system itself. Statistical models are not necessary for statistical inference, but randomness itself is amazingly… let’s say… <em>useful</em> for understanding natural phenomena. I will spend the next few blogs reminding myself and you faithful blog readers that proper experiments, machine learning predictions, and statistical summarizations can all be designed without statistical models of populations. Perhaps the mathematical formalizations of randomized algorithms can suggest paths to reform conventional experimental formalism.</p></div>

    <title>The New Jeopardy Champion is a `A CS grad student from a school in New Haven'</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> As of Sept 17, Matt Amodio has won 23 straight games in a row on Jeopardy and won over $800,000 in regular play. The following website is not quite up to date, but its close: <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/contestant-zone/hall-of-fame">here</a>. Of course, that website will change. </p><p>1) They refer to him as <i>A CS grad student from a school in New Haven</i>. My first thought was <i>probably</i> <i>Yale, but whatever it is, they should just say it. </i>I looked it up and it is Yale. So why aren't they just saying <i>A CS grad student from Yale?  </i>If someone works for <i>an airline company</i> they do not tell you which airline- prob to avoid giving that airline free publicity. But I would think a school is different. And I remember (perhaps incorrectly) that they DO say what school someone teaches at or is a student at. </p><p>(ADDED LATER: a colleague of mine who was on Jeop (he lost his only game) tells me that YES, you re NOT ALLOWED to say the company you work for. He was from <i>Riverdale Park, MD </i>which might make some people think there is a <i>Univ of MD at Riverdale Park</i> . He also told me that when he was on the show the following happened:  <i>On One of the shows of the game before I  played, Alex was curious which LA area restaurant somebody worked at (to see if he had eaten there--- he hadn't), and sure enough, they edited the name of the restaurant out.)</i></p><p>2) Longest streak: Ken Jennings: 74. Also most money in reg play: roughly 2.5 Mill</p><p>    2nd longest: James Holzhauer: 32. Also  2nd most money in reg play: roughly 2.4 Mill</p><p>    3rd longest: Matt Amodio: 23. Also  3rd most money in reg play: roughly 0.8 Mill</p><p>3) I do not think Matt will move into second place on any of these categories. He bets big on the daily doubles and it has paid off but either (a) he will miss and it will lead to a loss, or (b) he will just not get the daily double and be against a very good opponent. Item (b) happened to James H- and the person who beat him did have a good enough win streak to be in the Tournament of Champions. I wonder if they try to stop a long streak by picking really good opponents. I also wonder if they can even tell who will be a really good opponent. </p><p>4) Matt has played in front of (or will- counting tomorrow) six hosts: Robin Roberts, LeVar Burton, David Faber, Joe Buck, Mike Richards, and Mayim Bialik. Six is a record which I suspect won't be broken, except possibly by Matt himself if he also plays in front of Ken Jennings (the rest of 2021 will be Mayim B and Ken J as hosts, see <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/16/1037930905/mayim-bialik-ken-jennings-host-jeopardy">here</a>.</p><p>5) Matt works in AI. When he gets his PhD and is on the job market will his Jeopardy success help him, hurt him, or neither?  </p><p>6) James H and Matt A are both very good at calculating how much to bet. I think Ken J is not quite as good but still good. Generally the players on Jeop are not that good at that aspect. I had the chance to ask some a champions (not any of those three) why that was and she said that most people get into because of the trivia-aspect, not the betting aspect. I wonder if just as players now study lots of facts to prep, they will also learn how to bet better. </p><p>7) Ken J as host is a bit odd in that, if he says (as Alex T did sometimes) <i>That category looks hard </i>I won't believe him. I also have this suspicion that when a contestant gets something wrong Ken might be thinking <i>what a moron; </i>however, (a) by all accounts Ken is a nice guy, and (b)  I might be projecting. </p></div>

<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is a Mathematician </b></p>
<p/><p>
Ken is of course a co-author of this blog. We try to cover computer science and mathematics, but we are open to other areas. Ken started his career in Mathematics; he obtained a PhD in math from Oxford University in 1986. It was under Dominic Welsh and was tilted: <i>On the separation of complexity classes</i>. Welsh’s family tree is <a href="https://users.monash.edu.au/~davidwo/files/Welsh-FamilyTree.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is a Programmer </b></p>
<p/><p>
Ken is of course famous for being one of the world’s top chess cheating detectors. Recall to cheat at chess is to use a computer program to make your moves in a game against a human opponent. This is strictly illegal. </p>
<p>
Ken was featured on the cover in <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/personal/JuneCLarticleKWR.pdf">chess review</a>. His work gets critic review <a href="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/44719/">here</a> by David Barnes and Julio Hernandez-Castro in the 2015 article <i>On the limits of engine analysis for cheating detection in chess</i> in the journal Computers and Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is Unique </b></p>
<p/><p>
Ken is special in many ways. He is smart, he is a wonderful partner, and he is a great friend. I would claim that he is one of the few people that have the following three properties:</p>
<ol>
<li> He is an international master in chess of rating <img alt="{2372}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2372%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>;
</li><li> He is a strong researcher in complexity theory;
</li><li> He is a terrific programmer.
</li></ol>
<p>
The last I would claim is pretty remarkable. There are many strong chess players, there are many of us working in complexity theory. But few have written as much production quality code as Ken has. For his work on chess cheating he has had to write thousands of lines of code. This code must run fast, and be correct. The latter, correctness, is really important. This since his work on detecting cheating has led players to be suspended from chess for years. It also has helped protect players who did not cheat, even though many thought they had. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Again I wish him a wonderful unbirthday day.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This Erev Yom Kippur, I wish to repent for not putting enough quantum computing content on this blog.  Of course, repentance is meaningless unless accompanied by genuine reform.  That being the case, please enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLmGfNKCLU">YouTube video of my ACM TechTalk from last week about quantum supremacy</a>—although, as you’ll see if you watch the thing, I oscillate between quantum supremacy and other terms like “quantum advantage” and even “quantum supremadvantage.”  This represents the first time ever that I got pushback about a talk before I’d delivered it for political reasons—the social-justice people, it turns out, are <em>actually serious</em> about wanting to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">ban the term “quantum supremacy”</a>—but my desire to point out all the difficulties with their proposal competed with my desire not to let that issue overshadow my talk.</p>



<p>And there’s plenty to talk about!  While regular <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers will have already heard (or read) most of what I say, I make some new comments, including about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03494">new paper from last week</a>, the night before my talk (!), by the USTC group in China, where they report a quantum supremacy experiment based on random circuit sampling with a superconducting chip, this time with a record-setting 60 qubits and 24 layers of gates.  On the other hand, I also stress how increasing the circuit fidelity has become a <em>much</em> more urgent issue than further increasing the number of qubits (or in the case of BosonSampling, the number of photons), if our goal is for these experiments to remain a couple steps ahead of classical spoofing algorithms.</p>



<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy my lovingly handcrafted visuals.  Over the course of this pandemic, I’ve become a full convert to writing out my talks with a stylus pen rather than PowerPointing them—not only is it faster for me, not only does it allow for continuous scrolling rather than arbitrary divisions into slides, but it enforces simplicity and concision in ways they <em>should</em> be enforced.</p>



<p>While there was only time for me to field a few questions at the end of the talk, I later supplied <a href="https://on.acm.org/t/quantum-computational-supremacy/2106/2?u=acm-learning">written answers to 52 questions (!!) that I hadn’t gotten to</a>.  If <em>you</em> have a question, please check to see if it’s already there, and otherwise ask away in the comments!</p>



<p>Thanks so much to Yan Timanovsky for inviting and organizing this talk, and to whurley for hosting it.</p></div>

Meanwhile for those of us using it as a static site generator and github-pages blog springboard, Jekyll still largely just works as it always has without much need for development.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Way back in 2005, I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/qchallenge.html">Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory</a>, on at least half of which I’d say there’s been dramatic progress in the 16 years since (most of the challenges were open-ended, so that it’s unclear when to count them as “solved”).  I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=471">more open quantum complexity problems</a> in 2010, and some <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=663">classical complexity problems</a> in 2011.  In the latter cases, I’d say there’s been dramatic progress on about a third of the problems.  I won’t go through the problems one by one, but feel free to ask in the comments about any that interest you.</p>



<p>Shall I push my luck as a problem-poser?  Shall or shall not, I have.</p>



<p>My impetus, this time around, was a kind invitation by Travis Humble, the editor-in-chief of the new <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tqc">ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing</a></em>, to contribute a perspective piece to that journal on the occasion of my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5448">ACM Prize</a>.  I agreed—but only on the condition that, rather than ponderously pontificate about the direction of the field, I could simply discuss a bunch of open problems that I wanted to see solved.  The result is below.  It’s coming soon to an arXiv near you, but <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers get it first.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/open.pdf">Open Problems Related to Quantum Query Complexity</a></strong>  (11 pages, PDF)</p><p>by Scott Aaronson</p><p><em>Abstract:</em> I offer a case that quantum query complexity still has loads of enticing and fundamental open problems—from relativized QMA versus QCMA and BQP versus IP, to time/space tradeoffs for collision and element distinctness, to polynomial degree versus quantum query complexity for partial functions, to the Unitary Synthesis Problem and more.</p></blockquote>



<p>Some of the problems on my new hit-list are ones that I and others have flogged for years or even decades, but others, as far as I know, appear here for the first time.  If your favorite quantum query complexity open problem, or a problem I’ve discussed in the past, is missing, that doesn’t mean that it’s been solved or is no longer interesting—it might mean I simply ran out of time or energy before I got to it.</p>



<p>Enjoy!  And tell me what I missed or got wrong or has a trivial solution that I overlooked.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-137 |  Affine extractors and AC0-Parity | 

	Xuangui Huang, 

	Peter Ivanov, 

	Emanuele Viola</title>
    <summary>We study a simple and general template for constructing affine extractors by composing a linear transformation with resilient functions. Using this we show that good affine extractors can be computed by non-explicit circuits of various types, including AC0-Xor circuits: AC0 circuits with a layer of parity gates at the input. We also show that one-sided extractor can be computed by small DNF-Xor circuits, and separate these circuits from other well-studied classes. As a further motivation for studying DNF-Xor circuits we show that if they can approximate inner product then small AC0-Xor circuits can compute it exactly – a long-standing open problem.</summary>

<p>
Scott Aaronson is one of the top researchers in complexity theory and especially in quantum computing. He is famous for more than his research, he is famous also for his blog <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?m=202109">Shtetl-Optimized</a>. Its scope includes just about everything that touches on complexity theory, but includes many topics that span just about anything that is interesting these days.</p>
<p>
For a whole week, he has had the topic: <i>Exciting opportunities at Kabul University!</i> </p>
<p>
Scott is kidding about Kabul of course. Rather, his topic is the recent Texas law against abortion. Here are his initial comments: </p>
<blockquote><p>
Now, of course, Texas has effectively outlawed abortion—well, after the 6th week, which is before many women even realize they’re pregnant, and when the fetus is still the size of a grain of rice…</p>
<p>
There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and—this is the “novel” part—there’s a bounty system, with $10,000 fines for anyone who helps in any way with an abortion, payable to anyone who snitches on them. Texas has openly defied Roe v. Wade and, for the first time in half a century, has gotten five Supreme Court justices (three appointed by Donald Trump) to go along with it. Roe v. Wade is de facto no longer the law of the United States.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We will not talk about abortion, but rather the novel aspect of the Texas law. This will not lead to quantum computing, not even along lines of a famous SMBC <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3">cartoon</a> that Scott created with Zach Weinersmith, from which we give the second panel:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/the-talk/" rel="attachment wp-att-19098"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19098" height="270" src="https://i2.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/the-talk.jpg?resize=480%2C270&amp;ssl=1" width="480"/></a></p>
<p>
We promise it will lead to some math, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What can we do to stop the Texas law? Many are worried that the fact that the US Supreme Court has refused to even temporarily block the Texas law is unheard of. Does this mean that the new Texas law somehow is valid? Does this mean that abortions will be made illegal? Not clear.</p>
<p>
One part of the Texas law is clever—we can disagree with it and still note that the new law is clever. The law does not give the usual suspects to the local law enforcement, who are usually the ones responsible to enforce the law. Rather the law insists that anyone can raise the issue that X has violated the law against an abortion. Say S raises that X helped make an abortion happen. Then S gets $10,000 payment provided the case is upheld in court. Scott calls S the <i>snitches</i>. </p>
<p>
As recognized by the Emergency Medical Network (Emnet), this step in moving the enforcement from the usual police to the general public is one of the reasons the Texas law is so hard to fight. The usual way to challenge a new law is to immediately file some counter suit stopping those charged with enforcement. This seems to be impossible with this trick. Who can be S?—by construction that could be just about anyone. There is no single body to force to defend the law in court. Clever.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law—The Trick </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are experts in theory of computation. Can we use that ability to find a way to attack the new <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961">law</a>? Can we see any weakness that is inherent in the law? Some trick? Or is the Texas idea somehow a breakthrough in ways to state a law against abortion?</p>
<p>
Ken and I have an insight. A standard trick in theory is given a new idea can we generalize it. If we can use the new idea to solve other problems then we should shed some light on the new idea. If the idea is too powerful, then we essentially prove that it cannot work in general. If it does work elsewhere, then we can use it to solve previous unsolved problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law for Speeding </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Cars speeding is a serious problem just about everywhere. I live in a rural area and it is 35 mph here. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/attachment/35/" rel="attachment wp-att-19100"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19100" height="114" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/35.png?resize=196%2C114&amp;ssl=1" width="196"/></a></p>
<p>
Yet when I am driving I am often passed by cars that cross a yellow line going 50 or faster. The issue is that the laws insist that some officer witness a violation. But since that rarely happens, the speeders almost always get no ticket.</p>
<p>
Let’s use the same trick that is used in the new Texas law. If a car races by me then I will send a digital message to the police that says: “Today I was driving my car number <b>1236335356</b> at time <b>11:19.42am</b> and witnessed a car with plate number <b>ERRW5365</b> speeding at <b>55.11mph</b> while passing me. I was at location …</p>
<p>
This would be sent to the police and they would then have the task of checking it out. Provided it checks out, I would be awarded a bounty of $500, say. And the speeder would get a fine and …</p>
<p>
How could I prove the speed? I wouldn’t have time to take a video in the moment. But Ken’s smartphone—and those of many of his colleagues—have an app that is solving problems of this type 24/7. His is a University at Buffalo product but there are many similar ones. Quoting the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/pocketcares.html">website</a> makes everything quickly clear:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> PocketCare S is a bluetooth low energy (BLE) solution which enables smartphones to send and receive anonymous beacon signals. It checks the distance between a smartphone and another beacon (or smartphone running PocketCare S) … [and] … records the duration a close encounter with another beacon. PocketCare S is designed to report social distance information without collecting or revealing any personally identifiable information about any specific individual. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The car would only need to have a detectable beacon, not the same app—and the info giving proof of speed over said duration might already be in the authorities’ data banks even before the complaint is filed.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Bipartite Epidemiology? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Of course, what we are trying to say is that this kind of lawsuit would become a new kind of virus. It might extend to many other transgressions besides speeding. What strikes us further is that this would assume a binary structure that we do not know to exist in medical pandemics.</p>
<p>
The first point is that the people who voted for the Texas law believe they are not the ones who would be violating it. Call them Team A. The remaining people—Team 2—would want to get back at them. Maybe speeding is an equal vice for those two teams, so that wouldn’t work. We’ve seen suggestions like Team B suing for open-carry of firearms. Let us just suppose Team B finds something.</p>
<p>
The second point is that a “snitch” lawsuit is like one person infecting another. But unlike our present pandemic, it’s one where people in A can only infect those in B, and vice versa. We have a bipartite graph <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. How does this change the math?</p>
<p>
One issue noted by Scott in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5807#comment-1908708">comment</a> is whether the law allows someone to be sued multiple times. If not, then being sued once would be like acquiring immunity. The US recognizes principles of “no double jeopardy” but the Texas law appears to avoid them. </p>
<p>
We’ve tried to look for related analysis of the popular college “Humans Versus Zombies” (<a href="https://humansvszombies.org/">HvZ</a>) game. But in that game, the zombies only increase. <em>Scientific American</em> once published an <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/modelling-a-werewolf-epidemic-2/">analysis</a> titled, “Modelling a werewolf epidemic” that also mentioned zombies. But it did not say the werewolves could only infect zombies and vice-versa. </p>
<p>
Binary infection situations do of course exist when two groups of people suddenly mix, each having already acquired resistance to a disease that infects the other. There have been great tragedies when the mixing was a relatively small number of A colonizing into B. But we still do not know of models that would apply when the kinds of “infections” involve spontaneously arise <em>en masse</em> in the manner of a pandemic with high <img alt="{R_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> factor—as might happen if the courts really legitimize this kind of “snitch suit” law.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is this type of snitching a viable adjunct to law enforcement for speeding? Could it save lives? What about the associated dimension of propagating personal information into massive repositories?</p>

    <title>TR21-136 |  LCC and LDC: Tailor-made distance amplification and a refined separation | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Tal Yankovitz</title>
    <summary>The Alon-Edmonds-Luby distance amplification procedure (FOCS 1995) is an algorithm that transforms a code with vanishing distance to a code with constant distance. AEL was invoked by Kopparty, Meir, Ron-Zewi, and Saraf (J. ACM 2017) for obtaining their state-of-the-art LDC, LCC and LTC. Cohen and Yankovitz (CCC 2021) devised a  procedure that can amplify inverse-polynomial distances, exponentially extending the regime of distances that can be amplified by AEL. However, the improved procedure only works for LDC and assuming rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log n}$.

In this work we devise a distance amplification procedure for LCC with inverse-polynomial distances even for vanishing rate $\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. For LDC, we obtain a more modest improvement and require rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. Thus, the tables have turned and it is now LCC that can be better amplified. Our key idea for accomplishing this, deviating from prior work, is to tailor the distance amplification procedure to the code at hand.

Our second result concerns the relation between linear LDC and LCC. We prove the existence of linear LDC that are not LCC, qualitatively extending a separation by Kaufman and Viderman (RANDOM 2010).</summary>
