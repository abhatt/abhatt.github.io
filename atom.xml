analysis has recently received significant attention. We complement several
recent papers in this line of research by introducing a general method to
reduce bias in the data through random projections in a ``fair'' subspace.
</p>
<p>We apply this method to densest subgraph and $k$-means. For densest subgraph,
our approach based on fair projections allows to recover both theoretically and
empirically an almost optimal, fair, dense subgraph hidden in the input data.
We also show that, under the small set expansion hypothesis, approximating this
problem beyond a factor of $2$ is NP-hard and we show a polynomial time
algorithm with a matching approximation bound. We further apply our method to
$k$-means. In a previous paper, Chierichetti et al.~[NIPS 2017] showed that
problems such as $k$-means can be approximated up to a constant factor while
ensuring that none of two protected class (e.g., gender, ethnicity) is
disparately impacted.
</p>
<p>We show that fair projections generalize the concept of fairlet introduced by
Chierichietti et al. to any number of protected attributes and improve
empirically the quality of the resulting clustering. We also present the first
constant-factor approximation for an arbitrary number of protected attributes
thus settling an open problem recently addressed in several works.

    <title>ParPaRaw: Massively Parallel Parsing of Delimiter-Separated Raw Data</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1559520000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Stehle:Elias.html">Elias Stehle</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jacobsen:Hans=Arno.html">Hans-Arno Jacobsen</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13415">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Parsing is essential for a wide range of use cases, such as stream
processing, bulk loading, and in-situ querying of raw data. Yet, the
compute-intense step often constitutes a major bottleneck in the data ingestion
pipeline, since parsing of inputs that require more involved parsing rules is
challenging to parallelise. This work proposes a massively parallel algorithm
for parsing delimiter-separated data formats on GPUs. Other than the
state-of-the-art, the proposed approach does not require an initial sequential
pass over the input to determine a thread's parsing context. That is, how a
thread, beginning somewhere in the middle of the input, should interpret a
certain symbol (e.g., whether to interpret a comma as a delimiter or as part of
a larger string enclosed in double-quotes). Instead of tailoring the approach
to a single format, we are able to perform a massively parallel FSM simulation,
which is more flexible and powerful, supporting more expressive parsing rules
with general applicability. Achieving a parsing rate of as much as 14.2 GB/s,
our experimental evaluation on a GPU with 3584 cores shows that the presented
approach is able to scale to thousands of cores and beyond. With an end-to-end
streaming approach, we are able to exploit the full-duplex capabilities of the
PCIe bus and hide latency from data transfers. Considering the end-to-end
performance, the algorithm parses 4.8 GB in as little as 0.44 seconds,
including data transfers.

    <title>A Weighted Linear Matroid Parity Algorithm</title>

generalization of matching and matroid intersection problems, is so general
that it requires an exponential number of oracle calls. Nevertheless, Lov\'asz
(1980) showed that this problem admits a min-max formula and a polynomial
algorithm for linearly represented matroids. Since then efficient algorithms
have been developed for the linear matroid parity problem. In this paper, we
present a combinatorial, deterministic, polynomial-time algorithm for the
weighted linear matroid parity problem. The algorithm builds on a polynomial
matrix formulation using Pfaffian and adopts a primal-dual approach based on
the augmenting path algorithm of Gabow and Stallmann (1986) for the unweighted
problem.

    <title>Sum-of-squares meets square loss: Fast rates for agnostic tensor completion</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Foster:Dylan_J=.html">Dylan J. Foster</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Risteski:Andrej.html">Andrej Risteski</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13283">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study tensor completion in the agnostic setting. In the classical tensor
completion problem, we receive $n$ entries of an unknown rank-$r$ tensor and
wish to exactly complete the remaining entries. In agnostic tensor completion,
we make no assumption on the rank of the unknown tensor, but attempt to predict
unknown entries as well as the best rank-$r$ tensor.
</p>
<p>For agnostic learning of third-order tensors with the square loss, we give
the first polynomial time algorithm that obtains a "fast" (i.e., $O(1/n)$-type)
rate improving over the rate obtained by reduction to matrix completion. Our
prediction error rate to compete with the best $d\times{}d\times{}d$ tensor of
rank-$r$ is $\tilde{O}(r^{2}d^{3/2}/n)$. We also obtain an exact oracle
inequality that trades off estimation and approximation error.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm is based on the degree-six sum-of-squares relaxation of the
tensor nuclear norm. The key feature of our analysis is to show that a certain
characterization for the subgradient of the tensor nuclear norm can be encoded
in the sum-of-squares proof system. This unlocks the standard toolbox for
localization of empirical processes under the square loss, and allows us to
establish restricted eigenvalue-type guarantees for various tensor regression
models, with tensor completion as a special case. The new analysis of the
relaxation complements Barak and Moitra (2016), who gave slow rates for
agnostic tensor completion, and Potechin and Steurer (2017), who gave exact
recovery guarantees for the noiseless setting. Our techniques are
user-friendly, and we anticipate that they will find use elsewhere.

that our algorithm obtains solutions whose objective value nearly matches the

are capable of solving these two problems in any such set that can be
represented with finite number of convex inequalities. For the axis-aligned
case, we formulate the problem for higher dimensions and present an exact
optimization algorithm which solves the problem in $\mathcal{O}(d^3+d^2n)$
time, where $d$ is the dimension and $n$ is the number of inequalities defining
the convex set. For the general case, after formulating the problem for higher
dimensions we investigate the traditional 2-dimensional problem, which is in
the literature merely considered for convex polygons, for a broad range of
convex sets. We first present a new exact algorithm that finds the largest
inscribed axis-aligned rectangle in such convex sets for any given direction of
axes in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. Using this exact algorithm as a subroutine, we
present an $\epsilon$-approximation algorithm that computes
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximation to the largest inscribed rectangle with
computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}n)$. Finally, we show
that how this running time can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log

Given
samples from an unknown probability distribution $P$ and a set of $m$
probability distributions $\mathcal{H}$, the goal is to output, in a
$\varepsilon$-differentially private manner, a distribution from $\mathcal{H}$
whose total variation distance to $P$ is comparable to that of the best such
distribution (which we denote by $\alpha$). The sample complexity of our basic
algorithm is $O\left(\frac{\log m}{\alpha^2} + \frac{\log m}{\alpha
\varepsilon}\right)$, representing a minimal cost for privacy when compared to
the non-private algorithm. We also can handle infinite hypothesis classes
$\mathcal{H}$ by relaxing to $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy.
</p>
<p>We apply our hypothesis selection algorithm to give learning algorithms for a
number of natural distribution classes, including Gaussians, product
distributions, sums of independent random variables, piecewise polynomials, and
mixture classes. Our hypothesis selection procedure allows us to generically
convert a cover for a class to a learning algorithm, complementing known
learning lower bounds which are in terms of the size of the packing number of
the class. As the covering and packing numbers are often closely related, for
constant $\alpha$, our algorithms achieve the optimal sample complexity for
many classes of interest. Finally, we describe an application to private
distribution-free PAC learning.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If I want to get back to blogging on a regular basis, given the negative amount of time that I now have for such things, Iâll need to get better at dispensing with pun-filled titles, jokey opening statements, etc. etc., and resigning myself to a less witty, more workmanline blog.</p>



<p>So in that spirit: a few weeks ago I gave a talk at the Fields Institute in Toronto, at a <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/18-19/NP50">symposium</a> to celebrate Stephen Cook and the 50th anniversary (or actually more like 48th anniversary) of the discovery of NP-completeness.  Thanks so much to the organizers for making this symposium happen.</p>



<p>You can <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/video-archive/static/2019/05/2774-20557/mergedvideo.ogv">watch the video of my talk here</a> (or <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/npphys-toronto.ppt">read the PowerPoint slides here</a>).  The talk, on whether NP-complete problems can be efficiently solved in the physical universe, covers much the same ground as <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf">my 2005 survey article</a> on the same theme (not to mention dozens of earlier talks), but this is an updated version and Iâm happier with it than I was with most past iterations.</p>



<p>As I explain at the beginning of the talk, I wasnât going to fly to Toronto at all, due to severe teaching and family constraintsâbut my wife Dana uncharacteristically <em>urged me to go</em> (âdonât worry, Iâll watch the kids!â).  Why?  Because in her view, it was the risks that Steve Cook took 50 years ago, as an untenured assistant professor at Berkeley, that gave birth to the field of computational complexity that Dana and I both now work in.</p>



<p>Anyway, be sure to <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/video-archive//event/2774/2019">check out the other talks as well</a>âtheyâre by an assortment of random nobodies like Richard Karp, Avi Wigderson, Leslie Valiant, Michael Sipser, Alexander Razborov, Cynthia Dwork, and Jack Edmonds.  I found the talk by Edmonds particularly eye-opening: he explains how he thought about (the objects that we now call) P and NPâ©coNP when he first defined them in the early 60s, and how it was similar to and different from the way we think about them today.</p>



<p>Another memorable moment came when Edmonds interrupted Sipserâs talkâabout the history of P vs. NPâto deliver a booming diatribe about how what really matters is not mathematical proof, but just how quickly you can solve problems in the real world.  Edmonds added that, from a practical standpoint, Pâ NP is âtrue today but might become false in the future.â  In response, Sipser asked âwhat does a mathematician like me care about the real world?,â to roars of approval from the audience.  I mightâve picked a different tackâabout how for every practical person I meet for whom itâs blindingly obvious that âin real life, Pâ NP,â I meet another for whom itâs equally obvious that âin real life, P=NPâ (for all the usual reasons: because SAT solvers work so well in practice, because physical systems so easily relax as their ground states, etc).  No wonder it took 25+ years of smart people thinking about operations research and combinatorial optimization before the P vs. NP question was even explicitly posed.</p>

    <title>TR19-082 |  Approximate degree, secret sharing, and concentration phenomena | 

	Andrej Bogdanov, 

	Nikhil Mande, 

	Justin Thaler, 

	Christopher Williamson</title>
    <summary>The $\epsilon$-approximate degree $\widetilde{\text{deg}}_\epsilon(f)$ of a Boolean function $f$ is the least degree of a real-valued polynomial that approximates $f$ pointwise to error $\epsilon$.  The approximate degree of $f$ is at least $k$ iff there exists a pair of probability distributions, also known as a dual polynomial, that are perfectly $k$-wise indistinguishable, but are distinguishable by $f$ with advantage $1 - \epsilon$.  Our contributions are:

We give a simple new construction of a dual polynomial for the AND function, certifying that $\widetilde{\text{deg}}_\epsilon(f) \geq \Omega(\sqrt{n \log 1/\epsilon})$.  This construction is the first to extend to the notion of weighted degree, and yields the first explicit certificate that the $1/3$-approximate degree of any read-once DNF is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$.

We show that any pair of symmetric distributions on $n$-bit strings that are perfectly $k$-wise indistinguishable are also statistically $K$-wise indistinguishable with error at most $K^{3/2} \cdot \exp(-\Omega(k^2/K))$ for all $k \leq K \leq n/64$.
This implies that any symmetric function $f$ is a reconstruction function with constant advantage for a ramp secret sharing scheme that is secure against size-$K$ coalitions with statistical error $K^{3/2} \exp(-\Omega(\widetilde{\text{deg}}_{1/3}(f)^2/K))$ for all values of $K$ up to $n/64$ simultaneously.
Previous secret sharing schemes required that $K$ be determined in advance, and only worked for $f=$ AND.  

Our analyses draw new connections between approximate degree and concentration phenomena.

As a corollary, we show that for any $d \leq n/64$, any degree $d$ polynomial approximating a symmetric function $f$ to error $1/3$
must have $\ell_1$-norm at least $K^{-3/2} \exp({\Omega(\widetilde{\text{deg}}_{1/3}(f)^2/d)})$, which we also show to be tight for any $d &gt; \widetilde{\text{deg}}_{1/3}(f)$.
These upper and lower bounds were also previously only known in the case $f=$ AND.</summary>

    <title>TR19-081 |  Channels of Small Log-Ratio Leakage and Characterization of Two-Party Differentially Private Computation | 

	Iftach Haitner, 

	Noam Mazor, 

	Ronen Shaltiel, 

	Jad Silbak</title>
    <summary>Consider a PPT two-party protocol ?=(A,B) in which the parties get no private inputs and obtain outputs O^A,O^B?{0,1}, and let V^A and V^B denote the partiesâ individual views. Protocol ? has ?-agreement if Pr[O^A=O^B]=1/2+?. The leakage of ? is the amount of information a party obtains about the event {O^A=O^B}; that is, the leakage ? is the maximum, over P?{A,B}, of the distance between V^P|OA=OB and V^P|OA!=OB. Typically, this distance is measured in statistical distance, or, in the computational setting, in computational indistinguishability. For this choice, Wullschleger [TCC â09] showed that if ?&gt;&gt;? then the protocol can be transformed into an OT protocol.

We consider measuring the protocol leakage by the log-ratio distance (which was popularized by its use in the differential privacy framework). The log-ratio distance between X,Y over domain ? is the minimal ??0 for which, for every v??, log(Pr[X=v]/Pr[Y=v])? [??,?]. In the computational setting, we use computational indistinguishability from having log-ratio distance ?. We show that a protocol with (noticeable) accuracy ???(?^2) can be transformed into an OT protocol (note that this allows ?&gt;&gt;?). We complete the picture, in this respect, showing that a protocol with ??o(?^2) does not necessarily imply OT. Our results hold for both the information theoretic and the computational settings, and can be viewed as a âfine grainedâ approach to âweak OT amplificationâ.

We then use the above result to fully characterize the complexity of differentially private two-party computation for the XOR function, answering the open question put by Goyal, Khurana, Mironov, Pandey, and Sahai [ICALP â16] and Haitner, Nissim, Omri, Shaltiel, and Silbak [FOCS â18]. Specifically, we show that for any (noticeable) ???(?^2), a two-party protocol that computes the XOR function with ?-accuracy and ?-differential privacy can be transformed into an OT protocol. This improves upon Goyal et al. that only handle ???(?), and upon Haitner et al. who showed that such a protocol implies (infinitely-often) key agreement (and not OT). Our characterization is tight since OT does not follow from protocols in which ??o(?^2), and extends to functions (over many bits) that âcontainâ an âembedded copyâ of the XOR function.</summary>

intervals called a bar code. It is often said that the long intervals represent
the "topological signal" and the short intervals represent "noise". We give
evidence to dispute this thesis, showing that the short intervals encode
geometric information. Specifically, we show that persistent homology detects
the curvature of disks from which points have been sampled. We describe a
general computational framework for solving inverse problems using average
persistence landscapes. In the present application, the average persistence
landscapes of points sampled from disks of constant curvature produce a path in
a Hilbert space which may be learned.

(decision tree) for a function, we may find upper bounds on its quantum query
complexity. More precisely, they have shown that given a decision tree for a
function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to[m]$ whose input can be accessed via queries to its
bits, and a guessing algorithm that predicts answers to the queries, there is a
quantum query algorithm for $f$ which makes at most $O(\sqrt{GT})$ quantum
queries where $T$ is the depth of the decision tree and $G$ is the maximum
number of mistakes of the guessing algorithm. In this paper we give a simple
proof of and generalize this result for functions $f:[\ell]^n \to [m]$ with
non-binary input as well as output alphabets. Our main tool for this
generalization is non-binary span program which has recently been developed for
non-binary functions, as well as the dual adversary bound. As applications of
our main result we present several quantum query upper bounds, some of which
are new. In particular, we show that topological sorting of vertices of a
directed graph $\mathcal{G}$ can be done with $O(n^{3/2})$ quantum queries in
the adjacency matrix model. Also, we show that the quantum query complexity of
the maximum bipartite matching is upper bounded by $O(n^{3/4}\sqrt m + n)$ in
the adjacency list model.

improve software reliability and to speed up performance. Examples include a
Doubly Linked List which allows a faster deletion due to the presence of the

redundant data fields into persistent memory adds a significant write overhead,
and reduces performance. In this work, we focus on three data structures -
Doubly Linked List, B+Tree and Hashmap, and showcase alternate partly
persistent implementations where we only store a limited set of data fields to
persistent memory. After a crash/restart, we use the persistent data fields to
recreate the data structures along with the redundant data fields. We compare
our implementation with the base implementation and show that we achieve
speedups around 5-20% for some data structures, and up to 165% for a

Nong (TOIS, 2013) that computes simultaneously the Lyndon array and the suffix
array of a text in $O(n)$ time using $\sigma + O(1)$ words of working space,
where $n$ is the length of the text and $\sigma$ is the alphabet size. Our
result improves the previous best space requirement for linear time computation
of the Lyndon array. In fact, all the known linear algorithms for Lyndon array
computation use suffix sorting as a preprocessing step and use $O(n)$ words of
working space in addition to the Lyndon array and suffix array. Experimental
results with real and synthetic datasets show that our algorithm is not only
space-efficient but also fast in practice.

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Jan Bydzovsky, Jan Krajicek, Igor C. Oliveira <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12935">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Proving that there are problems in $\mathsf{P}^\mathsf{NP}$ that require
boolean circuits of super-linear size is a major frontier in complexity theory.
While such lower bounds are known for larger complexity classes, existing
results only show that the corresponding problems are hard on infinitely many
input lengths. For instance, proving almost-everywhere circuit lower bounds is
open even for problems in $\mathsf{MAEXP}$. Giving the notorious difficulty of
proving lower bounds that hold for all large input lengths, we ask the
following question: Can we show that a large set of techniques cannot prove
that $\mathsf{NP}$ is easy infinitely often? Motivated by this and related
questions about the interaction between mathematical proofs and computations,
we investigate circuit complexity from the perspective of logic.
</p>
<p>Among other results, we prove that for any parameter $k \geq 1$ it is
consistent with theory $T$ that computational class $\mathcal{C} \nsubseteq
\textit{i.o.}\mathsf{SIZE}(n^k)$, where $(T, \mathcal{C})$ is one of the pairs:
</p>
<p>$T = \mathsf{T}^1_2\;$ and $\;{\cal C} = \mathsf{P}^\mathsf{NP}$, $\quad T =
\mathsf{S}^1_2\;$ and $\;{\cal C} = \mathsf{NP}$, $\quad T = \mathsf{PV}\;$ and
$\;{\cal C} = \mathsf{P}$.
</p>
<p>In other words, these theories cannot establish infinitely often circuit
upper bounds for the corresponding problems. This is of interest because the
weaker theory $\mathsf{PV}$ already formalizes sophisticated arguments, such as
a proof of the PCP Theorem (Pich, 2015). These consistency statements are
unconditional and improve on earlier theorems of Krajicek and Oliveira (2017)
and Bydzovsky and Muller (2018) on the consistency of lower bounds with
$\mathsf{PV}$.

timestamps to detect the information source in a network. The problem incurs
prohibitive cost under canonical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the
source due to the exponential number of possible infection paths. Our main idea
of source detection, however, is to approximate the MLE by an alternative
infection path based estimator, the essence of which is to identify the most
likely infection path that is consistent with observed timestamps. The source
node associated with that infection path is viewed as the estimated source
$\hat{v}$. We first study the case of tree topology, where by transforming the
infection path based estimator into a linear integer programming, we find a
reduced search region that remarkably improves the time efficiency. Within this
reduced search region, the estimator $\hat{v}$ is provably always on a path
which we term as \emph{candidate path}. This notion enables us to analyze the
distribution of $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$, the error distance between $\hat{v}$ and
the true source $v^{\ast}$, on arbitrary tree, which allows us to obtain for
the first time, in the literature provable performance guarantee of the
estimator under limited timestamps. Specifically, on the infinite $g$-regular
tree with uniform sampled timestamps, we get a refined performance guarantee in
the sense of a constant bounded $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$. By virtue of time
labeled BFS tree, the estimator still performs fairly well when extended to
more general graphs. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets further
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms.

shortest unique substring (SUS) for an interval [s, t] if (a) u occurs exactly
once in T, (b) u contains the interval [s, t] (i.e. i \leq s \leq t \leq j),
and (c) every substring v of T with |v| &lt; |u| containing [s, t] occurs at least

propose a 4n + o(n) bits data structure answering an interval SUS query in
output-sensitive O(occ) time, where occ is the number of returned SUSs.
Additionally, we focus on the point SUS problem, which is the interval SUS

with a color. The goal is to cluster the points to minimize the classical
clustering cost but with the additional constraint that no color is
over-represented in any cluster. This problem is motivated by practical
clustering settings, e.g., in clustering news articles where the color of an
article is its source, it is preferable that no single news source dominates
any cluster.
</p>
<p>For the most general version of this problem, we obtain an algorithm that has
provable guarantees of performance; our algorithm is based on finding a
fractional solution using a linear program and rounding the solution
subsequently. For the special case of the problem where no color has an
absolute majority in any cluster, we obtain a simpler combinatorial algorithm
also with provable guarantees. Experiments on real-world data shows that our
algorithms are effective in finding good clustering without
over-representation.

complex modular deep network processes its inputs. The sketch summarizes
essential information about the inputs and outputs of the network and can be
used to quickly identify key components and summary statistics of the inputs.
Furthermore, the sketch is recursive and can be unrolled to identify
sub-components of these components and so forth, capturing a potentially
complicated DAG structure. These sketches erase gracefully; even if we erase a
fraction of the sketch at random, the remainder still retains the `high-weight'
information present in the original sketch. The sketches can also be organized
in a repository to implicitly form a `knowledge graph'; it is possible to
quickly retrieve sketches in the repository that are related to a sketch of
interest; arranged in this fashion, the sketches can also be used to learn
emerging concepts by looking for new clusters in sketch space. Finally, in the
scenario where we want to learn a ground truth deep network, we show that
augmenting input/output pairs with these sketches can theoretically make it
easier to do so.

    <title>TR19-080 |  On List Recovery of High-Rate Tensor Codes | 

	Noga Ron-Zewi, 

	Swastik Kopparty, 

	Shubhangi Saraf, 

	Nicolas Resch, 

	Shashwat Silas</title>
    <summary>We continue the study of list recovery properties of high-rate tensor codes, initiated by Hemenway, Ron-Zewi, and Wootters (FOCS'17). In that work it was shown that the tensor product of an efficient (poly-time) high-rate globally list recoverable code is {\em approximately}  locally list recoverable, as well as globally list recoverable in {\em probabilistic} near-linear time. This was used in turn to give the first capacity-achieving list decodable codes with (1) local list decoding algorithms, and with (2)  {\em probabilistic} near-linear time  global list decoding algorithms. This was also yielded constant-rate codes approaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound  with  {\em probabilistic}  near-linear time global   unique decoding algorithms.

In the current work we obtain the following results:
1. The tensor product of an efficient (poly-time) high-rate globally list recoverable code is globally list recoverable in {\em deterministic} near-linear time. This yields in turn the first capacity-achieving list decodable codes with {\em deterministic} near-linear time global  list decoding algorithms. It also gives constant-rate codes approaching the Gilbert Varshamov bound with {\em deterministic} near-linear time global unique decoding algorithms.

2. If the base code is additionally locally correctable, then the tensor product is (genuinely) locally list recoverable. This yields in turn constant-rate codes approaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound that are {\em locally correctable} with query complexity and running time $N^{o(1)}$. This improves over prior work by Gopi et. al. (SODA'17; IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'18) that only gave query complexity $N^{\epsilon}$ with rate that is exponentially small in $1/\epsilon$.

3. A nearly-tight combinatorial lower bound on output list size for list recovering high-rate tensor codes. This bound implies in turn a nearly-tight lower bound of $N^{\Omega(1/\log \log N)}$ on the product of  query complexity and output list size  for locally list recovering high-rate tensor codes.</summary>

    <title>TR19-079 |  Average Bias and Polynomial Sources | 

	Arnab Bhattacharyya, 

	Philips George John, 

	Suprovat Ghoshal, 

	Raghu Meka</title>
    <summary>We identify a new notion of pseudorandomness for randomness sources, which we call the average bias. Given a distribution $Z$ over $\{0,1\}^n$, its average bias is: $b_{\text{av}}(Z) =2^{-n} \sum_{c \in \{0,1\}^n} |\mathbb{E}_{z \sim Z}(-1)^{\langle c, z\rangle}|$. A source with average bias at most $2^{-k}$ has min-entropy at least $k$, and so low average bias is a stronger condition than high min-entropy. We observe that the inner product function is an extractor for any source with average bias less than $2^{-n/2}$.

  The notion of average bias especially makes sense for polynomial sources, i.e., distributions sampled by low-degree $n$-variate polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$. For the well-studied case of affine sources, it is easy to see that min-entropy $k$ is exactly equivalent to average bias of $2^{-k}$. We show that for quadratic sources, min-entropy $k$ implies that the average bias is at most $2^{-\Omega(\sqrt{k})}$. We use this relation to design dispersers for separable quadratic sources with a min-entropy guarantee.</summary>

    <title>TR19-078 |  Pseudo-Mixing Time of Random Walks | 

	Itai Benjamini, 

	Oded Goldreich</title>
    <summary>We introduce the notion of pseudo-mixing time of a graph define as the number of steps in a random walk that suffices for generating a vertex that looks random to any polynomial-time observer, where, in addition to the tested vertex, the observer is also provided with oracle access to the incidence function of the graph. 

Assuming the existence of one-way functions,
we show that the pseudo-mixing time of a graph can be much smaller than its mixing time.
Specifically, we present bounded-degree $N$-vertex Cayley graphs that have pseudo-mixing time $t$ for any $t(N)=\omega(\log\log N)$. 
Furthermore, the vertices of these graphs can be represented by string of length $2\log_2N$, and the incidence function of these graphs can be computed by Boolean circuits of size $poly(\log N)$.</summary>

Klein studied it in the complex projective plane in 1879, but it wasnât known to have this nice real heptagonal realization until GrÃ¼nbaum and Rigby (1990). The new Wikipedia article on it was started by âTomoâ (whose real-world identity Wikipediaâs arcane outing rules bar me from disclosing, but he just turned 70, so if you figure it out wish him a happy birthday).</p>

    <title>TR19-077 |  Consistency of circuit lower bounds with bounded theories | 

	Jan Bydzovsky, 

	Jan  Krajicek, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira</title>
    <summary>Proving that there are problems in $P^{NP}$ that require boolean circuits of super-linear size is a major frontier in complexity theory. While such lower bounds are known for larger complexity classes, existing results only show that the corresponding problems are hard on infinitely many input lengths. For instance, proving almost-everywhere circuit lower bounds is open even for problems in MAEXP. Giving the notorious difficulty of proving lower bounds that hold for all large input lengths, we ask the following question: 

Can we show that a large set of techniques cannot prove that NP is easy infinitely often? 

Motivated by this and related questions about the interaction between mathematical proofs and computations, we investigate circuit complexity from the perspective of logic.

  Among other results, we prove that for any parameter $k \geq 1$ it is consistent with theory $T$ that computational class $C$ is not contained infinitely often in SIZE$(n^k)$, where $(T, C)$ is one of the pairs:

  $T = T^1_2\;$ and $\;C = P^{NP}$, $\quad T = S^1_2\;$ and $\;C = NP$, $\quad T =~ $PV$\;$ and $C = P$.

  In other words, these theories cannot establish infinitely often circuit upper bounds for the corresponding problems. This is of interest because the weaker theory PV already formalizes sophisticated arguments, such as a proof of the PCP Theorem (Pich, 2015). These consistency statements are unconditional and improve on earlier theorems of Krajicek and Oliveira (2017) and Bydzovsky and Muller (2018) on the consistency of lower bounds with PV.</summary>

Apparently, itâs a busy life being an assistant prof so there were no posts here all year. However, while some of us are decompressing after the NeurIPS deadline, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oegc0quwv2PqoR_pzZlUIrPw4rFsZ4FKoKkUvmLBTHM/edit?usp=sharing">here is a link</a> to a crowdsourced spreadsheet created to collect information about theory jobs this year. 
Congratulations to both job seekers and departments/labs who are done with their searches!</p>

<p>In the past my academic uncle Lance Fortnow set this spreadsheet up (check <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/06/theory-jobs-2016.html">this link</a> to his post from two years ago which also has links to all the previous years). This year the first entry is Lance himself who is moving back to Chicago to be the Dean of the College of Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Did Lance get the idea from his advisor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sipser">Michael Sipser</a> who is also a Dean of Science but at MIT? In any case, great to see theoretical computer scientists stepping up to be the deans of science, congratulations!</p>

<p>Rules about the spreadsheet have been copied from last years and all edits to the document are anonymized. Please, post a comment if you have any suggestions about the rules.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Separate sheets for faculty, industry and postdocs/visitors. </li>
 <li>People should be connected to theoretical computer science, broadly defined.</li>
 <li>Only add jobs that you are absolutely sure have been offered and accepted. This is not the place for speculation and rumors. </li>
 <li>You are welcome to add yourself, or people your department has hired. </li>
</ul>

<p>This document will continue to grow as more jobs settle.</p>

    <title>NSF Panels</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The government shut down in January led to delays at the National Science Foundation and only recently announcing decisions on grants submitted last fall. For those who successfully received awards, congratulations! For those who didn't, don't take it personally, buckle up and try again.<br/>
<br/>
For those who don't know how the process works, for each grant program, the program directors organize one or more panels which typically meets in person at NSF headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. A typical panel has about a dozen panelists and twenty or so proposals. Before the panels, each proposal gets at least three reviews by the panelists. Discussions ensue over a day or two, proposals get sorted into categories: Highly Competitive, Competitive, Low Competitive and Not Competitive and then ranked ordered in the top categories.<br/>
<br/>
There are tight rules for Conflict-of-Interest and those who are conflicted have to leave the room during the discussions on those papers.<br/>
<br/>
If you do get asked to serve on a panel, you should definitely do so. You get to see how the process works and help influence funding and research directions in your field. You can't reveal when you serve on a particular panel but you can say "Served on NSF Panels" on your CV.<br/>
<br/>
Panels tend to take proposals that will likely make progress and not take ones less risky. Funding risky proposals is specifically mentioned to the panel but when push comes to shove and there is less funding than worthy proposals, panelists gravitate towards proposals that don't take chances.<br/>
<br/>
Panels are not unlike conference program committees. It didn't always work this way, it used to be more like journal publications. I remember when the program director would send out proposals for outside reviews and then make funding decisions. That gave the program director more discretion to fund a wider variety of proposals.<br/>
<br/>
The NSF budget for computing goes up slowly while the number of academic computer scientists grows at a much larger clip. Until this changes, we'll have more and more worthy proposals unfunded, particularly proposals of bold risky projects. That's the saddest part of all.</div>

    <title>Individual Notions of Fairness You Can Use</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><u>Individual Notions of Fairness You Can Use</u></span></div><br/>Our group at Penn has been thinking about when <i>individual </i>notions of fairness might be practically achievable for awhile, and we have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10660">two</a>Â <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10607">new</a>Â approaches.<br/><br/><span style="font-size: large;"><u>Background</u>:</span><br/><u>Statistical Fairness</u><br/>I've written about this before, <a href="http://aaronsadventures.blogspot.com/2017/11/between-statistical-and-individual.html">here</a>. But briefly: there are two families of definitions in the fairness in machine learning literature. The first group of definitions, which I call <i>statistical</i>Â fairness notions, is far and away the most popular. If you want to come up with your own statistical fairness notion, you can follow this recipe:<br/><ol><li>Partition the world into a small number of "protected sub-groups". You will probably be thinking along the lines of race or gender or something similar when you do this.</li><li>Pick your favorite error/accuracy metric for a classifier. This might literally be classification error, or false positive or false negative rate, or positive predictive value, or something else. Lots of options here.Â </li><li>Ask that this metric be approximately equalized across your protected groups.</li><li>Finally, enjoy your new statistical fairness measure! Congratulations!</li></ol><div>These definitions are far and away the most popular in this literature, in large part (I think) because they are so immediately actionable. Because they are defined as conditions on a small number of expectations, you can easily check whether your classifier is "fair" according to these metrics, and (although there are some interesting computational challenges) go and try and learn classifiers subject to these constraints.Â </div><div><br/></div><div>Their major problem is related to the reason for their success: they are defined as conditions on a small number of expectations or <i>averages</i>Â over people, and so they don't promise much to particular individuals. I'll borrow an example from our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05144">fairness gerrymandering</a> paper from a few years ago to put this in sharp relief. Imagine that we are building a system to decide who to incarcerate, and we want to be "fair" with respect to both gender (men and women) and race (green and blue people). We decide that in our scenario, it is the false positives who are harmed (innocent people sent to jail), and so to be fair, we decide should equalize the false positive rate: across men and women, and across greens and blues. But one way to do this is to jail all green men and blue women. This does indeed equalize the false positive rate (at 50%) across all four of the groups we specified, but is cold comfort if you happen to be a green man --- since then you will be jailed with certainty. The problem was our fairness constraint was never a promise to an individual to begin with, just a promise about the average behavior of our classifier over a large group. And although this is a toy example constructed to make a point, things like this happen in real data too.Â </div><br/><u>Individual Fairness</u><br/>Individual notions of fairness, on the other hand, really do correspond to promises made to individuals. There are at least two kinds of individual fairness definitions that have been proposed: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2090255">metric fairness</a>, and <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6355-fairness-in-learning-classic-and-contextual-bandits">weakly meritocratic fairness</a>. Metric fairness proposes that the learner will be handed a <i>task specific similarity metric</i>, and requires that individuals who are close together in the metric should have a similar probability of being classified as positive. Weakly meritocratic fairness, on the other hand, takes the (unknown) labels of an individual as a measure of merit, and requires that individuals who have a higher probability of really having a positive label should have only a higher probability of being classified as positive. This in particular implies that false positive and false negative rates should be equalized <i>across individuals</i>, where now the word <i>rate</i>Â is averaging over only the randomness of the classifier, not over people. What makes both of these <i>individual</i>Â notions of fairness is that they impose constraints that bind on all pairs of individuals and not just over averages of people.<br/><br/>Definitions like this have the advantage of strong individual-level semantics, which the statistical definitions don't have. But they also have big problems: for metric fairness, the obvious question is: <i>where does the metric come from</i>? Even granting that fairness should be some Lipschitz condition on a metric, it seems hard to pin down what the metric is, and different people will disagree: coming up with the metric seems to encapsulate a large part of the original problem of defining fairness. For weakly meritocratic fairness, the obvious problem is that we don't know what the labels are. Its possible to do non-trivial things if you make assumptions about the label generating process, but its not at all clear you can do any non-trivial learning subject to this constraint if you don't make strong assumptions.<br/><br/><span style="font-size: large;"><u>Two New Approaches:</u></span><br/>We have two new approaches, building off of metric fairness and weakly meritocratic fairness respectively. Both have the advantages of statistical notions of fairness in that they can be put into practice without making unrealistic assumptions about the data, and without needing to wait on someone to hand us a metric. But they continue to make meaningful promises to individuals.<br/><br/><u>Subjective Individual Fairness</u><br/>Lets start with our variant of metric fairness, which we call subjective individual fairness. (This is joint work with Michael Kearns, our PhD students Chris Jung and Seth Neel, our former PhD student Steven Wu, and Steven's student (our grand student!) Logan Stapleton). The paper is here:Â <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10660">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10660</a>. We stick with the premise that "similar people should be treated similarly", and that whether or not it is correct/just/etc., it is at least fair to treat two people the same way, in the sense that we classify them as positive with the same probability. But we don't want to assume anything else.<br/><br/>Suppose I were to create a machine learning fairness panel: I could recruit "AI Ethics" experts, moral philosophers, hyped up consultants, people off the street, toddlers, etc. I would expect that there would be as many different conceptions of fairness as there were people on the panel, and that none of them could precisely quantify what they meant by fairness --- certainly not in the form of a "fairness metric". But I could still ask these people, in particular cases, if they thought it was fair that two particular individuals be treated differently or not.<br/><br/>Of course, I would have no reason to expect that the responses that I got from the different panelists would be consistent with one another --- or possibly even internally consistent (we won't assume, e.g. that the responses satisfy any kind of triangle inequality). Nevertheless, once we fix a data distribution and a group of people who have opinions about fairness, we have a well defined tradeoff we can hope to manage: any classifier we could choose will have both:<br/><ol><li>Some error rate, and</li><li>Some frequency with which it makes a pair of decisions that someone in the group finds unfair.Â </li></ol><div>We can hope to find classifiers that optimally trade off 1 and 2: note this is a coherent tradeoff even though we haven't forced the people to try and express their conceptions of fairness into some consistent metric. What we show is that you can do this.Â </div><div><br/></div><div>Specifically, given a set of pairs that we have determined should be treated similarly, there is an <i>oracle efficient </i>algorithm that can find the optimal classifier subject to the constraint that no pair of individuals that has been specified as a constraint should have a substantially different probability of positive classification. Oracle efficiency means that what we can do is reduce the "fair learning" problem to a regular old learning problem, without fairness constraints. If we can solve the regular learning problem, we can also solve the fair learning problem. This kind of fairness constraint also generalizes in the standard way: if you ask your fairness panel about a reasonably small number of pairs, and then solve the in-sample problem subject to these constraints, the classifier you learn will also satisfy the fairness constraints out of sample. And it works: we implement the algorithm and try it out on the COMPAS data set, with fairness constraints that we elicited from 43 human (undergrad) subjects. The interesting thing is that once you have an algorithm like this, it isn't only a tool to create "fair" machine learning models: its also a new instrument to investigate human conceptions of fairness. We already see quite a bit of variation among our 43 subjects in our preliminary experiments. We plan to pursue this direction more going forward.</div><div><br/></div><div><u>Average Individual Fairness</u></div><div>Next, our variant of weakly meritocratic fairness. This is joint work with Michael Kearns and our student Saeed Sharifi. The paper is here:Â <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10607">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10607</a>.Â In certain scenarios, it really does seem tempting to think about fairness in terms of false positive rates. Criminal justice is a great example, in the sense that it is clear that everyone agrees on which outcome they <i>want</i>Â (they would like to be released from jail), and so the people we are being unfair to really do seem to be the false positives: the people who should have been released from jail, but who were mistakenly incarcerated for longer. So in our "fairness gerrymandering" example above, maybe the problem with thinking about false positive rates wasn't a problem with <i>false positives</i>, but with <i>rates</i>: i.e. the problem was that the word rate averaged over many people, and so it didn't promise <i>you</i>Â anything. Our idea is to redefine the word rate.Â </div><div><br/></div><div>In some (but certainly not all) settings, people are subject to not just one, but many classification tasks. For example, consider online advertising: you might be shown thousands of targeted ads each month. Or applying for schools (a process that is centralized in cities like New York): you apply not just to one school, but to many. In situations like this, we can model the fact that we have not just a distribution over people, but also a distribution over (or collection of) problems.Â </div><div><br/></div><div>Once we have a distribution over problems, we can define the error rate, or false positive rate, or any other rate you like <i>for individuals. </i>It is now sensible to talk about Alice's false positive rate, or Bob's error rate, because rate has been redefined as an average over problems, for a particular individual. So we can now ask for individual fairness notions in the spirit of the statistical notions of fairness we discussed above! We no longer need to define protected groups: we can now ask that the false positive rates, or error rates, be equalized across all pairs of people.Â </div><div><br/></div><div>It turns out that given a reasonably sized sample of people, and a reasonably sized sample of problems, it is tractable to find the optimal classifier subject to constraints like this in sample, and that these guarantees generalize out of sample. The in-sample algorithm is again an oracle-efficient algorithm, or in other words, a reduction to standard, unconstrained learning. The generalization guarantee here is a little interesting, because now we are talking about simultaneous generalization in two different directions: to people we haven't seen before, and also to problems we haven't seen before. This requires thinking a little bit about what kind of object we are even trying to output: a mapping from new problems to classifiers. The details are in the paper (spoiler --- the mapping is defined by the optimal dual variables for the empirical risk minimization problem): here, I'll just point out that again, the algorithm is practical to implement, and we perform some simple experiments with it.Â </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><br/><br/><br/></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>An inadequately-explained phenomenon in computational complexity theory is that there are so few natural candidates for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-intermediate">-intermediate problems</a>, problems in  but neither in  nor -complete. Of course, if  there are none, and the <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/Schaefer's dichotomy theorem">dichotomy theorem</a> implies that there are no intermediate Boolean constraint satisfaction problems. But there are a lot of other types of problems in , and a theorem of Ladner<sup id="fnref:l"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:l">1</a></sup> shows that there should be an infinite hierarchy of degrees of hardness within . So where are all the members of this hierarchy, and why are they so shy?</p>

<p>The same thing happens not just for  but for other related complexity classes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%99%AFP"/>. There should be many -intermediate classes but we know even fewer than for . <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102118180704402052">I recently posted</a> about a discussion I had with Igor Pak on this issue, in which we suggested to each other two number-theoretic candidates for being -intermediate, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function">Euler totient function</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function">prime-counting function</a> (see also <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/43954/95">Igorâs StackExchange question on this</a>). But although theyâre in , neither of these functions is very combinatorial.</p>

<p>So anyway, the point of all this is to discuss more candidates for being -intermediate that are, I think, natural and combinatorial. Theyâre part of a family of problems that include a couple of related candidates for being -intermediate, and even a candidate for being -intermediate. These problems come from computational learning theory, or alternatively they can be seen as coming from mathematical logic, hereditary graph theory, and the theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_graph">Rado graph</a>. And theyâre all at what is in some sense the shallow end of the intermediate problems: theyâre solvable in quasi-polynomial time, meaning , but not known to be solvable in polynomial time. So this is pretty strong evidence that theyâre not complete for their respective complexity classes, but weaker evidence than usual that theyâre not polynomial.</p>

<p>In learning theory, a family of sets  is said to <em>shatter</em> another set  (not necessarily belonging to ) if every subset of , including the empty set and  itself, can be obtained by intersecting  with some member of . The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension">VapnikâChervonenkis dimension</a> of  is just the size of the largest set that is shattered by  . If we let  (the number of sets in the family) and  (the number of distinct elements in those sets), then the dimension is clearly at most , because sets of size larger than  have too many subsets for them all to be formed by intersection with a member of . Therefore, the following problem can be solved in quasipolynomial time, by a brute-force search of the  small-enough subsets of :<sup id="fnref:lmr"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:lmr">2</a></sup></p>

<dl>
  <dt>VC-dimension (largest shattered set)</dt>
  <dd>Input: family of sets , number 

    <p>Output: true if  shatters a set of size , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>The same quasipolynomial time bound applies to the following related problems,
the first of which is also in  and the second of which is in :</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Smallest non-shattered set</dt>
  <dd>Input: family of sets , number 

    <p>Output: True if there exists a subset  of 
of size  that is not shattered by , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Number of shattered sets</dt>
  <dd>Input: family of sets 

    <p>Output: the number of sets shattered by .</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>For the first two problems, being non--complete hinges on the assumption that , but for the number of shattered sets, being non--complete (under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_counting_reduction">counting reductions</a>) is unconditional: the output doesnât provide enough bits of information to encode the answers to all other  problems.
The VC-dimension is hard to approximate under a form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential time hypothesis</a>, strongly suggesting that it cannot be computed exactly in polynomial time.<sup id="fnref:mr"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:mr">3</a></sup></p>

<p>To see that the two existence problems can sometimes both have answers that are logarithmic, itâs helpful to turn to the theory of random graphs, and of <em>the</em> random graph, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_graph">Rado graph</a>. This graph obeys a collection of <em>extension axioms</em> according to which, for every two disjoint finite subsets of vertices, there exists another vertex adjacent to everything in the first subset and to nothing in the second subset. Using these axioms, we can build up induced copies of any finite or countable subgraph, one vertex at a time, using a greedy algorithm. Based on this property, letâs define a subset  of the vertices in an undirected graph to be <em>extensible</em> if, for every partition of  into two disjoint subsets, there exists another vertex outside  that is adjacent to everything in the first subset and to nothing in the second subset. This is nothing more than being shattered by the neighborhoods of the vertices outside . So we have the following corresponding problems.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Largest extensible set</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph , number 

    <p>Output: true if  has an extensible set of size , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Smallest non-extensible set</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph , number 

    <p>Output: true if  has a non-extensible set of size , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Smallest missing induced subgraph</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph , number 

    <p>Output: true if there is a graph  on at most  vertices that
is not an induced subgraph of , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Number of extensible sets</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph 

    <p>Output: The number of extensible sets of vertices of .</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>The smallest missing induced subgraph size naturally falls into the complexity class  of problems for which you can guess a solution (the missing subgraph) but then verifying it involves solving a co- problem (is this subgraph missing).
It is greater than the size of the smallest non-extensible set, because if you try to build up a given induced subgraph by adding one vertex at a time greedily you can only get stuck at a non-extensible set. There must be a missing induced subgraph of size at most , because there are  isomorphism classes of -vertex labeled graphs and fewer than  ways of choosing which of the  labeled vertices correspond to vertices of , so for larger values of  than this bound there are more labeled graphs than placements of them as induced subgraphs. Another way of thinking about the smallest missing induced subgraph problem is that we are asking for the largest  for which  is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_graph">-universal</a>: it contains all graphs on at most  vertices as induced subgraphs.</p>

<p>The smallest non-extensible set and the smallest missing subgraph are both easy on any hereditary class of graphs, because these classes always have a missing subgraph of size . On the other hand, if  is chosen uniformly at random among the -vertex graphs, then any small subset of its vertices is extensible with high probability, so the smallest non-extensible set has expected size .</p>

<p>If these problems are not - and -complete, what are they? Papadimitriou and Yannakakis<sup id="fnref:py"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:py">4</a></sup> define a complexity class , and show that VC-dimension is -complete. Presumably, because itâs so similar, the same is true for the largest extensible set. Maybe itâs possible to prove completeness for the smallest missing induced subgraph in an analogue of  at the level of , and to prove completeness for the number of shattered sets and number of extensible sets in an analogue of  at this level.</p>

    <title>separating fact from fiction with the 56% of Americans say Arabic Numerals should not be taught in school</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
On the excellent TV show Veep there was a subplot about a political candidate (who himself had failed algebra in HS) objecting to Algebra since it was invented by the Muslims. I don't recall the exact line, but he said something like `Math teachers are terrorists'<br/>
This was, of course, fiction.<br/>
<br/>
The same week I read that 56% of survey respondents say `<u><i>Arabic Numerals' shouldn't be taught in</i></u> <i><u>schools'</u></i> Obviously also a fiction. Perhaps a headline from <i>The Onion</i>.<br/>
<br/>
No. The story is true.<br/>
<br/>
See snopes entry on this:Â <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/teaching-arabic-numerals/">here</a><br/>
<br/>
but also see many FALSE but FUNNY websites:<br/>
<br/>
Sarah Palin wants Arabic Numerals out of the schools:Â <a href="http://nationalreport.net/sarah-palin-wants-arabic-numerals-banned-americas-schools/">here</a>Â Funny but false.<br/>
<br/>
Jerry Brown is forcing students in California to learn Arabic Numerals as part of multi-culturism False by funny:Â Â <a href="https://me.me/i/sharia-law-must-be-stopped-under-gov-brown-students-in-20990368">here</a><br/>
<br/>
A website urging us to use Roman Numerals (which Jesus used!) False but funny:Â Â <a href="http://freedomnumerals.com/">here</a><br/>
<br/>
OKAY, what to make of the truth that really, really, 56% of Americans are against Arab Numerals<br/>
<br/>
1) Bigotry combined with ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
2) Some of the articles I read about this say its a problem with polls and people. There may be some of that, but still worries me.<br/>
<br/>
3) In Nazi Germany (WOW- Goodwin's law popped up rather early!) they stopped teaching relativity because Albert Einstein was Jewish (the story is more complicated than that, seeÂ <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-2-pro-nazi-nobelists-attacked-einstein-s-jewish-science-excerpt1/">her</a>e). That could of course never happen in America now (or could it, seeÂ <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/50097/time-warp">here</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Counterexamples_to_Relativity">here</a>).<br/>
<br/>
4) There is no danger that we will dump Arabic Numerals. I wonder if we will change there name to Freedom Numerals.<br/>
<br/>
5) Ignorance of science is a more immediate problem with the anti-vax people. SeeÂ <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/measles-outbreak-grows-with-60-new-cases-across-26-states?ref=home">here</a><br/>

You can find the transcript of the interview below. My questions are labelled with <b>LA</b>, Andy's answers with <b>AP</b> and Jamie's with <b>JG</b>. I hope that you'll enjoy reading their insights and the story of their award-receiving work as much as I did myself. <br/><br/><div dir="ltr"><b>LA: </b>You are receiving the 2019 Alonzo Church Award  for  Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation as well as the  Test-of-Time Award from LICS 1999 for your invention of nominal  techniques to provide a semantic understanding of abstract syntax with  binding.Â Â  Could you briefly describe the history of the ideas that led  you to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_model">permutation model of set theory with atoms</a> due to  Fraenkel and Mostowski to represent name abstraction and fresh name  generation? What were the  main inspirations and motivations for your work? In your opinion, how  did nominal techniques advance the state of the art at that time?</div><div dir="ltr"/><br/><div dir="ltr"><b>AP: </b>I have had a long-standing interest in the mathematical semantics of programming language features that restrict resources to a specific scope, or hide information from a program's environment; think local mutable state in languages like <a href="http://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, or channel-name restriction in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">pi-calculus</a>. When <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/stark/">Ian Stark</a> was doing his PhD with me in the 90s we tried to understand a simple instance: the observable properties of higher-order functions combined with dynamically generated atomic names that can be tested for equality, but don't have any other attribute -- we called this the "nu-calculus". Ian gave a denotational semantics for the nu-calculus using Moggi's monad for modelling dynamic allocation. That monad is defined on the category of pullback-preserving functors from the category of injective functions between finite ordinals to the category of sets. This functor category was well-known to me from topos theory, where it is called <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Schanuel+topos">Schanuel's topos </a>and hosts the generic model of a geometric theory of an infinite decidable set.  A few years later, when Jamie joined me as a PhD student in 1998, I suggested we look at the Schanuel topos as a setting for initial algebra semantics of syntax involving binding operations, modulo alpha-equivalence. I think Jamie prefers set theory over category theory, so he pushed us to use another known equivalent presentation of the Schanuel topos, in terms of continuous actions of the group of permutations of the set N of natural numbers (topologized as a subspace of the product of countably many copies of N). In this form there is an obvious connection with the cumulative hierarchy of sets (with atoms) that are hereditarily finitely supported with respect to the action of permuting atoms. This universe of sets was devised by Fraenkel and Mostowski in the first part of the twentieth century to model ZFA set theory without axioms of choice.  Whether one emphasises set theory or category theory, the move to making permutations of names, rather than injections between sets of names, the primary concept was very fruitful. For example, it certainly makes higher-order constructions (functions and powersets) in the topos/set-theory easier to describe and use. We ended up with a generic construction for name-abstraction modulo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Alpha_equivalence">alpha-equivalence</a> compatible with classical higher-order logic or set theory, so long as one abstains from unrestricted use of choice. </div><div dir="ltr"/><div dir="ltr"><br/><b>JG:</b> At the time it wasn't an idea to consider names as elements of a distinctive datatype of names, with properties just like other datatypes such as the natural numbers Nat. If we want to add 1 to 1, we take 1:Nat and invoke the "plus" function, which is a specific thing associated to Nat; so why not abstract a in x by assuming a:Atm (where Atm is a distinct thing in our mathematical universe) and x:X and invoking a function "abstract", which is a thing associated to Atm?  We unfolded the implications of this idea in set theory and rediscovered FM sets.  I was inspired by the way I saw mathematics built up in ZF set theory as an undergraduate, starting from a simple basis and building up the cumulative hierarchy.  When I saw the chance to do this for a universe with names, I jumped at the chance.  It turns out FM sets are not required.  Nominal techniques can be built in ZFA set theory, which contains more functions and permits unrestricted choice. </div><div dir="ltr"><br/><b>LA: </b>Over  the last fifteen years, nominal techniques have become a fundamental  tool for modelling locality in computation, underlying research  presented in over a hundred papers, new programming languages and models  of computation. They have applications to the syntax and semantics of  programming languages, to logics for machine-assisted reasoning about  programming-language semantics and to the automatic verification of  specifications in process calculi. Variations on nominal sets are used  in automata theory over infinite alphabets, with applications to  querying XML and databases, and also feature in work on models of  Homotopy Type Theory. When did it dawn on you that you had succeeded in  finding a very good model for name abstraction and fresh name  generation, and one that would have a  lot of impact? Did you imagine that your model would generate such a  large amount of follow-up work, leading to a whole body of work on  nominal computation theory? <br/><br/><b>AP: </b>No, to begin with I was very focussed on getting better techniques for computing and reasoning about syntax with bound names. But that only represents a part of the current broad landscape of nominal techniques, the part that mainly depends on the mathematical notion of "finite support" (a way of expressing, via name-permutation, that an object only involves finitely many names). Independently of us, some people realised that a related notion of finiteness, "orbit-finiteness" (which expresses that an object is finite modulo symmetries) is crucial for many applications of nominal techniques. I am referring to the work of Montanari and Pistore on pi-calculus and <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82414059.pdf">HD automata </a>using named sets (yet another equivalent of the Schanuel topos) and the work on automata theory over infinite alphabets (and much else besides) using "sets with atoms" by the Warsaw group (Bojanczyk, Klin, Lasota, Torunczyk,...). The latter is particularly significant because it considers groups of symmetry for atoms other than the full permutation group (in which the only property of an atom preserved under symmetry is its identity). <br/><br/><b>JG:</b> Yes, I did.  Nobody could anticipate the specific applications but I knew we were on to something, which is why I stayed on to build the field after the PhD.  The amount of structure was just too striking.  This showed early: e.g. in the equivariance properties, and the commutation of nominal atoms-abstraction with function-spaces.  When I sent the proof of this property to Andrew, at first he didn't believe it!  I had a sense that there was something deep going on and I still do. <br/><br/><b>LA: </b>What is the result of  yours on nominal techniques you are most proud of? And what are your  favourite results amongst those achieved by others on nominal computation?<b/><br/><b><br/></b><b>AP:</b> Not so much a specific result, but rather a logical concept, the freshness quantifier (which we wrote using an upside down "N" -- N stands for "New"). In informal practice when reasoning about syntax involving binders, one often chooses <i>some</i> fresh name for the bound variable, but then has to revise that choice in view of later ones; but fortunately <i>any </i>fresh name does as well as some particular one. This distinctive "some/any" property occurs all over the place when computing and reasoning about languages with binders and the freshness quantifier formalises it, in terms of the freshness ("not in the support of") relation and conventional quantifiers.  For the second part of your question I would choose two things. One is the work by Jamie with Fernandez and Mackie on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540106001635">nominalrewriting systems</a>, which won the PPDP Most Influential Paper 10-year Award in 2014. The second is the characterisation of orbit-finite sets with atoms in terms of "set-builder expressions"---see Klin et al, "<a href="https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~szymtor/papers/locfin.pdf">Locally Finite Constraint Satisfaction Problems</a>", Proc. LICS 2015); it's a nice application of the classical model theory of homogeneous structures with interesting applications for languages that compute with finite structures. <br/><br/><b>JG:</b> Thanks for asking.  Aside from the initial papers, my work on nominal rewriting with Fernandez has probably had most impact.  However, I am rather fond of the thread of research going from Nominal Algebra, through the axiomatisation of substitution and first-order logic and the characterisation of quantification as a limit in nominal sets, and on to Stone duality.  It's a mathematical foundation built from a nominal perspective of naming and quantification and I hope that as the state of the art in nominal techniques advances and broadens, it might prove useful.  Andrew's book has been helpful in marking out nominal techniques as a field.  I also agree with Andrew that orbit-finiteness and the applications of this idea to transition systems and automata, is important.  I like the automata work for another concrete reason: nominal techniques were discovered in the context of names and binding in syntax, which has bequeathed a misconception that nominal techniques are <i>only</i> about this.  The Warsaw school of nominal techniques gives an independent illustration of the other applications of these ideas. <br/><b><br/></b><b><b>LA: </b></b>Twenty years have passed since your LICS 1999 paper and the  literature on variations on nominal techniques now contains over a hundred papers. Do you expect any further  development related to the theory and application of nominal techniques in the  coming years? What advice would you give to a PhD student who is  interested in working on topics related to nominal computation today?</div><div dir="ltr"><br/><b>AP: </b> For the purpose of answering your question, let's agree to divide LICS topics into Programming Languages and Semantics (PLS) versus Logic and Algorithms (LAS). (So long as we don't think of it as a dichotomy!) Then it seems to me that applications of nominal techniques to LAS are currently in the ascendant and show no sign of slowing down. My own interests are with PLS and there is still work to be done there. In particular, I would like better support for using nominal techniques within the mainstream interactive theorem proving systems: we have the Nominal Package of Urban and Berghofer for classical higher-order logic within Isabelle (which lead to Urban and Tasson winning the CADE Skolem Award in 2015), but nothing analogous for systems based on dependent type theory, such as Agda, Coq and Lean. Recent work of Swan (arXiv:1702.01556) gives us a better understanding of how to develop nominal sets within constructive logic; but I have yet to see a dependent type theory that both corresponds to some form of constructive nominal logic under Curry-Howard and is sufficiently simple that it appeals to users of systems lke Coq who want to mechanise programming language meta-theory in a nameful style. Really, I would like the utility of the FreshML programming language that Jamie, Mark Shinwell and I proposed in 2003 (and which Mark implemented as a patch of OCaml) restricted to total functional programming in the style of Agda; but I don't quite know how to achieve that. <br/><br/><b>JG:</b> Yes.  We are far from understanding nominal techniques and the field has a lot of life and will continue to surprise.  I've always believed that.  A key sticking-point right now is implementations.  I wrote a paper about this recently, on equivariance and the foundations of nominal techniques.  One point in the paper is a sketch for a next-generation nominal theorem-prover (based on ZFA + equivariance).  I'd like to see this carried out, so if anybody reading this is interested then please be in touch.  I'd also like to see nominal techniques implemented as a package in a language like Haskell, ML, or even Python!  If we can get this stuff into the working programmer's toolbox, in a way that just works and does not require special configuration, then that would be helpful.  I suspect that nominal techniques as currently presented in the maths papers, might not fit into a programming language at the moment.  The theory is too strong and may need weakened first.  We need a subset of nominal techniques weak enough to squeeze into an existing language, yet expressive enough for interesting applications.  Some general advice, specifically for the PhD student.  If you have an idea which most people around you don't understand, consider this may be a gap in the collective imagination.  There can be peer pressure when faced by incomprehension to blame yourself, back down, and think about something else.  By all means do this, but only if you yourself judge it right to do so. <br/><br/></div><b>LA: </b>Is there any general research-related lesson you have learnt in the process of working on nominal techniques?<br/><br/><b>AP: </b>On the one hand, don't lose sight of what application your theory is supposed to be good for; but on the other hand, let beauty and simplicity be your guide.<br/><br/><b>JG:</b> Yes:<br/><ul><li>Proving stuff is 30% of the work; convincing people is 70%.Â </li><li>It's the basic ideas that are hard, not the complicated theorems.</li><li>Competence and imagination are orthogonal.Â </li><li>It's doesn't have to be complex to be clever.Â </li><li>Elegant + applicable is a potent combination.Â </li><li>Seek out good listeners.  Give up quickly on bad ones.  Try to be a good listener.Â </li><li>Other people have a lot to teach you, but it might not be the things you expected.Â </li><li>Writing papers is fun. Â  </li></ul><b>LA: </b>Thanks to both of you for your willingness to answer my questions and congratulations for the awards you will be receiving this summer!</div>

    <title>TR19-076 |  The Equivalences of Refutational QRAT | 

	Leroy Chew, 

	Judith Clymo</title>
    <summary>The solving of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) has been advanced considerably in the last two decades. In response to this, several proof systems have been put forward to universally verify QBF solvers. 
QRAT by Heule et al. is one such example of this and builds on technology from DRAT, a checking format used in propositional logic. 
Recent advances have shown conditional optimality results for QBF systems that use extension variables.
Since QRAT can simulate Extended Q-Resolution, we know it is strong, but we do not know if QRAT has the strategy extraction property as Extended Q-Resolution does. In this paper, we partially answer this question by showing that QRAT with a restricted reduction rule has strategy extraction (and consequentially is equivalent to Extended Q-Resolution modulo NP).
We also extend equivalence to another system, as we show an augmented version of QRAT known as QRAT+, developed by Lonsing and Egly, is in fact equivalent to the basic QRAT. We achieve this by constructing a line-wise simulation of QRAT+ using only steps valid in QRAT.</summary>

    <title>More matching-mimicking networks</title>
    <summary>My paper with Vijay Vazirani on parallel matching (soon to appear in SPAA) is based on the idea of a âmatching-mimicking networkâ. If is a graph with a designated set of terminal vertices, then a matching-mimicking network for is another graph with the same terminals that has the same pattern of matchings. Here, by a pattern of matchings, I mean a family of subsets of , the subsets that can be covered by a matching that also covers all non-terminal vertices. We included a messy case analysis that, after some simplifications due to symmetry, had 21 cases for the matching mimicking networks on at most three terminals.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/02/01/parallel-matching-in.html">paper with Vijay Vazirani on parallel matching</a> (soon to appear in <a href="http://spaa.acm.org/2019/">SPAA</a>) is based on the idea of a âmatching-mimicking networkâ.

<p>By now, I think I understand patterns of matchings a lot better, enough to do the three-terminal case in only four cases and to extend the analysis to four terminals in only seven more cases. The starting point is the observation that these patterns of matchings are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-matroid">even Î-matroids</a>.</p>

<p>One way to think of a Î-matroid is that itâs just a convex polyhedron or polytope in Euclidean space of some dimension , with the properties that all vertex coordinates are  or  and all edge lengths are  or . An even Î-matroid has the stronger property that all edge lengths are , as is true for the three-dimensional regular tetrahedron with vertex coordinates (written in a more compact form as bitvectors) , , , and .</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Regular tetrahedron formed from alternating vertices of a cube" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/tet-in-cube.svg"/></p>

<p>Alternatively one can consider the same kind of structure to be a family of sets, drawn from a universe of  elements that correspond to the dimensions of the space. Each set in the family corresponds to a vertex of the polytope and includes the elements whose coordinates are one. So over the three-element set  the same regular tetrahedron can be written as the family of sets</p>



<p>When expressed in this way, the sets of a Î-matroid obey an exchange axiom: if two sets  and  differ on whether they include some element , then there must exist an element  on which they also differ, so that the symmetric difference of sets  also belongs to the Î-matroid. By repeatedly applying this axiom one can connect  to  by a geodesic path (in Hamming distance) of two-element moves. For the bases of a matroid, we have a stronger requirement that one of the two elements belongs to  and the other belongs to , or equivalently that all sets have the same size, but a Î-matroid relaxes this requirement. Itâs not even required that ! But in an even Î-matroid  and  must be distinct, because otherwise the step would be along an edge of length one. Another way of expressing the extra requirements of an even Î-matroid over an arbitrary Î-matroid is that all sets must have the same parity (all have even size, or all have odd size).</p>

<p>So anyway, back to matching. Suppose that both  and  are sets drawn from a pattern of matchings. Choose arbitrarily a matching representing each set. Then the symmetric difference of these matchings is a collection of disjoint alternating paths and cycles, and we can get from  to  by 
a sequence of steps in which we take the symmetric difference of the current matching by one of the alternating paths. So this gives us not just one geodesic from  to  but a lot of different geodesics, one for each ordering of the alternating paths. Expressed as an exchange axiom, this means that when two sets  and  differ, the elements on which they differ can be partitioned into pairs, the symmetric differences with which can be performed independently. You can pick any subset of the pairs of differing elements, and change each of those pairs, leaving the rest alone. Because this is a strengthening of the even Î-matroid axiom, every matching pattern is an even Î-matroid.</p>

<p>Expressed in polyhedral terms, this stronger exchange axiom means that every two vertices at distance  from each other are connected by a -dimensional hypercube with side length . This is a little weird, because we started with a hypercube but then eliminated half of its vertices (by the parity condition) to get something else. Now we have hypercubes again, of lower dimension. They must be tilted with respect to the coordinate axes: each axis of one of these lower-dimensional hypercubes is tilted at a 45 degree angle with respect to the coordinate system of the overall polytope.</p>

<p>Not every even Î-matroid obeys this sub-hypercube property. On the other hand, I was expecting the matching patterns that are matroids (all sets are the same size) to be transversal matroids (maximal subsets of vertices on one side of a bipartite graph that can be covered by a matching), and they arenât. There is a six-element non-transversal matroid, whose six elements are the edges of a triangle with doubled edges and whose sets are pairs of edges from different sides of the triangle. But it is the pattern of matchings of a tree in which the (non-terminal) root has three children, each of which has two terminals as its children.</p>

<p>Conveniently, whether a 0-1 polyhedron can be represented by a pattern of matchings depends only on its shape and not on its orientation. You can obviously permute the coordinates of a polyhedron that represents a pattern of matchings, by relabeling which coordinate corresponds to which terminal vertex. But you can also reflect the polyhedron across any one of its coordinates by modifying the graph whose matchings represent it in the following way: turn the  terminal vertex for that coordinate into a non-terminal, and attach a new degree-one terminal vertex to it. These permutations and reflections generate all the symmetries of the hypercube in which the 0-1 polyhedron lives. So to find small matching-mimicking networks, we only need to look at one representative 0-1 polyhedron in each symmetry class. If we find a small network for this representative, we can modify it to create a different small matching-mimicking network for every other 0-1 polyhedron with the same shape.</p>

<p>So what are the possible shapes? Letâs define the dimension of a Î-matroid to be the number of coordinates of the polytope that take both values,  and , at different vertices. Then a 0-dimensional even Î-matroid must be a single point (), there are no 1-dimensional even Î-matroids, and a two-dimensional even Î-matroid must be a line segment (). There are two three-dimensional even Î-matroids: a triangle  and the tetrahedron shown above, . The cube exchange axiom for patterns of matching starts to kick in for four-dimensional even Î-matroids, whose vertices must be subsets of the four-dimensional hyperoctahedron . (This is the shape formed from a four-dimensional hypercube by keeping only vertices with the same parity as each other, just as we formed a regular tetrahedron by doing the same thing to a three-dimensional cube.) Hereâs a drawing of  from <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2010/09/26/in-response-to.html">an earlier post</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="The hyperoctahedral graph K_{2,2,2,2}" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2010/k7/cocktail2.svg"/></p>

<p>If there are no two opposite vertices, we get  (a regular tetrahedron, again, but embedded in a four-dimensional way into the hypercube). Otherwise, we must take at least two pairs of opposite vertices to form a square, and the cases are  (only the square),  (a square pyramid),  (an octahedron), ,  (an octahedral pyramid), and  (the hyperoctahedron). All of these polyhedra can be represented as matching-mimicking networks with the additional property that all vertices are terminals:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Matching-mimicking networks for up to four terminals" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/4-terminal-mm.svg"/></p>

<p>Based on these small examples, itâs tempting to guess that when a pattern of matchings includes the empty set, the whole pattern is just the set of matchings on a graph whose edges are the pairs of terminals in the pattern. But it isnât true. The square pyramid , for instance, can represent the pattern of matchings</p>



<p>with the empty set at the apex of the pyramid. In this pattern, even though one can match terminal pairs <span style="white-space: nowrap;">â or â,</span> one canât take the union of those two matchings and cover all four terminals. (This is what you get by reflecting the two middle terminals of the network shown above for ; its matching-mimicking network is a tree with two interior non-terminals and four terminal leaves.) My guess is that the number of patterns of matching should grow quickly relative to the number of graphs, so for large enough numbers of terminals it should not be possible to use graphs without non-terminals or their complements. But I havenât taken the case analysis far enough to find an example of this.</p>

    <summary>Relations and Equivalences Between Circuit Lower Bounds and Karp-Lipton Theorems

A frontier open problem in circuit complexity is to prove P^NP is not in SIZE[n^k] for all k; this is a necessary intermediate step towards NP is not in P/poly. Previously, for several classes containing P^NP, including NP^NP, ZPP^NP, and S_2 P, such lower bounds have been proved via Karp-Lipton-style Theorems: to prove C is not in SIZE[n^k] for all k, we show that C subset Ppoly implies a ``collapse'' D = C for some larger class D, where we already know D is not in SIZE[n^k] for all k. 

It seems obvious that one could take a different approach to prove circuit lower bounds for P^NP that does not require proving any Karp-Lipton-style theorems along the way. We show this intuition is wrong: (weak) Karp-Lipton-style theorems for P^NP are equivalent to fixed-polynomial size circuit lower bounds for P^NP. That is, P^NP not subset SIZE[n^k] for all k if and only if (NP is in P/poly implies PH is in i.o.-P^NP/n).
		
Next, we present new consequences of the assumption NP is in P/poly, towards proving similar results for NP circuit lower bounds. We show that under the assumption, fixed-polynomial circuit lower bounds for NP, nondeterministic polynomial-time derandomizations, and various fixed-polynomial time simulations of NP are all equivalent. Applying this equivalence, we show that circuit lower bounds for NP imply better Karp-Lipton collapses. That is, if NP is not in SIZE[n^k] for all k, then for all C in { ParP, PP, PSPACE, EXP }, C is in P/poly implies C is in i.o.-NP/n^eps for all eps &gt; 0. Note that unconditionally, the collapses are only to MA and not NP.
		
We also explore consequences of circuit lower bounds for a sparse language in NP. Among other results, we show if a polynomially-sparse NP language does not have n^(1+eps)-size circuits, then MA is in i.o.-NP/O(log n), MA is in i.o.-P^{NP[O(log n)]}, and NEXP is not in SIZE[2^o(m)]. Finally, we observe connections between these results and the ``hardness magnification'' phenomena described in recent works.</summary>

Alan Selman is a long-time friend of Ken and I, and is a long-time researcher in complexity theory. Alan was the first president of the organizing <a href="https://www.computationalcomplexity.org/governance.php">body</a> for the Computational Complexity Conferences (CCC). </p>
<p>
Today we salute the <img alt="{0b100010}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0b100010%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0b100010}"/>th edition of the conference and discuss some of the accepted papers.</p>
<p>
The conference, and the governing body, have changed names over the years; by any name it remains an important conference. Alan <a href="https://www.computationalcomplexity.org/documents/first-cfp.pdf">chaired</a> the first program committee with Steve Mahaney and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=648296&amp;picked=prox">edited</a> the first proceedings, in 1986. </p>
<p>
Ken recently saw Alan two weeks ago at the banquet for the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/18-19/NP50">symposium</a> honoring Steve Cook at the University of Toronto. We will cover event, once <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/05/21/making-up-tests/">exams</a> are done. Ken saw another of the CCC past presidents thereâif you wish to guess who, a hint is it was one of Cookâs past students.</p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Six Papers with Some Comments </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are some papers that I, Dick, found interesting from the list of accepted papers. All accepted papers are interesting, of course. I selected six that were on topics that were directly connected with my interests.</p>
<p>
<b>Criticality of Regular Formulas</b>â<a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/rossman/criticality.pdf">paper</a><br/>
Benjamin Rossman<br/>
<i>I thought this was about regular expressions. Shows something about me.</i> Here âregularâ means the in-degree of gates being the same at each level of the circuit. This condition seems likely to be removable as Rossman conjectures, but I doubt it will be easy. The term âcriticalityâ is a parameter that measures how much a random restriction reduces the size of a formula. Think switching lemma.</p>
<p>
<b>Typically-Correct Derandomization for Small Time and Space</b>â<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00565">paper</a><br/>
William Hoza<br/>
<i>I like the notion of typically-correct.</i> Their algorithms work by treating the input as a source of randomness. This idea was pioneered by Oded Goldreich and Avi Wigderson. The title of their 2002 <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/p_rnd02.html">article</a> âDerandomization that is rarely wrong from short advice that is typically goodâ, gives away how one can prove such results. </p>
<p>
<b>Optimal Short-Circuit Resilient Formulas</b>â<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05014">paper</a><br/>
Mark Braverman, Klim Efremenko, Ran Gelles, and Michael Yitayew <br/>
<i>This is on a kind of fault-tolerance.</i> They consider fault-tolerant boolean formulas in which the output of a faulty gate is stuck at one of the gateâs inputs. This is an interesting model of errors, and they show roughly: any formula can be converted into a formula that is not too much bigger and survives even if about <img alt="{1/5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1/5}"/> of the gates are faulty. A surprise is that they use a method related to <i>blockchains</i>. Hmmmmm. Interesting.</p>
<p>
<b>Fourier and Circulant Matrices are Not Rigid</b>â<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07334.pdf">paper</a><br/>
Allen Liu and Zeev Dvir <br/>
<i>A matrix is rigid if its rank cannot be reduced significantly by changing a small number of entries.</i> As you probably know there are plenty of rigid matricesâtake random onesâbut no provable examples of explicit ones. Their beautiful results prove that specific families of matrices are not rigid. These families include ones that were long thought to be rigid. The highlight of this work could be that it suggests new families that may be rigid. </p>
<p>
<b>Average-Case Quantum Advantage with Shallow Circuits</b>â<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12792.pdf">paper</a><br/>
FranÃ§ois Le Gall <br/>
<i>A quest, the quest that tops all othersâis the search for evidence that quantum computers are better than classic ones.</i> Of course, this is nearly impossible, since P=PSPACE is an open problem. So one looks at special classes of computations. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05903.pdf">here</a> for how the quest for âquantum advantageâ meets up with computational complexity.</p>
<p>
<b>Relations and Equivalences Between Circuit Lower Bounds and Karp-Lipton Theorems</b><br/>
<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/075/">paper</a><br/>
Lijie Chen, Dylan McKay, Cody Murray, and Ryan Williams <br/>
<i>Of course I think this is an interesting paper.</i> There is the famous H-score. Perhaps there could be a T-score. This would be the number of times your name is in the title of a published paper. Thus Ron Rivest, for example, has a huge T-score.</p>

    <title>Logic Then and Now</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This week I attended the <a href="https://asl2019.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">Association of Symbolic Logic North American Annual Meeting</a> in New York City, giving a talk on P v NP.<br/>
<br/>
First I must share the announcement that ASL member Tuna Antinel of Lyon 1 University has been arrested in Turkey for his political beliefs. <a href="http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/SoutienTunaAltinel/">This website</a>Â (<a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~adrien.deloro/">English version</a>) has details and how to show your support.<br/>
<br/>
I last attended the ASL annual meeting at Notre Dame in 1993 as a young assistant professor. Back then I talked aboutÂ <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/S0097539793248305">then recent work</a> using a special kind of generic oracle to make the Berman-Hartmanis isomorphism conjecture true. I remember someone coming up to me after the talk saying how excited they were to see such applications of logic. I'm not a theoretical computer scientist, I'm a applied logician.<br/>
<br/>
I asked at my talk this year and maybe 2-3 people were at that 1993 meeting. The attendance seemed smaller and younger, though that could be my memory playing tricks. I heard that the 2018 meeting in Macomb, Illinois drew a larger crowd. New York is expensive and logicians don't get large travel budgets.<br/>
<br/>
Logic like theoretical computer science has gotten more specialized so I was playing catch up trying to follow many of the talks. Mariya Soskova of Wisconsin talked about enumeration degrees that brought me back to the days I sat in logic classes and talks at the University of Chicago. A set A is enumeration reducible to B if from an enumeration of B you can compute an enumeration of A and Mariya gave a great overview of this area.<br/>
<br/>
I learned about the status of an open problem for Turing reducibility: Is there a non-trivial automorphism of the Turing Degrees? A degree is the equivalence class where each class are the languages all computably Turing-reducible to each other. So the question asks if there is a bijection f mapping degrees to degrees, other than identity, that preserves reducibility or lack thereof.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what's known: There are countably many such automorphisms. There is a definable degree C in the arithmetic hierarchy, such that if f(C) = C then f is the identity. Also if f is the identity on all the c.e.-degrees (those equivalence classes containing a computably enumerable set), then f is the identity on all the degrees. Still open if there is more than one automorphism.<br/>
