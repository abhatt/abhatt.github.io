    <title>TR20-033 |  New Exponential Size Lower Bounds against Depth Four Circuits of Bounded Individual Degree | 

	Suryajith Chillara</title>
    <summary>Kayal, Saha and Tavenas [Theory of Computing, 2018] showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size $n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases. Further, the bound is superpolynomial only when $\delta$ is $o(d)$. It is natural to ask if the dependence on $\delta$ in the bound could be weakened. Towards this, in an earlier result [STACS, 2020], we showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d = \Theta(\log^2{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{0.2}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\log{n})}$.

  In this paper, we make further progress by proving that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$, and absolute constants $a$ and $b$ such that $\omega(\log^2n)\leq d\leq n^{a}$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{b}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Our bound is obtained by carefully adapting the proof of Kumar and Saraf [SIAM J. Computing, 2017] to the complexity measure introduced in our earlier work [STACS, 2020].</summary>

    <title>The Importance of Networking</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">People skip conferences because of the coronavirus or for <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241717-publish-and-perish/fulltext">global</a> <a href="https://www.change.org/p/organizers-of-data-science-and-machine-learning-conferences-neurips-icml-aistats-iclr-uai-allow-remote-paper-poster-presentations-at-conferences">warming</a> or just because conferences are too expensive and time consuming. I'm certainly <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext">no fan</a> of the current conference structure but I would never want to virtualize all of them. Even if we could completely recreate the conference experience in virtual reality, people would not hang out in the halls without the commitment of having made the physical trip. I made this point in a tweet with a depressing response.<br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<div dir="ltr" lang="en">
At least in CS theory, I don't see any crucial importance. These days it's easy to follow the latest developments online. If you're interested in someone's work, you just email them and start a collaboration. Sooner or later networking in hallways may become a thing of the past.</div>
— Mahdi Cheraghchi (@cheraghchi) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheraghchi/status/1235792583516975104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2020</a></blockquote>


<br/>
<div>
I don't disagree with anything Mahdi says except for the "crucial importance". Great ideas come from chance encounters and random conversations. Many of my research papers would never have happened if not for a conversation had at a conference or on the plane or train rides that took me there. Harken Gilles Brassard's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604072">origin story</a> of quantum cryptography.<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
One fine afternoon in late October 1979, I was swimming at the beach of a posh
hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Imagine my surprise when this complete stranger
swims up to me and starts telling me, without apparent provocation on my part,
about Wiesner’s quantum banknotes! This was probably the most bizarre, and
certainly the most magical, moment in my professional life<sup>6</sup>. Within hours, we had
found ways to mesh Wiesner’s coding scheme with some of the then-new concepts
of public-key cryptography.... The ideas that Bennett and I tossed around on the beach that day resulted
in the first paper ever published on quantum cryptography, indeed the paper
in which the term “Quantum Cryptography” was coined. </blockquote>
And Footnote 6 read as follows.<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
At the risk of taking some of the magic away, I must confess that it was not by accident that
Bennett and I were swimming at the same beach in Puerto Rico. We were both there for the
20th Annual IEEE Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science. Bennett approached
me because I was scheduled to give a talk on relativized cryptography on the last day of the
Symposium and he thought I might be interested in Wiesner’s ideas. By an amazing coincidence,
on my way to San Juan, I had read Martin Gardner’s account of Bennett’s report on
Chaitin’s Omega, which had just appeared in the November 1979 “Mathematical Games” column
of Scientific American—so, I knew the name but I could not recognize Bennett in that swimmer
because I did not know what he looked like.</blockquote>
After we see a slate of conferences held virtually due to the virus, networking may indeed become a thing of the past. But we'll never know the research not done because of people who never connected.</div></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Scott’s foreword:</strong> This week Steve Ebin, a longtime <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader (and occasional commenter) from the San Francisco tech world, sent me the essay below.  Steve’s essay fit too well with my own recent thoughts, and indeed with this blog’s title, for me not to offer to share it here—and to my surprise and gratitude, Steve agreed.</p>



<p>I guess there are only two things I’d add to what Steve wrote.  First, some commenters took me to task for a misplaced emphasis in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4671">my last coronavirus post</a>, and on further reflection, I now concede that they were right.  When a preventable catastrophe strikes the world, what’s always terrified me most are <em>not</em> the ranting lunatics and conspiracy theorists, even if some of those lunatics actually managed to attain the height of power, from where they played a central role in the catastrophe.  No, what’s terrified me more are the blank-faced bureaucrats who’ve signed the paperwork that amounted to death warrants.  Like, for example, the state regulators who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-testing-delays.html?referringSource=articleShare">ordered the Seattle infectious disease expert to stop</a>, after she’d had enough of the government’s failure to allow corona tests, took it upon herself to start testing anyway, and found lots of positive results.  Notably, only some countries have empowered lunatics, but the blank-faced bureaucrats rule everywhere unless something stronger overrides them.</p>



<p>Second, I’ll forever ask myself what went wrong with me, that it took me until metaphorical 1939 to acknowledge the scale of an unfolding catastrophe (on more than a purely intellectual level)—even while others were trying to tell me way back in metaphorical 1933.  Even so, better metaphorical 1939 than metaphorical 1946.</p>



<p><strong>Without further ado, Steve’s essay:</strong></p>



<p>The most expensive meal I ever ate was in San Francisco at a restaurant called Eight Tables. As the name implies, the restaurant has only eight tables. The meal cost $1,000 and featured 12 courses, prepared by award-winning chefs.</p>



<p>The most expensive meal a person ever ate was in late 2019, in China, and consisted of under-cooked bat meat. It cost trillions of dollars. The person who ate it, possibly a peasant, changed the course of the 21st century. The bat he ate contained a virus, and the virus threatened to spread from this man to the rest of humanity.</p>



<p>I’m making up some details, of course. Maybe the man wasn’t a peasant. Or he could have been a woman. Or the bat could have been a pangolin. Or maybe, through a lucky accident (the guy was a loner perhaps), it could have not spread. That could have happened, but it didn’t. Or maybe sometimes that does happen and we don’t know it. These are just accidents of history.</p>



<p>I’m writing this on March 9, 2020. The good news is that the virus, in its current form, doesn’t kill children. I am so thankful for that. The bad news is that the virus does kill adults. The virus is like a grim reaper, culling the sick, the debilitated, and the elderly from the population. It attacks the pulmonary system. I heard a 25-year-old survivor describing how he became unable to control his breathing and could not fall asleep or he would die. Even for healthy young people, the prognosis is often poor. </p>



<p>There were Jews in Europe in the 1930s who sat around tables with the elders of their families and villages and debated whether to leave for America, or Palestine, or South America. Most of them, including my grandmother’s family, didn’t leave, and were largely exterminated. The virus of the time was Nazism, and it too attacked the pulmonary systems of the old and the debilitated, in that case with poisonous gasses.</p>



<p>When you grow up as I did, you are taught to have a paranoia in the back of your mind that there is a major disaster about to happen. That a holocaust, or something of that magnitude, might occur in your lifetime. And so you are never complacent. For your whole life, you’re looking and waiting for a history changing event. You try to ensure that you are willing to follow your thoughts to their logical conclusion and take the necessary actions as a result, unlike many of the Jews of 1930s Europe, who refused to confront the obstacle in front of them until it was too late, and unlike many politicians and world leaders today, who are doing the same.</p>



<p>And the conclusion we must now confront is clear. We are watching a once-in-a-century event unfold. Coronavirus–its mutations, its spawn–will change the course of human history. It will overwhelm our defense system and may kill millions. It may continue to mutate and kill millions more. We will develop painful social measures to slow its spread. We will produce vaccines and better treatment protocols. Some of this will help, but none of this will work perfectly. What will happen to society as this unfolds?</p>



<p>My favorite biblical verse comes from Ecclesiastes: To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. A time to be born, and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to pluck that which is planted. And so on.</p>



<p>The season has changed, and the seven years of famine have begun.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-032 |  On Computing Multilinear Polynomials Using Multi-r-ic Depth Four Circuits | 

	Suryajith Chillara</title>
    <summary>In this paper, we are interested in understanding the complexity of computing multilinear polynomials using depth four circuits in which polynomial computed at every node has a bound on the individual degree of $r$ (referred to as multi-$r$-ic circuits). The goal of this study is to make progress towards proving superpolynomial lower bounds for general depth four circuits computing multilinear polynomials, by proving better and better bounds as the value of $r$ increases.
	
  Recently, Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018) showed that any depth four arithmetic circuit of bounded individual degree $r$ computing a multilinear polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $d=o(n)$, must have size at least $\left(\frac{n}{r^{1.1}}\right)^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{d}{r}}\right)}$ when $r$ is $o(d)$ and is strictly less than $n^{1.1}$. This bound however deteriorates with increasing $r$. It is a natural question to ask if we can prove a bound that does not deteriorate with increasing $r$ or a bound that holds for a "larger" regime of $r$.

  We here prove a lower bound which does not deteriorate with $r$, however for a specific instance of $d = d(n)$ but for a wider range of $r$. Formally, we show that there exists an explicit polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ such that any depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $r&lt;n^{0.2}$ must have size at least $\exp(\Omega(\log^2 n))$. This improvement is obtained by suitably adapting the complexity measure of Kayal et al. (Theory of Computing, 2018). This adaptation of the measure is inspired by the complexity measure used by Kayal et al. (SIAM J. Computing, 2017).</summary>

vertex-colored interval graphs, namely \emph{$f$-Balanced Independent Set}
($f$-BIS) and \emph{$f$-Balanced Dominating Set} ($f$-BDS). Let $G=(V,E)$ be a
vertex-colored interval graph with a $k$-coloring $\gamma \colon V \rightarrow
\{1,\ldots,k\}$ for some $k \in \mathbb N$. A subset of vertices $S\subseteq V$
is called \emph{$f$-balanced} if $S$ contains $f$ vertices from each color
class. In the $f$-BIS and $f$-BDS problems, the objective is to compute an
independent set or a dominating set that is $f$-balanced. We show that both
problems are \NP-complete even on proper interval graphs. For the BIS problem
on interval graphs, we design two \FPT\ algorithms, one parameterized by
$(f,k)$ and the other by the vertex cover number of $G$. Moreover, we present a
2-approximation algorithm for a slight variation of BIS on proper interval
graphs.

    <title>Hitting Long Directed Cycles is Fixed-Parameter Tractable</title>

$G$, and the task is to find a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices/arcs such that
$G-S$ has no cycle of length longer than $\ell$. We show that the problem can
be solved in time $2^{\mathcal O(\ell k^3\log k + k^5\log k\log\ell)}\cdot
n^{\mathcal O(1)}$, that is, it is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)
parameterized by $k$ and $\ell$. This algorithm can be seen as a far-reaching
generalization of the fixed-parameter tractability of {\sc Mixed Graph Feedback
Vertex Set} [Bonsma and Lokshtanov WADS 2011], which is already a common
generalization of the fixed-parameter tractability of (undirected) {\sc
Feedback Vertex Set} and the {\sc Directed Feedback Vertex Set} problems, two
classic results in parameterized algorithms. The algorithm requires significant
insights into the structure of graphs without directed cycles length longer
than $\ell$ and can be seen as an exact version of the approximation algorithm
following from the Erd{\H{o}}s-P{\'o}sa property for long cycles in directed
graphs proved by Kreutzer and Kawarabayashi [STOC 2015].

A hole is long if
its length is at least 5. By $P_t$ we denote a path on $t$ vertices. In this
paper we give polynomial-time algorithms for the following problems: the
Maximum Weight Independent Set problem in long-hole-free graphs, and the

<p>An extended $C_5$ is a five-vertex hole with an additional vertex adjacent to
one or two consecutive vertices of the hole. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the class of
graphs excluding an extended $C_5$ and holes of length at least $6$ as induced
subgraphs; $\mathcal{C}$ contains all long-hole-free graphs and all $P_5$-free

weights and an integer $k$, one can in time $n^{\Oh(k)}$ find a maximum-weight
induced subgraph of $G$ of treewidth less than $k$. This implies both
aforementioned results.

initially given only one side of the vertex set of a bipartite graph; the
vertices on the other side are revealed to the algorithm one by one, along with
its incident edges. The algorithm is required to maintain a matching in the
current graph, where the algorithm revises the matching after each vertex
arrival by reassigning vertices. Bernstein, Holm, and Rotenberg showed that an
online algorithm can maintain a matching of maximum cardinality by performing
amortized $O(\log^2 n)$ reassignments per arrival.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose to consider the general question of how requiring a
non-amortized hard budget $k$ on the number of reassignments affects the
algorithms' performances, under various models from the literature.
</p>
<p>We show that a simple, widely-used algorithm is a best-possible deterministic
algorithm for all these models. For the unweighted maximum-cardinality problem,
the algorithm is a $(1-\frac{2}{k+2})$-competitive algorithm, which is the best
possible for a deterministic algorithm both under vertex arrivals and edge
arrivals. Applied to the load balancing problem, this yields a bifactor online
algorithm. For the weighted problem, which is traditionally studied assuming
the triangle inequality, we show that the power of reassignment allows us to
lift this assumption and the algorithm becomes a $\frac{1}{2}$-competitive
algorithm for $k=4$, improving upon the $\frac{1}{3}$ of the previous algorithm
without reassignments. We show that this also is a best-possible deterministic
algorithm.

    <title>A generalized Sylvester-Gallai type theorem for quadratic polynomials</title>

polynomials that takes us one step closer to obtaining a deterministic
polynomial time algorithm for testing zeroness of
$\Sigma^{[3]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[2]}$ circuits. Specifically, we prove that if a
finite set of irreducible quadratic polynomials $\mathcal{Q}$ satisfy that for
every two polynomials $Q_1,Q_2\in \mathcal{Q}$ there is a subset
$\mathcal{K}\subset \mathcal{Q}$, such that $Q_1,Q_2 \notin \mathcal{K}$ and
whenever $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ vanish then also $\prod_{i\in \mathcal{K}} Q_i$
vanishes, then the linear span of the polynomials in $\mathcal{Q}$ has
dimension $O(1)$. This extends the earlier result [Shpilka19] that showed a
similar conclusion when $|\mathcal{K}| = 1$.
</p>
<p>An important technical step in our proof is a theorem classifying all the
possible cases in which a product of quadratic polynomials can vanish when two
other quadratic polynomials vanish. I.e., when the product is in the radical of
the ideal generates by the two quadratics. This step extends a result from
[Shpilka19]that studied the case when one quadratic polynomial is in the
radical of two other quadratics.

magical combat. Recently, several authors including Chatterjee and Ibsen-Jensen
(2016) and Churchill, Biderman, and Herrick (2019) have investigated the
computational complexity of playing Magic optimally. In this paper we show that
the ``mate-in-$n$'' problem for Magic is $\Delta^0_n$-hard and that optimal
play in two-player Magic is non-arithmetic in general. These results apply to
how real Magic is played, can be achieved using standard-size tournament legal
decks, and do not rely on stochasticity or hidden information. Our paper builds
upon the construction that Churchill, Biderman, and Herrick (2019) used to show
that this problem was at least as hard as the halting problem.

dimension of very high-dimensional tensors. Building upon classical results on
Gaussian random projections and Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms~(JLT), we
propose two tensorized random projection maps relying on the tensor train~(TT)
and CP decomposition format, respectively. The two maps offer very low memory
requirements and can be applied efficiently when the inputs are low rank
tensors given in the CP or TT format. Our theoretical analysis shows that the
dense Gaussian matrix in JLT can be replaced by a low-rank tensor implicitly
represented in compressed form with random factors, while still approximately
preserving the Euclidean distance of the projected inputs. In addition, our
results reveal that the TT format is substantially superior to CP in terms of
the size of the random projection needed to achieve the same distortion ratio.
Experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate
the superiority of the TT decomposition.

cutting plane (CP) algorithms for mixed-integer optimization. In particular, we
study the relative efficiency of BB and CP, when both are based on the same
family of disjunctions. We extend a result of Dash to the nonlinear setting
which shows that for convex 0/1 problems, CP does at least as well as BB, with
variable disjunctions. We sharpen this by giving instances of the stable set
problem where we can provably establish that CP does exponentially better than
BB. We further show that if one moves away from 0/1 sets, this advantage of CP
over BB disappears; there are examples where BB finishes in O(1) time, but CP
takes infinitely long to prove optimality, and exponentially long to get to
arbitrarily close to the optimal value (for variable disjunctions). We next
show that if the dimension is considered a fixed constant, then the situation
reverses and BB does at least as well as CP (up to a polynomial blow up), no
matter which family of disjunctions is used. This is also complemented by
examples where this gap is exponential (in the size of the input data).

daily life of end-users by providing several value-added services. However, IoT
systems may capture and store sensitive, personal data about individuals in the
cloud, thereby jeopardizing user-privacy. Emerging legislation, such as
California's CalOPPA and GDPR in Europe, support strong privacy laws to protect
an individual's data in the cloud. One such law relates to strict enforcement
of data retention policies. This paper proposes a framework, entitled IoT
Expunge that allows sensor data providers to store the data in cloud platforms
that will ensure enforcement of retention policies. Additionally, the cloud
provider produces verifiable proofs of its adherence to the retention policies.
Experimental results on a real-world smart building testbed show that IoT
Expunge imposes minimal overheads to the user to verify the data against data
retention policies.

learning tasks during the last decades, ranging from image classification and
speech recognition to natural language understanding. As an extension of deep
learning, Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to solve the non-Euclidean
problems on graph-structured data which can hardly be handled by general deep
learning techniques. Existing GNNs under various mechanisms, such as random
walk, PageRank, graph convolution, and heat diffusion, are designed for
different types of graphs and problems, which makes it difficult to compare
them directly. Previous GNN surveys focus on categorizing current models into
independent groups, lacking analysis regarding their internal connection. This
paper proposes a unified framework and provides a novel perspective that can
widely fit existing GNNs into our framework methodologically. Specifically, we
survey and categorize existing GNN models into the spatial and spectral
domains, and reveal connections among subcategories in each domain. Further
analysis establishes a strong link across the spatial and spectral domains.

graph convolutional networks (GCN), which nicely integrate local vertex
features and graph topology in the spectral domain. However, current studies
suffer from several drawbacks: (1) graph CNNs relies on Chebyshev polynomial
approximation which results in oscillatory approximation at jump
discontinuities; (2) Increasing the order of Chebyshev polynomial can reduce
the oscillations issue, but also incurs unaffordable computational cost; (3)
Chebyshev polynomials require degree $\Omega$(poly(1/$\epsilon$)) to
approximate a jump signal such as $|x|$, while rational function only needs
$\mathcal{O}$(poly log(1/$\epsilon$))\cite{liang2016deep,telgarsky2017neural}.
However, it's non-trivial to apply rational approximation without increasing
computational complexity due to the denominator. In this paper, the superiority
of rational approximation is exploited for graph signal recovering. RatioanlNet
is proposed to integrate rational function and neural networks. We show that
rational function of eigenvalues can be rewritten as a function of graph
Laplacian, which can avoid multiplication by the eigenvector matrix. Focusing
on the analysis of approximation on graph convolution operation, a graph signal
regression task is formulated. Under graph signal regression task, its time
complexity can be significantly reduced by graph Fourier transform. To overcome
the local minimum problem of neural networks model, a relaxed Remez algorithm
is utilized to initialize the weight parameters. Convergence rate of
RatioanlNet and polynomial based methods on jump signal is analyzed for a
theoretical guarantee. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that our
approach could effectively characterize the jump discontinuities, outperforming
competing methods by a substantial margin on both synthetic and real-world
graphs.

    <summary>Nisan showed in 1991 that the width of a smallest noncommutative single-(source,sink) algebraic branching program (ABP) to compute a noncommutative polynomial is given by the ranks of specific matrices. This means that the set of noncommutative polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is Zariski-closed, an important property in geometric complexity theory. It follows that approximations cannot help to reduce the required ABP width.

It was mentioned by Forbes that this result would probably break when going from single-(source,sink) ABPs to trace ABPs. We prove that this is correct. Moreover, we study the commutative monotone setting and prove a result similar to Nisan, but concerning the analytic closure. We observe the same behavior here: The set of polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is closed for single-(source,sink) ABPs and not closed for trace ABPs. The proofs reveal an intriguing connection between tangent spaces and the vector space of flows on the ABP.
We close with additional observations on VQP and the closure of VNP which allows us to establish a separation between the two classes.</summary>

    <title>More on uniqueness in Sudoku</title>
    <summary>My first post on this blog, lo these nearly 15 years ago, discussed a program I had written to try to solve Sudoku puzzles deductively (rather than by the easier computational method, backtracking), with the goal of being able to automatically grade the puzzles and automatically generate explanations for how to solve a given puzzle. And a few months later I posted again, on deduction rules that take advantage of the assumption that a puzzle has a unique solution, by ruling out choices that would cause any solution consistent with them to become non-unique. Since then, that part of my solver has been relatively stable, although I have added other rules for Nishio and 2SAT and posted here about more general uniqueness deduction rules in map-coloring puzzles.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/07/20/updated-python-library.html">My first post on this blog</a>, lo these nearly 15 years ago, discussed a program I had written to try to solve Sudoku puzzles deductively (rather than by the easier computational method, backtracking), with the goal of being able to automatically grade the puzzles and automatically generate explanations for how to solve a given puzzle. And a few months later I posted again, on <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/10/15/assuming-uniqueness-in.html">deduction rules that take advantage of the assumption that a puzzle has a unique solution</a>, by ruling out choices that would cause any solution consistent with them to become non-unique. Since then, that part of my solver has been relatively stable, although I have added other rules for <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2012/02/23/solving-single-digit-sudoku.html">Nishio</a> and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2009/04/26/sudoku-and-2sat.html">2SAT</a> and posted here about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/07/28/any-order-puzzle.html">more general uniqueness deduction rules in map-coloring puzzles</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also occasionally been using my program to generate puzzles for me to work on, and today it found an interesting test case, a puzzle that it thought would be much more difficult than it turned out to be for me. This mis-rating happened because the uniqueness deduction rules I’m using in my own deductions are stronger than the ones in my program (although some of its other rules are stronger than I typically apply myself). In its initial state, the puzzle looks like:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Sudoku puzzle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-givens.svg"/></p>

<p>My program tells me that it’s at the second highest level of difficulty that it knows about: it has to resort to using 2SAT, but it can successfully solve it that way. (The highest level is for puzzles where it is forced to use backtracking.) Usually, for me, puzzles at that level require me to use written notes to keep track of the deductions, rather than doing it all in my head, but not this time. Using more-or-less standard reasoning, one can fill in the cells of the puzzle to reach the state:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Partially solved Sudoku puzzle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-partial.svg"/></p>

<p>This is where my program gets stuck and has to resort to more powerful deduction rules. But as a human solving this puzzle, here is what I see: In row 3, the two empty cells must contain the pair of digits 3 and 5. In the center right block of nine cells, the two empty cells must again be 3 and 5. And in the center block of cells, the 5 digit is confined to three cells aligned with those two pairs of empty cells. If the 3 digit were also confined to the same three cells in the center block, it and the five would have to occupy the two diagonally aligned cells out of the three, because otherwise they would line up and prevent one of the other pairs of 3-5 cells from having any value. But then the 3-5 cells in row 3, the center block, and column 7 would form a closed system (shown by the red squares below): nothing else outside those cells could affect which of those six cells contains 3, and which contains 5. Within that closed system, there are two solutions, obtained from each other by swapping the locations of the 3 and the 5. But that would violate the assumption of uniqueness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Closed system of cells in a partially solved Sudoku puzzle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-closed.svg"/></p>

<p>Even if the 7 in the center cell weren’t there, the same reasoning would apply. Since this closed system with a non-unique solution would happen automatically if we confine the digit 3 to the same three center-block cells as the digit 5, the digit 3 must be elsewhere in the center block, which can only mean that it is in column 4. Once we make this deduction, the rest of the puzzle falls into place.</p>

<p>My program only has built into it a couple of ad-hoc rules to prevent closed systems of four cells with two solutions, and it misses the one in this example because it involves six cells. It’s making me think that I need a more general description of the possible closed systems (at least the ones involving only two digit values, like this), in order to match the deductions I’m making by hand and make my program’s difficulty estimates more accurate.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In this blog’s now 15-year-history, at Waterloo and then MIT and now UT Austin, I’ve tried to make it clear that I blog <em>always</em> as Scott, never as Dr. Aaronson of Such-and-Such Institution.  (God knows I’ve written a few things that a prudent dean might prefer that I hadn’t—though if I couldn’t honestly say that, in what sense would I even enjoy “academic freedom”?)  Today, though, for <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3167">only about</a> the second time, I’m also writing as a professor motivated by a duty of care toward his students.</p>



<p>A week ago, most of my grad students were in the Bay Area for a workshop; they then returned and spent a week hanging around the CS building like normal.  Yesterday I learned that at least one of those students developed symptoms consistent with covid19.  Of course, it’s much more likely to be a boring cold or flu—but still, in any sane regime, just to be certain, such a person would <strong>promptly get tested</strong>.</p>



<p>After quarantining himself, my student called the “24/7 covid19 hotline” listed in an email from the university’s president, but found no one answering the phone over the weekend.  Yesterday he finally got through—only to be told, flatly, that he couldn’t be tested due to insufficient capacity.  When I heard this, I asked my department chair and dean to look into the matter, and received confirmation that yeah, it sucks, but this is the situation.</p>



<p>If it’s true that, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/opinion/coronavirus-testing-new-york.html?fbclid=IwAR24o0pcDW2n6usYpyIC-bPhGUhoIkYAcvS_R4QvPv8yEdp0KsEF1XJWQv8">as I’ve read</a>, the same story is currently playing itself out all over the country, then this presumably isn’t the fault of anyone in UT’s health service or the city of Austin.  Rather, as they say in the movies, it goes all the way to the top, to the CDC director and ultimately the president—or rather, to the festering wound that now sits where the top used to be.</p>


<p>Speaking of movies, over the weekend Dana and I watched <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contagion-Marion-Cotillard/dp/B006IVBSBU">Contagion</a>, as apparently many people are now doing.  I confess that I’d missed it when it came out in 2011.  I think it’s a cinematic masterpiece.  It freely violates many of the rules of movie narrative: characters are neither done in by their own hubris, nor saved by their faith or by being A-list stars.  But <em>Contagion</em> is also more than a glorified public service announcement about the importance of washing your hands.  It wants to show you the reality of the human world of its characters, and <em>also</em> the reality of a virus, and how the two realities affect each other despite obeying utterly different logic.  It will show a scene that’s important to the charaters for human reasons, and then it will show you the same scene again, except this time making you focus on whose hand touched which surface in which order.<br/><!--StartFragment--></p>
<p>But for all its excellence and now-obvious prescience, there are two respects in which Contagion failed to predict the reality of 2020.  The first is just a lucky throw of the RNA dice: namely, that the real coronavirus is perhaps an order of magnitude less fatal than the movie virus, and for some unknown reason it spares children.  But the second difference is terrifying.  All the public health authorities in the movie are ultra-empowered and competent.  They do badass things like injecting themselves with experimental vaccines.  If they stumble, it’s only in deeply understandable ways that any of us might (e.g., warning their own loved ones to evacuate a city before warning the public).</p>
<p>In other words, when the scriptwriters, writing their disaster movie, tried to imagine the worst, they failed to imagine a US government that would essentially abandon the public, by</p>
<p>(1) botching a simple test that dozens of other countries performed without issue,<br/>(2) preventing anyone else from performing their own tests, and then<br/>(3) turning around and using the lack of positive test results to justify its own inaction.</p>
<p>They failed to imagine a CDC that might as well not exist for all it would do in its hour of need: one that <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1236967513008877568">didn’t even bother to update its website on weekends</a>, and stopped publishing data once the data became too embarrassing.  The scriptwriters <em>did</em> imagine a troll gleefully spreading lies about the virus online, endangering anyone who listened to him.  They failed to imagine a universe where that troll was the president.</p>


<p>“I mean, don’t get me wrong,” they told me.  “Trump is a racist con artist, a demagogue, the precise thing that Adams and Hamilton and Franklin tried to engineer our republic to avoid.  Just, don’t get so <em>depressed</em> about it all the time!  Moaning about how we’re trapped in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3294">freakishly horrible</a> branch of the wavefunction, blah blah.  I mean look on the bright side!  What an incredible run of luck we’ve had, that we elected a president with the mental horizons of a sadistic toddler, and yet <em>in three years he hasn’t caused even one apocalypse</em>.  You’re alive and healthy, your loved ones are alive and healthy.  It could be a lot worse!”</p>



<p>The above, I suspect, is a sentiment that will now forever date any writing containing it to January 2020 or earlier.</p></div>

    <title>Theorist Paul R Young passed away</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the early days of theoretical computer science, say 1960-1990 the main tools used were logic.<br/>
This made sense since, early on:<br/>
<br/>
a) Some of the basic notions like DTIME(T(n)), P, NP used Turing Machines in their definitions<br/>
<br/>
b) Some of the basic notions like reductions were modeled after similar concepts in<br/>
computability theory.<br/>
<br/>
One of the people who did much work in the interface between Logic and TCS was Paul Young.<br/>
He <a href="https://news.cs.washington.edu/2020/03/05/remembering-paul-young-1936-2019/">passed away</a> in December. Here are some highlights of his work:<br/>
<br/>
1) One of the first books that covered both computability and complexity:<br/>
<br/>
An Introduction to the general theory of Algorithms<br/>
by Machtey and Young.<br/>
<br/>
2) In Computability theory all many-one complete sets are computably isomorphic. Berman and<br/>
Hartmanis conjectured that the poly-many-one degree of the NP-complete sets was the same. This<br/>
would mean that all NP-complete sets were poly-isom (all of the known ones are).<br/>
<br/>
Mahaney and Young in the paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>Reductions Among Polynomial Isomorphism Types</i><br/>
<br/>
showed that every many-one poly degree either has one degree or has an infinite number of<br/>
degrees in a very complicated way.<br/>
<br/>
3) Recall that a <i>Cook Reduction from A to B </i>allows many queries to B, whereas a <i>Karp Reduction</i><br/>
only allows one query and your answer must be the same sense as the query.<br/>
Are there  cases where a Cook reduction is faster? Yes, from the paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>Cook reducibility is faster than Karp Reducibility</i><br/>
<br/>
by Longpre and Young<br/>
<br/>
(The original title was going to be <i>Cook is Faster than Karp</i>, but it was changed since it invoked<br/>
images of Cook and Karp in a footrace.  Hmmm. Which one would be faster?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4) The <i>Boolean Hierarchy </i>is a hierarchy of iterations of NP sets. What if instead of starting with P<br/>
one started with RP (Randomized Poly time). What an intriguing notion! To find out read<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Generalized Boolean Hierarchies over RP</i><br/>
<br/>
by  Alberto Bertoni, Danilo Bruschi, Deborah Joseph, Meera Sitharam, Paul Young<br/>
<br/>
5) There are many more, mostly on the theme of the interaction of logic and computer science.<br/>
<br/>
                       I saw him speak on some of these topics and was inspired by how much one could<br/>
take notions of computability and translate them into complexity theory.  The field has gone in a<br/>
different direction since then (more combinatorial) but we still use many of the basic concepts<br/>
like reducibility.  As such we all owe a debit to Paul Young.</div>

    <title>TR20-030 |  Barriers for Rectangular Matrix Multiplication | 

	Matthias Christandl, 

	François Le Gall, 

	Vladimir Lysikov, 

	Jeroen Zuiddam</title>
    <summary>We study the algorithmic problem of multiplying large matrices that are rectangular. We prove that the method that has been used to construct the fastest algorithms for rectangular matrix multiplication cannot give optimal algorithms. In fact, we prove a precise numerical barrier for this method. Our barrier improves the previously known barriers, both in the numerical sense, as well as in its generality. We prove our result using the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. More precisely, we crucially make use of two families of real tensor parameters with special algebraic properties: the quantum functionals and the support functionals. In particular, we prove that any lower bound on the dual exponent of matrix multiplication $\alpha$ via the big Coppersmith-Winograd tensors cannot exceed 0.625.</summary>

    </summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As the coronavirus epidemic advances in Italy with a 25-30% growth rate (meaning that the numbers are doubling every 3-4 days), and after two weeks of “lockdown-lite” in Northern Italy seems to have made no difference, the Italian government imposed on Sunday morning a stricter lockdown on the region of Lombardy and some cities outside the region including Venice. Several people have reached out to ask how things are going, so here is a brief recap. </p>
<p><span id="more-4322"/></p>
<p>First of all, I would like to give a shoutout to Taiwan, which is currently the country that has done the <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/other/pieces/how-taiwan-managed-to-avoid-a-coronavirus-outbreak/">best job stopping an outbreak</a>. The Taiwanese have several things going for them: the SARS scare made the government plan for the next epidemic, instead of making it up as it would go along, and their preparedness was impressive. The plan focused on isolation, contact-tracing, and people being careful: kudos to the Taiwanese for how well they complied. From the little that I have learned about Taiwan after living there for two months a couple of years ago, the Taiwanese are not rule-followers the way the Swiss or the Singaporean can be. But if they bend or break rules, they do that after a lot of consideration for how this impacts others. Basically, people <i>care about strangers</i>, a disposition that helps a lot in controlling an epidemic (and which is not a big part of the Italian national mood).</p>
<p>But let’s talk about me. This is my mood right now:<br/>
<img alt="self_isolate" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4326" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/self_isolate.png?w=584"/></p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> by Randall Munroe)</p>
<p>Since we are past isolation-and-contact-tracing, the main goal is to reduce person-to-person contact so that we can stop the exponential growth. For the past two weeks, besides the usual recommendations (do not kiss hello and goodbye, do not shake hands, wash hands frequently, do not touch your face) the government recommended keeping a one-meter distance from other people. There has been some inventive ways to keep going under these requirements. For example cinemas (in the regions in which they were not required to shut down) sold tickets for at most a third of the seats, asking people to leave two empty seats between any occupied seats. </p>
<p>Last Saturday, before the newest set of regulations were in place, I went out for a drink. The bar had cordoned off the counter area</p>
<p> <img alt="IMG_9383" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4328" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/img_9383.jpg?w=584"/></p>
<p>They asked everybody who came in to seat down, at one of a few well-separated tables. Gloves-wearing servers took orders and brought some food (instead of the usual buffet). Once all tables were taken, a server stood outside preventing other people from coming in.</p>
<p>As we were drinking our aperitivi at a safe distance from each other, news began to leak of the new measures, which the government eventually announced at 2am Sunday morning. The leak suggested that Lombardy, Venice, and other places, would be included in the so-called <i>red zone</i>, which was a group of small towns that had been completely isolated for the past two weeks (nobody could go in and out except ambulances, trash collection trucks, and deliveries). In a development that might not have happened in Taiwan, a few hundred people rushed to train stations in Milan and Venice to flee South.</p>
<p>The actual regulations allowed travel in and out of the places affected by the new lockdown, but only for <i>demonstrated work or health reasons</i>. This is what the regulation said, but how would people prove their reason? The Italian genius for bureaucracy started cranking in the next few hours, and now, at train stations, people are required to sign an affidavit stating the existence of such a reason before boarding a train:</p>
<p><img alt="affidavit" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4329" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/affidavit.jpeg?w=584"/></p>
<p>In the locked-down cities, all bars and restaurants have to close by 6pm, and all places where people may congregate (including churches, gyms, swimming pools, in addition to museums, schools and universities which were already closed) are closed all day. Even funeral and weddings are banned. Grocery stores will have to ensure that people stay within a meter of each other, making people wait outside and enter in small groups if necessary.</p>
<p>What about me? I am procrastinating on writing blog posts about online optimization and on reviewing papers for ICALP, I have started reading William Gibson’s latest novel <i>Agency</i> and watching the tv series <i>Pose</i>, and I am cooking every meal. Considering that I like to sleep and that I am spending a fair amount of time on the phone, I have got the whole day covered.</p>
<p>What is next? At this point in Lombardy about a person in 2,500, or 0.04% of the population, is infected, and we have run out of ICU beds. The rate of infection in Wuhan peaked at about 0.6% of the population, and this was well past the point at which they had run out of hospital beds in general. Hopefully, here we will peak well below that. On the other hand, left to its own devices, in the absence of any containment measures, I have seen estimates that the disease would peak a bit higher than a flu epidemic, at 20% or even 60% of the population.</p>
<p>So, find the Taiwanese in yourself, think about others, and wash those hands.</p></div>

<p>
Maryam Aliakbarpour and Sandeep Silwal are PhD students at MIT. They have a joint <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07324.pdf">paper</a> titled, “Testing Properties of Multiple Distributions with Few Samples.” Aliakbarpour is advised by Ronitt Rubinfeld. Silwal has a different advisor, Piotr Indyk. Could we test which advisor is better by sampling? Haha, not a chance…</p>
<p>
Today we will discuss this paper as an example of the power of computer science theory.</p>
<p>
Aliakbarpour and Silwal (AS) prove results on property testing, which is of course a long studied area in statistics, in mathematics, and in complexity theory. Many problems of property testing are open; many are very hard problems, and some are really impossible—such as distinguishing slight differences between distributions. With all due respect, the brilliance of their paper is not in solving open problems. Rather it is how they modify property testing in a novel manner. </p>
<p>
Their proofs are clever, are technically strong, but we feel more importantly is how they change the problems. That is, they show how to add a new constraint to property testing, where: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The constraint is reasonable and appears to be natural; <p/>
</li><li>
The constraint is powerful and allows efficient algorithms where previously none were possible.
</li></ol>
<p>Let’s look at this more closely.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Opening a Closed Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We all know about open problems and closed problems. There are however two kinds of closed problems: ones that have been settled and ones that have been proved impossible to settle. We also know that one can often take an open problem and define a meaningful subcase of it that can be solved. What may be less obvious is how one can do the same with the latter kind of closed problem.</p>
<p>
The work of AS is a perfect example of this phenomenon. They take a problem that is unsolvable and change it to one that is solvable. The details of their results are less important than their change to the underlying problem. One of the key insights throughout theory is that we often have made major progress by changing the ground rules. The AS work is a particularly clear case of this. </p>
<p/><h2> The New Condition </h2><p/>

AS call it the <i>structural condition</i>. They postulate a consistency type of condition on property testing. Suppose that one is interesting in testing whether or not a collection of slot-machines are fair. That is, are they set to cheat players or not? This is known to be hard to do with few tests. But after adding their new constraint it becomes quite efficient.</p>
<p>
Among some examples to convey their definition, they postulate a row of slot machines in a casino that are supposed to give the same distribution of prizes <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{j}"/> with known <em>fair</em> probabilities <img alt="{q(j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%28j%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q(j)}"/>. As usual with property testing we want to distinguish between two hypotheses that are some distance apart: one that the machines conform to the fair distribution <img alt="{q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q}"/> and an alternative hypothesis that each is far from fair. There are two relevant factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
We do not get to make many tests on one machine of our choosing. The best we can do is watch people try the machines. They may try different machines and so give only a few sample results per machine. <p/>
</li><li>
There are cases of this situation 1 where although each machine is far from fair the joint distribution of a few samples cannot be told apart from fair. The authors mention a trivial case where <img alt="{q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q}"/> is uniform and we get just one result from each machine, results all different from each other. These cannot be told apart. But there are less-trivial cases.
</li></ol>
<p>
Such situations are common with real-word data. The authors mention cases of medical data when one gets just one or a few blood readings from patients with disparate situational factors that can bias their samples. The joint effect of the biases may completely mask the systematic population tendency one is trying to test for. This is the setting in which the problem of distinguishing has been regarded as impossible, case closed. In the slot-machine example, Aliakbarpour and Silwal state their structural condition informally as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Our goal is to test whether all the machines were fair … or they are far from being fair. In this case, we can naturally assume that if the machines are unfair, the house will assign a lower probability to the expensive prizes, and higher probability to cheap ones. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Of course, the house <em>could</em> cheat players without cheating in this uniform manner. More subtle rigging of the machines in different ways could mask the lowered expectation. But what AS are saying is: <i>Provided the house cheats in this consistent manner, then they can be discovered quickly</i>. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Formal Definition and Proof Idea </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The formal definition is that each of the true source distributions is biased the same way in the same components as the expected (“fair”) distribution:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 1</b> <em> A sequence <img alt="{p^1,\dots, p^m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E1%2C%5Cdots%2C+p%5Em%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p^1,\dots, p^m}"/> of distributions on a discrete domain <img alt="{[n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{[n]}"/> obeys the structural condition relative to the distribution <img alt="{q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q}"/> if there is a subset <img alt="{A \subset [n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Csubset+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \subset [n]}"/> such that for all <img alt="{i \in [m]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi+%5Cin+%5Bm%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i \in [m]}"/> and <img alt="{j \in [n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj+%5Cin+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{j \in [n]}"/>: </em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{cases} p^i(j) \geq q(j) &amp; \text{if } j \in A\\ p^i(j) \leq q(j) &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+p%5Ei%28j%29+%5Cgeq+q%28j%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+j+%5Cin+A%5C%5C+p%5Ei%28j%29+%5Cleq+q%28j%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D.+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \begin{cases} p^i(j) \geq q(j) &amp; \text{if } j \in A\\ p^i(j) \leq q(j) &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} "/></p>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The term “structural condition” is vanilla and perhaps saying the <img alt="{p^i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p^i}"/> are “conformally biased” relative to <img alt="{q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q}"/> would be more descriptive. A major point which the authors emphasize right afterward is that the set <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> is <em>unknown</em>. There are exponentially many possibilities for what <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> could be—so we cannot try to guess it. Rather, proofs using this condition need to exploit how all the <img alt="{p^{i}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p^{i}}"/> distributions conform to the same <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>. The slot-machine example arguably does not reflect this point in full—because we can know in advance what the major and minor prizes of a slot machine are (including “no prize” among the latter). The medical-data examples and others certainly do, however.</p>
<p>
We can convey briefly and intuitively how this condition is used for the case where <img alt="{q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q}"/> is uniform distribution on <img alt="{[n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{[n]}"/>—which is quite general as testing for many distributions can be efficiently mapped into this case. A key property of uniform distribution is that among all distributions on <img alt="{[n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{[n]}"/>, it minimizes the probability of getting <em>collisions</em> from repeated samples. This idea has yielded the most effective test statistics for problems when there is only one distribution <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/>. When there are multiple <img alt="{p^i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p^i}"/> the effectiveness can be blunted in instances like the one in the previous section—the instances that are impossible. </p>
<p>
However, AS show that their structural condition is just what’s needed to bridge the gap that keeps the impossible cases from being distinguished. Realizing that the compounded complications of having multiple <img alt="{p^i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p^i}"/> can be resolved by this stroke is their act of brilliance. Their paper applies it successfully to two other problem settings—identity testing and closeness testing—and also shows meaningful instances that obey and are resolved by their definition but that escape an older condition involving product distributions. As usual, we say to see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07324.pdf">paper</a> for the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Consequences in Crypto and Inference? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
It remains our place to ask, in which other cases might the AS condition arise and what uses might it have? I can think first of one implication for adversarial strategies in cryptography. It goes like this:</p>
<p>
We can view the AS theorems as saying that anyone who wishes to cheat others should <b>not</b> be consistent. Being consistent according to some utility criterion—<em>even an unknown one</em>—makes it easier for others to detect that they are cheating. </p>
<p>
Following their slot-machine example suggests this: Arrange the machines in total to cheat players. But make it so that they are not consistent. They can set some prizes up in probability and some lower, and importantly, do this differently on different machines. They could even make some machines pay out more than the legal expectation—while still giving a small profit to the casino so it does not become too obvious to customers that those machines are “lucky.” There is safety in non-conformity alone. </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \S " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CS+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \S "/></p>
<p>
Ken notices a similarity to the chess-modeling situation he began describing in this recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/29/predicating-predictivity/">post</a>. Instead of prizes of known value, in chess we have distributions over possible moves whose values are <em>not</em> so readily apparent to the player—that’s what makes chess challenging to play. </p>
<p>
In his case, giving any chess position <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> and a player <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> having that position, he postulates a true distribution <img alt="{p^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p^t}"/> of moves <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> would make and wants to compare that with the distribution <img alt="{q^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q^t}"/> projected by his model. Now there can be many positions <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> with different characteristics, but Ken can treat the distributions <img alt="{q^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q^t}"/> coming from his model as one fixed point of reference <img alt="{q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q}"/>, and he can give different positions the same ranks of legal moves <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> (best), then <img alt="{2,\dots, n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%2C%5Cdots%2C+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2,\dots, n}"/>. If positions have different numbers of legal moves he can pad them out by treating illegal moves the same as completely losing blunders. </p>
<p>
So he has a situation like this: different <img alt="{p^t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p^t}"/> and one <img alt="{q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q}"/> over a bunch of positions. Ken knows his model not only varies in accuracy but is biased in ways explained in that post. It appears that this bias is highly conformal. The model is trained to make the projection <img alt="{q(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{q(1)}"/> of the probability of the first move accurate on average. Then the tendency is that the projections of the second-best and third-best moves are off one way, and the projections of all the other moves are off the other way. This is like having <img alt="{A = \{2,3\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%3D+%5C%7B2%2C3%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A = \{2,3\}}"/> or its complement most of the time. The new statistical tests that Ken is crafting also live under the specter of impossibility. A co-worker has demonstrated that they <em>fail</em> in cases randomly generated from normal distributions. But so far they are appearing to succeed in Ken’s more-structured situations from his real-world chess data. On this we will stay tuned.</p>

<p>There are many more I could include, but haven’t yet (including most of the <em>Aperiodical</em> list). Many of these books are award-winners, but to a large extent inclusion in this list is driven by my personal taste in books, so many of these are somewhat specialized rather than being general-audience books. But the main criterion for inclusion on Wikipedia is that everything must have multiple in-depth sources, and everything in the article must come from those sources. For books those sources are not the book itself, but (typically) published book reviews. The bare minimum is two reviews, but I’ve been aiming for books with at least four. So for instance I would have liked to include <em>Geometry: The Line and the Circle</em> (2019), by Maureen T. Carroll and Elyn Rykken, but I could find only <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/geometry-the-line-and-the-circle">one review of it</a>, and that’s not enough. To all the book reviewers out there: your efforts are appreciated, and helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Monotone probability distributions over the Boolean cube can be learned with sublinear samples</strong>, by Ronitt Rubinfeld and Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03415">arXiv</a>). By now, it is well known that assuming an (unknown) distribution enjoys some sort of structure can lead to more efficient algorithms for learning and testing. Often one proves that the structure permits a convenient representation, and exploits this representation to solve the problem at hand. This paper studies the learning of monotone distributions over the Boolean hypercube. The authors exploit and extend a structural statement about monotone Boolean <em>functions</em> by <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-43948-7_20">Blais, Håstad, Servedio, and Tan</a>, using it to provide sublinear algorithms for estimating the support size, distance to uniformity, and the distribution itself.</p>



<p><strong>Locally Private Hypothesis Selection</strong>, by Sivakanth Gopi, Gautam Kamath, Janardhan Kulkarni, Aleksandar Nikolov, Zhiwei Steven Wu, and Huanyu Zhang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09465">arXiv</a>). Given a collection of \(k\) distributions and a set of samples from one of them, can we identify which distribution it is? This paper studies this problem (and an agnostic generalization of it) under the constraint of <em>local differential privacy</em>. The authors show that this problem requires \(\Omega(k)\) samples, in contrast to the \(O(\log k)\) complexity in the non-private model. Furthermore, they give \(\tilde O(k)\)-sample upper bounds in various interactivity models.</p>



<p><strong>Efficient Distance Approximation for Structured High-Dimensional Distributions via Learning</strong>, by Arnab Bhattacharyya, Sutanu Gayen, Kuldeep S. Meel, and N. V. Vinodchandran (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05378">arXiv</a>). Given samples from two distributions, can you estimate the total variation distance between them? This paper gives a framework for solving this problem for <em>structured</em> distribution classes, including Ising models, Bayesian networks, Gaussians, and causal models. The approach can be decomposed properly learning the distributions, followed by estimating the distance between the two hypotheses. Challenges arise when densities are hard to compute exactly.</p>



<p><strong>Profile Entropy: A Fundamental Measure for the Learnability and Compressibility of Discrete Distributions</strong>, by Yi Hao and Alon Orlitsky (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11665">arXiv</a>). The histogram of a dataset is the collection of frequency counts of domain elements. The <em>profile</em> of a dataset can be succinctly described as the histogram of the histogram. Recent works have shown that, in some sense, discarding information about your dataset by looking solely at the profile can be beneficial for certain problems in which it is “universal”. This work explores two new quantities, the entropy and dimension of the profile, which turn out to play a key role in quantifying the performance of estimators based on the profile.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Many people have suggested coating handles, doorknobs and so forth with <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread">virus-killing copper tape</a>.  It’s a shame that this isn’t being tried on a wider scale.  In the meantime, though, here’s a related but different idea that I had last night.</p>



<p>Imagine we could coat every doorknob, every light switch, every railing, every other surface that people might touch in public buildings, with some long-lasting disgusting, sticky, slimy substance.  For a variety of reasons, one probably wouldn’t use actual excrement, although it wouldn’t hurt if the substance <em>looked like</em> that.  Or it could be a sickly neon green or red, to make it impossible to conceal when you’d gotten the substance on your hands.</p>



<p>What would be the result?  Of course, people would avoid touching these surfaces.  If they had to, they’d do so with a napkin or glove whenever possible.  If they had to touch them bare-handedly, they’d rush to wash their hands with soap as soon as possible afterwards.  Certainly they wouldn’t touch their faces before having washed their hands.</p>



<p>In short, they’d show exactly the behaviors that experts agree are among the most helpful, if our goal is to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  In effect, we’d be plugging an unfortunate gap in our evolutionary programming—namely, that the surfaces where viruses can thrive aren’t intuitively disgusting to us, as (say) vomit or putrid meat are—by <em>making</em> those surfaces disgusting, as they ought to be in the middle of a pandemic.</p>



<p>Note that, even if it <em>somehow</em> turns out to be infeasible to coat all the touchable surfaces in public buildings with disgusting goo, you might still derive great personal benefit from <em>imagining</em> them so covered.  If you manage to pull that off, it will yield just the right heuristic for when and how often you should now be washing your hands (and avoiding touching your face), without no need for additional conscious reflection.</p>



<p>Mostly, having the above thoughts made me grateful for my friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson">Robin Hanson</a>.  For as long Robin is around, <a href="https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1235020994110205953">tweeting</a> and <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/02/consider-controlled-infection.html">blogging</a> from his unique corner of mindspace, no one will ever be able to say that <em>my</em> ideas for how to control the coronavirus were the world’s weirdest or most politically tone-deaf.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-029 |  Geometric Rank of Tensors and Subrank of Matrix Multiplication | 

	Guy Moshkovitz, 

	Swastik Kopparty, 

	Jeroen Zuiddam</title>
    <summary>Motivated by problems in algebraic complexity theory (e.g., matrix multiplication) and extremal combinatorics (e.g., the cap set problem and the sunflower problem), we introduce the geometric rank as a new tool in the study of tensors and hypergraphs. We prove that the geometric rank is an upper bound on the subrank of tensors and the independence number of hypergraphs. We prove that the geometric rank is smaller than the slice rank of Tao, and relate geometric rank to the analytic rank of Gowers and Wolf in an asymptotic fashion. As a first application, we use geometric rank to prove a tight upper bound on the (border) subrank of the matrix multiplication tensors, matching Strassen's well-known lower bound from 1987.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Several people asked me to comment on the recent announcement by Honeywell that they’ll soon have what they call “the most powerful” quantum computer (see <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2020/03/behind-the-scenes-of-a-major-quantum-breakthrough">here for press release</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/03/03/honeywell-surprisingly-announces-it-will-be-releasing-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-in-the-world/#c271c5114b4a">here for <em>Forbes</em> article</a>, <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/content/dam/honeywell/files/Beta_10_Quantum_3_3_2020.pdf">here for paper</a>).  </p>



<p>I’m glad that Honeywell, which many people might know as an air-conditioner manufacturer, has entered the race for trapped-ion QC.  I wish them success.  I’ve known about what they were doing in part because Drew Potter, my friend and colleague in UT Austin’s physics department, took a one-year leave from UT to contribute to their effort.</p>



<p>Here I wanted to comment about one detail in Honeywell’s announcement: namely, the huge emphasis on “quantum volume” as the central metric for judging quantum computing progress, and the basis for calling their own planned device the “most powerful.”  One journalist asked me to explain why quantum volume is such an important measure.  I had to give her an honest answer: I don’t know whether it is.</p>



<p>Quantum volume was invented a few years ago by a group at IBM.  According to one of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12926.pdf">their papers</a>, it can be defined roughly as 2<sup>k</sup>, where k is the largest number such that you can run a k-qubit random quantum circuit, with depth k and with any-to-any connectivity, and have at least (say) 2/3 probability of measuring an answer that passes some statistical test.  (In the paper, they use what Lijie Chen and I named <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">Heavy Output Generation</a>, though Google’s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark is similar.)</p>



<p>I don’t know why IBM takes the “volume” to be 2<sup>k</sup> rather than k itself.  Leaving that aside, though, the idea was to invent a single “goodness measure” for quantum computers that can’t be gamed <em>either</em> by building a huge number of qubits that don’t maintain nearly enough coherence (what one might call “the D-Wave approach”), <em>or</em> by building just one perfect qubit, <em>or</em> by building qubits that behave well in isolation but don’t interact easily.  Note that the any-to-any connectivity requirement makes things harder for architectures with nearest-neighbor interactions only, like the 2D superconducting chips being built by Google, Rigetti, or IBM itself.</p>



<p>You know the notion of a researcher’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index">h-index</a>—defined as the largest h such that she’s published h papers that garnered h citations each?  Quantum volume is basically an h-index for quantum computers.  It’s an attempt to take several different yardsticks of experimental progress, none terribly useful in isolation, and combine them into one “consumer index.”</p>



<p>Certainly I sympathize with the goal of broadening people’s focus beyond the “but how many qubits does it have?” question—since the answer to that question is meaningless without further information about what the qubits can <em>do</em>.  From that standpoint, quantum volume seems like a clear step in the right direction.</p>



<p>Alas, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a> states that “as soon as a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”  That happened years ago with the h-index, which now regularly pollutes academic hiring and promotion decisions, to the point where <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09496">its inventor expressed regrets</a>.  Quantum volume is now looking to me like another example of Goodhart’s Law at work.</p>



<p>The position of Honeywell’s PR seems to be that, if they can build a device that can apply 6 layers of gates to 6 qubits, with full connectivity and good fidelity, that will then count as “the world’s most powerful quantum computer,” since it will have the largest volume.  One problem here is that such a device could be simulated by maintaining a vector of only 2<sup>6</sup>=64 amplitudes.  This is nowhere near quantum supremacy (i.e., beating classical computers at some well-defined task), which is a necessary though not sufficient condition for doing anything useful.</p>



<p>Think of a university that achieves an average faculty-to-student ratio of infinity by holding one class with zero students.  It gets the “best score” only by exploiting an obvious defect in the scoring system.</p>



<p>So what’s the alternative?  The policy <em>I</em> prefer is simply to tell the world all your system specs, as clearly as you can, with no attempts made to bury the lede.  How many qubits do you have?  With what coherence times?  With what connectivity?  What are the 1- and 2-qubit gate fidelities?  What depth of circuit can you do?  What resources do the standard classical algorithms need to simulate your system?  Most importantly: what’s the main drawback of your system, the spec that’s the <em>worst</em>, the one you most need to improve?  What prevents you from having a scalable quantum computer right now?  And are you going to tell me, or will you make me scour Appendix III.B in your paper, or worse yet, ask one of your competitors?</p>



<p>I confess that the answers to the above questions are hard to summarize in a single number (unless you, like, concatenated binary encodings of them or something).  But they <em>can</em> be ineffably combined, to produce a progress metric that one of my postdocs suggested calling “quantum scottness,” and which roughly equals the number of expressions of wide-eyed surprise minus the number of groans.</p></div>

    <title>A New College of Computing at Illinois Tech</title>

In 1890, Chicago South Side pastor Frank Gunsaulus gave a sermon where he said that with a million dollars he could build a school where students of all backgrounds could prepare for meaningful roles in a changing industrial society. One of the congregants, Philip Armour, came up to him after the service and told Gunsaulus that "if you give me five years of your time, I will give you the money." Thus was born the Armour Institute of Technology, the forerunner of the Illinois Institute of Technology.<br/>
<br/>
Today Illinois Tech enters a new chapter, <a href="https://www.iit.edu/news/illinois-tech-creates-college-computing-fuel-chicagos-tech-rise">announcing a College of Computing</a>, and I am honored to have been asked to serve as its inaugural dean. The college will take on a horizontal mission, to infuse computation and data science thinking throughout the curriculum in every discipline, while understanding the power, limitations and social implications of the technologies they create. We will significantly grow computing to produce the talent needed for a growing Chicago tech community. The college will develop an agile curriculum to continually reevaluate our offerings as computing technology continues to advance, and develop education as a life-long process where our alumni can always count on Illinois Tech to continually reskill to advance their careers.<br/>
<br/>
We will do it all by keeping the core principle of the original "million-dollar sermon," as important as ever, to prepare students of all backgrounds for meaningful roles in a changing technological society.<br/>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: We provide an information-theoretic framework for studying the generalization properties of machine learning algorithms. Our framework ties together existing approaches, including uniform convergence bounds and recent methods for adaptive data analysis. Specifically, we use Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) to quantify how well the input (i.e., the training data) can be recognized given the output (i.e., the trained model) of the learning algorithm. We show that bounds on CMI can be obtained from VC dimension, compression schemes, differential privacy, and other methods. We then show that bounded CMI implies various forms of generalization.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Lydia Zakynthinou.</p></blockquote></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>These next few months, every time I stop myself from touching my face by force of will,</p>



<p>Let me remind myself that the same willpower is available to diet, to exercise, to throw myself into a project, to keep calm amid screaming, to introduce myself to strangers, to decrease the fraction of my life spent getting upset that someone was mean to my ingroup on social media, or otherwise to better myself as a human specimen.</p>



<p>Yea, let all of these things be just as easy for me as it was not to touch my face.</p>



<p>Ah, but what if I forget, what if I do keep touching my face in the next few months?</p>



<p>In one plausible scenario, with at least ~0.1% probability and probably higher depending on my age, a cheap answer will be available to that question: namely, that I’ll no longer be around to ponder the implications.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Soon, all anyone will want to talk about is quarantines, food shortages, N95 masks, the suspension of universities and of scientific conferences.  (As many others have pointed out, this last might actually be a boon to scientific productivity—as it was for a young Isaac Newton when Cambridge was closed for the bubonic plague, so Newton went home and invented calculus and mechanics.)</p>



<p>Anyway, before that all happens, I figured I’d get in a last post about quantum information and complexity theory progress.</p>



<p>Hsin-Yuan Huang, Richard Kueng, and John Preskill have a nice preprint entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08953">Predicting Many Properties of a Quantum System from Very Few Measurements</a>.  In it they take <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01053">shadow tomography</a>, which I proposed a couple years ago, and try to bring it closer to practicality on near-term devices, by restricting to the special case of non-adaptive, one-shot measurements, on separate copies of the state ρ that you’re trying to learn about.  They show that this is possible using a number of copies that depends logarithmically on the number of properties you’re trying to learn (the optimal dependence), not at all on the Hilbert space dimension, and linearly on a new “shadow norm” quantity that they introduce.</p>



<p>Rahul Ilango, Bruno Loff, and Igor Oliveira announced the pretty spectacular-sounding result that the <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/021/">Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) is NP-complete for multi-output functions</a>—that is, for Boolean functions f with not only many input bits but many outputs.  Given the 2<sup>n</sup>-sized truth table of a Boolean function f:{0,1}<sup>n</sup>→{0,1}, the original MCSP simply asks for the size of the smallest Boolean circuit that computes f.  This problem was studied in the USSR as early as the 1950s; whether it’s NP-complete has stood for decades as one of the big open problems of complexity theory.  We’ve known that if you could quickly solve MCSP then you could also invert any one-way function, but we’ve also known technical barriers to going beyond that to a flat-out NP-hardness result, at least via known routes.  Before seeing this paper, I’d never thought about whether MCSP for many-output functions might somehow be easier to classify, but apparently it is!</p>



<p>Hamoon Mousavi, Seyed Nezhadi, and Henry Yuen have now taken the MIP*=RE breakthrough even a tiny step further, by showing that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10490">“zero-gap MIP*”</a> (that is, quantum multi-prover interactive proofs with an arbitrarily small gap between the completeness and soundness probabilities) takes you <strong>even beyond the halting problem</strong> (i.e., beyond Recursively Enumerable or RE), and up to the second level of the arithmetical hierarchy (i.e., to the halting problem for Turing machines with oracles for the original halting problem).  This answers a question that someone asked <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4512#comment-1829033">in the comments section of this blog</a>.</p>



<p>Several people asked me for comment on the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07730">What limits the simulation of quantum computers?</a>, by Yiqing Zhou, Miles Stoudenmire, and Xavier Waintal.  In particular, does this paper refute or weaken Google’s quantum supremacy claim, as the paper does <em>not</em> claim to do (but, rather coyly, also does not claim <em>not</em> to do)?  Short answer: No, it doesn’t, or not now anyway.</p>



<p>Longer, more technical answer: The quoted simulation times, just a few minutes for quantum circuits with 54 qubits and depth 20, <em>assume Controlled-Z gates rather than iSWAP-like gates.</em> Using tensor network methods, the classical simulation cost with the former is roughly the square root of the simulation cost with the latter (~2<sup>k</sup> versus ~4<sup>k</sup> for some parameter k related to the depth).  As it happens, Google switched its hardware from Controlled-Z to iSWAP-like gates a couple years ago precisely because they realized this—I had a conversation about it with Sergio Boixo at the time.  Once this issue is accounted for, the quoted simulation times in the new paper seem to be roughly in line with what was previously reported by, e.g., Johnnie Gray and Google itself.</p>



<p>Oh yeah, I enjoyed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09524">Quantum Homeopathy Works</a>.  Cool result, and the title is actually a pretty accurate description of the contents.</p>



<p>To end with a community announcement: as many of you might know, the American Physical Society’s March Meeting, which was planned for this week in Denver, was abruptly cancelled due to the coronavirus (leaving thousands of physicists out their flights and hotel rooms—many had even already arrived there).  However, my colleague Michael Biercuk kindly alerted me to a <a href="https://virtualmarchmeeting.com/">“virtual March Meeting”</a> that’s been set up online, with recorded talks and live webinars.  Even after the pandemic passes, is this a model that we should increasingly move to?  I wouldn’t have thought so ten or fifteen years ago, but today every schlep across the continent brings me a step closer to shouting “yes”…</p></div>
