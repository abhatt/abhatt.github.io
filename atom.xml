used to compute the optimal strategy for the leader to commit to in a
Stackelberg game, are susceptible to manipulation by the follower. Such a
learning algorithm operates by querying the best responses or the payoffs of
the follower, who consequently can deceive the algorithm by responding as if
his payoffs were much different than what they actually are. For this strategic
behavior to be successful, the main challenge faced by the follower is to
pinpoint the payoffs that would make the learning algorithm compute a
commitment so that best responding to it maximizes the follower's utility,
according to his true payoffs. While this problem has been considered before,
the related literature only focused on the simplified scenario in which the
payoff space is finite, thus leaving the general version of the problem
unanswered. In this paper, we fill in this gap, by showing that it is always
possible for the follower to compute (near-)optimal payoffs for various
scenarios about the learning interaction between leader and follower.

Tsybakov noise. In the Tsybakov noise model, each label is independently
flipped with some probability which is controlled by an adversary. This noise
model significantly generalizes the Massart noise model, by allowing the
flipping probabilities to be arbitrarily close to $1/2$ for a fraction of the
samples. Our main result is the first non-trivial PAC learning algorithm for
this problem under a broad family of structured distributions -- satisfying
certain concentration and (anti-)anti-concentration properties -- including
log-concave distributions. Specifically, we given an algorithm that achieves
misclassification error $\epsilon$ with respect to the true halfspace, with
quasi-polynomial runtime dependence in $1/\epsilin$. The only previous upper
bound for this problem -- even for the special case of log-concave
distributions -- was doubly exponential in $1/\epsilon$ (and follows via the
naive reduction to agnostic learning). Our approach relies on a novel
computationally efficient procedure to certify whether a candidate solution is
near-optimal, based on semi-definite programming. We use this certificate
procedure as a black-box and turn it into an efficient learning algorithm by
searching over the space of halfspaces via online convex optimization.

However, it brings bit savings at the cost of significant increases in coding
complexity, which limits its potential for implementation within practical

which improves the interpolation of reference samples needed for fractional
precision motion compensation. Contrary to previous efforts, the proposed
approach focuses on complexity reduction achieved by interpreting the
interpolation filters learned by the networks. When the approach is implemented
in the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) test model, up to 4.5% BD-rate saving for
individual sequences is achieved compared with the baseline VVC, while the
complexity of learned interpolation is significantly reduced compared to the
application of full neural network.

assumed to be known upfront. This static input structure is often informed
purely by insight of the machine learning practitioner, and might not be
optimal for the actual task the GNN is solving. In absence of reliable domain
expertise, one might resort to inferring the latent graph structure, which is
often difficult due to the vast search space of possible graphs. Here we
introduce Pointer Graph Networks (PGNs) which augment sets or graphs with
additional inferred edges for improved model expressivity. PGNs allow each node
to dynamically point to another node, followed by message passing over these
pointers. The sparsity of this adaptable graph structure makes learning
tractable while still being sufficiently expressive to simulate complex
algorithms. Critically, the pointing mechanism is directly supervised to model
long-term sequences of operations on classical data structures, incorporating
useful structural inductive biases from theoretical computer science.
Qualitatively, we demonstrate that PGNs can learn parallelisable variants of
pointer-based data structures, namely disjoint set unions and link/cut trees.
PGNs generalise out-of-distribution to 5x larger test inputs on dynamic graph
connectivity tasks, outperforming unrestricted GNNs and Deep Sets.

searching for a geometric transformation. Recent works leverage the power of
deep learning for registering a pair of point sets. However, unfortunately,
deep learning models often require a large number of ground truth labels for
training. Moreover, for a pair of source and target point sets, existing deep
learning mechanisms require explicitly designed encoders to extract both deep
spatial features from unstructured point clouds and their spatial correlation
representation, which is further fed to a decoder to regress the desired
geometric transformation for point set alignment. To further enhance deep
learning models for point set registration, this paper proposes Deep-3DAligner,
a novel unsupervised registration framework based on a newly introduced deep
Spatial Correlation Representation (SCR) feature. The SCR feature describes the
geometric essence of the spatial correlation between source and target point
sets in an encoding-free manner. More specifically, our method starts with
optimizing a randomly initialized latent SCR feature, which is then decoded to
a geometric transformation (i.e., rotation and translation) to align source and
target point sets. Our Deep-3DAligner jointly updates the SCR feature and
weights of the transformation decoder towards the minimization of an
unsupervised alignment loss. We conducted experiments on the ModelNet40
datasets to validate the performance of our unsupervised Deep-3DAligner for
point set registration. The results demonstrated that, even without ground
truth and any assumption of a direct correspondence between source and target
point sets for training, our proposed approach achieved comparative performance
compared to most recent supervised state-of-the-art approaches.

classes are known to have useful algorithmic applications related to variants
of the clique and $k$-coloring problems. We consider six well-known graph

induced topological minor, and induced subgraph relations. For each of them, we
give a complete characterization of the graphs $H$ for which the class of
graphs excluding $H$ is $(tw,\omega)$-bounded. Our results imply that the class
of $1$-perfectly orientable graphs is $(tw,\omega)$-bounded, answering a

that can work in many specific scenarios is a challenging task. We describe the
C ++ programming techniques that can help in creating flexible and extensible
programming interfaces for linear solvers. The approach is based on
policy-based design and partial template specialization, and is implemented in

demonstrated on the example of accelerating a large-scale Stokes problem
solution with a Schur pressure correction preconditioner. The user may select
algorithmic components of the solver by adjusting template parameters without
any change to the codebase. It is also possible to switch to block values, or
use mixed precision solution, which results in up to 4 times speedup, and
reduces the memory footprint of the algorithm by about 50%.

Kallimanis</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kanellou:Eleni.html">Eleni Kanellou</a>, Charidimos Kiosterakis <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06048">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this work, we propose the $\lambda$-scanner snapshot, a variation of the
snapshot object, which supports any fixed amount of $0 &lt; \lambda \leq n$
different $SCAN$ operations being active at any given time. Whenever $\lambda$
is equal to the number of processes $n$ in the system, the $\lambda$-scanner
object implements a multi-scanner object, while in case that $\lambda$ is equal
to $1$, the $\lambda$-scanner object implements a single-scanner object. We
present the $\lambda-Snap$ snapshot object, a wait-free $\lambda$-scanner
snapshot implementation that has a step complexity of $O(\lambda)$ for $UPDATE$
operations and $O(\lambda m)$ for $SCAN$ operations. The space complexity of
$\lambda-Snap$ is $O(\lambda m)$. $\lambda-Snap$ provides a trade-off between
the step/space complexity and the maximum number of $SCAN$ operations that the
system can afford to be active on any given point in time. The low space
complexity that our implementations provide makes them more appealing in real
system applications. Moreover, we provide a slightly modified version of the
$\lambda-Snap$ implementation, which is called partial $\lambda-Snap$, that is
able to support dynamic partial scan operations. In such an object, processes
can execute modified $SCAN$ operations called $PARTIAL\_SCAN$ that could obtain
a part of the snapshot object avoiding to read the whole set of components.
</p>
<p>In this work, we first provide a simple single-scanner version of
$\lambda-Snap$, which is called $1-Snap$. We provide $1-Snap$ just for
presentation purposes, since it is simpler than $\lambda-Snap$. The $UPDATE$ in
$1-Snap$ has a step complexity of $O(1)$, while the $SCAN$ has a step
complexity of $O(m)$. This implementation uses $O(m)$ $CAS$ registers.

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">Will He Go?, by legal scholar Lawrence Douglas, is, at 120 pages, a slim volume focused on a single question: what happens if the 2020 US election delivers a narrow or disputed result favoring Biden, and Trump refuses to concede? This question will, of course, either be answered or rendered irrelevant in half a year. [‚Ä¶]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Will-He-Go-Election-Meltdown/dp/1538751887">Will He Go?</a>, by legal scholar Lawrence Douglas, is, at 120 pages, a slim volume focused on a single question: <em>what happens if the 2020 US election delivers a narrow or disputed result favoring Biden, and Trump refuses to concede?</em>  This question will, of course, either be answered or rendered irrelevant in half a year.  And yet, in my estimation, there‚Äôs at least a 15% probability that <em>Will He Go?</em> will enter the ranks of the most important and prescient books ever written.  You should read it right now (or at least read <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/3/21257133/trump-2020-election-meltdown-lawrence-douglas">this Vox interview</a>), if you want to think through the contours of a civilizational Singularity that seems at least as plausible to me as the AI Singularity, but whose fixed date of November 3, 2020 we‚Äôre now hurtling toward.</p>



<p>In one of the defining memes of the past few years, a sign in a bookstore reads ‚ÄúDear customers: post-apocalyptic fiction has been moved to the Current Affairs section.‚Äù  I was reminded of that as Douglas dryly lays out his horror scenario: imagine, hypothetically, that a President of the United States gets elected on a platform of racism and lies, with welcomed assistance from a foreign adversary.  Suppose that his every outrage only endears him further to his millions of followers.  Suppose that, as this president‚Äôs deepest (and perhaps only) principle, he never backs down, never apologizes, never acknowledges any inconvenient fact, and never accepts the legitimacy of any contest that he loses‚Äîand <em>this is perfectly rational for him, </em>as he‚Äôs been richly rewarded for this strategy his entire life.  Suppose that, during the final presidential debate, he pointedly refuses to promise to respect the election outcome if he loses‚Äîa first in American history.  And suppose that, after eking out a narrow win in the Electoral College, he then turns around and <em>disputes the election anyway</em> (!)‚Äîclaiming, ludicrously, that he would‚Äôve won the popular vote too, if not for millions of fraudulent voters.  Suppose that, for their own sordid reasons, Republican majorities in the Senate and Supreme Court enable this president‚Äôs chaotic rule, block his impeachment, and acquiesce to his daily cruelties and lies.</p>



<p>Then what happens in the <em>next</em> election?</p>



<p>Taking the existing catastrophe as given, Douglas asks: is America‚Äôs Constitutional machinery up to a challenge that it‚Äôs never yet faced, of a president who accepts democracy itself as legitimate only when he wins?  Douglas concludes that it isn‚Äôt‚Äîand this is the book‚Äôs terrifying and non-obvious part.  There are no checks or balances in the Constitution that will magically ensure a smooth transition of power.  On the contrary, the design flaws of our antiquated system make a meltdown <em>more</em> likely.</p>



<p>OK, but then why hasn‚Äôt America‚Äôs Reactor of Democracy exploded yet (or at least, not since the Civil War)?  Douglas spends a lot of time on historical parallels, including the Tilden-Hayes election of 1876 and the Bush-Gore election of 2000.  In each case, he finds, collapse was averted not because of mythical safeguards in our rickety, Rube-Goldberg system, but <em>only</em> because the relevant people (e.g., Samuel Tilden, Al Gore) stood down, having internalized the norm that the national good required them to.  But that‚Äôs precisely what Trump has telegraphed that he‚Äôll never do.</p>



<p>The class of scenario that most worries Douglas runs as follows: just like last time, the election comes down to a few swing states, such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.  Crucially, right now all three of those states have Democratic governors and Republican-controlled legislatures ‚Ä¶ and <em>there‚Äôs no clear law about which of the two (the governor or the legislature) gets to certify election results and send them to Congress!</em>  So suppose Trump has a slight edge on election night, Fox News calls the race for him, but then an avalanche of absentee or provisional ballots shift things in Biden‚Äôs favor over the following week.  Can you imagine Trump or his supporters accepting the latter?</p>



<p>Or suppose that, on election day, Russian hackers cut off electricity or voter registration databases in Philadelphia or Detroit, via computer systems that <em>we know they already broke into and that remain exposed (!)</em>.  Hundreds of thousands are unable to vote; the Democratic governor orders a revote; the Republican legislature tries to preempt that by sending the original tally to Congress.</p>



<p>The final authority over election results rests with Congress.  The trouble is, the Senate is currently under Republican control and the House under Democratic control‚Äîand once again, <em>the Constitution and federal law provide no clear guidance on how to resolve a deadlock between the two on presidential succession (!!)</em>.  So what if Michigan or Pennsylvania or Wisconsin sends two separate sets of election results, and (predictably) the House accepts one and the Senate accepts the other?  And what if there‚Äôs no resolution by noon EST on January 20, 2021?  Then by law, the Speaker of the House, currently Nancy Pelosi, becomes acting president.  Can you imagine Trump willingly vacating the Oval Office if that comes to pass?</p>



<p>Douglas seems to have finished writing <em>Will He Go?</em> just as the coronavirus shut down the planet; he includes some comments about how that will massively exacerbate the above problems.  Election officials expect a historic number of absentee ballots, from people‚Äîdisproportionately urban‚Äîwho will (reasonably) consider it unsafe to wait in line for hours in a room packed with hundreds of strangers.  Alas, Trump has already told his followers that voting by mail is a scam to be fiercely opposed, never mind that he uses it himself.  Worse yet, the laws governing mail-in ballots‚Äîthe signature, the postmark, the deadline for receipt‚Äîare byzantine, open to interpretation, and wildly different from county to county.  So again: imagine if mail-in ballots overturn what looked like a Trump win on election night.  The 2000 Florida recount battle was tea and cookies by comparison.</p>



<p>Douglas doesn‚Äôt mention, because it happened too recently, the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests (and in rarer cases, vandalism and looting) set off by the horrific murder of George Floyd, and the often shockingly militarized response.  But assuming the protests continue through the fall, they‚Äôll of course give the Trumpists even more pretexts to meddle with the election, in the name of imposing ‚Äúorder.‚Äù</p>



<p>This is not a sound statistical methodology, but if I imagine a <em>gong</em> every time the US inches perceptibly closer to collapse‚Äî<em>gong</em> when Trump got elected, <em>gong</em> when covid made landfall and the states were abandoned to fight each other over medical supplies, <em>gong</em> when George Floyd was murdered and staid, conformist liberals suddenly became anarchists demanding the complete abolition of all police‚Äîwell, the <em>gong</em>s seem to be getting more frequent!  Almost as if they were building toward a <em>gong</em>ularity that was, I dunno, sometime around November!</p>



<p>Douglas never mentions the prospect of a second Civil War until literally the book‚Äôs last sentence, but it‚Äôs the undercurrent of everything he writes‚Äîparticularly given Trump‚Äôs frequent glorifications of violence, and his heavily armed base.  Having spent his career studying American jurisprudence, Douglas is willing to guide our imaginations all the way to the precipice but not over it.  Part of me still finds the possibility of going over unthinkable‚Äîalthough wasn‚Äôt the <em>first</em> Civil War similarly unthinkable until shortly before it happened?</p>



<p>If there <em>is</em> to be a Chernobyl-like meltdown of the Founding Fathers‚Äô machine, at least it would retrospectively make sense of a lot that‚Äôs confused me in the past few years.  As I‚Äôm far from the only one to notice, ‚Äúmy‚Äù side, the left, has seemed less and less interested in debate and discussion, and more and more eager to denounce, ban, shame, and no-platform.  As just one example, out of hundreds that would serve, last week a 28-year-old analyst named David Shor was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/case-for-liberalism-tom-cotton-new-york-times-james-bennet.html">fired from his job</a> for <em>politely tweeting about an <a href="http://omarwasow.com/APSR_protests3_1.pdf">academic paper</a> offering evidence that peaceful protests are effective at winning public support for progressive, antiracist causes, while violence is ineffective</em>.  Hopefully <em>I</em> won‚Äôt now be fired for mentioning this!</p>



<p>Of course every cause has its extremists, but the puzzle is that I <em>know</em> plenty of people who will eagerly join whatever is the shaming or firing campaign du jour.  And many of those people strike me as friendly, insightful, honest, balanced, wise‚Äîat least when the topic is apolitical, as (alas) less and less seems to be these days.</p>



<p>Thought experiment: two protesters meet on a street, carrying huge signs that say ‚ÄúBLACK LIVES MATTER‚Äù and ‚ÄúALL LIVES MATTER‚Äù respectively.  Can you imagine the following conversation ensuing: ‚ÄúAh, my good fellow, it looks like you and I are allies, sharing deeply compatible moral messages with the world ‚Ä¶ one of us merely focused more on a special case, and the other on its generalization!  Shall we sit in the park to discuss our joint strategy?‚Äù</p>



<p>I guess it takes an Aspbergery STEM nerd even to <em>ask</em> why that never happens.  To spell it out: both sides are deploying English words, not for what they explicitly assert, but as markers of tribal affiliation, of <em>which side they‚Äôre on</em>.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs much the same with ‚ÄúBelieve Women.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBelieve <em>all</em> women, <em>always</em>?‚Äù asks our hapless STEM nerd.  ‚ÄúWomen are goddesses who never lie?  Feminism is no longer the radical notion that women are people?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo, you sexist asshat,‚Äù replies the normie.  ‚ÄúIt means listen to women, empathize with women, believe women, be on their side, be on <em>our</em> side.  What about that is so f-ing hard to understand?‚Äù</p>



<p>Or consider the slogans now conquering the world: ‚Äúabolish the police‚Äù and ‚Äúdefund the police.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou mean <em>fundamentally reform</em> the police, right?‚Äù asks the STEM nerd.  ‚ÄúEliminate qualified immunity, bust the unions that protect abusive cops, get rid of military gear, provide de-escalation training, stop treating homelessness and drug abuse as law enforcement problems, and all those other no-brainers?  But not, like, literally end all law enforcement, leave the 911 calls unanswered as machete-wielding rapists run free, and let gangsters and warlords fill the vacuum?‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúNo, abolish the police means <em>abolish the police</em>,‚Äù reply the activists sternly.  ‚ÄúYou refuse to listen.  You‚Äôre not our ally.‚Äù</p>



<p>Imagine a ragtag guerilla army encamped in the jungle, surrounded by a brutal occupying force and facing impossible odds, constantly on the alert for turncoats and spies and fair-weather friends in its midst.  Would it surprise you if these guerillas had a macabre initiation ritual for new recruits: say, slicing off the tips of recruits‚Äô fingers?</p>



<p>Now suppose you reckoned that truth and justice were at least 3/4 on the guerillas‚Äô side, and so decided to join them.  At your initiation, would you ask the guerillas if they‚Äôd analyzed whether finger-slicing <em>actually</em> leads to greater effectiveness in battle?  Or, as you swore the oath of eternal allegiance to the cause, with one hand on your heart and the other on your Kalashnikov, would you add: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ <em>assuming</em> that we continue to represent Enlightenment values like science, free speech, and intellectual charity‚Äù?</p>



<p>When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it suddenly became reasonable to take the side of the bloodthirsty Stalin.  And it would‚Äôve been <em>praiseworthy</em> for a Russian to say: ‚ÄúI now pledge my life to fighting for the Soviet government‚Äîeven if, likely as not, that government will thank me afterward by sending me to the gulag for an invented crime.‚Äù</p>



<p>Five years ago, thousands of woke activists shamed me for writing about my teenage experiences on this blog, a few even calling for an end to my career.  Especially if those activists emerge victorious from a turbulent 2020‚Äî<em>as I hope they will</em>‚ÄîI expect that they‚Äôll come for me again.  (Well, if they get around to it.  I‚Äôm nowhere near the top of their list.)</p>



<p>And yet, if Lawrence Douglas‚Äôs scenario comes to pass‚Äîif, for example, the 2020 election leaves Trump barricaded in the White House with his loyalists, while a duly elected government waits in limbo‚Äîthen I pledge to render whatever assistance I can, and even risk my life if needed, for the same side that the woke activists will be on.</p>



<p>I‚Äôd rather not, though.  As Douglas points out, the more overwhelming we can make Trump‚Äôs electoral defeat, the less chance that it ever comes to this.</p></div>

    <title>MeshWalker: Deep Mesh Understanding by Random Walks</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1591833600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Alon Lahav, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Tal:Ayellet.html">Ayellet Tal</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05353">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Most attempts to represent 3D shapes for deep learning have focused on
volumetric grids, multi-view images and point clouds. In this paper we look at
the most popular representation of 3D shapes in computer graphics - a
triangular mesh - and ask how it can be utilized within deep learning. The few
attempts to answer this question propose to adapt convolutions &amp; pooling to
suit Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper proposes a very different
approach, termed MeshWalker, to learn the shape directly from a given mesh. The
key idea is to represent the mesh by random walks along the surface, which
"explore" the mesh's geometry and topology. Each walk is organized as a list of
vertices, which in some manner imposes regularity on the mesh. The walk is fed
into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that "remembers" the history of the walk.
We show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for two fundamental
shape analysis tasks: shape classification and semantic segmentation.
Furthermore, even a very small number of examples suffices for learning. This
is highly important, since large datasets of meshes are difficult to acquire.

the core and most studied problems in supply chain management for the last half
a century. Nonetheless, despite the vast effort put into studying the problem,
its complexity has eluded researchers for years. Although the CPJRP has one of
the tighter constant approximation ratio of 1.02, a polynomial optimal solution
to it was never found. Recently, the discrete version of this problem was
finally proved to be NP-hard. In this paper, we extend this result and finaly
prove that the CPJRP problem is also strongly NP-hard.

    <title>Faster Queries on BWT-runs Compressed Indexes</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nishimoto:Takaaki.html">Takaaki Nishimoto</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Tabei:Yasuo.html">Yasuo Tabei</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05104">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Although a significant number of compressed indexes for highly repetitive
strings have been proposed thus far, developing compressed indexes that support
faster queries remains a challenge. Run-length Burrows-Wheeler transform
(RLBWT) is a lossless data compression by a reversible permutation of an input
string and run-length encoding, and it has become a popular research topic in
string processing. Recently, Gagie et al. presented r-index, an efficient
compressed index on RLBWT whose space usage does not depend on text length. In
this paper, we present a new compressed index on RLBWT, which we call
r-index-f, in which r-index is improved for faster locate queries. We introduce
a novel division of RLBWT into blocks, which we call balanced BWT-sequence as
follows: the RLBWT of a string is divided into several blocks, and a
parent-child relationship between each pair of blocks is defined. In addition,
we present a novel backward search algorithm on the balanced BWT-sequences,
resulting in faster locate queries of r-index-f. We also present new algorithms
for solving the queries of count query, extract query, decompression and prefix
search on r-index-f.

used to increase spectral efficiency. The maximum likelihood (ML) decoder
jointly detects the transmitted SM symbol, which is of high complexity. In this
paper, a novel reliable sphere decoder (RSD) algorithm based on tree-search is
proposed for the SM system. The basic idea of the proposed RSD algorithm is to
reduce the size of the tree-search, and then, a smart searching method inside
the reduced tree-search is performed to find the solution. The proposed RSD
algorithm provides a significant reduction in decoding complexity compared to
the ML decoder and existent decoders as well. Moreover, the RSD algorithm
provides a flexible trade-off between the bit error rate (BER) performance and
decoding complexity, so as to be reliable for a wide range of practical
hardware implementations. The BER performance and decoding complexity analysis
for the RSD algorithm are studied, and Monte Carlo simulations are then
provided to demonstrate the findings.

constraints. We provide a modular analysis with strong theoretical guarantees
for settings with concave rewards and convex constraints, and for settings with
hard constraints (knapsacks). Most of the previous work in constrained
reinforcement learning is limited to linear constraints, and the remaining work
focuses on either the feasibility question or settings with a single episode.
Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms these approaches in existing constrained episodic environments.

predictions, potentially imperfect, to improve their performance. The best
known online algorithms for this problem, due to Westbrook'94 and Bienkowski et
al'17, have competitive ratios strictly bounded away from 1. In contrast, we
show that if the algorithm is given a prediction of the input sequence, then it
can achieve a competitive ratio that tends to $1$ as the prediction error rate
tends to $0$. Specifically, the competitive ratio is equal to $1+O(q)$, where
$q$ is the prediction error rate. We also design a ``fallback option'' that
ensures that the competitive ratio of the algorithm for {\em any} input
sequence is at most $O(1/q)$. Our result adds to the recent body of work that
uses machine learning to improve the performance of ``classic'' algorithms.

society including science. Mining these data meaningfully has become a
considerable challenge and is of the broadest possible interest. The size, both
in numbers of observations and dimensionality thereof, requires data mining
algorithms to possess time complexities with both variables that are linear or
nearly linear. One such algorithm, see Comput. Phys. Commun. 184, 2446-2453
(2013), arranges observations into a sequence called the progress index. The
progress index steps through distinct regions of high sampling density
sequentially. By means of suitable annotations, it allows a compact
representation of the behavior of complex systems, which is encoded in the
original data set. The only essential parameter is a notion of distance between
observations. Here, we present the shared memory parallelization of the key
step in constructing the progress index, which is the calculation of an
approximation of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph of
observations. We demonstrate that excellent parallel efficiencies are obtained
for up to 72 logical (CPU) cores. In addition, we introduce three conceptual
advances to the algorithm that improve its controllability and the
interpretability of the progress index itself.

the Graphical TSP, a city may be visited more than once, which may be necessary

is, matrices with spectral norm at most~1. The algorithm gets as an input an
arbitrary $n\times n$ contraction matrix $A$, and a parameter $T \leq
\mathrm{poly}(n)$ and outputs the entries of $A^T$, up to (arbitrary)
polynomially small additive error. The algorithm applies only unitary
operators, without intermediate measurements. We show various implications and
applications of this result:
</p>
<p>First, we use this algorithm to show that the class of quantum logspace
algorithms with only quantum memory and with intermediate measurements is
equivalent to the class of quantum logspace algorithms with only quantum memory
without intermediate measurements. This shows that the deferred-measurement
principle, a fundamental principle of quantum computing, applies also for
quantum logspace algorithms (without classical memory). More generally, we give
a quantum algorithm with space $O(S + \log T)$ that takes as an input the
description of a quantum algorithm with quantum space $S$ and time $T$, with
intermediate measurements (without classical memory), and simulates it
unitarily with polynomially small error, without intermediate measurements.
</p>
<p>Since unitary transformations are reversible (while measurements are
irreversible) an interesting aspect of this result is that it shows that any
quantum logspace algorithm (without classical memory) can be simulated by a
reversible quantum logspace algorithm. This proves a quantum analogue of the
result of Lange, McKenzie and Tapp that deterministic logspace is equal to
reversible logspace [LMT00].
</p>
<p>Finally, we use our results to show non-trivial classical simulations of
quantum logspace learning algorithms.

    <title>Evaluation of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm based on the approximation ratio of single samples</title>

quantum-classical algorithm to solve binary-variable optimization problems. Due
to its expected robustness to systematic errors and the short circuit depth, it
is one of the promising candidates likely to run on near-term quantum devices.
We project the performance of QAOA applied to the Max-Cut problem and compare
it with some of the best classical alternatives, both for exact or approximate
solution. When comparing approximate solvers, their performance is
characterized by the computational time taken to achieve a given quality of
solution. Since QAOA is based on sampling, we introduce performance metrics
based on the probability of observing a sample above a certain quality. In
addition, we show that the QAOA performance varies significantly with the graph
type. By selecting a suitable optimizer for the variational parameters and
reducing the number of function evaluations, QAOA performance improves by up to
2 orders of magnitude compared to previous estimates. Especially for 3-regular
random graphs, this setting decreases the performance gap with classical
alternatives.

algorithm outputs a quantum-mechanical representation of its corresponding
discrete Legendre-Fenchel transform evaluated at $K$ points in the transformed
space. For a fixed regular discretizaton of the dual space the expected running
time scales as $O(\sqrt{\kappa}\,\mathrm{polylog}(N,K))$, where $\kappa$ is the
condition number of the function. If the discretization of the dual space is
chosen adaptively with $K$ equal to $N$, the running time reduces to
$O(\mathrm{polylog}(N))$. We explain how to extend the presented algorithm to
the multivariate setting and prove lower bounds for the query complexity,
showing that our quantum algorithm is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors.
For certain scenarios, such as computing an expectation value of an

modern numerical algebraic geometry and theoretical computer science. One of
the challenges that it poses is to expand the currently limited range of random

available tools cannot handle random sparse polynomials and Gaussian
polynomials, that is polynomials whose coefficients are i.i.d. Gaussian random

of the cube, that is a step in this direction. We present this framework for
real hypersurfaces. We demonstrate its capabilities by providing a new
probabilistic complexity analysis for the Plantinga-Vegter algorithm, which
covers both random sparse (alas a restricted sparseness structure) polynomials
and random Gaussian polynomials. We present explicit results with structured
random polynomials for problems with two or more dimensions. Additionally, we
provide some estimates of the separation bound of a univariate polynomial in
our current framework.

    <title>TR20-090 |  Tight Quantum Time-Space Tradeoffs for Function Inversion |

	Luowen Qian</title>
    <summary>In function inversion, we are given a function $f: [N] \mapsto [N]$, and want to prepare some advice of size $S$, such that we can efficiently invert any image in time $T$. This is a well studied problem with profound connections to cryptography, data structures, communication complexity, and circuit lower bounds. Investigation of this problem in the quantum setting was initiated by Nayebi, Aaronson, Belovs, and Trevisan (2015), who proved a lower bound of $ST^2 = \tilde\Omega(N)$ for random permutations against classical advice, leaving open an intriguing possibility that Grover's search can be sped up to time $\tilde O(\sqrt{N/S})$. Recent works by Hhan, Xagawa, and Yamakawa (2019), and Chung, Liao, and Qian (2019) extended the argument for random functions and quantum advice, but the lower bound remains $ST^2 = \tilde\Omega(N)$. 

In this work, we prove that even with quantum advice, $ST + T^2 = \tilde\Omega(N)$ is required for an algorithm to invert random functions. This demonstrates that Grover's search is optimal for $S = \tilde O(\sqrt{N})$, ruling out any substantial speed-up for Grover's search even with quantum advice. Further improvements to our bounds would imply a breakthrough in circuit lower bounds, as shown by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (2019).

To prove this result, we develop a general framework for establishing quantum time-space lower bounds. We further demonstrate the power of our framework by proving the following results. 

* Yao's box problem: We prove a tight quantum time-space lower bound for classical advice. For quantum advice, we prove a first time-space lower bound using shadow tomography. These results resolve two open problems posted by Nayebi, Aaronson, Belovs, and Trevisan (2015). 

* Salted cryptography: We show that ‚Äúsalting generically provably defeats preprocessing,‚Äù a result shown by Coretti, Dodis, Guo, and Steinberger (2018), also holds in the quantum setting. In particular, we prove quantum time-space lower bounds for a wide class of salted cryptographic primitives in the quantum random oracle model. This yields a first quantum time-space lower bound for salted collision-finding, which in turn implies that ${PWPP}^{O} \not\subseteq {FBQP}^{O}{/qpoly}$ relative to a random oracle $O$.</summary>

    <title>TR20-089 |  Lower Bounds on  the Time/Memory Tradeoff of Function Inversion | 

	Dror Chawin, 

	Iftach Haitner, 

	Noam Mazor</title>
    <summary>We study time/memory tradeoffs of function inversion: an algorithm, i.e., an inverter, equipped with an $s$-bit advice for a randomly chosen function $f\colon [n] \mapsto [n]$ and using $q$ oracle queries to $f$, tries to invert a randomly chosen output $y$ of $f$ (i.e., to find $x$ such that $f(x)=y$). Much progress was done regarding adaptive function inversion - the inverter is allowed to make adaptive oracle queries. Hellman [IEEE transactions on Information Theory '80] presented an adaptive inverter that inverts with high probability a random $f$. Fiat and Naor [SICOMP '00] proved that for any $s,q$ with $s^2 q = n^2$ (ignoring low-order terms), an $s$-advice, $q$-query variant of Hellman's algorithm inverts a constant fraction of the image points of any function. Yao [STOC '90] proved a lower bound of $sq\ge n$ for  this problem. Closing the gap between the above lower and upper bounds is a long-standing open question.

Very little is known for the non-adaptive variant of the question - the inverter chooses its queries in advance. The only known upper bounds, i.e., inverters, are the trivial ones (with $s+q= n$), and the only lower bound is the above bound of Yao. In a recent work, Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan [TCC '19] partially justified the difficulty of finding lower bounds on non-adaptive inverters, showing that a lower bound on the time/memory tradeoff of non-adaptive inverters implies a lower bound on low-depth Boolean circuits. Bounds that for a strong enough choice of parameters, are notoriously hard to prove.

We make progress on the above intriguing question, both for the adaptive and the non-adaptive case, proving the following lower bounds on restricted families of inverters:

	- Linear-advice (adaptive inverter): If the advice string is a linear function of $f$ (e.g., $A\times f$, viewing $f$ as  a vector in $[n]^n$), then $s+q \in \Omega(n)$.
	
	- Affine non-adaptive decoders: If the non-adaptive inverter has an affine decoder - it outputs a linear function, determined by the advice string and the element to invert, of the query answers - then $s \in \Omega(n)$ (regardless of $q$).
	
	- Affine non-adaptive decision trees: If the non-adaptive inversion algorithm is a $d$-depth affine decision tree - it outputs the evaluation of a decision tree whose nodes compute a linear function of the answers to the queries - and $q \le cn$ for some universal $c&gt;0$, then $s\in \Omega(n/d \log n)$.</summary>

    <title>TR20-088 |  Eliminating Intermediate Measurements in Space-Bounded Quantum Computation | 

	Bill Fefferman, 

	Zachary Remscrim</title>
    <summary>A foundational result in the theory of quantum computation known as the ``principle of safe storage'' shows that it is always possible to take a quantum circuit and produce an equivalent circuit that makes all measurements at the end of the computation.  While this procedure is time efficient, meaning that it does not introduce a large overhead in the number of gates, it uses extra ancillary qubits and so is not generally space efficient.  It is quite natural to ask whether it is possible to defer measurements to the end of a quantum computation without increasing the number of ancillary qubits.
		
		We give an affirmative answer to this question by exhibiting a procedure to eliminate all intermediate measurements that is simultaneously space-efficient and time-efficient. A key component of our approach, which may be of independent interest, involves showing that the well-conditioned versions of many standard linear-algebraic problems may be solved by a quantum computer in less space than seems possible by a classical computer.</summary>

    <title>TR20-087 |  Quantum Logspace Algorithm for Powering Matrices with Bounded Norm | 

	Uma Girish, 

	Ran Raz, 

	Wei Zhan</title>
    <summary>We give a quantum logspace algorithm for powering contraction matrices, that is, matrices with spectral norm at most 1. The algorithm gets as an input an arbitrary $n\times n$ contraction matrix $A$, and a parameter $T \leq poly(n)$ and outputs the entries of $A^T$, up to (arbitrary) polynomially small additive error. The algorithm applies only unitary operators, without intermediate measurements. We show various implications and applications of this result:

First, we use this algorithm to show that the class of quantum logspace algorithms with only quantum memory and with intermediate measurements is equivalent to the class of quantum logspace algorithms with only quantum memory without intermediate measurements. This shows that the deferred-measurement principle, a fundamental principle of quantum computing, applies also for quantum logspace algorithms (without classical memory). More generally, we give a quantum algorithm with space $O(S + \log T)$ that takes as an input the description of a quantum algorithm with quantum space $S$ and time $T$, with intermediate measurements (without classical memory), and simulates it unitarily with polynomially small error, without intermediate measurements.

Since unitary transformations are reversible (while measurements are irreversible) an interesting aspect of this result is that it shows that any quantum logspace algorithm (without classical memory) can be simulated by a reversible quantum logspace algorithm. This proves a quantum analogue of the result of Lange, McKenzie and Tapp that deterministic logspace is equal to reversible logspace.

Finally, we use our results to show non-trivial classical simulations of quantum logspace learning algorithms.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Last month saw activity across a diverse collection of topics in sublinear algorithms. In particular, we had the following <s>five</s> six papers. <em>(Sorry, I missed one)</em> </p>



<p><strong>One-Sided Error Testing of Monomials and Affine Subspaces</strong> by Oded Goldreich and Dana Ron (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/068/">ECCC</a>). This work focuses on one-sided testing of two kinds of problems (and their variants): <br/><span class="has-inline-color has-blue-color">1.</span> Testing Monomials: Suppose you are given a function \(f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\). Is \(f = \wedge_{i \in I} x_i\) (that is, is \(f\) a monotone monomial). <br/><span class="has-inline-color has-blue-color">2.</span> Testing Affine Subspaces: Consider the task of testing whether a \(f \colon \mathcal{F}^n \to \{0,1\}\) is the indicator of an \((n-k)\)-dimensional affine space for some \(k\) (where \(\mathcal{F}\) is a finite field).<br/></p>



<p>The paper shows that the general problem ‚Äî the one in which the arity of the monomial (resp the co-dimension of the subspace) is not specified has one-sided query complexity \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)\). The same holds for testing whether the arity of the monomial is at most \(k\) (resp the co-dimension of the subspace is at most \(k\)). Finally, the exact problem which seeks to test whether the arity of the monomial is exactly \(k\) (resp the co-dimension of the space is exactly \(k\)) has query complexity \(\Omega(\log n)\). For two sided testers however, size oblivious testers are known for this problem. Thus, like the authors remark, two-sided error is inherent in the case of the exact version of the problem.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Sampling Arbitrary Subgraphs Exactly Uniformly in Sublinear Time</strong> by Hendrik Fichtenberger, Mingze Gao, Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01861v2">arXiv</a>). Readers of PT Review are no strangers to the problem of counting cliques in sublinear time (with a certain query model). Building on tools from [1], in [2], Eden-Ron-Seshadhri gave the first algorithms for counting number of copies \(K_r\) in a graph \(G\) to within a \((1 \pm \varepsilon)\) multiplicative factor. En route to this result, they also gave a procedure to sample cliques incident to some special set \(S \subseteq V(G)\). The query model in [2] allowed the following queries: a u.a.r vertex query, degree query, \(i^{th}\) neighbor query and a pair query which answers whether a pair \((u,v)\) forms an edge. The work under consideration shows a result which I personally find remarkable: given the additional ability to get a u.a.r edge sample, we can do the following. For any graph \(H\) we can obtain a uniformly random subgraph isomorphic to \(H\) in \(G\). Let that sink in: this work shows that you can sample \(H\) <em>exactly uniformly</em> from the graph \(G\).  </p>



<p><strong>Finding Planted Cliques in Sublinear Time</strong> by Jay Mardia, Hilal Asi, Kabir Aladin Chandrasekher (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12002">arXiv</a>). Planted Clique is a time honored problem in average case complexity. This classic problem asks the following: You are given a \(G \sim \mathcal{G}(n, 1/2)\). Suppose I select a subset of \(k\) vertices in this graph and put a clique on the subgraph they induce. In principle it is possible to recover the clique I planted if \(k &gt; (2 + \varepsilon) \log n\). But it seems you get polynomial time algorithms only when \(k \geq \Omega(\sqrt n)\) even after you throw SDPs at the problem. Moreover, so far, the algorithms which recover the planted \(k\)-clique were known to take \(\widetilde{O}(n^2)\) time. This work shows that you actually get algorithms which take time \(\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})\) if \(k \geq \Omega(\sqrt{n \log n})\). The key idea is to first obtain a ‚Äúcore‚Äù part of the clique of size \(O(\log n)\) in time \(\widetilde{O}(n^2/k)\). This is followed up with a clique completion routine where you mark all vertices connected to the entire core as being potentially in the clique. The paper also shows a conditional lower bound result which shows that given query access to adjacency matrix of the graph, a natural family of non-adaptive algorithms cannot recover a planted \(k\) clique in time \(o\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)^3\) (for \(k \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt n))\).</p>



<p><strong>A robust multi-dimensional sparse Fourier transform in the continuous setting</strong> by Yaonan Jin, Daogao Liu and Zhao Song (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06156">arXiv</a>).  Suppose you are given an unknown signal whose Fourier Spectrum is k-sparse (that is, there are at most k dominant Fourier Coefficients and all the others are zero or close to zero). Significant research effort has been devoted to learn these signals leading to works which study this problem for multi-dimensional discrete setting and in the one-dimensional continuous case. The \(d\)-dimensional continuous case \((d = \Theta(1))\) was largely unexplored. This work makes progress on this frontier by making some natural assumptions on the unknown signal. In particular, the paper assumes that the frequencies ‚Äî which are vectors \(f_i‚Äôs \in R^d\) ‚Äî are well separated and satisfy \(\|f_i ‚Äì f_j\|_2 \leq \eta\) and that all \({f_i}_{i \in [k]} \subseteq [-F, F]^d\) sit inside a bounded box.<br/>The authors assume sample access to the signal in the sense that at any desired timestep \(\tau\), the algorithm can sample the signal‚Äôs value. With this setup, the authors show that all the dominant frequencies can be recovered with a \(O_d(k \cdot \log(F/\eta))\) samples by considering a relatively small time horizon.</p>



<p><strong>Extrapolating the profile of a finite population</strong> by Soham Jana, Yury Polyanskiy, Yihong Wu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10561">arXiv</a>). Consider the following setup. You are given a universe \(k\) balls. Ball come in up to \(k\) different colors. Say you \(\theta_j\) balls in color \(j\) for each \(j \in [k]\). One of the fundamental problems in statistics considers taking samples \(m\) balls from the universe and attempts estimating ‚Äúpopulation profile‚Äù (that is, the number of balls in each color). Historically, it is known that unless an overwhelming majority of the universe has been seen, one cannot estimate the empirical distribution of colors. This paper shows that in the sublinear regime, with \(m \geq \omega(k/\log k)\), it is possible to consistently estimate the population profile in total variation. And once you have a handle on the empirical distribution of the population, you can go ahead and learn lots of interesting label invariant properties of your universe (things like entropy, number of distinct elements etc). </p>

<p><strong>Testing Positive Semi-Definiteness via Random Submatrices</strong> by Ainesh Bakshi, Nadiia Chepurko, Rajesh Jayaram (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06441">arXiv</a>). Suppose I give you a PSD matrix \(A \in R^{n \times n}\). You know that all of its principle submatrices are also PSD. What if \(A\) was \(\varepsilon\)-far from the PSD cone (in a sense I will define soon)? What can you say about the eigenvalues of principle submatrices of \(A\) now? In this paper, the authors tackle precisely this question. The paper defines a matrix \(A\) to be \(\varepsilon\)-far in \(\ell_2^2\) distance from the PSD Cone if you have that \(\min_{B \geq 0: B \in R^{n \times n}}\|A ‚Äì B\|_F^2 \geq \varepsilon n^2\). You are allowed to randomly sample a bunch of principle submatrices (of order roughly \(O(1/\varepsilon)\) by \(O(1/\varepsilon)\) and check if they are PSD. Armed with this setup, the paper gives a non-adaptive one sided tester for this problem which makes \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^4)\) queries. The paper also supplements this result with a lower bound of \(\widetilde{\Omega}(1/\varepsilon^2)\) queries.</p>

John Gott III is an emeritus professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton. He was one of several independent inventors of the controversial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument">Doomsday</a> <a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=anthropic_principle/doomsday_argument">Argument</a> (DA). He may have been the first to think of it but the last to expound it in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/363315a0.epdf">paper</a> or presentation.</p>
<p>
Today we expound DA as a defense against thought experiments that require unreasonable lengths of time.</p>
<p>
Gott thought of the argument when he saw the Berlin Wall as a 22-year-old touring Berlin in 1969. He reasoned that his visit was a uniformly random event in the lifetime <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> of the wall. That assumption gave him a 75% likelihood that he was not observing the wall in the first quarter of its lifetime. Since the wall was then 8 years old, that became a 75% likelihood that the wall would not last beyond 1993. It came down in late 1989.</p>
<p>
The ‚ÄúDoomsday‚Äù name comes when one‚Äôs birthdate <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is regarded as a uniformly random sample from the sequence of all human births. If you are my age, <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is probably <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=F7CF2C002ED22C17F221BE1788C43A6E?doi=10.1.1.49.5899&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">closer</a> to ordinal 60 billion than 70 or 100 billion. We can then say we are 95% confident that we are not in the initial 5% of this sequence. That <em>entails</em> the sequence stopping before 1.2 trillion births. If our population levels off at 10 billion with 80 years‚Äô life expectancy, that makes <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> extend no further than the year 12,000 AD. The upshot is that a longer <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> entails asserting that our random sample gave a point unusually <em>early</em> in the span. The purer form of DA also argues that <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is not unusually <em>late</em>, giving this picture:</p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Debating DA </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The dependence on which observer is taken as the reference point <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is one shiftable parameter of the DA. If you are a preteen reader, then your own birth may be closer to ordinal 70 billion in the sequence, which becomes <em>your</em> reference point. You can then tack on another 2,000 years to <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/>. The earliest human cave painters may have been among the first 3 billion <em>Homo sapiens</em>. With regard to their reference point, <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> has already gone past their 95% limit. </p>
<p>
A more fundamental rebuff to DA comes from the equal reasonableness of an alternate uniformity assumption: that you are a uniformly random element of the set <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H}"/> of all <em>possible</em> human beings. Only a subset <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> of <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H}"/> will ever be born. The longer <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> is, the higher was your prior probability of belonging to <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. Thus the fact of your birth can be construed as weighting the odds toward longer <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> in a way that cancels out the short-<img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> reasoning of DA.</p>
<p>
Even when an instance of DA passes these objections, the inference remains controversial. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/22/predicting-when-pnp-is-resolved/">wrote</a> about DA last year in connection with estimating the lifespan of open problems remaining open. A clear <em>non</em>-instance is trying to apply DA to estimate the lifespan of the Covid-19 pandemic. We have all been going through the span together and <em>now</em> is not a uniformly random sample. </p>
<p>
The DA assumptions would however hold if an alien tourist with no prior knowledge of events dropped in on Earth today. The delicacy of the assumptions makes it significant to seek scenarios where DA firmly applies‚Äîand better, where the inference may be deemed <em>necessary</em> to preserve the validity of established modes of inference against extreme skeptical hypotheses. This is what we will try to argue in regard to inferences of cheating at chess. </p>

</p><p/><h2> The 1-in-100,000 Question </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/the-problem-of-catching-chess-cheaters/">posted</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/littlewoods-law/">numerous</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/the-crown-game-affair/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/thirteen-sigma/">about</a> my statistical <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/london-calling/">chess</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/15/predicting-chess-and-horses/">model</a>, its giving judgments of odds against null hypotheses of fair play in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"><em>z</em>-scores</a>, and my <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/empirical-humility/">means</a> of <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/our-trip-to-monte-carlo/">validating</a> them. We will suppose for this argument that the modeling is true in the sense that the distribution of <em>z</em>-scores from testing honest players conforms to the standard normal distribution. </p>
<p>
Now let us talk about chess in the years B.C.‚Äîbefore Covid‚Äîwhen the game was played over-the-board (OTB) in-person across a table. Suppose I obtained a <em>z</em>-score of 4.265 from a test of one player in one tournament. I have chosen this number for all of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It corresponds to what I call ‚Äúface-value odds‚Äù of 100,000-to-1 against the null hypothesis, as one can see from <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/experiments/analysis/zCalc.html">this</a> or any similar calculator. <p/>
</li><li>
It is close to my number from an actual case in the year 1 B.C., that is, last year. <p/>
</li><li>
It is also typical of <em>z</em>-scores I have been obtaining these past three months since chess went online, at the point where certain online platforms have made their own decisions to impose sanctions. Here I must add that the platforms‚Äô cheating detection systems avail much information about the manner of play that often furnishes much greater statistical evidence, whereas my minimalist model uses only the record of the moves played in the games.
</li></ul>
<p>
Suppose there were no other relevant information about the case. How would one assess the significance of the <em>z</em>-score of 4.265? Here are two different ways of reasoning that‚Äîin the case of OTB chess‚Äîarrive at similar answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The Bayesian prior probability of cheating in OTB chess has been estimated between 1-in-10,000 and 1-in-5,000. Suppose the former, and consider a thought experiment in which 100,000 players are tested. For simplicity, let‚Äôs suppose all true instances‚Äîthat is, cheating players‚Äîgive above 4.265. We expect there to be ten of them, plus one <em>natural</em> occurrence of 4.265 or more. Thus the odds that our score represents a true positive are only 10-in-11. This is well short of the odds range usually needed to meet the standard of <em>comfortable satisfaction</em> used for example by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Thus the 4.265 datum alone should not be sufficient grounds for sanction. <p/>
</li><li>
Suppose there were a policy of sanction above a threshold of 4.25. The sum of playing fields in events held under auspices of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) each year exceeds 100,000. Thus we would expect to find at least one <em>z</em>-score over 4.265 per year by natural chance, whose sanctioning would be a serious human-rights error. FIDE cannot afford a rate of one such error per year. Thus it is insufficient for sanction.
</li></ol>
<p>
A 5.0 standard, however, gives a natural frequency of just over 1-in-3.5 million. The resulting error rate of once in 20-to-30 years might be acceptable in prospect. And the Bayesian argument based on a 0.0001 prior leaves about 350-to-1 odds against the null hypothesis, which is comfortably within the comfortable-satisfaction range as it has been applied. </p>
<p>
FIDE nevertheless has maintained a policy that statistical evidence must be accompanied by some other kind of evidence. If a player is caught looking at a chess position in a bathroom, or found to have a buzzing device or wires on his-or-her person, or signaling behavior is observed, then in fact much lower <em>z</em>-scores (to a threshold of 2.50, about 160-to-1 odds, in current FIDE regulations) are deemed to lend strong support to such evidence. </p>

I posted a similar <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/chess/fidelity/Golfers.html">rationale</a> on my own website in early 2012, where causal evidence is likened to the ‚Äúblack spot‚Äù in the novel <em>Treasure Island</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> One More Datum </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Now, however, suppose we have the 4.265 and one more piece of ‚Äúevidence‚Äù that is pertinent but not as clearly causal. It could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The player wore a hat that covers the ears, or <p/>
</li><li>
An unusually bulky sweater (worn on a hot day), or <p/>
</li><li>
Unusual gestures or movements during the games.
</li></ul>
<p>
Say a search of the player turned up nothing, but this occurred after the sequence of games giving the 4.265, a day after the player had been put on notice of suspicion. So the extra information is not a black spot but instead a ‚Äúgrey spot.‚Äù What can we conclude now?</p>
<p>
The Bayesian argument seems to depend on judging how this information affects the prior probability of cheating. Does it make cheating a more likely hypothesis? We don‚Äôt actually know. Whereas the 1-in-10,000 global prior estimate was based on knowing dozens of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_chess#Incidents">cases</a> over the past decade, only a handful conformed to this level of indication‚Äîshort of more obvious things like making frequent visits to the restroom or being seen with an ear adornment. The most we can say is that the datum is not irrelevant. An example of an irrelevant datum would be if the player were wearing neon green sneakers‚Äînot bulky, no wires, just a weird green.</p>
<p>
I would like, however, to argue that the player‚Äôs membership in a smaller sample <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> that is <em>pertinent</em> enhances the significance of the <em>z</em>-score. <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> must be defined by criteria that are not only independent of my statistical analysis of the games but also pertinent so as to avoid selection bias. What is needed to quantify this enhancement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
(a) to collect all (other) kinds of items on a par with the above‚Äîsay ostentatious bracelets that could camouflage electronic indicators‚Äîand</p>
<p>(b) to establish that the frequency of players having <em>any</em> such accoutrement over the global mass of tournaments is at most, say, 1-in-100.<br/>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Now there are several equivalent ways to continue the reasoning. One is to say that since <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> is ‚Äúat worst‚Äù independent, the face-value odds are amplified by a factor of at least 100. The Bayesian mitigation then still leaves about 1,000-to-1 odds against the null hypothesis. Another is to say that in any given year, the natural chance of seeing the conjunction of <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> and the <em>z</em>-score is at most 1-in-100. Thus aside from the frequency of true positives, a policy of sanctioning in such cases would have a prospective error rate of once in 100 years. The conjoined error rate of that and sanctioning on 5.0 in isolation would be acceptable.</p>
<p>
A Bayesian defense attorney might still counter: Consider a thought experiment in which we test 100,000 such ‚Äúbulky‚Äù players. We don‚Äôt have any new information on the prior rate of cheating by players in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. For all we know, it is still 1-in-10,000. Thus the same terms as before will apply: our experiment will expect to have 10 cheaters in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> plus the one natural false positive, leaving the odds only 10-to-1 as before. Put another way: without knowing the import of specializing to <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> on the likelihood of cheating, you can‚Äôt reach any further conclusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Doomsday to the Rescue </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The nub of rejecting this counter-argument is that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Because there are only about 1,000 players in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> per year, the thought experiment of testing 100,000 players in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> now takes 100 years. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the defense attorney is asserting that the mistaken false positive has occurred <em>unusually early</em> in this span. If this is the first year under consideration, then it is a uniformly random event in the first 1% of <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/>. By the same reasoning of DA, the odds of this are only 1-in-100. Compounded by the 10-1 odds against this particular score in the thought experiment being the false positive, we recover something near the 1,000-to-1 odds of the original reasoning.</p>
<p>
We might allow that we are not in the first year of ‚Äúthe cheating era‚Äù in chess. The thicket of high-profile cases with solid grounds for judgment goes back a little over 10 years. The factor from DA then goes down to 1-in-10. But this still leaves the overall odds about 100-to-1 against the null hypothesis, and that is commonly taken as an anchor point for the standard of comfortable satisfaction after all mitigating factors have been addressed. </p>
<p>
Thus I am casting the Doomsday interval argument as a defense against unreasonably long thought experiments. It restores a dimension of time that is ignored by the Bayesian objection. This dimension of time is correctly preserved in the analysis of the expected error rate from a policy of imposing sanctions under this <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>‚Äì<em>z</em> combination of circumstances.</p>
<p>
Is my line of reasoning valid? You can be the judge. If so, then it is a class of instances where DA is applied merely to <em>conserve</em> an inference of unlikelihood that was originally made by other means. This supports the validity of DA-type inference in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Online Chess and the Time Warp </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are now in the third month of ‚Äúthe online era‚Äù in chess. Even though online platforms can process many more kinds of information than I can avail from OTB play, my work has proved highly relevant for global early indications, second opinions, and transparent explanations. Alas, the sanction rate at the new featured tournaments has been well in excess of 1%. We hope this will come down as the playing pool‚Äîwhich has been greatly democratized in massive online events‚Äîwises up to the reality of getting caught.</p>
<p>
What I want to discuss here is how this brave new world flips the Bayesian reasoning in a way that may come on too strong <em>for the prosecution</em>, again by its indifference to the element of time. </p>
<p>
Take the 4.265 <em>z</em>-score with a <img alt="{1\%}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1\%}"/> prior. The face-value odds from the <em>z</em>-score are now mitigated only to 1-in-1,000. This gives 99.9% confidence in imposing a sanction. However, the <em>rate of errors</em> would be <em>higher</em> than once-per-year because more players total have been involved per tournament. The tournaments are played at faster Rapid and Blitz paces allowing eight or more games per day, whereas classic OTB tournaments feature one game per day, sometimes two, over a span of a week to ten days. </p>
<p>
This is also set against a vastly higher global sample size. Whereas the entire historical record of OTB chess represented by the ChessBase <a href="https://shop.chessbase.com/en/products/mega_database_2020?ref=RF32-OET9DCF5AK&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIu9P-4-_u6QIVGqSzCh0QQQsyEAAYASAAEgKcevD_BwE">Mega</a> database has yet to hit the 10 million games mark, the online platform <a href="https://lichess.org/">Lichess</a> has now hit 75 million games played <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">per month</a>. Adding in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Chess_Club">ICC</a> and <a href="https://www.chess.com/home">chess.com</a> and ChessBase‚Äôs and FIDE‚Äôs own servers yields an equation that recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm">Ps 90:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A thousand years of OTB are but a day that passes online. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
For online platforms in isolation, absent anything to distinguish one player‚Äôs set of games from any other‚Äôs (such as their belonging to a highest-profile tournament), this means that even a 5.0 standard is inadequate for sure judgment. At their volume, online sites can see deviations of by natural chance more than once per day. Thus they either tolerate a higher rate of errors or adopt a standard so high as to let many more guilty <a href="https://en.bab.la/dictionary/french-english/partie-d-echecs">parties</a> through the sieve. </p>
<p>
Such volume means all the more that one should hold a score of 4.265 as insufficient for judgment. This is despite the vastly higher Bayesian likelihood that a sanction based on that score is correct. The greater frequency of actual cheating does mean that the rate of error per positive reading declines, but the rate per absolute time, with regard to the fixed population of honest players, may matter more. This has accompanied deliberations of whether sanctions for online cheating must be given less permanent consequences in order to allow setting thresholds so that a high percentage of actual cheaters are flagged and the error rate can be tolerated.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Does this analysis square with you? Does it help in understanding controversies over the original Doomsday Argument‚Äôs paradigm?</p>
<p>
For another pass over the argument, suppose I get a <em>z</em>-score of 4.265 in a narrowly-defined event such as one country‚Äôs championship league. Does that limit the sample size, so that the score is more dispositive? The kind of reasoning in point (b) above, where we had to gather all possible indicators that would lead us to constrain the sample, would however mandate widening it at least to include other countries‚Äô leagues. This is an aspect of the ‚Äúlook elsewhere‚Äù <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-elsewhere_effect">effect</a> where the space of potential tests is widened even before actual tests are considered. Possibly it should be widened to include all tournaments with similar levels of players, in which case we are back to the ‚Äúsquare 1‚Äù of the 1-in-100,000 section of this post. The point of the analysis of the extra datum about the player is that the sample expansion has an effective pre-defined limit.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
[Added note about online cheating detection to third bullet in section 3.  Clarified: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the conjunction of these two factors‚Äù ‚Äì&gt; ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the conjunction of B and the z-score‚Äù and changed the succeeding sentence.]</p></font></font></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="http://phys.lsu.edu/~jdowling/index_files/Dowling.jpg"/></figure>



<p>Today I woke up to the sad and shocking news that Jon Dowling (<a href="http://phys.lsu.edu/~jdowling/">homepage</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/jpdowling?lang=en">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Dowling">Wikipedia</a>)‚Äîphysics professor at Louisiana State, guy who got the US government to invest in quantum computing back in the 90s, author of the popular book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Schr%C3%B6dingers-Killer-App-Jonathan-Dowling/dp/1439896739">Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Killer App: Race to Build the World‚Äôs First Quantum Computer</a>, investigator of BosonSampling among many other topics, owner of a ‚ÄúQUBIT‚Äù license plate, and one of my main competitors in the field of quantum computing humor‚Äîhas passed away at age 65, apparently due to an aortic aneurysm.</p>



<p>Three months ago, right before covid shut down the world, the <em>last</em> travel I did was a seven-hour road trip from Austin to Baton Rouge, together with my postdoc <a href="https://twitter.com/a_rocchetto?lang=en">Andrea Rocchetto</a>, to deliver something called the <a href="https://calendar.lsu.edu/event/the_hearne_eminent_lecture_with_scott_aaronson#.Xtv1HDpKg2w">Hearne Lecture</a> at the Louisiana State physics department.  My topic (unsurprisingly) was Google‚Äôs quantum supremacy experiment.</p>



<p>I‚Äôd debated whether to cancel the trip, as flying already seemed too dangerous.  Dowling was the one who said ‚Äúwhy not just drive here with one of your postdocs?‚Äù‚Äîwhich turned into a memorable experience for me and Andrea, complete with a personal tour of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">LIGO</a> and a visit to an alligator hatchery.  I had no inkling that it was the last time I‚Äôd ever see Jon Dowling, but am now super-glad that we made the visit.</p>



<p>At the dinner after my talk, Dowling was exactly the same as every other time I‚Äôd seen him: loud, piss-drunk, obnoxious, and hilarious.  He dominated the conversation with stories and jokes, referring in every other sentence either to his Irishness or my Jewishness.  His efforts to banter with the waitress, to elicit her deepest opinions about each appetizer and bottle of wine, were so over-the-top that I, sitting next to him, blushed, as if to say, ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm just the visitor here!  I don‚Äôt necessarily <em>endorse</em> this routine!‚Äù</p>



<p>But Dowling got away with it because, no matter how many taboos he violated per sentence, there was never any hint of malice in it.  He was an equal-opportunity offender, with his favorite target being himself.  He loved to talk, for example, about my pathological obsession with airy-fairy abstractions, like some kind of ‚Äúpolynomial hierarchy‚Äù that hopefully wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù‚Äîwith the punchline being that he, the hardheaded laser physicist, then needed to learn what that meant for his own research.</p>



<p>The quantum computing community of the southern US, not to mention of Twitter and Facebook, and indeed of the entire world, will be poorer without this inimitable, louder-than-life presence.</p>



<p>Feel free to share your own Dowling stories in the comments.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>In solidarity with the current protests in the United States (<a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.shutdownstem.com/</a>), our speaker asked that the talk this coming Wednesday be postponed.</b></p>
<p><strong>Cliff‚Äôs talk has been rescheduled to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thursday, June 18th</span>; we will keep you updated in case of any further change. We would also take this opportunity to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">call the TCS community for feedback, and for suggestions and comments</a>. As a small team organizing this virtual seminar, we are continuously trying to improve and welcome your input.</strong></p>
<p>The next TCS+ talk<em> (and the last of the season!)</em> will take place this coming Wednesday, June 10th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC). <strong>Cliff Stein</strong> from Columbia University will speak about ‚Äú<em>Parallel Approximate Undirected Shortest Paths Via Low Hop Emulators</em>‚Äù (abstract below).</p>
<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. Due to security concerns, <em>registration is required</em> to attend the interactive talk. (The link to the YouTube livestream will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk">on our<br/>
website</a> on the day of the talk, so people who did not sign up will still be able to watch the talk live.) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see &gt;the website.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: Although sequential algorithms with (nearly) optimal running time for finding shortest paths in undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights have been known for several decades, near-optimal parallel algorithms have turned out to be a much tougher challenge. In this talk, we present a <img alt="(1+\varepsilon)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2B%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="(1+\varepsilon)"/>-approximate parallel algorithm for computing shortest paths in undirected graphs, achieving polylog depth and near-linear work. All prior <img alt="(1+\varepsilon)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2B%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="(1+\varepsilon)"/>-algorithms with polylog depth perform at least superlinear work. Improving this long-standing upper bound obtained by Cohen (STOC‚Äô94) has been open for 25 years.</p>
<p>Our algorithm uses several new tools. Prior work uses hopsets to introduce shortcuts in the graph. We introduce a new notion that we call low hop emulators. We also introduce compressible preconditioners, which we use in conjunction with Serman‚Äôs framework (SODA ‚Äô17) for the uncapacitated minimum cost flow problem.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>[From Jelani Nelson and David Woodruff. This workshop can be very important to ensure TCS is represented in what is likely to be a difficult funding environment in coming years. ‚ÄìBoaz ]</em> </p>



<p>The¬†<a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/catcs/">CATCS</a>¬†will be hosting a virtual¬†<strong>‚ÄúVisioning Workshop‚Äù</strong>¬†the¬†<strong>week of¬†</strong><strong>July 20</strong>¬†in order to identify broad research themes within theoretical computer science (TCS) that have potential for a major impact in the future. The goals are similar to the¬†<a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/visioning-workshop/">workshop of the same name</a>¬†in 2008: to package these themes in a way that can be consumed¬†by the general public, which we would deliver primarily to the Computing Community Consortium and others (e.g. funding agencies) to help them advocate for TCS.</p>



<p>While participation in the workshop is primarily through invitation, we have a few slots available for the broader community. If you are interested in participating, please see details of the application process below. The workshop will be organized according to area-wise breakout groups. Each breakout group will have 1-2 leads. Breakout groups will meet for 4-5 hours spread across several days and will be tasked with brainstorming ideas and preparing materials related to their topic. Leads are further expected to participate in plenary sessions held on Monday July 20 and Friday July 24 (4-5 hrs of additional time) where these materials will be discussed.</p>



<p>If you are interested in participating in the workshop, please fill out¬†<a href="https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9">this Google form</a>¬†by¬†<strong>Monday June 15</strong> ( <a href="https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9">https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9</a> ). On this form, applicants are asked to contribute one or two¬†major results in the last 10 years whose significance can be explained in layperson terms, and one or two major challenges for theory whose significance can be explained in layperson terms. <em>[The results need not and generally will not be your own. They just should be easy-to-explain major results in your research area‚ÄìBoaz] </em>These descriptions¬†can be very brief. We will just use them to select participants and create breakout groups.</p></div>
