    <title>NEEXP in MIP*</title>

The power of classical
multiprover interactive proof systems, in which the provers do not share
entanglement, was characterized in a famous work by Babai, Fortnow, and Lund
(Computational Complexity 1991), whose main result was the equality MIP = NEXP.
The power of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems, in which the
provers are allowed to share entanglement, has proven to be much more difficult
to characterize. The best known lower-bound on MIP* is NEXP, due to Ito and
Vidick (FOCS 2012). As for upper bounds, MIP* could be as large as RE, the
class of recursively enumerable languages.
</p>
<p>The main result of this work is the inclusion of NEEXP (nondeterministic
doubly epxonential time) in MIP*. This is an exponential improvement over the
prior lower bound and shows that proof systems with entangled provers are at
least exponentially more powerful than classical provers. In our protocol the
verifier delegates a classical, exponentially large MIP protocol for NEEXP to
two entangled provers: the provers obtain their exponentially large questions
by measuring their shared state, and use a classical PCP to certify the
correctness of their exponentially-long answers. For the soundness of our
protocol, it is crucial that each player should not only sample its own
question correctly but also avoid performing measurements that would reveal the
other player's sampled question. We ensure this by commanding the players to
perform a complementary measurement, relying on the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle to prevent the forbidden measurements from being performed.

    <title>Multiplicative Up-Drift</title>

algorithm (or more generally, a random process) into a probabilistic guarantee
on its run time (hitting time). So far, drift arguments have been successfully
employed in the rigorous analysis of evolutionary algorithms, however, only for
the situation that the progress is constant or becomes weaker when approaching
the target.
</p>
<p>Motivated by questions like how fast fit individuals take over a population,
we analyze random processes exhibiting a multiplicative growth in expectation.
We prove a drift theorem translating this expected progress into a hitting
time. This drift theorem gives a simple and insightful proof of the level-based
theorem first proposed by Lehre (2011). Our version of this theorem has, for
the first time, the best-possible linear dependence on the growth parameter
$\delta$ (the previous-best was quadratic). This gives immediately stronger run
time guarantees for a number of applications.

    <title>Locality of not-so-weak coloring</title>

it looks valid in all constant-radius neighborhoods. This idea is formalized in
the concept of locally checkable labelings (LCLs), introduced by Naor and
Stockmeyer (1995). Recently, Chang et al. (2016) showed that in bounded-degree
graphs, every LCL problem belongs to one of the following classes:
</p>
<p>- "Easy": solvable in $O(\log^* n)$ rounds with both deterministic and
randomized distributed algorithms.
</p>
<p>- "Hard": requires at least $\Omega(\log n)$ rounds with deterministic and
$\Omega(\log \log n)$ rounds with randomized distributed algorithms.
</p>
<p>Hence for any parameterized LCL problem, when we move from local problems
towards global problems, there is some point at which complexity suddenly jumps
from easy to hard. For example, for vertex coloring in $d$-regular graphs it is
now known that this jump is at precisely $d$ colors: coloring with $d+1$ colors
is easy, while coloring with $d$ colors is hard.
</p>
<p>However, it is currently poorly understood where this jump takes place when
one looks at defective colorings. To study this question, we define $k$-partial
$c$-coloring as follows: nodes are labeled with numbers between $1$ and $c$,
and every node is incident to at least $k$ properly colored edges.
</p>
<p>It is known that $1$-partial $2$-coloring (a.k.a. weak $2$-coloring) is easy
for any $d \ge 1$. As our main result, we show that $k$-partial $2$-coloring
becomes hard as soon as $k \ge 2$, no matter how large a $d$ we have.
</p>
<p>We also show that this is fundamentally different from $k$-partial
$3$-coloring: no matter which $k \ge 3$ we choose, the problem is always hard
for $d = k$ but it becomes easy when $d \gg k$. The same was known previously
for partial $c$-coloring with $c \ge 4$, but the case of $c &lt; 4$ was open.

    <title>Tight Bounds for the Subspace Sketch Problem with Applications</title>

Woodruff</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05543">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the subspace sketch problem one is given an $n\times d$ matrix $A$ with
$O(\log(nd))$ bit entries, and would like to compress it in an arbitrary way to
build a small space data structure $Q_p$, so that for any given $x \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, with probability at least $2/3$, one has
$Q_p(x)=(1\pm\epsilon)\|Ax\|_p$, where $p\geq 0$, and where the randomness is
over the construction of $Q_p$. The central question is: How many bits are
necessary to store $Q_p$?
</p>
<p>This problem has applications to the communication of approximating the
number of non-zeros in a matrix product, the size of coresets in projective
clustering, the memory of streaming algorithms for regression in the row-update
model, and embedding subspaces of $L_p$ in functional analysis. A major open
question is the dependence on the approximation factor $\epsilon$.
</p>
<p>We show if $p\geq 0$ is not a positive even integer and
$d=\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$, then $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2}d)$ bits are
necessary. On the other hand, if $p$ is a positive even integer, then there is
an upper bound of $O(d^p\log(nd))$ bits independent of $\epsilon$. Our results
are optimal up to logarithmic factors, and show in particular that one cannot
compress $A$ to $O(d)$ "directions" $v_1,\dots,v_{O(d)}$, such that for any
$x$, $\|Ax\|_1$ can be well-approximated from $\langle
v_1,x\rangle,\dots,\langle v_{O(d)},x\rangle$. Our lower bound rules out
arbitrary functions of these inner products (and in fact arbitrary data
structures built from $A$), and thus rules out the possibility of a singular
value decomposition for $\ell_1$ in a very strong sense. Indeed, as
$\epsilon\to 0$, for $p = 1$ the space complexity becomes arbitrarily large,
while for $p = 2$ it is at most $O(d^2 \log(nd))$. As corollaries of our main
lower bound, we obtain new lower bounds for a wide range of applications,
including the above, which in many cases are optimal.

over an unknown set of $n$-bit strings, given access to independent draws from
the distribution that have been independently corrupted according to some noise
channel. Recent work has intensively studied such problems both for the
bit-flip and erasure noise channels.
</p>
<p>We initiate the study of population recovery under the \emph{deletion
channel}, in which each bit is independently \emph{deleted} with some fixed
probability and the surviving bits are concatenated and transmitted. This is a
far more challenging noise model than bit-flip~noise or erasure noise; indeed,
even the simplest case in which the population size is 1 (corresponding to a
trivial distribution supported on a single string) corresponds to the
\emph{trace reconstruction} problem, a challenging problem that has received
much recent attention (see e.g.~\cite{DOS17,NP17,PZ17,HPP18,HHP18}).
</p>
<p>We give algorithms and lower bounds for population recovery under the
deletion channel when the population size is some $\ell&gt;1$. As our main sample
complexity upper bound, we show that for any $\ell=o(\log n/\log \log n)$, a
population of $\ell$ strings from $\{0,1\}^n$ can be learned under deletion
channel noise using $\smash{2^{n^{1/2+o(1)}}}$ samples. On the lower bound
side, we show that $n^{\Omega(\ell)}$ samples are required to perform
population recovery under the deletion channel, for all $\ell \leq
n^{1/2-\epsilon}$.
</p>
<p>Our upper bounds are obtained via a robust multivariate generalization of a
polynomial-based analysis, due to Krasikov and Roddity \cite{KR97}, of how the
$k$-deck of a bit-string uniquely identifies the string; this is a very
different approach from recent algorithms for trace reconstruction (the
$\ell=1$ case). Our lower bounds build on moment-matching results of
Roos~\cite{Roo00} and Daskalakis and Papadimitriou~\cite{DP15}.

    <title>Restricted Isometry Property under High Correlations</title>

role in the areas of compressed sensing and statistical learning. RIP matrices
with optimal parameters are mainly obtained via probabilistic arguments, as
explicit constructions seem hard. It is therefore interesting to ask whether a
fixed matrix can be incorporated into a construction of restricted isometries.
In this paper, we construct a new broad ensemble of random matrices with
dependent entries that satisfy the restricted isometry property. Our
construction starts with a fixed (deterministic) matrix $X$ satisfying some
simple stable rank condition, and we show that the matrix $XR$, where $R$ is a
random matrix drawn from various popular probabilistic models (including,
subgaussian, sparse, low-randomness, satisfying convex concentration property),
satisfies the RIP with high probability. These theorems have various
applications in signal recovery, random matrix theory, dimensionality
reduction, etc. Additionally, motivated by an application for understanding the
effectiveness of word vector embeddings popular in natural language processing
and machine learning applications, we investigate the RIP of the matrix
$XR^{(l)}$ where $R^{(l)}$ is formed by taking all possible (disregarding
order) $l$-way entrywise products of the columns of a random matrix $R$.

reasoning. In this paper, we study the circuit complexity of some of the
various tasks it performs. Specifically, in the broadcast tree model (which has
important applications to phylogenetic reconstruction and close connections to
community detection), we show the following:
</p>
<p>(1) No $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuit can guess the label of the root with positive
advantage over random guessing, independent of the depth for any non-trivial
choice of parameters.
</p>
<p>(2) There is a $\mathbf{TC}^0$ circuit that competes with the Bayes optimal
predictor in some range of parameters above the Kesten-Stigum bound.
</p>
<p>(3) There is a $16$ label broadcast tree model in which it is possible to
accurately guess the label of the root, but beating random guessing is
$\mathbf{NC}^1$-hard.
</p>
<p>Our work yields a simple and natural generative model where large depth
really is necessary for performing various types of inference, that have
intriguing parallels with phase transitions from statistical physics.

demand-aware infrastructures whose resources can be adjusted according to the
workload they currently serve. Such dynamic adjustments can be exploited to
improve network utilization and hence performance, by moving frequently
interacting communication partners closer, e.g., collocating them in the same
server or datacenter. However, dynamically changing the embedding of workloads
is algorithmically challenging: communication patterns are often not known
ahead of time, but must be learned. During the learning process, overheads
related to unnecessary moves (i.e., re-embeddings) should be minimized. This
paper studies a fundamental model which captures the tradeoff between the
benefits and costs of dynamically collocating communication partners on $\ell$
servers, in an online manner. Our main contribution is a distributed online
algorithm which is asymptotically almost optimal, i.e., almost matches the
lower bound (also derived in this paper) on the competitive ratio of any
(distributed or centralized) online algorithm. As an application, we show that
our algorithm can be used to solve a distributed union find problem in which
the sets are stored across multiple servers.

    <title>What Storage Access Privacy is Achievable with Small Overhead?</title>

cryptographic primitives used to hide the access pattern to data whose storage
has been outsourced to an untrusted server. Unfortunately, both primitives
require considerable overhead compared to plaintext access. For large-scale
storage infrastructure with highly frequent access requests, the degradation in
response time and the exorbitant increase in resource costs incurred by either
ORAM or PIR prevent their usage. In an ideal scenario, a privacy-preserving
storage protocols with small overhead would be implemented for these heavily
trafficked storage systems to avoid negatively impacting either performance
and/or costs. In this work, we study the problem of the best $\mathit{storage\
access\ privacy}$ that is achievable with only $\mathit{small\ overhead}$ over
plaintext access.
</p>
<p>To answer this question, we consider $\mathit{differential\ privacy\ access}$
which is a generalization of the $\mathit{oblivious\ access}$ security notion
that are considered by ORAM and PIR. Quite surprisingly, we present strong
evidence that constant overhead storage schemes may only be achieved with
privacy budgets of $\epsilon = \Omega(\log n)$. We present asymptotically
optimal constructions for differentially private variants of both ORAM and PIR
with privacy budgets $\epsilon = \Theta(\log n)$ with only $O(1)$ overhead. In
addition, we consider a more complex storage primitive called key-value storage
in which data is indexed by keys from a large universe (as opposed to
consecutive integers in ORAM and PIR). We present a differentially private
key-value storage scheme with $\epsilon = \Theta(\log n)$ and $O(\log\log n)$
overhead. This construction uses a new oblivious, two-choice hashing scheme
that may be of independent interest.

Subsequence and Edit Distance have been extensively studied for decades. For
exact algorithms, LCS and Edit Distance (with character insertions and
deletions) are equivalent; the state of the art running time is (almost)
quadratic and this is tight under plausible fine-grained complexity
assumptions. But for approximation algorithms the picture is different: there
is a long line of works with improved approximation factors for Edit Distance,
but for LCS (with binary strings) only a trivial $1/2$-approximation was known.
In this work we give a reduction from approximate LCS to approximate Edit
Distance, yielding the first efficient $(1/2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for LCS for some constant $\epsilon&gt;0$.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was saddened about the results of the Israeli election.  The Beresheet lander, which lost its engine and crashed onto the moon as I was writing this, seems like a fitting symbol for where the country is now headed.  Whatever he was at the start of his career, Netanyahu has become the Israeli Trump—a breathtakingly corrupt strongman who appeals to voters’ basest impulses, sacrifices his country’s future and standing in the world for short-term electoral gain, considers himself unbound by laws, recklessly incites hatred of minorities, and (despite zero personal piety) cynically panders to religious fundamentalists who help keep him in power.  Just like with Trump, it’s probably futile to hope that lawyers will swoop in and free the nation from the demagogue’s grip: legal systems simply aren’t designed for assaults of this magnitude.</p>



<p>(If, for example, you were designing the US Constitution, how would you guard against a presidential candidate who <em>openly</em> supported and was supported by a hostile foreign power, and won anyway?  Would it even occur to you to include such possibilities in your definitions of concepts like “treason” or “collusion”?)</p>



<p>The original Zionist project—the secular, democratic vision of Herzl and Ben-Gurion and Weizmann and Einstein, which the Nazis turned from a dream to a necessity—matters more to me than most things in this world, and that was true even before I’d spent time in Israel and before I had a wife and kids who are Israeli citizens.  It would be depressing if, after a century of wildly improbable victories against external threats, Herzl’s project were finally to eat itself from the inside.  Of course I have analogous worries (scaled up by two orders of magnitude) for the US—not to mention the UK, India, Brazil, Poland, Hungary, the Philippines … the world is now engaged in a massive test of whether Enlightenment liberalism can long endure, or whether it’s just a metastable state between one Dark Age and the next.  (And to think that people have accused me of uncritical agreement with Steven Pinker, the world’s foremost optimist!)</p>



<p>In times like this, one takes one’s happiness where one can find it.</p>



<p>So, yeah: I’m happy that there’s now an “image of a black hole” (or rather, of x-rays being bent around a black hole’s silhouette).  If you really want to understand what the now-ubiquitous image is showing, I strongly recommend <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">this guide</a> by Matt Strassler.</p>



<p>I’m happy that integer multiplication can apparently <a href="https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~davidharvey/papers/nlogn/">now be done</a> in O(n log n), capping a decades-long quest (see also <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/integer-multiplication-in-nlogn-time/">here</a>).</p>



<p>I’m happy that there’s now apparently a spectacular fossil record of the first minutes after the asteroid impact that ended the Cretaceous period.  Even better will be if this finally proves that, yes, some non-avian dinosaurs were still alive on impact day, and had not gone extinct due to unrelated climate changes slightly earlier.  (Last week, my 6-year-old daughter sang a song in a school play about how “no one knows what killed the dinosaurs”—the verses ran through the asteroid and several other possibilities.  I wonder if they’ll retire that song next year.)  If you haven’t yet read it, the <em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died">New Yorker</a></em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died"> piece on this</a> is a must.</p>



<p>I’m happy that my good friend Zach Weinersmith (legendary author of <a href="http://smbc-comics.com/">SMBC Comics</a>), as well as the GMU economist Bryan Caplan (rabblerousing author of <em>The Case Against Education</em>, which I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3678">reviewed here</a>), have a new book out: a graphic novel that makes a moral and practical case for open borders (!).  Their book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316979/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=A2TM1SK1AE3QXC3DEC99">now available for pre-order</a>, and at least at some point cracked Amazon’s top 10.  Just last week I met Bryan for the first time, when he visited UT Austin to give a talk based on the book.  He said that meeting me (having known me only from the blog) was like meeting a fictional character; I said the feeling was mutual.  And as for Bryan’s talk?  It felt great to spend an hour visiting a fantasyland where the world’s economies are run by humane rationalist technocrats, and where walls are going down rather than up.</p>



<p>I’m happy that, according to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?verso=true">this </a><em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?verso=true">Vanity Fair</a></em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?verso=true"> article</a>, Facebook will still ban you for writing that “men are scum” <em>or</em> that “women are scum”—having ultimately rejected the demands of social-justice activists that it ban only the latter sentence, not the former.  According to the article, everyone on Facebook’s Community Standards committee agreed with the activists that this was the right result: dehumanizing comments about women have no place on the platform, while (superficially) dehumanizing comments about men are an important part of feminist consciousness-raising that require protection.  The problem was simply that the committee couldn’t come up with any <em>general principle</em> that would yield that desired result, without also yielding bad results in other cases.</p>



<p>I’m happy that the 737 Max jets are grounded and will hopefully be fixed, with no thanks to the FAA.  Strangely, while this was still the top news story, I gave a short talk about quantum computing to a group of Boeing executives who were visiting UT Austin on a previously scheduled trip.  The title of the session they put me in?  “Disruptive Computation.”</p>



<p>I’m happy that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg">Greta Thunberg</a>, the 15-year-old Swedish climate activist, has attracted a worldwide following and might win the Nobel Peace Prize.  I hope she does—and more importantly, I hope her personal story will help galvanize the world into accepting things that it already knows are true, as with the example of Anne Frank (or for that matter, Gandhi or MLK).  Confession: back when I was an adolescent, I often daydreamed about doing exactly what Thunberg is doing right now, leading a worldwide children’s climate movement.  I didn’t, of course.  In my defense, I wouldn’t have had the charisma for it anyway—and also, I got sidetracked by even more pressing problems, like working out the quantum query complexity of recursive Fourier sampling.  But fate seems to have made an excellent choice in Thunberg.  She’s not the prop of any adult—just a nerdy girl with Asperger’s who formed the idea to sit in front of Parliament every day to protest the destruction of the world, because she couldn’t understand why everyone else wasn’t.</p>



<p>I’m happy that the college admissions scandal has finally forced Americans to confront the farcical injustice of our current system—a system where elite colleges pretend to peer into applicants’ souls (or the souls of the essay consultants hired by the applicants’ parents?), and where they preen about the moral virtue of their “holistic, multidimensional” admissions criteria, which amount in practice to shutting out brilliant working-class Asian kids in favor of legacies and rich badminton players.  Not to horn-toot, but Steven Pinker and I tried to raise the alarm about this travesty five years ago (see for example <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003">this post</a>), and were both severely criticized for it.  I do worry, though, that people will draw <em>precisely</em> the wrong lessons from the scandal.  If, for example, a few rich parents resorted to outright cheating on the SAT—all their other forms of gaming and fraud apparently being insufficient—then the SAT itself must be to blame so we should get rid of it.  In reality, the SAT (whatever its flaws) is almost the only bulwark we have against the <em>complete</em> collapse of college admissions offices into nightclub bouncers.  <a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/?fbclid=IwAR0mvO48sFgBps3mrSJ0bdK-qGzmiFd06vG6Au6enANaBC5Qh_YAa9tloJY">This </a><em><a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/?fbclid=IwAR0mvO48sFgBps3mrSJ0bdK-qGzmiFd06vG6Au6enANaBC5Qh_YAa9tloJY">Quillette</a></em><a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/?fbclid=IwAR0mvO48sFgBps3mrSJ0bdK-qGzmiFd06vG6Au6enANaBC5Qh_YAa9tloJY"> article</a> says it much better than I can.</p>



<p>I’m happy that there will a <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/18-19/NP50">symposium from May 6-9</a> at the University of Toronto, to honor Stephen Cook and the (approximate) 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the discovery of NP-completeness.  I’m happy that I’ll be attending and speaking there.  If you’re interested, there’s still time to register!</p>



<p>Finally, I’m happy about the following “Sierpinskitaschen” baked by CS grad student and friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://twitter.com/optimistsinc?lang=en">Jess Sorrell</a>, and included with her permission (Jess says she got the idea from <a href="https://seattlelocalfood.com/2011/03/20/sierpinski-hamantaschen-sierpinskitaschen/?fbclid=IwAR1Qvoe8OYFXGbcke8u8XBS40tJMG2SkdJ8RI34u3CTSdjB2Fk1uob4OKzo">Debs Gardner</a>).</p>

    <title>Elwyn Berlekamp Died April 9, 2019</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elwyn R. Berlekamp entered this world on Sept 6, 1940, and left it on April 9, 2019.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwyn_Berlekamp">Wikipedia</a> calls him <i>An American Mathematician</i> which seems to narrow to me. He worked on a variety of topics which were Math, Comp Sci, finance, and likely others --- if you know any that I missed leave comments.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the things he worked on:<br/>
<br/>
1) Factoring Polynomials over large finite fields (See <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2004849?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">here</a> from 1970)<br/>
<br/>
I quote the abstract<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
This paper reviews some of the known algorithms for factoring polynomials over finite fields and presents a new deterministic procedure for reducing the problem of factoring an arbitrary polynomial over the Galois field GP(p<sup>m</sup>) to the problem of finding roots in GF(p) of certain other polynomials over GP(p). The amount of computation and the storage space required by these algorithms are algebraic in both the degree of the polynomial to be factored and the log of the order of the field.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Certain observations on the application of these methods to factorization of polynomials over the rational integers are also included. </blockquote>
I think he meant what we would call polynomial time when he says algebraic.<br/>
<br/>
2) Combinatorial Games. He co-wrote the classic Winning Ways For your Mathematical Plays with John Conway and Richard Guy.  These books are like NIM on steroids. They are FUN and have some serious math in them. (My blog system thinks Combinatorial is not a word. It is wrong)<br/>
<br/>
3) Combinatorial Games. He was very interested in Go via Combinatorial Games. I have an article (alas, not online) by him entitled Introductory Overview of Mathematical Go Endgames.  There has been further work on this that is on the web, see <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~wqy/research/Honor%20Thesis.pdf">here</a>. I wonder what ERB would think of the ALPHAGO program.<br/>
<br/>
4) Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm finds the shortest linear feedback shift register for a given binary output sequence.<br/>
<br/>
5) Berlekamp-Welch Algorithm efficiently corrects errors in Reed-Solomon codes.  (Berlekamp also wrote a book on Algebraic Coding Theory.)<br/>
<br/>
6) I didn't know about his work in finance until I began writing this, but the following quote from Wikipedia is impressive<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
In 1989, Berlekamp purchased the largest interest in a trading company named Axcom Trading Advisors. After the firm's futures trading algorithms were rewritten, Axcom's Medallion Fund had a return (in 1990) of 55%, net of all management fees and transaction costs. The fund has subsequently continued to realize annualized returns exceeding 30% under management by James Harris Simons and his Renaissance Technologies Corporation.</blockquote></div>

    <title>Coloring kinggraphs</title>
    <summary>Draw a collection of quadrilaterals in the plane, meeting edge to edge, so that they don’t surround any open space (the region they cover is a topological disk) and every vertex interior to the disk touches at least four quadrilaterals. Is it always possible to color the corners of the quadrilaterals with four colors so that all four colors appear in each quadrilateral?</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Draw a collection of quadrilaterals in the plane, meeting edge to edge, so that they don’t surround any open space (the region they cover is a topological disk) and every vertex interior to the disk touches at least four quadrilaterals. Is it always possible to color the corners of the quadrilaterals with four colors so that all four colors appear in each quadrilateral?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="4-colored kinggraph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/colored-kinggraph.svg"/></p>

<p>The graph of corners and quadrilateral edges is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaregraph">squaregraph</a> but this question is really about coloring a different and related graph, called a kinggraph, that also includes as edges the diagonals of each quad. It’s called that because one example of this kind of graph is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_graph">king’s graph</a> describing the possible moves of a chess king on a chessboard.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="The king's graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/kings-graph.svg"/></p>

<p>The king’s graph, and kinggraphs more generally, are examples of 1-planar graphs, graphs drawn in the plane in such a way that each edge is crossed at most once. The edges of the underlying squaregraph are not crossed at all, and the diagonals of each quad only cross each other. Squaregraphs are bipartite (like every planar graph in which all faces have an even number of edges), so they can be colored with only two colors. 1-planar graphs, in general, can require six colors (for instance you can draw the complete graph  as a 1-planar graph by adding diagonals to the squares of a triangular prism) and this is tight.
And you can easily 4-color the king’s graph by using two colors in alternation across the even rows of the chessboard, and a different two colors across the odd rows. So the number of colors for kinggraphs should be somewhere between these two extremes, but where?</p>

<p>One useful and general graph coloring method is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)">degeneracy</a> of graphs. This is the largest number  such that every subgraph has a vertex with at most  neighbors; one can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring">greedy coloring algorithm</a> to color any graph with  colors. Kinggraphs themselves always have a vertex with at most  neighbors, but unfortunately they do not have degeneracy . If you form a king’s graph on a  chessboard, and then remove its four corners, you get a subgraph in which all vertices have at least four neighbors.
This turns out to be as large as possible: every kinggraph has degeneracy at most four. This is because, if you consider the zones of the system of quads (strips of quads connected on opposite pairs of edges), there always exists an “outer zone”, a zone with nothing on one side of it (see the illustration, below). You can remove the vertices of the outer zone one at a time, in order from one end to the other, always removing a vertex of degree at most four, and then repeat on another outer zone until the whole graph is gone. So the degeneracy and greedy coloring method shows that you can 5-color every kinggraph, better than the 6-coloring that we get for arbitrary 1-planar graphs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="An outer zone" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/outer-zone.svg"/></p>

<p>This turns out to be optimal! For a while I thought that every kinggraph must be 4-colorable, because it was true of all the small examples that I tried. But it’s not true in general, and here’s why. If you look at the zones of the 4-colored kinggraph above, you might notice a pattern. The edges that connect pairs of quads from the same zone have colorings that alternate between two different pairs of colors. For instance, we might have a zone that has red–yellow edges alternating with blue–green edges, or another zone that has red–blue edges alternating with green–yellow edges. This is true whenever a kinggraph can be 4-colored. But there are only three ways of coloring a zone (that is, of partitioning the four colors into two disjoint pairs, which alternate along the zone). And when two zones cross each other, they must be colored differently. So every 4-coloring of a kinggraph turns into a 3-coloring of its zones. But the graph that describes the zones and its crossings is a triangle-free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_graph">circle graph</a>, and vice versa: every triangle-free circle graph describes a kinggraph. And triangle-free circle graphs may sometimes need as many as five colors, in which case so does the corresponding kinggraph.</p>

<p>I posted <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2008/03/23/ageevs-squaregraph.html">an example of a squaregraph whose circle graph needs five colors</a> on this blog in 2008. Here’s a slightly different drawing of the same graph from <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2009/05/29/congratulations-dr-wortman.html">a later post</a>.
Because its circle graph is not 3-colorable, the corresponding kinggraph is not 4-colorable.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A squaregraph whose kinggraph is not 4-colorable" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2009/cd220c.svg"/></p>

<p>There are simpler examples of squaregraphs whose circle graph needs four colors. As long as the number of colors of the circle graph is more than three, the number of colors of the kinggraph will be more than four.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you can color the circle graph with three colors, then it’s also possible to translate this 3-coloring of zones back into a 4-coloring of the kinggraph. Just remove an outer zone, color the remaining graph recursively, add the removed zone back, and use the color of the zone you removed to decide which colors to assign to its vertices. Unfortunately, I don’t know the computational complexity of testing whether a circle graph is 3-colorable. There was a conference paper by Walter Unger in 1992 that claimed to have a polynomial time algorithm, but without enough details and it was never published in a journal. I think we have to consider the problem of finding a coloring as still being open.</p>

<p>The same method also leads to an easy calculation of the number of 4-colorings (in the same sense) of the usual kind of chessboard with  squares, or of a king’s graph with  vertices. In this case, the zones are just the rows and columns of the chessboard. We can use one color for the rows and two for the columns, or vice versa, so the number of 3-colorings of the zones (accounting for the fact that the 2-colorings get counted twice) is . And once the coloring of the zones is chosen, the coloring of the chessboard itself is uniquely determined by the color of any of its squares, so the total number of chessboard colorings is .</p>

    <title>EATCS Award 2019 to Thomas Henzinger</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EATCS has just announced that <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/">Thomas Henzinger</a> is the <a href="http://eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/2811-the-eatcs-award-2019-laudatio-for-thomas-henzinger">EATCS Award 2019 recipient</a> for "fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of formal verification and synthesis of reactive, real-time, and hybrid computer systems, and to the application of formal methods to biological systems." Congratulations to  the award committee---consisting of Artur Czumaj, Marta Kwiatkowska and Christos Papadimitriou (chair)---for their great choice, to Tom for a very well deserved award and to the TCS community at large.<br/><br/>Of course, Tom Henzinger needs no introduction. However, let me use this post to provide a bird's eye view of his career and of some of his many contributions to TCS, which would be enough for a good number of very successful research careers. The text below is largely due to <a href="http://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/jfr/">Jean-Francois Raskin</a>. <br/><br/><br/><b>Biographical sketch</b> Thomas A. Henzinger is the President of <a href="http://www.ist.ac.at/">IST Austria</a> (Institute of Science and Technology Austria), which, under his leadership, has quickly become one of the most impactful research institutes in the world. Before joining IST as its first president, Tom was Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University (1992-95), Assistant Professor (1996-97), Associate Professor (1997-98) and Professor (1998-2004) of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. He was also the Director of the Max-Planck Institute for Computer Science in Saarbruecken, Germany (1999) and Professor of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland (2004-09).<br/><br/>Tom is an ISI highly cited researcher and his h-index is 103, according to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jpgplxUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a>. He is a member of Academia Europaea, a member of the German Academy of Sciences (Leopoldina), a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the AAAS, a Fellow of the EATCS, a Fellow of the ACM, and a Fellow of the IEEE. He was the recipient of the Milner Award of the Royal Society in 2015, of the Wittgenstein Award of the Austrian Science Fund and was granted an ERC Advanced Investigator Grant in 2010. He received the SIGPLAN POPL Most Influential Paper Award (2014), Logic in Computer Science Test-of-Time Award (2012), ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award (2011), and Best Paper awards at SIGSOFT FSE and CONCUR.<br/><br/><b>Main scientific achievements</b> Tom's research focuses on modern systems theory, especially models, algorithms, and tools for the design and verification of reliable software, hardware and embedded systems. His <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#hytech">HyTech tool </a>was the first model checker for mixed discrete-continuous systems.<br/><br/>Tom has made a large number of fundamental contributions to theoretical computer science. Here I will limit myself to mentioning a small number of research areas where he has been particularly prolific and influential.<br/><ul><li><i><a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#real-time">The theory of timed and hybrid systems</a>.</i> Tom has defined and studied the expressiveness and the algorithmic complexity of several real-time extensions of temporal logics. He is one of the most important contributors to the <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#hytech">theory of hybrid automata and to algorithms for the analysis of suchmodels</a>. His papers on the subject are among the most cited ones in the field of computer-aided verification. As an example, his paper “Symbolic model checking for real-time systems” received a LICS Test-of-Time Award in 2012. He has also studied the gap that exists between mathematical models of systems (e.g. hybrid automata) and their implementation on physical hardware. To bridge this gap, he developed models of physical platforms such as <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#giotto">Giotto</a> and E-machines, and he devised ways to relate their semantics with the one of the abstract mathematical models.</li><li><i><a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#games">Games for verification and control</a>.</i> Tom has introduced the logic ATL*, which extends LTL and CTL* with the ability to reason about strategies that can be played by coalitions of agents/components in models of multi-agent/component systems. He has contributed to the understanding of the potential of adopting concepts from game theory for modeling and reasoning about open systems. He has contributed to a large number of algorithmic advances for solving game-graph problems and to better understand their computational complexity.</li><li><i>From Boolean models to quantitative models for verification and synthesis.</i> Tom has recently investigated how to shift from Boolean models to quantitative models. This research proposes quantitative generalizations of the paradigms that had success in reactive modeling, such as compositionality, property-preserving abstraction, model checking and synthesis. With those models, we can specify and reason about quantitative aspects, such as resource consumption, or compare the performance of different design solutions in embedded systems. He has obtained a substantial funding from the European Research Council to proceed along this promising line of research.</li><li><a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#blast"><i>Foundations of software model checking.</i></a> Tom has contributed substantially to the algorithms underlying the analysis of software systems by introducing the concept of lazy abstraction. Those ideas have been implemented in the highly influential tool Blast. This line of work was honoured with the Most Influential 2004 POPL Paper Award which he received in 2014.</li><li><a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#bio"><i>Computational modelling of biological systems.</i></a> Tom and his coworkers have shown that computational models are well suited to model the dynamics of biological systems. This is part of a broader research program that has the objective to show that concepts introduced to formalize reactive systems are helpful to model and reason about biological systems.</li></ul>Those important theoretical contributions have always been developed with relevant practical applications in mind. Consequently, Thomas Henzinger has not only worked on the foundations of our subject, but he also transferred his theoretical ideas into practice by developing tools and by suggesting methodologies that could be used in applying his theoretical results.<br/><br/>Tom is a research leader who has had a profound influence on his PhD students and post-docs. To wit, several of his former students are now well-recognized researchers that enrich the life of our research community and now lead successful research groups.<br/><br/><b>Addendum 12 April 2019:</b> In case you are interested, you can find a short interview I had with Tom Henzinger a while back <a href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2017/02/an-interview-with-thomas-henzinger.html">here</a>. <br/><br/></div>

whether an unknown Boolean function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is
unate (i.e., every variable is either non-decreasing or non-increasing) or
$\epsilon$-far from unate. The upper bound is nearly optimal given the
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2/3})$ lower~bound of [CWX17a]. The algorithm builds on a
novel use of the binary search procedure and its analysis over long random
paths.

computational tasks from cloud structures to multiple devices close to the end
user. An example for this are embedded systems in autonomous cars that
communicate in order to coordinate their actions.
</p>
<p>Our model is a variant of the classical Page Migration Problem. More
formally, we consider a mobile server holding a data page. The server can move
in the Euclidean space (of arbitrary dimension). In every round, requests for
data items from the page pop up at arbitrary points in the space. The requests
are served, each at a cost of the distance from the requesting point and the
server, and the mobile server may move, at a cost $D$ times the distance
traveled for some constant $D$. We assume a maximum distance $m$ the server is
allowed to move per round.
</p>
<p>We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio independent
of the length of the input sequence in this setting. Hence we augment the
maximum movement distance of the online algorithms to $(1+\delta)$ times the
maximum distance of the offline solution. We provide a deterministic algorithm
which is simple to describe and works for multiple variants of our problem. The
algorithm achieves almost tight competitive ratios independent of the length of
the input sequence.
</p>
<p>Our Algorithm also achieves a constant competitive ratio without resource
augmentation in a variant where the distance between two consecutive requests
is restricted to a constant smaller than the limit for the server.

    <title>Predicative proof theory of PDL and basic applications</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Gordeev:Lev.html">Lev Gordeev</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05131">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Propositional dynamic logic (PDL) is presented in Sch\"{u}tte-style mode as
one-sided semiformal tree-like sequent calculus Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ with
standard cut rule and the omega-rule with principal formulas $\left[ P^{\ast
}\right] \!A$. The omega-rule-free derivations in Seq$_{\omega }^{\text{pdl}}$
are finite (trees) and sequents deducible by these finite derivations are valid
in PDL. Moreover the cut-elimination theorem for Seq$_{\omega}^{\text{pdl}}$ is
provable in Peano Arithmetic (PA)extended by transfinite induction up to
Veblen's ordinal $\varphi_\omega\left( 0\right) $. Hence (by the cutfree
subformula property) such predicative extension of PA proves that any given
$\left[ P^{\ast }\right] $-free sequent is valid in PDL iff it is deducible in
Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ by a finite cut- and omega-rule-free derivation,
while PDL-validity of arbitrary star-free sequents is decidable in polynomial
space. The former also implies a Herbrand-style conclusion that e.g. a given
formula $S=\left\langle P^{\ast }\right\rangle \!A\vee Z$ for star-free $A$ and
$Z\ $is valid in PDL iff there is a $k\geq 0$ and a cut- and omega-rule-free
derivation of sequent $A,\left\langle P\right\rangle
^{1}\!\!A,\cdots,\left\langle P\right\rangle ^{k}\!\!A,B$ where $\left\langle
P\right\rangle^{i}\!A$ is an abbreviation for $\underset{i\
times}{\underbrace{\left\langle P\right\rangle \cdots \left\langle
P\right\rangle }}A$. This eventually leads to PSPACE-decidability of
PDL-validity of $S$, provided that $P$ is atomic and $A$ is in a suitable
\emph{basic conjunctive normal form}. Furthermore we consider star-free
formulas $A$ in dual \emph{basic disjunctive normal form}, and corresponding
expansions $S=\left\langle P^{\ast }\right\rangle \!A\vee Z$ whose PDL-validity
problem is known to be EXPTIME-complete. We show that cutfree-derivability in
Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ (hence PDL-validity) of such $S$\ is equivalent to
plain validity of a suitable ``transparent'' quantified boolean formula
$\widehat{S}$. Hence EXPTIME = PSPACE holds true iff the validity problem for
any $\widehat{S}$ involved is solvable by a polynomial-space deterministic TM.
This may reduce the former problem to a more transparent complexity problem in
quantified boolean logic. The whole proof can be formalized in PA extended by
transfinite induction along $\varphi_\omega\left( 0\right)$ -- actually in the
corresponding primitive recursive weakening, $\mathbf{PRA}_{\varphi_{\omega
}\left( 0\right)}$.

perfectness for discrete gradient vector fields with respect to
(multi-parameter) persistent homology. As a natural generalization of usual
perfectness in Morse theory for homology, persistence-perfectness entails
having the least number of critical cells relevant for persistent homology. The
first result about a persistence-perfect gradient vector-field is that the
number of its critical cells yield inequalities bounding the Betti tables of
persistence modules, as a sort of Morse inequalities for multi-parameter
persistence. The second result is that, at least in low dimensions,
persistence-perfect gradient vector-fields not only exist but can be
constructed by an algorithm based on local homotopy expansions. These results
show a link between multi-parameter persistence and discrete Morse theory that
can be leveraged for a better understanding of the former.

represent some logistic networks. The goal is to deliver all the delivery
points in the network. The network exists in a mostly stable environment,
except for a few edges known to be non-stable. The weight of each of these
non-stable edges may change at any time (bascule or lift bridge, elevator,
traffic congestion...). All other edges have stable weights that never change.
This problem can be now considered as a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem on
a dynamic graph. We propose an efficient polynomial algorithm that computes in
advance alternative MSTs for all possible configurations. No additional
computation is then needed after any change in the problem because the MSTs are
already known in all cases. We use these results to compute critical values for
the non-stable weights and to pre-compute best paths. When the non-stable
weights change, the appropriate MST may then directly and immediately be used
without any recomputation.

    <title>The Complexity of Subtree Intersection Representation of Chordal Graphs and Linear Time Chordal Graph Generation</title>

intersection of $n$ subtrees in a tree on $n$ nodes. This fact is recently used
in [2] to generate random chordal graphs on $n$ vertices by generating $n$
subtrees of a tree on $n$ nodes. It follows that the space (and thus time)
complexity of such an algorithm is at least the sum of the sizes of the
generated subtrees assuming that a tree is given by a set of nodes. In [2],
this complexity was mistakenly claimed to be linear in the number $m$ of edges
of the generated chordal graph. This error is corrected in [3] where the space
complexity is shown to be $\Omega(m n^{1/4})$. The exact complexity of the
algorithm is left as an open question.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that the sum of the sizes of $n$ subtrees in a tree on
$n$ nodes is $\Theta(m\sqrt{n})$. We also show that we can confine ourselves to
contraction-minimal subtree intersection representations since they are
sufficient to generate every chordal graph. Furthermore, the sum of the sizes
of the subtrees in such a representation is at most $2m+n$. We use this result
to derive the first linear time random chordal graph generator. Based on
contraction-minimal representations, we also derive structural properties of
chordal graphs related to their connectivity. In addition to these theoretical
results, we conduct experiments to study the quality of the chordal graphs
generated by our algorithm and compare them to those in the literature. Our
experimental study indicates that the generated graphs do not have a restricted
structure and the sizes of maximal cliques are distributed fairly over the
range. Furthermore, our algorithm is simple to implement and produces graphs
with 10000 vertices and $4 . 10^7$ edges in less than one second on a laptop
computer.

$0$-$1$ and linear programming. Specifically, for any subset (finite union of
intervals) $E \subset [0,1]$ containing $\{0,1\}$, we give a random-walk based
algorithm with runtime $O_E((2-\text{measure}(E))^n\text{poly}(n,m))$ that
finds a solution in $E^n$ to any $n$-variable linear program with $m$
constraints that is feasible over $\{0,1\}^n$. Note that as $E$ expands from
$\{0,1\}$ to $[0,1]$, the runtime improves smoothly from $2^n$ to polynomial.
</p>
<p>Taking $E = [0,1/k) \cup (1-1/k,1]$ in our result yields as a corollary a
randomized $(2-2/k)^{n}\text{poly}(n)$ time algorithm for $k$-SAT. While our
approach has some high level resemblance to Sch\"{o}ning's beautiful algorithm,
our general algorithm is based on a more sophisticated random walk that
incorporates several new ingredients, such as a multiplicative potential to
measure progress, a judicious choice of starting distribution, and a time
varying distribution for the evolution of the random walk that is itself
computed via an LP at each step (a solution to which is guaranteed based on the
minimax theorem). Plugging the LP algorithm into our earlier polymorphic
framework yields fast exponential algorithms for any CSP (like $k$-SAT,
$1$-in-$3$-SAT, NAE $k$-SAT) that admit so-called `threshold partial
polymorphisms.'

lower bound for $\mathsf{ANN}$ against general (non black-box) data structures.
We also show that any oblivious $\mathit{static}$ data structure for

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Vertex connectivity is a classic extensively-studied problem. Given an integer k, its goal is to decide if an <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="n"/>-node <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="m"/>-edge graph can be disconnected by removing <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> vertices. Although a <img alt="O(m)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(m)"/>-time algorithm was postulated since 1974 [Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman], and despite its sibling problem of edge connectivity being resolved over two decades ago [Karger STOC’96], so far no vertex connectivity algorithms are faster than <img alt="O(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(n^2)"/> time even for <img alt="k = 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+4&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k = 4"/> and <img alt="m = O(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%3D+O%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="m = O(n)"/>. In the simplest case where <img alt="m = O(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%3D+O%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="m = O(n)"/> and <img alt="k = O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+O%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k = O(1)"/>, the <img alt="O(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(n^2)"/> bound dates five decades back to [Kleitman IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory’69]. For the general case, the best bound is <img alt="\tilde{O}( \min{ kn^2, n^\omega + nk^\omega } )" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28+%5Cmin%7B+kn%5E2%2C+n%5E%5Comega+%2B+nk%5E%5Comega+%7D+%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{O}( \min{ kn^2, n^\omega + nk^\omega } )"/> [Henzinger, Rao, Gabow FOCS’96; Linial, Lovász, Wigderson FOCS’86].</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present a randomized Monte Carlo algorithm with <img alt="\tilde{O}(m + k^3 n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28m+%2B+k%5E3+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{O}(m + k^3 n)"/> time. This algorithm proves the conjecture by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman when <img alt="k=O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3DO%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k=O(1)"/> up to a polylog factor, breaks the 50-year-old bound by Kleitman, is fastest for <img alt="4 &lt; k &lt; n^{0.456}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%3C+k+%3C+n%5E%7B0.456%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="4 &lt; k &lt; n^{0.456}"/>. The story is similar for the directed graphs where we obtain an algorithm running time at most <img alt="\tilde{O}(k^2 m)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28k%5E2+m%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{O}(k^2 m)"/>.</p>
<p>The key to our results is to avoid computing single-source connectivity, which was needed by all previous exact algorithms and is not known to admit <img alt="o(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="o(n^2)"/> time. Instead, we design the first local algorithm for computing vertex connectivity; without reading the whole graph, our algorithm can find a separator of size at most <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> or certify that there is no separator of size at most <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> “near” a given seed node.</p>
<p>This talk is based on joint works with Danupon Nanongkai and Sorrachai Yingchareonthawornchai.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>Barna Saha, Sofya Raskhodnikova and I are organizing the second annual TCS Women event at STOC’19. We had an event at STOC’18 and it went really well. We envision an exciting program for the TCS Women event at STOC 2019. The details about the program are forthcoming.  The new TCS Women website is here: <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__sigact.org_tcswomen_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=CVsmSCuxoCwFoG2gFr0tpYyUk9r_oVDDLqgpNw-QTrM&amp;m=yF6ryOV_72RkpZ0_dg--Elo-VEADbvub3IKRqkerKEs&amp;s=sU7cAYjUogjxkGH7PXLNYC26FKcl0oYAZvIQjwBIQgc&amp;e=" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sigact.org/tcswomen/</a>. There you can learn more about our initiative.</p>



<p>In addition to the event, we have secured generous funding (similar to last year) from the NSF and industrial partners such as Akamai, Amazon, Google and Microsoft for <strong>travel grants</strong> for women and underrepresented minority students and postdocs to attend STOC. These grants are separate from the STOC travel awards and you can apply to both.</p>



<p>The application deadline for the TCS Women travel scholarship is <strong>April 25th, 2019</strong>. The information on how to apply is available here <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__sigact.org_tcswomen_tcs-2Dwomen-2Dtravel-2Dscholarship_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=CVsmSCuxoCwFoG2gFr0tpYyUk9r_oVDDLqgpNw-QTrM&amp;m=yF6ryOV_72RkpZ0_dg--Elo-VEADbvub3IKRqkerKEs&amp;s=8uERTRJZx4nz2kM7duDKIQl7pEyP1uP_TeaH-Qsu47U&amp;e=" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sigact.org/tcswomen/tcs-women-travel-scholarship/</a>. We hope to support as many women and underrepresented minority students and postdocs as possible all over the globe to come to STOC and FCRC. The participants will also have the opportunity to present their work at the STOC poster session.<br/>If you are aware of eligible students (not only PhD) who are interested in attending STOC, please encourage them to apply.</p>



<p>Best wishes,</p>

As an academic, we do a lot of writing about the things we work on, but usually our audience is narrow and technical: other researchers in our sub-specialty. But it can be both fun and important to communicate to a wider audience as well. So my amazing colleague Michael Kearns and I wrote a book, called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205">The Ethical Algorithm</a>. It's coming out in October (Amazon says the release date is November 1st, but my understanding is that pre-orders will start shipping on October 4).<br/><br/>This was the first time for either of us writing something like this: it's not a textbook, it's a "trade book" -- a popular science book. Its intended readership isn't just computer science PhDs, but the educated public broadly. But there should be plenty in it to interest experts too, because we cover quite a bit of ground.  The book is about the problems that arise when algorithmic decision making interacts with human beings --- and the emerging science about how to fix them. The topics we cover include privacy, fairness, strategic interactions and gaming, and the scientific reproducibility crisis.<br/><br/>Lots has been written about the problems that can arise, especially related to privacy and fairness. And we're not trying to reinvent the wheel. Instead, the focus of our book is the exciting and embryonic algorithmic science that has grown to address these issues.<br/><br/>The privacy chapter develops differential privacy, and its strengths and weaknesses. The fairness chapter covers recent work on algorithmic fairness that has come out of the computer science literature. The gaming chapter studies how algorithm design can affect the equilibria that emerge from large scale interactions. The reproducibility chapter explores the underlying issues that lead to false discovery, and recent algorithmic advances that hold promise in avoiding them.  We try and set expectations appropriately. We don't pretend that the solutions to complex societal problems can be entirely (or even primarily) algorithmic. But we argue that embedding social values into algorithms will inevitably form an important component of any solution.<br/><br/>I'm really excited for it to come out.

    <title>TR19-054 |  Bridging between 0/1 and Linear Programming via Random Walks | 

	Joshua Brakensiek, 

	Venkatesan Guruswami</title>
    <summary>Under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, an integer linear program with $n$ Boolean-valued variables and $m$ equations cannot be solved in $c^n$ time for any constant $c &lt; 2$. If the domain of the variables is relaxed to $[0,1]$, the associated linear program can of course be solved in polynomial time. In this work, we give a natural algorithmic bridging between these extremes of $0$-$1$ and linear programming. Specifically, for any subset (finite union of intervals) $E \subset [0,1]$ containing $\{0,1\}$, we give a random-walk based algorithm with runtime $O_E((2-\text{measure}(E))^n \text{poly}(n,m))$ that finds a solution in $E^n$ to any  $n$-variable linear program with $m$ constraints that is feasible over $\{0,1\}^n$. Note that as $E$ expands from $\{0,1\}$ to $[0,1]$, the runtime improves smoothly from $2^n$ to polynomial. 
 
Taking $E = [0,1/k) \cup (1-1/k,1]$ in our result yields as a corollary a randomized $(2-2/k)^{n}\text{poly}(n)$ time algorithm for $k$-SAT, matching the best known runtime for larger $k$. While our approach has some high level resemblance to Sch\"{o}ning's beautiful algorithm, our general algorithm is based on a more sophisticated random walk that incorporates several new ingredients, such as a multiplicative potential to measure progress, a judicious choice of starting distribution, and a time varying distribution for the evolution of the random walk that is itself computed via an LP at each step (a solution to which is guaranteed based on the minimax theorem).  Plugging the LP algorithm into our earlier polymorphic framework yields fast exponential algorithms for any CSP (like $k$-SAT, $1$-in-$3$-SAT, NAE $k$-SAT) that admit so-called ``threshold partial polymorphisms."</summary>

    <title>TR19-053 |  The complexity of 3-colouring $H$-colourable graphs | 

	Andrei Krokhin, 

	Jakub Opršal</title>
    <summary>We study the complexity of approximation on satisfiable instances for graph homomorphism problems. For a fixed graph $H$, the $H$-colouring problem is to decide whether a given graph has a homomorphism to $H$.  By a result of Hell and Nešet?il, this problem is NP-hard for any non-bipartite graph $H$.  In the context of promise constraint satisfaction problems, Brakensiek and Guruswami conjectured that this hardness result extends to promise graph homomorphism as follows: fix any non-bipartite graph $H$ and another graph $G$ with a homomorphism from $H$ to $G$, it is NP-hard to find a homomorphism to $G$ from a given $H$-colourable graph.  Arguably, the two most important special cases of this conjecture are when $H$ is fixed to be $K_3$ (and $G$ is any graph with a triangle) and when $G=K_3$ (and $H$ is any 3-colourable graph). The former case is equivalent to the notoriously difficult approximate graph colouring problem. In this paper, we confirm the Brakensiek-Guruswami conjecture for the latter case.  Our proofs rely on a novel combination of the universal-algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction, that was recently developed by Bulín and the authors, with some ideas from algebraic topology.</summary>

    <title>TR19-052 |  Polynomial calculus space and resolution width | 

	Nicola  Galesi, 

	Leszek Kolodziejczyk, 

	Neil Thapen</title>
    <summary>We show that if a $k$-CNF requires width $w$ to refute in resolution, then it requires space $\sqrt w$ to refute in polynomial calculus, where the space of a polynomial calculus refutation is the number of monomials that must be kept in memory when working through the proof. This is the first analogue, in polynomial calculus, of Atserias and Dalmau's result lower-bounding clause space in resolution by resolution width.

As a by-product of our new approach to space lower bounds  we give a simple proof of Bonacina's recent result that total space in resolution (the total number of variable occurrences that must be kept in memory) is lower-bounded by the width squared. As corollaries of the main result we obtain some new lower bounds on the PCR space needed to refute specific formulas, as well as partial answers to some open problems about relations between space, size, and degree for polynomial calculus.</summary>
