<p>The news: In 1981, Paul Erdős and András Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Hong Liu and Richard Montgomry <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15802">have just proved</a> that the answer is positive!  They also proved a variety of other old standing conjectures.

<p>The same conclusion should apply to graphs with bounded clique numbers; it is related to the general area of <img alt="\chi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\chi"/>-boundedness, see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/when-a-few-colors-suffice/">this post</a> and this <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~pds/papers/chibounded/paper.pdf">recent survey</a> by Alex Scott and Paul Seymour.</p>

<p>I am thankful to Benny Sudakov for telling me about the new result.</p>
<p>A key ingredient of the proof is the study of expanders that you can always find in graphs. Komlós and Szemerédi showed in 1996 that every graph <em>G</em> contains an expander with comparable average degree to <em>G </em>and since their work, with greater and greater sophistication, finding expanders in general graphs has become an important tool for a large number of extremal problems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In 1981, Erdős and Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Let <img alt="\mathcal{C}(G)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathcal{C}(G)"/> be the set of cycle lengths in a graph <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/> and let <img alt="\mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_%5Ctext%7Bodd%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)"/> be the set of odd numbers in <img alt="\mathcal{C}(G)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathcal{C}(G)"/>. We prove that, if <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/> has chromatic number <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>, then <img alt="\sum_{\ell\in  \mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)}1/\ell\geq (1/2-o_k(1))\log k." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_%7B%5Cell%5Cin++%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_%5Ctext%7Bodd%7D%28G%29%7D1%2F%5Cell%5Cgeq+%281%2F2-o_k%281%29%29%5Clog+k.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\sum_{\ell\in  \mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)}1/\ell\geq (1/2-o_k(1))\log k."/> This solves Erdős and Hajnal’s odd cycle problem, and, furthermore, this bound is asymptotically optimal.<br/>
In 1984, Erdős asked whether there is some d such that each graph with chromatic number at least d (or perhaps even only average degree at least <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/>) has a cycle whose length is a power of 2. We show that an average degree condition is sufficient for this problem, solving it with methods that apply to a wide range of sequences in addition to the powers of 2.<br/>
Finally, we use our methods to show that, for every <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>, there is some <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/> so that every graph with average degree at least d has a subdivision of the complete graph <img alt="K_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="K_k"/> in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times. This confirms a conjecture of Thomassen from 1984.</p></div>

from nature or engineering. These patterns can be represented by a class of
parametric-structure graphs, which are defined by templates that generate
structure by way of repeated instantiation. We propose a class of parametric
graph templates that can succinctly represent a wide variety of graphs. Using
parametric graph templates, we develop structurally-parametric algorithm
variants of maximum flow, minimum cut, and tree subgraph isomorphism. Our
algorithms are polynomial time for maximum flow and minimum cut and are
fixed-parameter tractable for tree subgraph isomorphism when parameterized by
the size of the tree subgraph. By reasoning about the structure of the
repeating subgraphs, we avoid explicit construction of the instantiation.
Furthermore, we show how parametric graph templates can be recovered from an
instantiated graph in quasi-polynomial time when certain parameters of the
graph are bounded. Parametric graph templates and the presented algorithmic
techniques thus create opportunities for reasoning about the generating
structure of a graph, rather than an instance of it.

kernel $K(x, y)$ and a dataset of $n$ points in high dimensional Euclidean
space, prepare a data structure that can quickly output, given a query $q$, a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to $\mu:=\frac1{|P|}\sum_{p\in P} K(p, q)$. First,
we give a single data structure based on classical near neighbor search
techniques that improves upon or essentially matches the query time and space
complexity for all radial kernels considered in the literature so far. We then
show how to improve both the query complexity and runtime by using recent
advances in data-dependent near neighbor search.
</p>
<p>We achieve our results by giving a new implementation of the natural
importance sampling scheme. Unlike previous approaches, our algorithm first
samples the dataset uniformly (considering a geometric sequence of sampling
rates), and then uses existing approximate near neighbor search techniques on
the resulting smaller dataset to retrieve the sampled points that lie at an
appropriate distance from the query. We show that the resulting sampled dataset
has strong geometric structure, making approximate near neighbor search return
the required samples much more efficiently than for worst case datasets of the
same size. As an example application, we show that this approach yields a data
structure that achieves query time $\mu^{-(1+o(1))/4}$ and space complexity
$\mu^{-(1+o(1))}$ for the Gaussian kernel. Our data dependent approach achieves
query time $\mu^{-0.173-o(1)}$ and space $\mu^{-(1+o(1))}$ for the Gaussian
kernel. The data dependent analysis relies on new techniques for tracking the
geometric structure of the input datasets in a recursive hashing process that
we hope will be of interest in other applications in near neighbor search.

sensor data. Mining patterns, e.g., outliers or clusters, from such data must
take place in real time. This is challenging because (1) streams often have
high dimensionality, and (2) the data characteristics may change over time.
Existing approaches tend to focus on only one aspect, either high
dimensionality or the specifics of the streaming setting. For static data, a
common approach to deal with high dimensionality -- known as subspace search --
extracts low-dimensional, `interesting' projections (subspaces), in which
patterns are easier to find. In this paper, we address both Challenge (1) and
(2) by generalising subspace search to data streams. Our approach, Streaming
Greedy Maximum Random Deviation (SGMRD), monitors interesting subspaces in
high-dimensional data streams. It leverages novel multivariate dependency
estimators and monitoring techniques based on bandit theory. We show that the
benefits of SGMRD are twofold: (i) It monitors subspaces efficiently, and (ii)
this improves the results of downstream data mining tasks, such as outlier
detection. Our experiments, performed against synthetic and real-world data,
demonstrate that SGMRD outperforms its competitors by a large margin.

Goemans, Harvey, Iwata, and Mirrokni (SODA'09) as an application of their
structural result. In the mentioned problem $n$ unsplittable resources have to
be assigned to $m$ players, each with a monotone submodular utility function
$f_i$. The goal is to maximize $\min_i f_i(S_i)$ where $S_1,\dotsc,S_m$ is a
partition of the resources. The result by Goemans et al. implies a polynomial
time $O(n^{1/2 +\varepsilon})$-approximation algorithm. Since then progress on
this problem was limited to the linear case, that is, all $f_i$ are linear
functions. In particular, a line of research has shown that there is a
polynomial time constant approximation algorithm for linear valuation functions
in the restricted assignment case. This is the special case where each player
is given a set of desired resources $\Gamma_i$ and the individual valuation
functions are defined as $f_i(S) = f(S \cap \Gamma_i)$ for a global linear
function $f$. This can also be interpreted as maximizing $\min_i f(S_i)$ with
additional assignment restrictions, i.e., resources can only be assigned to
certain players. In this paper we make comparable progress for the submodular
variant. Namely, if $f$ is a monotone submodular function, we can in polynomial
time compute an $O(\log\log(n))$-approximate solution.

constant approximate clustering by changing the cluster centers only a small
number of times during the entire execution of the algorithm? This question
received attention in recent years in the machine learning literature and,
before our work, the best known algorithm performs $\widetilde{O}(k^2)$ center
swaps (the $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ notation hides polylogarithmic factors in the
number of points $n$ and the aspect ratio $\Delta$ of the input instance). This
is a quadratic increase compared to the offline case -- the whole stream is
known in advance and one is interested in keeping a constant approximation at
any point in time -- for which $\widetilde{O}(k)$ swaps are known to be
sufficient and simple examples show that $\Omega(k \log(n \Delta))$ swaps are
necessary. We close this gap by developing an algorithm that, perhaps
surprisingly, matches the guarantees in the offline setting. Specifically, we
show how to maintain a constant-factor approximation for the $k$-median problem
by performing an optimal (up to polylogarithimic factors) number
$\widetilde{O}(k)$ of center swaps. To obtain our result we leverage new
structural properties of $k$-median clustering that may be of independent
interest.

    <title>Matching through Embedding in Dense Graphs</title>

particular importance in social, transportation and biological networks. While
developing optimal solutions for various matching problems is important, the
running times of the fastest available optimal matching algorithms are too
costly. However, when the vertices of the graphs are point-sets in $R^d$ and
edge weights correspond to the euclidean distances, the available optimal
matching algorithms are substantially faster. In this paper, we propose a novel
network embedding based heuristic algorithm to solve various matching problems
in dense graphs. In particular, using existing network embedding techniques, we
first find a low dimensional representation of the graph vertices in $R^d$ and
then run faster available matching algorithms on the embedded vertices. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies network embedding to
solve various matching problems. Experimental results validate the efficacy of
our proposed algorithm.

uncertainty. In this paper we ask which advice can we give the algorithm to
improve its success probability?
</p>
<p>We propose a general model that unifies a broad range of problems: from the
classic secretary problem with no advice, to the variant where the quality of a
secretary is drawn from a known distribution and the algorithm learns each
candidate's quality on arrival, to more modern versions of advice in the form
of samples, to an ML-inspired model where a classifier gives us noisy signal
about whether or not the current secretary is the best on the market.
</p>
<p>Our main technique is a factor revealing LP that captures all of the problems
above. We use this LP formulation to gain structural insight into the optimal
policy. Using tools from linear programming, we present a tight analysis of
optimal algorithms for secretaries with samples, optimal algorithms when
secretaries' qualities are drawn from a known distribution, and a new noisy
binary advice model.

    <title>Alex Trebek/What is today's post about?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> Alex Trebek, long time host of the TV show Jeopardy! (the exclamation point is part of the name, though I will omit it for the rest of the post), passed away in November of 2020 at the age of 80. He announced he had pancreatic cancer in March 2019.</p><p>0) <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/search?q=Jeopardy">Here</a> is a pointer to a page that has all of our posts with the word <i>Jeopardy </i>in them. Some are about the show and others mention the show in passing. All of the posts relate to the TV show. That is because Lance and I lead fairly safe lives.</p><p>1) On April Fools day of 1997 Pat Sajak hosted <i>Jeopardy</i> and Alex Trebek hosted <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>. Both are on You tube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtIT-jr1hmQ">Trebek hosts wheel</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwVNmYjClXE">Pat hosts Jeopardy</a> Alex's hosting was more fun because- well, you can see for yourself. </p><p>2) Aside from that one day, Alex Trebek hosted <i>Jeopardy</i> every night since he began in 1984. </p><p>3) My favorite pangram (sentence that has all 26 letters) is</p><p>Watch <i>Jeopardy!</i>, Alex Trebek's fun TV quiz game show. </p><p>(See my post on natural pangrams <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/11/can-you-measure-which-panagrams-are.html">here</a> for... more natural pangrams and a discussion of what natural means.) </p><p>It's my favorite since I can really imagine someone saying it. The show should have used it for its tagline. And now they can't :-(</p><p>4) From Alex's comments he seems to like high scoring games that are not run-a-ways. He also likes when people bet big on the daily doubles and on<i> final Jeopardy</i>.  I think he liked having long win streaks like Ken Jenning's  and James Holzhauer, but see point 7 below.  I think he didn't like it when people go for the high scoring questions first (perhaps looking for the Daily Double) since sometimes the category name is not quite clear (e.g., <i>Country Groups</i> could be things like<i> NATO </i>or things like <i>The Charlie Daniels Band</i>) so you want to do a cheap question to get your feet wet, and also easier for the audience to see what the category means.  IMHO they should really make the Daily Double Uniformly distributed on all the squares instead of having it tend to be the bigger-money questions. </p><p>5) When the final <i>Jeopardy</i> category is  revealed he sometimes says <i>that's a  good category!</i> or <i>that sounds hard. </i> Makes me wonder that if he makes no comment he is thinking<i> that's a stupid categor</i>y  or <i>Gee that's easy.</i></p><p>6) Because of the pandemic they could not, for a while, make new shows. Hence  they aired old shows including the  first ever Alex-Trebek-<i>Jeopardy</i> (the show had been hosted by Art Fleming and the Trebek-version was really a reboot). From that show I found out WHY it's called<i> Jeopardy</i> (a question I had never thought about). It's because if you get an answer WRONG you can LOSE money- that's the Jeopardy. Not really a good name, but by now everyone knows the show by that name.</p><p>7) Art Fleming also died of pancreatic cancer, back in 1995 (he was 70). Coincidence? Well, yes, though two game show hosts of the same show dying of the same disease 25 years apart could be the premise of a really bad murder mystery. </p><p>8) Alex makes some small talk with the contestants  (though some is edited for time). Things like <i>I hear you have a book on muffins that is not a cookbook-- what's that all about?</i>' I wonder if during Ken Jenning's 74-long winning streak, towards the end,  Alex ran out of things to ask him. I can imagine <i>I hear you're pretty good at Jeopardy.</i></p><p>9) I wonder how good Alex would be playing <i>Jeopardy</i>. When he hosted <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> he said in passing that he would NEVER go on <i>Jeopardy</i> as a contestant, so he doesn't think he would do well. He could be wrong about that since over time they ask questions that are not quite repeats but draw on the same knowledge- and he's heard all of them. However, it could be that he is too busy concentrating on other things to really absorb all of this knowledge. </p><p>10) The <i>we give the answers you give the questions </i>is a bit odd. However, in my classes I  sometimes say  <i>We'll Trebek this - we know what the answer is, we have to find the question</i>.</p><p>11) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7UgxCayfV0">This</a> youtube video is of a contestant singing WORDS to the <i>Jeopardy</i> theme song that he wrote.The contestant  refers to Jon Stewart as having also written words to the <i>Jeopardy</i> theme, but I can't find that anywhere- if you can, let me know. </p><p>12) Weird Al did a novelty song about <i>Jeopardy</i> using Art Fleming in the video (see  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvUZijEuNDQ">here</a>)  I always hoped he would update it and use Alex Trebek. He never did and now he can't :-( OR-with todays technology maybe he can. Here's hoping!</p><p>13) Alex Trebek was in a category by himself!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>Pathbreaking for intervals</title>
    <summary>The use of Nash’s Hex lemma in my previous post, according to which any 2-coloring of a triangular grid has a long monochromatic path, naturally raises the question: for which graphs other than the triangular grid is this true? In that post I mentioned that it is also true for certain outerplanar graphs, but false for bipartite graphs and for subcubic graphs. Here’s another class of graphs for which it is false: the graphs of bounded pathwidth. These graphs can always be 2-colored in a way that breaks up all long paths, leaving the remaining monochromatic paths of bounded size.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The use of Nash’s Hex lemma in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/10/hex-books-queues.html">my previous post</a>, according to which any 2-coloring of a triangular grid has a long monochromatic path, naturally raises the question: for which graphs other than the triangular grid is this true? In that post I mentioned that it is also true for certain outerplanar graphs, but false for bipartite graphs and for subcubic graphs. Here’s another class of graphs for which it is false: the graphs of bounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathwidth">pathwidth</a>. These graphs can always be 2-colored in a way that breaks up all long paths, leaving the remaining monochromatic paths of bounded size.</p>

<p>Rather than dealing with pathwidth directly, I want to formulate it geometrically in terms of interval graphs. Every graph can be completed (by adding extra edges) to form an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_graph">interval graph</a> of the same pathwidth; an interval graph has one-dimensional closed intervals as its vertices, connected by an edge whenever they intersect. The pathwidth of an interval graph is always one less than the maximum number of intervals that overlap at the same point (their ply). So rather than looking at graphs of bounded pathwidth I’ll be considering sets of intervals of bounded ply. For example in the illustration below which I drew a few years ago for Wikipedia, the intervals shown have ply 3, and their interval graph has pathwidth 2.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A set of intervals and their associated interval graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/interval-graph.svg"/></p>

<p>Intervals with low ply that are all either nested or disjoint can have no long paths in their intersection graph regardless of coloring. In any set of intervals forming a path, the path can pass through the outermost level of nesting at most once, subdividing it into two smaller paths with lower ply. It follows by induction the number of intervals in the path can be at most \(2^{\operatorname{ply}}-1\). (This is the standard argument behind an equivalence in graphs between longest path length and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-depth">tree-depth</a>.) So if we could partition an arbitrary set of intervals into two subsets within which all intervals are nested or disjoint, we’d be done. For instance, in the example above, the partition into \(\{A,B,F\}\) and \(\{C,D,E,G\}\) works. Not every set of intervals can be partitioned in this way, but I’ll show below that it’s always possible to lengthen some intervals, keeping the ply small, so that the lengthened intervals can be partitioned (colored) into two nested subsets.</p>

<p>As a subroutine in the construction, let’s find a set of points with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each interval lies strictly between the leftmost and rightmost selected points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No interval covers more than one selected point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The union of the intervals that cover selected points equals the union of all the intervals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This can be done by a greedy algorithm that repeatedly selects an uncovered interval endpoint until the intervals that cover selected points also cover all other interval endpoints. Finish by selecting any two points to the left and right of all the intervals, and then number the selected points as \(x_0,x_1,\dots\) in left-to-right order. For example, one possible choice for our example would have \(x_0\) to the left of the intervals, \(x_1\) at the left endpoint of \(D\), \(x_2\) at the left endpoint of \(F\), and \(x_3\) to the right of the intervals. For this choice, \(B\) and \(E\) do not cover any selected points, but that’s not a problem. It’s not necessary to optimize how many points are selected.</p>

<p>Call an interval “odd” if it covers an odd-numbered point \(x_i\) and “even” if it covers an even-numbered point. In our example, \(A\), \(C\), and \(D\) are odd, and \(F\), and \(G\) are even, but \(B\) and \(E\) are neither odd nor even. We will color the odd intervals blue and the even intervals red. Because they are different colors, we don’t have to worry about nesting between odd and even intervals. However, the intervals that contain any single point \(x_i\) will have the same color and need to be lengthened to nesting intervals. To do so, we extend all these intervals to a single longer interval, from just after \(x_{i-1}\) to just before \(x_{i+1}\). Because of the way the points \(x_i\) were chosen, this does not create new intersections between intervals of the same color, and it makes all colored intervals nest with all uncolored ones (not just with each other). However, it can also increase the ply. If the ply was \(p\) previously, it can increase by as much as \(2p-1\), when a point that was previously covered by only one odd or even interval becomes covered by \(2p-1\) more of them.</p>

<p>Finally, we apply the same coloring and lengthening process recursively, to the remaining subsets of uncolored intervals between each pair of selected points.
To make sure the intervals stay nested after lengthening, we take care in each recursive subproblem to select its first and last points to be inside all intervals of the outer problem that contain the subproblem. Because every point in an interval of a recursive subproblem is also in at least one of the outer colored intervals, the recursive subproblem has smaller ply than the initial ply of the outer problem. The recursion stops at ply 2; for this ply the intersection graph is a tree (more precisely a caterpillar) and it is possible to 2-color the intervals without any lengthening so that no two intervals of the same color intersect, by 2-coloring the tree.</p>

<p>So if we start with intervals of ply 2, we produce a lengthened, 2-colored, and monochromatically nested set of intervals of ply 2 again (no change to the ply). If we start with intervals of ply 3, we produce a lengthened, 2-colored, and monochromatically nested set of intervals of ply at most 8, because the ply-3 interval-lengthening process added at most 5 to the existing ply. More generally for any starting ply \(p\) the new ply will be at most \(p^2+p-4\). And since the interval graph for the lengthened intervals has no monochromatic path with more than \(2^{p^2+p-4}-1\) intervals in it, neither does the interval graph for the original intervals, with the same 2-coloring.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wolfgang Kühnel</span></p>
<p>Today I want to talk about a new result in a newly arXived paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02703">A subexponential size <img alt="\mathbb RP^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb RP^n"/> by Karim Adiprasito, Sergey Avvakumov, and Roman Karasev</a>. Sergey Avvakumov gave about it a <strong>great</strong> zoom seminar talk about the result in our combinatorics seminar. <a href="https://huji.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=602454e6-d104-42fe-849c-ac6000b7517b">Here is the link</a>.</p>
<p>The question is very simple: <strong>W<span style="color: #0000ff;">hat is the smallest number of vertices required to triangulate the <em>n</em>-dimensional real projective space?</span></strong></p>
<p>The short paper exhibits a triangulation with <img alt="\exp (\frac {1}{2} \sqrt n \log n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp+%28%5Cfrac+%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%5Csqrt+n+%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\exp (\frac {1}{2} \sqrt n \log n)"/> vertices.  This is the first construction that requires subexponential number of vertices in the dimension. The best lower bound by Pierre Arnoux and Alexis Marin (from 1999) are quadratic, so there is quite a way to go with the problem. I am thankful to Ryan Alweiss who was the first to tell me about the new result.</p>
<h2>Reasons to care</h2>
<p>Representing a topological space using simplicial complexes arose in the early days of algebraic topology, but there are certainly more “efficient” representations. What is the reason to to care specifically about representations via simplicial complexes? Here are my answers</p>
<ol>
<li>Constructions of triangulated manifolds with few vertices are occasionally amazing mathematical objects.</li>
<li>Simplicial complexes arise in many combinatorial and algebraic contexts,</li>
<li>The study of face numbers of simplicial complexes with various topological properties is often related to deep questions in algebra, geometry, and topology,</li>
<li>We care also about other types of representation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Kühnel and Lassmann’s complex projective plane with nine vertices and other miracles</h2>
<p>You may all be familiar with the 6-vertex triangulation of the projective space. It is obtained by identifying opposite faces of the icosahedron. It is 2-neighborly, namely every pair of vertices span an edge of the triangulation. (It also played a role in my high dimensional extension of Cayley’s counting trees formula.) The existence of 2-neighborly triangulations of other closed surfaces is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heawood_conjecture">Heawood 1890 conjecture</a> solved by Ringel and Young in the 1960s.</p>
<p>In 1980 Wolfgang Kühnel set out to construct a 3-neighborly triangulation of the complex projective plane with 9 vertices. The construction, achieved in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316583900055?via%3Dihub">a paper by Kühnel and Lassmann</a> (who also proved uniqueness), and discussed in <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~banchoff/howison/newbanchoff/publications/pdfs/9Vertex.pdf">a paper of the same year by Kühnel and Banchof</a>, is, in my view, among the most beautiful constructions in mathematics with additional hidden structures and many connections. Some motivation to the work came from the study of tight embeddings of smooth manifolds and Morse theory.</p>
<p>Ulrich Brehm and Kühnel <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040938387900425?via%3Dihub">proved</a> that if a <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-3">d</span></span></span></span>-manifold has fewer than <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-4"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-5"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-6">3</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-7">⌈</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8">d</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-9"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-10"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-11">/</span></span></span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-12">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-13">⌉</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-14">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-15">3</span></span></span></span> vertices then it is homeomorphic to a sphere, and if it has exactly <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-3-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-16"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-17"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-18">3</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-19">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-20">d</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-21"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-22"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-23">/</span></span></span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-24">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-25">)</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-26">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-27">3</span></span></span></span> vertices and is not a sphere, then <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-4-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-28"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-29"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-30">d</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-31">=</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-32">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-33">,</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-34">4</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-35">,</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-36">8</span></span></span></span> or <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-5-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-37"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-38"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-39">16</span></span></span></span> and the manifold has a nondegenerate height function with exactly three critical points. The 6-vertex <img alt="\mathbb RP^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb RP^2"/> and the 9-vertex $\mathbbCP^2$ are examples for dimensions 2 and 4. We can expect further such examples for projective planes over the quaternions and octonions. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01934320">Brehm and Kühnel</a> constructed three 8-dimensional 5-neighborly “manifolds” which are not combinatorially isomorphic. It is conjectured but not known that they all triangulate the quaternionic projective plane.</p>

<h2>Open problems and Low dimensions</h2>
<p>Of course a main question is what is the minimum number of vertices required for a triangulation of n dimensional real projective space. What about the n-dimensional complex projective space? What is the situation for low dimensions? See also the paper by Sonia Balagopalan, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6149">On a vertex-minimal triangulation of RP^4</a>.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-172 |  Optimal rate list decoding over bounded alphabets using algebraic-geometric codes | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Chaoping Xing</title>
    <summary>We construct two classes of algebraic code families which are efficiently list decodable with small output list size from a fraction $1-R-\epsilon$ of adversarial errors where $R$ is the rate of the code, for any desired positive constant $\epsilon$. The alphabet size depends only on $\epsilon$ and is nearly-optimal.

The first class of codes are obtained by folding algebraic-geometric codes using automorphisms of the underlying function field. The second class of codes are obtained by restricting evaluation points of an algebraic-geometric code to rational points from a subfield. In both cases, we develop a linear-algebraic approach to perform list decoding, which pins down the candidate messages to a subspace with a nice "periodic" structure.

To prune this subspace and obtain a good bound on the list-size, we pick subcodes of these codes by pre-coding into certain subspace-evasive sets which are guaranteed to have small intersection with the sort of periodic subspaces that arise in our list decoding. We develop two approaches for constructing such subspace-evasive sets. The first is a Monte Carlo construction of hierearchical subspace-evasive (h.s.e) sets which leads to excellent list-size but is not explicit. The second approach exploits a further ultra-periodicity of our subspaces and uses a novel construct called subspace designs, which were subsequently constructed explicitly and also found further applications in pseudorandomness.

To get a family of codes over a fixed alphabet size, we instantiate our approach with algebraic-geometric codes based on the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower of function fields. Combining this with pruning via h.s.e sets yields codes list-decodable up to a $1-R-\epsilon$ error fraction with list size bounded by $O(1/\epsilon)$, matching the existential bound for random codes up to constant factors. Further, the alphabet size can be made $\exp(\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2))$ which is not much worse than the lower bound of $\exp(\Omega(1/\epsilon))$. The parameters we achieve are thus quite close to the  existential bounds in all three aspects---error-correction radius, alphabet size, and list-size---simultaneously. This construction is, however, Monte Carlo and the claimed list decoding property only holds with high probability. Once the code is (efficiently) sampled, the encoding/decoding algorithms are deterministic with a running time $O_\epsilon(N^c)$ for an absolute constant $c$, where $N$ is the code's block length.

Using subspace designs instead for the pruning, our approach yields a deterministic construction of an algebraic code family of rate $R$ with efficient list decoding from $1-R-\epsilon$ fraction of errors over an alphabet of constant size $\exp(\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2))$.  The list size bound is upper bounded by a very slowly growing function of the block length $N$; in particular, it is at most $O(\log^{(r)} N)$ (the $r$'th iterated logarithm) for any fixed integer $r$. The explicit construction avoids the shortcoming of the Monte Carlo sampling at the expense of a worse list size.</summary>

<em>Art, history, and controversy</em><br/>
<font color="#000000"/></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
Jemma Lorenat is an assistant professor at <a href="https://www.pitzer.edu">Pitzer College</a> in Los Angeles. She teaches and does research on the history of mathematics.<br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/12/the-art-of-math/jemma/" rel="attachment wp-att-17751"><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-17751" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/jemma.png?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
Today I thought we’d look at some of her work. </p>
<p>
History of math is one topic that we have focused on many times before. More on that in a moment. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Her Art </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
But before we do that I wish to present Lorenat’s art work. My late father, Jack Lipton, was an artist and so perhaps I have a genetic interest in art. Lorenat is an artist besides being a mathematician. You can see some of her drawings of famous mathematicians <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/portrait-gallery">here</a>. Her elegant style I find appealing. See if you like it as much as I do. My dad taught me: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A clean drawing is more difficult to execute than a busy one. It is hard to hide flaws when your art is clean. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Her drawings are clean indeed. </p>
<p>
Here are three of Lorenat’s drawings of the following three famous mathematicians in some order: Which is which? Prizes will not be given to those with correct answers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Eric Temple Bell <p/>
</li><li>
Jacques Hadamard <p/>
</li><li>
Henri Lebesgue
</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Her Research </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Lorenat’s research is on the history of mathematics. My first choice is to create math, but I am intrigued by the history of who did what, when, and why. We must understand history—at least in broad strokes—if we are to continue to make progress. History helps us understand how progress was made and how it was not. History teaches us much about our field, about mathematics. </p>
<p>
<a href="http://archives.math.utk.edu/topics/history.html">Several</a> online <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~dallen/masters/hist_frame.htm">sources</a> show the field’s breadth and scope. Among issues and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematics_history_topics">topics</a>, we note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Who is a result named for? <p/>
</li><li>
Who gets the credit for a result? <p/>
</li><li>
What is the strongest result known? <p/>
</li><li>
Is this result correct?
</li></ul>
<p>
It is fun to see the process in action. One example I have been involved in for a long time is the study of vector addition systems and reachability problems. There continues to be exciting news, for instance, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07115.pdf">paper</a> last year showing that a central reachability problem is vastly harder than had been conjectured. I will discuss, however, an issue from two centuries ago that Lorenat has illuminated.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Duality Controversy </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Lorenat has a <a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/78167-culturalcontextconference2015.pdf">talk</a> on the geometric theory of duality. It was a prime example of a controversy in the discover of a basic math idea. Here duality means: Given a statement from projective geometry we can flip points and lines and still leave its correctness invariant. This is the duality: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  points \iff lines. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++points+%5Ciff+lines.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  points \iff lines. "/></p>
<p/><p/>
<table style="margin: auto;">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/12/the-art-of-math/dual/" rel="attachment wp-att-17754"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17754" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/dual.png?w=600"/></a>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
In complexity theory we have our own duality. Instead of flipping points and lines we can exchange boolean operations 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  AND \iff OR, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++AND+%5Ciff+OR%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  AND \iff OR, "/></p>
<p>and also exchange 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  0 \iff 1. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++0+%5Ciff+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  0 \iff 1. "/></p>
<p>	 Thus 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z) \iff (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x+%5Cwedge+y%29+%5Cvee+%28x+%5Cwedge+z%29+%5Ciff+%28x+%5Cvee+y%29+%5Cwedge+%28x+%5Cvee+z%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z) \iff (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z). "/></p>
<p>		 Lorenat’s talk highlights a controversy between: Joseph Diaz Gergonne, Jean-Victor Poncelet, and Julius Plucker. Her work is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/science-in-context/article/polemics-in-public-poncelet-gergonne-plucker-and-the-duality-controversy/C305E6B9326F2AC4C8AC31D4194FEDC6">here</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A plagiarism charge in 1827 sparked a public controversy centered between Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788-1867) and Joseph-Diez Gergonne (1771-1859) over the origin and applications of the principle of duality in geometry. Over the next three years and through the pages of various journals, monographs, letters, reviews, reports, and footnotes, vitriol between the antagonists increased as their potential publicity grew. While the historical literature offers valuable resources toward understanding the development, content, and applications of geometric duality, the hostile nature of the exchange seems to have deterred an in-depth textual study of the explicitly polemical writings. We argue that the necessary collective endeavor of beginning and ending this controversy constitutes a case study in the circulation of geometry. In particular, we consider how the duality controversy functioned as a medium of communicating new fundamental principles to a wider audience of practitioners. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
A further comment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry)">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Of this feud, Pierre Samuel has quipped that since both men were in the French army and Poncelet was a general while Gergonne a mere captain, Poncelet’s view prevailed, at least among their French contemporaries. </em>
</p></blockquote>

<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>Since I’m now feeling better that the first authoritarian coup attempt in US history will probably sort itself out OK, here’s a <em>real</em> problem:</p>



<p>Nearly a score years ago, I created the <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo">Complexity Zoo</a>, a procrastination project turned encyclopedia of complexity classes.  Nearly half a score years ago, the Zoo moved to my former employer, the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">Institute for Quantum Computing</a> in Waterloo, Canada, which graciously hosted it ever since.  Alas, IQC has decided that it can no longer do so.  The reason is new regulations in Ontario about the accessibility of websites, which the Zoo might be out of compliance with.  My students and I were willing to look into what was needed—like, does the <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:P#ph">polynomial hierarchy</a> need ramps between its levels or something?  The best would be if we heard from actual blind or other disabled complexity enthusiasts about how we could improve their experience, rather than trying to parse bureaucratese from the Ontario government.  But IQC informed us that in any case, they can’t deal with the potential liability and their decision is final.  I thank them for hosting the Zoo for eight years.</p>



<p>Now I’m looking for a volunteer for a new host.  The Zoo runs on the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> platform, which doesn’t work with my own hosting provider (Bluehost) but is apparently easy to set up if you, unlike me, are the kind of person who can do such things.  The IQC folks kindly offered to help with the transfer; I and my students can help as well.  It’s a small site with modest traffic.  The main things I need are just assurances that you can host the site for a long time (“forever” or thereabouts), and that you or someone else in your organization will be reachable if the site goes down or if there are other problems.  I own the complexityzoo.com domain and can redirect from there.</p>



<p>In return, you’ll get the immense prestige of hosting such a storied resource for theoretical computer science … plus free publicity for your cause or organization on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, and the eternal gratitude of thousands of my readers.</p>



<p>Of course, if you’re <em>into</em> complexity theory, and you want to update or improve the Zoo while you’re at it, then so much the awesomer!  It could use some updates, badly.  But you don’t even <em>need</em> to know P from NP.</p>



<p>If you’re interested, leave a comment or shoot me an email.  Thanks!!</p>

<p><br/>The 34th International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC 2020) was held on October 12-16, 2020, as a virtual conference. As such, the opportunity for community members to get to know each other in an informal environment was lacking. To address this need, we arranged two types of virtual networking events. We hope that these events planted the seeds for many future collaborations and that there will be an opportunity for those involved to meet in person next time.</p>



<p><strong>MoPS (Meet other Postdoc and Students) Sessions<br/></strong>Webpage: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020mops/home" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020mops/home</a></p>



<p>To allow junior members of the community to get to know one another, we arranged MoPS sessions, which we have not seen done before. There were more than 50 participants who took part in the sessions, with representation from a host of countries throughout the world. Sessions were held in 10-time slots before, during, and after DISC. In each session, there would typically be 5 members representing a mixture of Bachelor’s students, Masters students, PhDs, postdocs, and others. Care was taken to include at least one postdoc or Ph.D. in each session so that Bachelors and Masters students might benefit from their experience. Groups were formed with the goal of allowing participants from different countries and institutions to share their experiences and research journeys with one another. Based on the feedback for this event, it would appear that that goal was met and the participants came away with more of a sense of community.</p>



<p><strong>Junior-Senior Meetings<br/></strong>Webpage: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020junior-seniormeeting/home" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020junior-seniormeeting/home</a></p>



<p>The Junior-Senior meetings were organized to provide an opportunity for junior researchers to meet with senior researchers. Fourteen sessions were conducted, where each one brought together one senior and 3-5 juniors. In these sessions,  the juniors got a chance to interact with seniors in the field and profit from their experience. Discussions covered a variety of topics such as how to approach research, how to deal with the job market, or perhaps more personal concerns like work-life balance. We collected amazing feedback from the participants, who claimed that this was a fruitful and interesting experience.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-171 |  Comparing computational entropies below majority (or: When is the dense model theorem false?) | 

	Sam McGuire, 

	Russell Impagliazzo</title>
    <summary>Computational pseudorandomness studies the extent to which a random variable $\bf{Z}$ looks like the uniform distribution according to a class of tests $\cal{F}$. Computational entropy generalizes computational pseudorandomness by studying the extent which a random variable looks like a \emph{high entropy} distribution. There are different formal definitions of computational entropy with different advantages for different applications. Because of this, it is of interest to understand when these definitions are equivalent.
  We consider three notions of computational entropy which are known to be equivalent when the test class $\cal{F}$ is closed under taking majorities. This equivalence constitutes (essentially) the so-called \emph{dense model theorem} of Green and Tao (and later made explicit by Tao-Zeigler, Reingold et al., and Gowers). The dense model theorem plays a key role in Green and Tao's proof that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions and has since been connected to a surprisingly wide range of topics in mathematics and computer science, including cryptography, computational complexity, combinatorics and machine learning. We show that, in different situations where $\cal{F}$ is \emph{not} closed under majority, this equivalence fails. This in turn provides examples where the dense model theorem is \emph{false}.</summary>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  We present very general lower bounds for parametric estimation when only limited information per sample is allowed. These limitations can arise, for example, in form of communication constraints, privacy constraints, or linear measurements. Our lower bounds hold for discrete distributions with large alphabet as well as continuous distributions with high-dimensional parameters, apply for any information constraint, and are valid for any $\ell_p$ loss function. Our bounds recover both strong data processing inequality based bounds and Cramér-Rao based bound as special cases.</p>

    <title>TR20-170 |  High Dimensional Expanders: Random Walks, Pseudorandomness, and Unique Games | 

	Max Hopkins, 

	Tali Kaufman, 

	Shachar Lovett</title>
    <summary>Higher order random walks (HD-walks) on high dimensional expanders have played a crucial role in a number of recent breakthroughs in theoretical computer science, perhaps most famously in the recent resolution of the Mihail-Vazirani conjecture (Anari et al. STOC 2019), which focuses on HD-walks on one-sided local-spectral expanders. In this work we study the spectral structure of walks on the stronger two-sided variant, which capture wide generalizations of important objects like the Johnson and Grassmann graphs. We prove that the spectra of these walks are tightly concentrated in a small number of strips, each of which corresponds combinatorially to a level in the underlying complex. Moreover, the eigenvalues corresponding to these strips decay exponentially with a measure we term the depth of the walk.
    
    Using this spectral machinery, we characterize the edge-expansion of small sets based upon the interplay of their local combinatorial structure and the global decay of the walk's eigenvalues across strips. Variants of this result for the special cases of the Johnson and Grassmann graphs were recently crucial both for the resolution of the 2-2 Games Conjecture (Khot et al. FOCS 2018), and for efficient algorithms for affine unique games over the Johnson graphs (Bafna et al. Arxiv 2020). For the complete complex, our characterization admits a low-degree Sum of Squares proof. Building on the work of Bafna et al., we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for affine unique games over the Johnson scheme. The soundness and runtime of our algorithm depend upon the number of strips with large eigenvalues, a measure we call High-Dimensional Threshold Rank that calls back to the seminal work of Barak, Raghavendra, and Steurer (FOCS 2011) on unique games and threshold rank.</summary>

    <title>TR20-169 |  Efficient List-Decoding with Constant Alphabet and List Sizes | 

	Zeyu Guo, 

	Noga Ron-Zewi</title>
    <summary>We present an explicit and efficient algebraic construction of capacity-achieving list decodable codes with both constant alphabet and constant list sizes. More specifically, for any $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, we give an algebraic construction of an infinite family of error-correcting codes of rate $R$, over an alphabet of size $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$, that can be list decoded from a $(1-R-\epsilon)$-fraction of errors with list size at most $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$. Moreover, the codes can be encoded in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, the output list is contained in a linear subspace of dimension at most $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$, and a basis for this subspace can be found in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$. Thus, both encoding and list decoding can be performed in \emph{fully polynomial-time} $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, except for pruning the subspace and outputting the final list which takes time $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(n)$. In contrast, prior explicit and efficient constructions of capacity-achieving list decodable codes either required a much higher complexity in terms of $1/\epsilon$ (and were additionally much less structured), or had super-constant alphabet or list sizes.

Our codes are quite natural and structured. Specifically, we use algebraic-geometric (AG) codes with evaluation points restricted to a subfield, and with the message space restricted to a (carefully chosen) linear subspace. Our main observation is that the output list of AG codes with subfield evaluation points is contained in an affine shift of the image of a \emph{block-triangular-Toeplitz (BTT) matrix}, and that the list size can potentially be reduced to a constant by restricting the message space to a \emph{BTT evasive subspace}, which is a large subspace that intersects the image of any BTT matrix in a constant number of points. We further show how to explicitly construct such BTT evasive subspaces, based on the explicit subspace designs of Guruswami and Kopparty (\emph{Combinatorica}, 2016), and composition.</summary>

    <title>TR20-168 |  Improved List-Decodability of Reed–Solomon Codes via Tree Packings | 

	Zeyu Guo, 

	Ray Li, 

	Itzhak Tamo, 

	Mary Wootters, 

	Chong Shangguan</title>
    <summary>This paper shows that there exist Reed--Solomon (RS) codes, over large finite fields, that are combinatorially list-decodable well beyond the Johnson radius, in fact almost achieving list-decoding capacity. In particular, we show that for any $\epsilon\in (0,1]$ there exist RS codes with rate $\Omega(\frac{\epsilon}{\log(1/\epsilon)+1})$ that are list-decodable from radius of $1-\epsilon$. We generalize this result to obtain a similar result on list-recoverability of RS codes. Along the way we use our techniques to give a new proof of a result of Blackburn on optimal linear perfect hash matrices, and strengthen it to obtain a construction of strongly perfect hash matrices. 

To derive the results in this paper we show a surprising connection of the above problems to graph theory, and in particular to the tree packing theorem of Nash-Williams and Tutte. En route to our results on RS codes, we prove a generalization of the tree packing theorem to hypergraphs (and we conjecture that an even stronger generalization holds). We hope that this generalization to hypergraphs will be of independent interest.</summary>

<p>As announced <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/announcing-a-short-course-in-paris/">earlier</a> I am currently teaching a course on “interactive proofs with quantum devices” in Paris. The course is proceeding apace, even though the recent lockdown order in France means that we had to abandon our beautiful auditorium at the Institut Henri Poincaré and retreat behind the fanciful Zoom backgrounds whose pretension is a sad reminder of what our summers used to be (Banff, anyone?). A possible upshot is that more may be able to attend the now-online course; if you are interested see the <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/">course page</a> for info. (Things are actually fairly good here–in spite of the apparently strict restrictions on daily outings (max 1h, 1km) you can count on the French to bend things their way; most shops are closed but the streets remain quite busy.)</p>



<p>We just finished a sequence of four lectures on the Mahadev “classical verification of quantum computation” protocol. In the process of preparing the lectures I arrived at a presentation of the protocol that is fairly self-contained, so I decided to compile the associated lecture notes as a stand-alone group of 4 lectures that is available <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp_verification.pdf">here</a>. The notes are aimed at beginning graduate students with a first course in quantum computing and in complexity desiring to gain a concrete understanding of the inner workings of the result; the notes are a bit lengthy but this in part because they take the time to introduce related concepts and slowly build up to the main result. Overall, my hope is that these should be relatively easily readable and provide a good technical introduction to the Mahadev result on classical verification, including an almost complete analysis of her protocol (there are a few explicitly declared shortcuts that help simplify the presentation without hiding any important aspects). For additional background you can also consult the full <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp.pdf">10-week notes</a>. Comments on the notes are welcome; I’m afraid they most likely contain numerous typos so if you find any please feel free to correct them directly on the associated <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/9892211158zrwmqnxtvcxm">overleaf document</a>.</p>



<p>The last three lectures of the course will be devoted to the problem of testing under spatial assumptions, building up to an introduction to the proof of MIP* = RE. If all goes well I’ll aim to prepare some stand-alone notes for that part as well.</p></div>

    <title>How to allow deep learning on your data without revealing the data</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Today’s online world and the emerging internet of things is built around a Faustian bargain:  consumers (and their internet of things) hand over their data, and in return get customization of the world to their needs.  Is this exchange of privacy for convenience inherent? At first sight one sees no way around because, of course, to allow machine learning on our data we have to hand our data over to the training algorithm.</p>

<p>Similar issues arise in settings other than consumer devices. For instance, hospitals may wish to pool together their patient data to train a large deep model. But privacy laws such as HIPAA forbid them from sharing the data itself, so somehow they have to train a deep net on their data without revealing their data. Frameworks such as Federated Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05492">Konečný et al., 2016</a>) have been proposed for this but it is known that sharing gradients in that environment leaks a lot of information about the data (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08935">Zhu et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p>Methods to achieve some of the above  so could completely change the privacy/utility tradeoffs implicit in today’s organization of the online world.</p>

<p>This blog post discusses the current set of solutions,  how they don’t quite suffice for above questions, and the story of a new solution, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02772">InstaHide</a>, that we proposed, and takeaways from a recent attack on it by Carlini et al.</p>

<h2 id="existing-solutions-in-cryptography">Existing solutions in Cryptography</h2>

<p>Classic solutions in cryptography do allow you to in principle outsource any computation to the cloud without revealing your data. (A modern method is Fully Homomorphic Encryption.) Adapting these ideas to machine learning  presents two major obstacles: (a) (serious issue) huge computational overhead, which essentially rules it out for today’s large scale deep models (b) (less serious issue) need for special setups —e.g., requiring every user to sign up for public-key encryption.</p>

<p>Significant research efforts are being made to try to overcome these obstacles and we won’t survey them here.</p>

<h2 id="differential-privacy-dp">Differential Privacy (DP)</h2>

<p>Differential privacy (<a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2006/40040493/40040493.pdf">Dwork et al., 2006</a>, <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf">Dwork&amp;Roth, 2014</a>) involves adding carefully calculated amounts of noise during training. This is a modern and rigorous version of classic    <em>data anonymization</em> techniques whose canonical application is release of noised census data to protect privacy of individuals.</p>

<p>This notion was adapted to machine learning by positing that “privacy” in machine learning refers to trained classifiers not being dependent on data of individuals. In other words, if the classifier is trained on data from N individuals, it’s behavior should be essentially unchanged (statistically speaking) if we omit data from any individual. Note that this is a weak notion of privacy: it does not in any way hide the data from the company.</p>

<p>Many tech companies have adopted differential privacy in deployed systems but the following two caveats are important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Caveat 1): In deep learning applications, DP’s provable guarantees are very weak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying DP to deep learning involves noticing that the gradient computation amounts to adding gradients of the loss corresponding to individual data points, and that adding noise to those individual gradients in calculated doses can help make the overall classifier limit its dependence on the individual’s datapoint.</p>

<p>In practice provable bounds require adding so much gradient noise that accuracy of the trained classifier plummets. We do not know of any successful training that achieved accuracy &gt; 75 percent on CIFAR10 (or any that achieved accuracy even 10 percent on ImageNet). Furthermore, achieving this level of accuracy involves <strong>pretraining</strong> the classifier model on a large set of <strong>public</strong> images and then using the private/protected images  only to fine-tune the parameters.</p>

<p>Thus it is no surprise that firms today usually apply DP with very low noise level, which give essentially no guarantees. Which brings us to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Caveat 2): DP’s guarantees (and even weaker guarantees applying to deployment scenarios) possibly act as a fig leaf that allows firms to not address  the kinds of privacy violations that the person on the street actually worries about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DP’s provable guarantee (which as noted, does not hold in deployed systems due to the low noise level used) would only ensure that  a deployed ML software that was trained with data from tens of millions of users will not change its behavior depending upon private information of any single user.</p>

<p>But that threat model would seem remote to the person on the street. The privacy issue they worry about more is that copious amounts of our data are continuously collected/stored/mined/sold, often by entities we do not even know about. While  lax regulation is primarily to blame,  there is also the technical hurdle  that  there  is no <strong>practical way</strong> for consumers to hide their data while at the same time benefiting from customized ML solutions that improve their lives.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the question we started with: <em>Could consumers allow machine learning to be done on their data without revealing their data?</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proposed-solution-instahide">A proposed solution: InstaHide</h2>

<p>InstaHide is a new concept: it hides or “encrypts” images to protect them somewhat,  while still allowing standard deep learning pipelines to be applied on them. The deep model is trained entirely on encrypted images.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The training speed and accuracy is only slightly worse than vanilla training: one can achieve a test accuracy of ~ 90 percent on CIFAR10 using encrypted images with a computation overhead $&lt; 5$ percent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to privacy, like every other form of cryptography, its security is based upon conjectured difficulty of the underlying computational problem.
(But we don’t expect breaking it to be as difficult as say breaking RSA.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-instahide-encryption-works">How InstaHide encryption works</h3>

<p>Here are some details. InstaHide  belongs to the class of subset-sum type encryptions (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dwoodruf/www/biwx.pdf">Bhattacharyya et al., 2011</a>), and was inspired by a data augmentation technique called Mixup (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">Zhang et al., 2018</a>). It views images as vectors of pixel values. With vectors you can take linear combinations. The figure below shows the result of a typical MixUp: adding  0.6 times the bird image  with 0.4 times the airplane image. The image labels can also be treated as one-hot vectors, and they are mixed using the same coefficients in front of the image samples.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/mixup.png" width="60%"/>
</p>

<p>To encrypt the bird image, InstaHide does mixup (i.e., combination with nonnegative coefficients) with one other randomly chosen training image, and with two  other images chosen randomly from a large public dataset like imagenet.  The coefficients 0.6., 0.4 etc. in the figure  are also chosen at random. Then it takes this composite image and for every pixel value, it randomly flips the sign. With that, we get the encrypted images and labels. All random choices made in this encryption act as a one-time key that is never re-used to encrypt other images.</p>

<p>InstaHide has a parameter $k$ denoting how many images are mixed; in the picture, we have $k=4$. The figure below shows this encryption mechanism.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/instahide.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

<p>When plugged into the standard deep learning with a private dataset of $n$ images, in each epoch of training (say $T$ epochs in total), InstaHide will re-encrypt each image in the  dataset using a random one-time key. This will gives $n\times T$ encrypted images in total.</p>

<h3 id="the-security-argument">The security argument</h3>

<p>We conjectured, based upon intuitions from computational complexity of the k-vector-subset-sum problem (citations), that extracting information about the images could time $N^{k-2}$. Here $N$, the size of the public dataset, can be tens or hundreds of millions, so it might be infeasible for real-life attackers.</p>

<p>We also released a <a href="https://github.com/Hazelsuko07/InstaHide_Challenge">challenge dataset</a> with $k=6, n=100, T=50$ to enable further investigation of InstaHide’s security.</p>

<h2 id="carlini-et-als-recent-attack-on-instahide">Carlini et al.’s recent attack on InstaHide</h2>

<p>Recently, Carlini et al. have shared with us a manuscript with a two-step reconstruction attack (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05315.pdf">Carlini et al., 2020</a>)  against InstaHide.</p>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: They used 11 hours on Google’s best GPUs to get partial recovery of our 100 challenge encryptions and  120 CPU hours to break the encryption completely. Furthermore, the latter was possible entirely because we used an insecure random number generator, and they used exhaustive search over random seeds.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now the details.</p>

<p>The attack takes $n\times T$ InstaHide-encrypted images as the input, ($n$ is the size of the private dataset, $T$ is the number of training epochs), and returns a reconstruction of the private dataset. It goes as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Map $n \times T$ encryptions into $n$ private images, by clustering encryptions of a same private image as a group. This is achieved by firstly building a graph representing pairwise similarity between encrypted images, and then assign each encryption a private image. In their implementation, they train a neural network to annotate pairwise similarity between encryptions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, given the encrypted images and the mapping, they solve a nonlinear optimization problem via gradient desent to recover an approximation of the original private dataset.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using Google’s powerful GPU, it took them 10 hours to train the neural network for similarity annotation, and about another hour to get an approximation of our challenge set of $100$ images with $k=6, n=100, T=50$. This gave them vaguely correct images, with significant unclear areas and color shift.</p>

<p>They also proposed a different strategy which abuses the vulnerability of NumPy and PyTorch’s random number generator (<em>Aargh; we didn’t use a secure random number generator.</em>) They did  brute force search of $2^{32}$ possible initial random seeds, which allows them to reproduce the randomness during encryption, and thus perform a pixel-perfect reconstruction. As they reported, this attack takes 120 CPU hours (they parallelize across 100 cores to obtain the solution in a little over an hour). We will have this implementation flaw fixed in an updated version.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-this-attack">Thoughts on this attack</h3>

<p>Though the attack is clever and impressive, we feel that the long-term take-away is still unclear for several reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variants of InstaHide seem to evade the attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The challenge set contained 50 encryptions each of 100 images. This corresponds to using encrypted images for 50 epochs. But as done in existing settings that use DP, one can pretrain the deep model using non-private images and then fine-tune it with fewer epochs of the private images. Using a similar pipeline DPSGD (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133">Abadi et al., 2016</a>), by pretraining a ResNet-18 on CIFAR100 (the public dataset) and finetuning  for $10$ epochs on CIFAR10 (the private dataset)  gives accuracy of 83 percent, still far better than any provable guarantees using DP on this dataset. Carlini et al.\ team conceded that their attack probably would not work in this setting.</p>

<p>Similarly using InstaHide purely at inference time (i.e., using ML, instead of training ML) still should be completely secure since only one encryption of the image is released. The new attack can’t work here at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>InstaHide was never intended to be a mission-critical encryption like RSA (which by the way also has no provable guarantees).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>InstaHide is designed to give users and the internet of things a <em>light-weight</em> encryption method that allows them to use machine learning without giving eavesdroppers or servers access to their raw data. There is no other cost-effective alternative to InstaHide for this application. If it takes Google’s powerful computers a few hours  to break our challenge set of 100 images, this is not yet a cost-effective attack  in the intended settings.</p>

<p>More important, the challenge dataset corresponded to an ambitious form of security, where the encrypted images themselves are released to the world. The more typical application is a Federated Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05492">Konečný et al., 2016</a>) scenario: the adversary observes shared gradients that are computed using encrypted images (he also has access to the trained model). The attacks in this paper do not currently apply to that scenario. This is also the idea in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06053"><strong>TextHide</strong></a>, an adaptation of InstaHide to text data.</p>

<h2 id="takeways">Takeways</h2>

<p>Users need lightweight encryptions that can be applied in real time to large amounts of data, and yet allow them to take benefit of Machine Learning on the cloud. Methods to do so could completely change the privacy/utility tradeoffs implicitly assumed in today’s tech world.</p>

<p>InstaHide is the only such tool right now, and we now know that it provides moderate security that may be enough for many applications.</p>
