    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Two weeks ago, I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5122">blogged about</a> the striking claim, by the group headed by Chaoyang Lu and Jianwei Pan at USTC in China, to have achieved quantum supremacy via BosonSampling with 50-70 detected photons.  I also did a <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/12/chinas-quantum-computer-a-step-not-a-leap/">four-part interview</a> on the subject with Jonathan Tennenbaum at Asia Times, and other interviews elsewhere.  None of that stopped some people, who I guess didn’t google, from writing to tell me how disappointed they were by my silence!</p>



<p>The reality, though, is that a lot has happened since the original announcement, so it’s way past time for an update.</p>



<p><strong>I. The Quest to Spoof</strong></p>



<p>Most importantly, other groups almost immediately went to work trying to refute the quantum supremacy claim, by finding some efficient classical algorithm to spoof the reported results.  It’s important to understand that this is exactly how the process is <em>supposed</em> to work: as I’ve often stressed, a quantum supremacy claim is credible only if it’s open to the community to refute and if no one can.  It’s also important to understand that, for reasons we’ll go into, there’s a decent chance that people <em>will</em> succeed in simulating the new experiment classically, although they haven’t yet.  All parties to the discussion agree that the new experiment is, far and away, the closest any BosonSampling experiment has ever gotten to the quantum supremacy regime; the hard part is to figure out if it’s already there.</p>



<p>Part of me feels guilty that, as one of reviewers on the <em>Science</em> paper—albeit, one stressed and harried by kids and covid—it’s now clear that I didn’t exercise the amount of diligence that I could have, in searching for ways to kill the new supremacy claim.  But another part of me feels that, with quantum supremacy claims, much like with proposals for new cryptographic codes, vetting <em>can’t be the responsibility of one or two reviewers</em>.  Instead, provided the claim is serious—as this one obviously is—the only thing to do is to get the paper out, so that the <em>entire community</em> can then work to knock it down.  Communication between authors and skeptics is also a hell of a lot faster when it doesn’t need to go through a journal’s editorial system.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, one skeptic of the new quantum supremacy claim is Gil Kalai, who (despite Google’s result last year, which Gil still believes must be in error) rejects the entire possibility of quantum supremacy on quasi-metaphysical grounds.  But other skeptics are current and former members of the Google team, including Sergio Boixo and John Martinis!  And—pause to enjoy the irony—<em>Gil has effectively teamed up with the Google folks</em> on questioning the new claim.  Another central figure in the vetting effort—one from whom I’ve learned much of what I know about the relevant issues over the last week—is Dutch quantum optics professor and frequent <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> commenter <a href="https://people.utwente.nl/j.j.renema">Jelmer Renema</a>.</p>



<p>Without further ado, why might the new experiment, impressive though it was, be efficiently simulable classically?  A central reason for concern is photon loss: as Chaoyang Lu has now explicitly confirmed (it was implicit in the paper), up to ~70% of the photons get lost on their way through the beamsplitter network, leaving only ~30% to be detected.  At least with “Fock state” BosonSampling—i.e., the original kind, the kind with single-photon inputs that Alex Arkhipov and I proposed in 2011—it seems likely to me that such a loss rate would be fatal for quantum supremacy; see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01953">this 2019 paper</a> by Renema, Shchesnovich, and Garcia-Patron.</p>



<p>Incidentally, if anything’s become clear over the last two weeks, it’s that I, the co-inventor of BosonSampling, am no longer any sort of expert on the subject’s literature!</p>



<p>Anyway, one source of uncertainty regarding the photon loss issue is that, as I said in my last post, the USTC experiment implemented a 2016 variant of BosonSampling called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01199">Gaussian BosonSampling (GBS)</a>—and Jelmer tells me that the computational complexity of GBS in the presence of losses hasn’t yet been analyzed in the relevant regime, though there’s been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12075">work aiming in that direction</a>.  A second source of uncertainty is simply that the classical simulations work in a certain limit—namely, fixing the rate of noise and then letting the numbers of photons and modes go to infinity—but any real experiment has a fixed number of photons and modes (in USTC’s case, they’re ~50 and ~100 respectively).  It wouldn’t do to reject USTC’s claim via a theoretical asymptotic argument that would equally well apply to <em>any</em> non-error-corrected quantum supremacy demonstration!</p>



<p>OK, but if an efficient classical simulation of lossy GBS experiments exists, then <em>what is it?</em>  How does it work?  It turns out that we have a plausible candidate for the answer to that, originating with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3093">2014 paper</a> by Gil Kalai and Guy Kindler.  Given a beamsplitter network, Kalai and Kindler considered an infinite hierarchy of better and better approximations to the BosonSampling distribution for that network.  Roughly speaking, at the first level (k=1), one pretends that the photons are just classical distinguishable particles.  At the second level (k=2), one correctly models quantum interference involving <em>pairs</em> of photons, but none of the higher-order interference.  At the third level (k=3), one correctly models three-photon interference, and so on until k=n (where n is the total number of photons), when one has reproduced the original BosonSampling distribution.  At least when k is small, the time needed to spoof outputs at the k<sup>th</sup> level of the hierarchy should grow like n<sup>k</sup>.  As theoretical computer scientists, Kalai and Kindler didn’t care whether their hierarchy produced any physically realistic kind of noise, but later work, by Shchesnovich, Renema, and others, showed that (as it happens) it does.</p>



<p>In its original paper, the USTC team ruled out the possibility that the first, k=1 level of this hierarchy could explain its experimental results.  More recently, in response to inquiries by Sergio, Gil, Jelmer, and others, Chaoyang tells me they’ve ruled out the possibility that the k=2 level can explain their results either.  We’re now eagerly awaiting the answer for larger values of k.</p>



<p>Let me add that I owe Gil Kalai the following public <em>mea culpa</em>.  While his objections to QC have often struck me as unmotivated and weird, in the case at hand, Gil’s 2014 work with Kindler is clearly helping drive the scientific discussion forward.  In other words, at least with BosonSampling, it turns out that Gil put his finger precisely on a key issue.  He did exactly what every QC skeptic should do, and what I’ve always implored the skeptics to do.</p>



<p><strong>II. BosonSampling vs. Random Circuit Sampling: A Tale of HOG and CHOG and LXEB</strong></p>



<p>There’s a broader question: why should skeptics of a BosonSampling experiment even have to <em>think</em> about messy details like the rate of photon losses?  Why shouldn’t that be solely the <em>experimenters’</em> job?</p>



<p>To understand what I mean, consider the situation with Random Circuit Sampling, the task Google demonstrated last year with 53 qubits.  There, the Google team simply collected the output samples and fed them into a benchmark that they called “Linear Cross-Entropy” (LXEB), closely related to what Lijie Chen and I called “Heavy Output Generation” (HOG) in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">2017 paper</a>.  With suitable normalization, an ideal quantum computer would achieve an LXEB score of 2, while classical random guessing would achieve an LXEB score of 1.  Crucially, according to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12085">2019 result</a> by me and Sam Gunn, under a plausible (albeit strong) complexity assumption, <em>no</em> subexponential-time classical spoofing algorithm should be able to achieve an LXEB score that’s even slightly higher than 1.  In its experiment, Google reported an LXEB score of about 1.002, with a confidence interval <em>much</em> smaller than 0.002.  Hence: quantum supremacy (subject to our computational assumption), with no further need to know anything about the sources of noise in Google’s chip!  (More explicitly, Boixo, Smelyansky, and Neven <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01875">did a calculation</a> in 2017 to show that the Kalai-Kindler type of spoofing strategy <em>definitely</em> isn’t going to work against RCS and Linear XEB, with no computational assumption needed.)</p>



<p>So then why couldn’t the USTC team do something analogous with BosonSampling?  Well, they tried to.   They defined a measure that they called “HOG,” although it’s different from my and Lijie Chen’s HOG, more similar to a cross-entropy.  Following Jelmer, let me call their measure CHOG, where the C could stand for Chinese, Chaoyang’s, or Changed.  They calculated the CHOG for their experimental samples, and showed that it exceeds the CHOG that you’d get from the k=1 and k=2 levels of the Kalai-Kindler hierarchy, as well as from various other spoofing strategies, thereby ruling those out as classical explanations for their results.</p>



<p>The trouble is this: <em>unlike </em>with Random Circuit Sampling and LXEB, with BosonSampling and CHOG, we <em>know</em> that there are fast classical algorithms that achieve better scores than the trivial algorithm, the algorithm that just picks samples at random.  That follows from Kalai and Kindler’s work, and it even more simply follows from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7460">2013 paper</a> by me and Arkhipov, entitled “BosonSampling Is Far From Uniform.”  Worse yet, with BosonSampling, we currently have no analogue of my 2019 result with Sam Gunn: that is, a result that would tell us (under suitable complexity assumptions) the highest possible CHOG score that we expect any efficient classical algorithm to be able to get.  And since we don’t know exactly where that ceiling is, we can’t tell the experimentalists exactly what target they need to surpass in order to claim quantum supremacy.  Absent such definitive guidance from us, the experimentalists are left playing whac-a-mole against <em>this</em> possible classical spoofing strategy, and <em>that</em> one, and <em>that</em> one.</p>



<p>This is an issue that I and others were aware of for years, although the new experiment has certainly underscored it.  Had I understood <em>just how serious</em> the USTC group was about scaling up BosonSampling, and fast, I might’ve given the issue some more attention!</p>



<p><strong>III. Fock vs. Gaussian BosonSampling</strong></p>



<p>Above, I mentioned another complication in understanding the USTC experiment: namely, their reliance on Gaussian BosonSampling (GBS) rather than Fock BosonSampling (FBS), sometimes also called Aaronson-Arkhipov BosonSampling (AABS).  Since I gave this issue short shrift in my previous post, let me make up for it now.</p>



<p>In FBS, the initial state consists of either 0 or 1 photons in each input mode, like so: |1,…,1,0,…,0⟩.  We then pass the photons through our beamsplitter network, and measure the number of photons in each output mode.  The result is that the amplitude of each possible output configuration can be expressed as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_(mathematics)">permanent</a> of some n×n matrix, where n is the total number of photons.  It was interest in the permanent, which plays a central role in classical computational complexity, that led me and Arkhipov to study BosonSampling in the first place.</p>



<p>The trouble is, preparing initial states like |1,…,1,0,…,0⟩ turns out to be really hard.  No one has yet build a source that reliably outputs <em>one and only one photon</em> at exactly a specified time.  This led two experimental groups to propose an idea that, in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1579">2013 post on this blog</a>, I named Scattershot BosonSampling (SBS).  In SBS, you get to use the more readily available “Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion” (SPDC) photon sources, which output superpositions over different numbers of photons, of the form $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \alpha_n |n \rangle |n \rangle, $$ where α<sub>n</sub> decreases exponentially with n.  You then measure the left half of each entangled pair, <em>hope</em> to see exactly one photon, and are guaranteed that if you do, then there’s also exactly one photon in the right half.  Crucially, one can show that, if Fock BosonSampling is hard to simulate approximately using a classical computer, then the Scattershot kind must be as well.</p>



<p>OK, so what’s <em>Gaussian</em> BosonSampling?  It’s simply the generalization of SBS where, instead of SPDC states, our input can be an arbitrary “Gaussian state”: for those in the know, a state that’s exponential in some quadratic polynomial in the creation operators.  If there are m modes, then such a state requires ~m<sup>2</sup> independent parameters to specify.  The quantum optics people have a much easier time creating these Gaussian states than they do creating single-photon Fock states.</p>



<p>While the amplitudes in FBS are given by permanents of matrices (and thus, the probabilities by the absolute squares of permanents), the probabilities in GBS are given by a more complicated matrix function called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnian">Hafnian</a>.  Roughly speaking, while the permanent counts the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph, the Hafnian counts the number of perfect matchings in an <em>arbitrary</em> graph.  The permanent and the Hafnian are both #P-complete.  In the USTC paper, they talk about yet another matrix function called the “Torontonian,” which was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01639.pdf">invented two years ago</a>.  I gather that the Torontonian is just the modification of the Hafnian for the situation where you only have “threshold detectors” (which decide whether one or more photons are present in a given mode), rather than “number-resolving detectors” (which <em>count</em> how many photons are present).</p>



<p>If Gaussian BosonSampling includes Scattershot BosonSampling as a special case, and if Scattershot BosonSampling is at least as hard to simulate classically as the original BosonSampling, then you might hope that GBS would <em>also</em> be at least as hard to simulate classically as the original BosonSampling.  Alas, this doesn’t follow.  Why not?  Because for all we know, a <em>random</em> GBS instance might be a lot easier than a <em>random</em> SBS instance.  Just because permanents can be expressed using Hafnians, doesn’t mean that a random Hafnian is as hard as a random permanent.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I think it’s very likely that the sort of analysis Arkhipov and I did back in 2011 could be mirrored in the Gaussian case.  I.e., instead of starting with reasonable assumptions about the distribution and hardness of random permanents, and then concluding the classical hardness of approximate BosonSampling, one would start with reasonable assumptions about the distribution and hardness of random Hafnians (or “Torontonians”), and conclude the classical hardness of approximate GBS.  But this is theoretical work that remains to be done!</p>



<p><strong>IV. Application to Molecular Vibronic Spectra?</strong></p>



<p>In 2014, Alan Aspuru-Guzik and collaborators put out a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8427">paper</a> that made an amazing claim: namely that, contrary to what I and others had said, BosonSampling was <em>not</em> an intrinsically useless model of computation, good only for refuting QC skeptics like Gil Kalai!  Instead, they said, a BosonSampling device (specifically, what would later be called a GBS device) could be directly applied to solve a practical problem in quantum chemistry.  This is the computation of “molecular vibronic spectra,” also known as “Franck-Condon profiles,” whatever those are.</p>



<p>I never understood nearly enough about chemistry to evaluate this striking proposal, but I was always a bit skeptical of it, for the following reason.  Nothing in the proposal seemed to take seriously that BosonSampling is a <em>sampling</em> task!  A chemist would typically have some <em>specific numbers</em> that she wants to estimate, of which these “vibronic spectra” seemed to be an example.  But while it’s often convenient to estimate physical quantities via Monte Carlo sampling over simulated observations of the physical system you care about, that’s not the <em>only</em> way to estimate physical quantities!  And worryingly, in all the other examples we’d seen where BosonSampling could be used to estimate a number, the same number could <em>also</em> be estimated using one of several polynomial-time classical algorithms invented by Leonid Gurvits.  So why should vibronic spectra be an exception?</p>



<p>After an email exchange with Alex Arkhipov, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Leonardo Novo, and Raul Garcia-Patron, I believe we finally got to the bottom of it, and the answer is: vibronic spectra are <em>not</em> an exception.</p>



<p>In terms of BosonSampling, the vibronic spectra task is simply to estimate the probability histogram of some weighted linear combination like $$ w_1 s_1 + \cdots + w_ m s_m, $$ where w<sub>1</sub>,…,w<sub>m</sub> are fixed real numbers, and (s<sub>1</sub>,…,s<sub>m</sub>) is a possible outcome of the BosonSampling experiment, s<sub>i</sub> representing the number of photons observed in mode i.  Alas, while it takes some work, it turns out that Gurvits’s classical algorithms can be adapted to estimate these histograms.  Granted, running the actual BosonSampling experiment would provide <em>slightly</em> more detailed information—namely, some exact sampled values of $$ w_1 s_1 + \cdots + w_ m s_m, $$ rather than merely additive approximations to the values—but since we’d still need to sort those sampled values into coarse “bins” in order to compute a histogram, it’s not clear why that additional precision would ever be of chemical interest.</p>



<p>This is a pity, since if the vibronic spectra application <em>had</em> beaten what was doable classically, then it would’ve provided not merely a first practical use for BosonSampling, but also a lovely way to <em>verify</em> that a BosonSampling device was working as intended.</p>



<p><strong>V. Application to Finding Dense Subgraphs?</strong></p>



<p>A different potential application of Gaussian BosonSampling, first suggested by the Toronto-based startup <a href="https://www.xanadu.ai/">Xanadu</a>, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10730">finding dense subgraphs in a graph</a>.  (Or at least, providing an initial seed to classical optimization methods that search for dense subgraphs.)</p>



<p>This is an NP-hard problem, so to say that I was skeptical of the proposal would be a gross understatement.  Nevertheless, it turns out that there <em>is</em> a striking observation by the Xanadu team at the core of their proposal: namely that, given a graph G and a positive even integer k, a GBS device can be used to sample a random subgraph of G of size k, with probability <em>proportional to the square of the number of perfect matchings in that subgraph</em>.  Cool, right?  And potentially even useful, especially if the number of perfect matchings could serve as a rough indicator of the subgraph’s density!  Alas, Xanadu’s Juan Miguel Arrazola himself recently told me that there’s a cubic-time classical algorithm for the same sampling task, so that the possible quantum speedup that one could get from GBS in this way is at most polynomial.  The search for a useful application of BosonSampling continues!</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>And that’s all for now!  I’m grateful to all the colleagues I talked to over the last couple weeks, including Alex Arkhipov, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Sergio Boixo, Raul Garcia-Patron, Leonid Gurvits, Gil Kalai, Chaoyang Lu, John Martinis, and Jelmer Renema, while obviously taking sole responsibility for any errors in the above.  I look forward to a spirited discussion in the comments, and of course I’ll post updates as I learn more!</p></div>

hierarchical clustering methods on massive datasets consisting of deep
embedding vectors from computer vision and NLP applications. This includes a
large variety of image embedding (ImageNet, ImageNetV2, NaBirds), word
embedding (Twitter, Wikipedia), and sentence embedding (SST-2) vectors from
several popular recent models (e.g. ResNet, ResNext, Inception V3, SBERT). Our
study includes datasets with up to $4.5$ million entries with embedding
dimensions up to $2048$.
</p>
<p>In order to address the challenge of scaling up hierarchical clustering to
such large datasets we propose a new practical hierarchical clustering
algorithm B++&amp;C. It gives a 5%/20% improvement on average for the popular
Moseley-Wang (MW) / Cohen-Addad et al. (CKMM) objectives (normalized) compared
to a wide range of classic methods and recent heuristics. We also introduce a
theoretical algorithm B2SAT&amp;C which achieves a $0.74$-approximation for the
CKMM objective in polynomial time. This is the first substantial improvement
over the trivial $2/3$-approximation achieved by a random binary tree. Prior to
this work, the best poly-time approximation of $\approx 2/3 + 0.0004$ was due
to Charikar et al. (SODA'19).

    <title>Efficient PTAS for the Maximum Traveling Salesman Problem in a Metric Space of Fixed Doubling Dimension</title>

researched combinatorial optimization problems. It consists of finding a
Hamiltonian cycle in a given complete weighted graph with the maximum total
weight of the edges. This problem is APX-hard in the general and metric cases
but admits efficient approximation schemes in the geometric setting, when the
vertices of the input graph are some points in fixed-dimensional real space and
the edge weights are induced by some vector norm. In this paper, we suggest the
first polynomial-time approximation scheme for Max TSP in arbitrary metric
space of fixed doubling dimension. In fact, the suggested algorithm implements
a scheme EPTAS: for any fixed $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, it computes a
$(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate solution of the considered problem in cubic time.
Also, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm which finds asymptotically optimal
solutions of the metric Max TSP in fixed and sublogarithmic doubling
dimensions.

independent Gaussian entries and the right-hand side $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$

prove that the gap between the value of the linear programming relaxation and
the IP is upper bounded by $\operatorname{poly}(m)(\log n)^2 / n$ with
probability at least $1-1/n^7-1/2^{\Omega(m)}$. Our results give a Gaussian
analogue of the classical integrality gap result of Dyer and Frieze (Math. of
O.R., 1989) in the case of random packing IPs. In constrast to the packing
case, our integrality gap depends only polynomially on $m$ instead of
exponentially. By recent breakthrough work of Dey, Dubey and Molinaro (SODA,

good probability, which is polynomial when the number of constraints $m$ is

    <title>On some geometric aspects of the class of hv-convex switching components</title>

discrete set is considered, by means of projection data collected along a set
$U$ of discrete directions. Possible ambiguous reconstructions can arise if and
only if switching components occur, namely, if and only if non-empty images
exist having null projections along all the directions in $U$. In order to
lower the number of allowed reconstructions, one tries to incorporate possible
extra geometric constraints in the tomographic problem. In particular, the
class $\mathbb{P}$ of horizontally and vertically convex connected sets
(briefly, $hv$-convex polyominoes) has been largely considered. In this paper
we introduce the class of $hv$-convex switching components, and prove some
preliminary results on their geometric structure. The class includes all
switching components arising when the tomographic problem is considered in
$\mathbb{P}$, which highly motivates the investigation of such configurations.
It turns out that the considered class can be partitioned in two disjointed
subclasses of closed patterns, called windows and curls, respectively. It
follows that all windows have a unique representation, while curls consist of
interlaced sequences of sub-patterns, called $Z$-paths, which leads to the
problem of understanding the combinatorial structure of such sequences. We
provide explicit constructions of families of curls associated to some special
sequences, and also give additional details on further allowed or forbidden
configurations by means of a number of illustrative examples.

and scientific computing. In practice, a map between two shapes is commonly
represented by two meshes with same connectivity and different embedding. The
standard approach is to input a meshing of one of the two domains plus a
function that projects its boundary to the other domain, and then solve for the
position of the interior vertices. Inspired by basic principles in mesh
generation, in this paper we present the reader a novel point of view on mesh
parameterization: we consider connectivity as an additional unknown, and assume
that our inputs are just two boundaries that enclose the domains we want to
connect. We compute the map by simultaneously growing the same mesh inside both
shapes.This change in perspective allows us to recast the parameterization
problem as a mesh generation problem, granting access to a wide set of mature
tools that are typically not used in this setting. Our practical outcome is a
provably robust yet trivial to implement algorithm that maps any planar shape
with simple topology to a homotopic domain that is weakly visible from an inner
convex kernel. Furthermore, we speculate on a possible extension of the
proposed ideas to volumetric maps, listing the major challenges that arise.
Differently from prior methods, for which we show that a volumetric extension
is not possible, our analysis leaves us reasoneable hopes that the robust
generation of volumetric maps via compatible mesh generation could be obtained
in the future.

    <title>A new perspective of paramodulation complexity by solving massive 8 puzzles</title>

certain routes on a board to reach a certain end-configuration. In this paper,
we propose a novel measurement of complexity of massive sliding puzzles with
paramodulation which is an inference method of automated reasoning. It turned
out that by counting the number of clauses yielded with paramodulation, we can
evaluate the difficulty of each puzzle. In experiment, we have generated 100 *
8 puzzles which passed the solvability checking by countering inversions. By
doing this, we can distinguish the complexity of 8 puzzles with the number of
generated with paramodulation. For example, board [2,3,6,1,7,8,5,4, hole] is
the easiest with score 3008 and board [6,5,8,7,4,3,2,1, hole] is the most
difficult with score 48653. Besides, we have succeeded to obverse several
layers of complexity (the number of clauses generated) in 100 puzzles. We can
conclude that proposal method can provide a new perspective of paramodulation
complexity concerning sliding block puzzles.

solutions with objective function values equal to the lower bound found by the
Linear Programming relaxation. For the cases when upper bound returned by our
heuristics differs from the lower bound we embed the bounds into a Branch and

comparable to the minimum time needed to verify the correctness of a solution.
Previously instance optimal algorithms were only known when the size of the
join was small (as one component of their run time that was linear in the join
size). We give an instance optimal algorithm for estimating the join size for
all instances, including when the join size is large, by removing the
dependency on the join size. As a byproduct, we show how to sample rows from
the join uniformly at random in a comparable amount of time.

convex hull of P with empty convex polygons or internal faces whose extreme
points belong to P. In a convex partition, the union of the internal faces give
the convex hull of P and the interiors of the polygons are pairwise disjoint.
Moreover, no polygon is allowed to contain a point of P in its interior. The
problem is to find a convex partition based on the minimum number of internal
faces. The problem has been shown to be NP-Hard and was recently used in the
CG:SHOP Challenge 2020. We propose a new integer linear programming (IP)
formulation that considerably improves over the existing one. It relies on the
representation of faces as opposed to segments and points. A number of
geometric properties are used to strengthen it. Data sets of 100 points are
easily solved to optimality and the lower bounds provided by the model can be
computed up to 300 points.

    <title>Minimum Robust Multi-Submodular Cover for Fairness</title>

Cover for Fairness (MinRF), as follows: given a ground set $V$; $m$ monotone
submodular functions $f_1,...,f_m$; $m$ thresholds $T_1,...,T_m$ and a
non-negative integer $r$, MinRF asks for the smallest set $S$ such that for all
$i \in [m]$, $\min_{|X| \leq r} f_i(S \setminus X) \geq T_i$. We prove that
MinRF is inapproximable within $(1-\epsilon)\ln m$; and no algorithm, taking
fewer than exponential number of queries in term of $r$, is able to output a
feasible set to MinRF with high certainty. Three bicriteria approximation
algorithms with performance guarantees are proposed: one for $r=0$, one for
$r=1$, and one for general $r$. We further investigate our algorithms'
performance in two applications of MinRF, Information Propagation for Multiple
Groups and Movie Recommendation for Multiple Users. Our algorithms have shown
to outperform baseline heuristics in both solution quality and the number of
queries in most cases.

    <title>A New Approach to Regular &amp; Indeterminate Strings</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Louza:Felipe_A=.html">Felipe A.

F. Smyth</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07892">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we propose a new, more appropriate definition of regular and
indeterminate strings. A regular string is one that is "isomorphic" to a string
whose entries all consist of a single letter, but which nevertheless may itself
include entries containing multiple letters. A string that is not regular is
said to be indeterminate. We begin by proposing a new model for the
representation of strings, regular or indeterminate, then go on to describe a
linear time algorithm to determine whether or not a string $x = x[1..n]$ is
regular and, if so, to replace it by a lexicographically least (lex-least)
string $y$ whose entries are all single letters. Furthermore, we connect the
regularity of a string to the transitive closure problem on a graph, which in
our special case can be efficiently solved. We then introduce the idea of a
feasible palindrome array MP of a string, and prove that every feasible MP
corresponds to some (regular or indeterminate) string. We describe an algorithm
that constructs a string $x$ corresponding to given feasible MP, while ensuring
that whenever possible $x$ is regular and if so, then lex-least. A final
section outlines new research directions suggested by this changed perspective
on regular and indeterminate strings.

    <title>Going from the huge to the small: Efficient succinct representation of proofs in Minimal implicational logic</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1608076800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Haeusler:Edward_Hermann.html">Edward Hermann Haeusler</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07833">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A previous article shows that any linear height bounded normal proof of a
tautology in the Natural Deduction for Minimal implicational logic
$M_{\supset}$ is as huge as it is redundant. More precisely, any proof in a
family of super-polynomially sized and linearly height bounded proofs have a
sub-derivation that occurs super-polynomially many times in it. In this
article, we show that by collapsing all the repeated sub-derivations we obtain
a smaller structure, a rooted Directed Acyclic Graph (r-DAG), that is
polynomially upper-bounded on the size of $\alpha$ and it is a certificate that
$\alpha$ is a tautology that can be verified in polynomial time. In other
words, for every huge proof of a tautology in $M_{\supset}$, we obtain a
succinct certificate for its validity. Moreover, we show an algorithm able to
check this validity in polynomial time on the certificate's size. Comments on
how the results in this article are related to a proof of the conjecture
$NP=CoNP$ appears in conclusion.

computational problem of deciding whether a given conjunction of atomic
formulas is satisfiable in some model of $T$. We study the computational
complexity of $\mathrm{CSP}(T_1 \cup T_2)$ where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are theories
with disjoint finite relational signatures. We prove that if $T_1$ and $T_2$
are the theories of temporal structures, i.e., structures where all relations
have a first-order definition in $(\mathbb{Q},&lt;)$, then $\mathrm{CSP}(T_1 \cup
T_2)$ is in P or NP-complete. To this end we prove a new algebraic dichotomy
about the lattice of locally closed clones over the domain ${\mathbb{Q}}$ that
contain $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q};&lt;)$.

Application deadline is tomorrow morning Italian time, tonight American time.)<br/><br/>Last weekend I was saddened to hear of the death of Korean filmmaker Kim Ki-duk. Kim was in Latvia, preparing to shoot a movie there. He disappeared about a week ago, and it then transpired that he had been hospitalized with Covid symptoms, and died last Friday from Covid complications.</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, living in the San Francisco Bay Area offered me several opportunities to discover cinema that was new to me. There were the several film festivals held each year in San Francisco, the wonderful retrospectives at the Castro Theater. There was also Netflix, that at the time operated by renting DVDs by mail (I am feeling like grandpa Simpson telling stories here) and whose catalog was basically every movie ever released in the US. I discovered the work of Hirokazu Kore-eda and Wong Kar-Wai, whose movies are now among my favorites, and I watched some challenging but rewarding movies by the likes of Tsai Ming-Lian and Hou Hsiao-Hsien. So, when it came out, I watched “3-iron” by Kim Ki-duk, an amazing movie on the theme of the poor being invisible to the rich, but taken to extreme and fantastical places.</p>



<p>I was reminded of that time during our first lockdown last Spring. After having watched a lot of TV series, I felt like I had to do something a bit more soul-nourishing before the lockdown ended. So I resolved to watch Tarkovsky’s “Solaris” and “Stalker”, which I had never seen. Compared with movies I had watched 15+ years ago like those of Tsai Ming-Lian and Hou Hsiao-Hsien, or like “3-iron”, “Solaris” was like a Michael Bay movie full of explosions and car chases, but I still had a really hard time getting into it. I ended up watching it over five or six sittings, across a couple of weeks (the lockdown actually ended before I was done watching it). I still haven’t seen “Stalker”. I suppose that twelve years of smartphone usage accounts for the difference in attention span.</p></div>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">The other day Dana and I finished watching The Queen’s Gambit, Netflix’s fictional saga of an orphaned girl in the 1960’s, Beth Harmon, who breaks into competitive chess and destroys one opponent after the next in her quest to become the world champion, while confronting her inner demons and addictions.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The other day Dana and I finished watching <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em>, Netflix’s fictional saga of an orphaned girl in the 1960’s, Beth Harmon, who breaks into competitive chess and destroys one opponent after the next in her quest to become the world champion, while confronting her inner demons and addictions.</p>



<p>The show is every bit as astoundingly good as everyone says it is, and I might be able to articulate why.  It’s because, perhaps surprisingly given the description, this is a story where <em>chess actually matters</em>—and indeed, the fact that chess matters so deeply to Beth and most of the other characters is central to the narrative.  (As in two pivotal scenes where Beth has sex with a male player, and then either she or he goes right back to working on chess.)</p>



<p>I’ve watched a lot of TV shows and movies, supposedly about scientists, where the science was just an interchangeable backdrop to what the writers clearly regarded as a more important story.  (As one random example, the drama <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)">NUMB3RS</a>, supposedly about an FBI mathematician, where “math” could’ve been swapped out for “mystical crime-fighting intuition” with barely any change.)</p>



<p>It’s true that a fictional work about scientists shouldn’t try to be a science documentary, just like <em>Queen’s Gambit</em> doesn’t try to be a chess documentary.  But if you’re telling a story about characters who are obsessed with topic X, then you need to <em>make their obsession plausible</em>, make the entire story hinge on it, and even make the audience vicariously feel the same obsession.</p>



<p>This is precisely what <em>Queen’s Gambit</em> does for chess.  It’s a chess drama where the characters are <em>constantly</em> talking about chess, thinking about chess, and playing chess—and that actually succeeds in making that riveting.  (Even if most of the audience can’t follow what’s happening on the board, it turns out that it doesn’t matter, since you can simply convey the drama through the characters’ faces and the reactions of those around them.)</p>



<p>Granted, a few aspects of competitive chess in the series stood out as jarringly unrealistic even to a novice like me: for example, the almost complete lack of draws.  But as for the board positions—well, apparently Kasparov was a consultant, and he helped meticulously design each one to reflect the characters’ skill levels and what was happening in the plot.</p>



<p>While the premise sounds like a feminist wish-fulfillment fantasy—orphan girl faces hundreds of intimidating white men in the sexist 1960s, orphan girl beats them all at their own game with style and aplomb—this is not at all a MeToo story, or a story about male crudity or predation.  It’s after bigger fish than that.  The series, you might say, conforms to all the external requirements of modern woke ideology, yet the actual plot subverts the tenets of that ideology, or maybe just ignores them, in its pursuit of more timeless themes.</p>



<p>At least once Beth Harmon enters the professional chess world, the central challenges she needs to overcome are internal and mental—just like they’re supposed to be in chess.  It’s not the Man or the Patriarchy or any other external power (besides, of course, skilled opponents) holding her down.  Again and again, the top male players are portrayed not as sexist brutes but as gracious, deferential, and even awestruck by Beth’s genius after she’s humiliated them on the chessboard.  And much of the story is about how those vanquished opponents then turn around and try to help Beth, and about how she needs to learn to accept their help in order to evolve as a player and a human being.</p>



<p>There’s also that, after defeating male player after male player, Beth sleeps with them, or at least wants to.  I confess that, as a teenager, I would’ve found that unlikely and astonishing.  I would’ve said: obviously, the only guys who’d even have a <em>chance</em> to prove themselves worthy of the affection of such a brilliant and unique woman would be those who could beat her at chess.  Anyone else would just be dirt between her toes.  In the series, though, each male player propositions Beth only <em>after</em> she’s soundly annihilated him.  And she’s never once shown refusing.</p>



<p>Obviously, I’m no Beth Harmon; I’ll never be close in my field to what she is in hers.  Equally obviously, I grew up in a loving family, not an orphanage.  Still, I was what some people would call a “child prodigy,” what with the finishing my PhD at 22 and whatnot, so naturally that colored my reaction to the show.</p>



<p>There’s a pattern that goes like this: you’re obsessively interested, from your first childhood exposure, in something that most people aren’t.  Once you learn what the something is, it’s evident to you that your life’s vocation couldn’t possibly be anything else, unless some external force prevents you.  Alas, in order to pursue the something, you first need to get past bullies and bureaucrats, who dismiss you as a nobody, put barriers in your way, despise whatever you represent to them.  After a few years, though, the bullies can no longer stop you: you’re finally among peers or superiors in your chosen field, regularly chatting with them on college campuses or at conferences in swanky hotels, and the main limiting factor is just the one between your ears. </p>



<p>You feel intense rivalries with your new colleagues, of course, you desperately want to excel them, but the fact that they’re all on the same obsessive quest as you means you can never actually hate them, as you did the bureaucrats or the bullies.  There’s too much of you in your competitors, and of them in you.</p>



<p>As you pursue your calling, you feel yourself torn in the following way.  On the one hand, you feel close to a moral obligation to humanity not to throw away whatever “gift” you were “given” (what loaded terms), to take the calling as far as it will go.  On the other hand, you also want the same things other people want, like friendship, validation, and of course sex.</p>



<p>In such a case, two paths naturally beckon.  The first is that of asceticism: making a virtue of eschewing all temporal attachments, romance or even friendship, in order to devote yourself entirely to the calling.  The second is that of renouncing the calling, pretending it never existed, in order to fit in and have a normal life.  Your fundamental challenge is to figure out a third path, to plug yourself into a community where the relentless pursuit of the unusual vocation and the friendship and the sex can all complement each other rather than being at odds.</p>



<p>It would be an understatement to say that I have some familiarity with this narrative arc.</p>



<p>I’m aware, of course, of the irony, that I can identify with so many contours of Beth Harmon’s journey—I, Scott Aaronson, who half the Internet denounced six years ago as a misogynist monster who denies the personhood and interiority of women.  In that life-alteringly cruel slur, there was a microscopic grain of truth, and it’s this: I’m not talented at imagining myself into the situations of people different from me.  It’s never been my strong suit.  I might <em>like</em> and <em>admire</em> people different from me, I might sympathize with their struggles and wish them every happiness, but I still don’t know what they’re thinking until they tell me.  And even then, I don’t fully understand it.</p>



<p>As one small but illustrative example, I have no intuitive understanding—zero—of what it’s like to be romantically attracted to men, or what any man could do or say or look like that could possibly be attractive to women.  If you have such an understanding, then imagine yourself sighted and me blind.  Intellectually, I might know that confidence or height or deep brown eyes or brooding artistry are supposed to be attractive in human males, but only because I’m told.  As far as my intuition is concerned, pretty much all men are equally hairy, smelly, and gross, a large fraction of women are alluring and beautiful and angelic, and both of those are just objective features of reality that no one could possibly see otherwise.</p>



<p>Thus, whenever I read or watch fiction starring a female protagonist who dates men, it’s very easy for me to imagine that protagonist judging me, enumerating my faults, and rejecting me, and very hard for me to do what I’m supposed to do, which is to <em>put myself into her shoes</em>.  I could watch a thousand female protagonists kiss a thousand guys onscreen, or wake up in bed next to them, and the thousandth-and-first time I’d still be equally mystified about what she saw in such a sweaty oaf and why she didn’t run from him screaming, and I’d snap out of vicariously identifying with her.  (Understanding gay men of course presents similar difficulties; understanding lesbians is comparatively easy.)</p>



<p>It’s possible to overcome this, but it takes an extraordinary female protagonist, brought to life by an extraordinary writer.  Off the top of my head, I can think of only a few.  There were Renee Feuer and Eva Mueller, the cerebral protagonists of Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Body-Problem-Contemporary-American-Fiction/dp/0140172459"><em>The Mind-Body Problem</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Passion-Woman-Vintage-Contemporaries/dp/0679728236"><em>The Late Summer Passion of a Woman of Mind</em></a>.  Maybe Ellie Arroway from Carl Sagan’s <em>Contact</em>.  And then there’s Beth Harmon.  With characters like these, I can briefly enter a space where their crushes on men seem no weirder or more inexplicable to me than my own teenage crushes … just, you know, inverted.  Sex is in any case secondary to the character’s primary urge to discover timeless truths, an urge that I fully understand because I’ve shared it.</p>



<p>Granted, the timeless truths of chess, an arbitrary and invented game, are less profound than those of quantum gravity or the P vs. NP problem, but the psychology is much the same, and <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em> does a good job of showing that.  To understand the characters of this series is to understand why they could be happier to lose an interesting game than to win a boring one.  And I could appreciate that, even if I was by no means the strongest player at my elementary school’s chess club, and the handicap with which I can beat my 7-year-old daughter is steadily decreasing.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-187 |  If VNP is hard, then so are equations for it | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	C Ramya, 

	Ramprasad Saptharishi, 

	Anamay Tengse</title>
    <summary>Assuming that the Permanent polynomial requires algebraic circuits of exponential size, we show that the class VNP *does not* have efficiently computable equations. In other words, any nonzero polynomial that vanishes on the coefficient vectors of all polynomials in the class VNP requires algebraic circuits of super-polynomial size.

In a recent work of Chatterjee and the authors (FOCS 2020), it was shown that the subclasses of VP and VNP consisting of polynomials with bounded integer coefficients *do*  have equations with small algebraic circuits. Their work left open the possibility that these results could perhaps be extended to all of VP or VNP. The results in this paper show that assuming the hardness of Permanent, at least for VNP, allowing polynomials with large coefficients does indeed incur a significant blow up in the circuit complexity of equations.</summary>

    <title>TR20-186 |  Shrinkage of Decision Lists and DNF Formulas | 

	Benjamin Rossman</title>
    <summary>We establish nearly tight bounds on the expected shrinkage of decision lists and DNF formulas under the $p$-random restriction $\mathbf R_p$ for all values of $p \in [0,1]$. For a function $f$ with domain $\{0,1\}^n$, let $\mathrm{DL}(f)$ denote the minimum size of a decision list that computes $f$. We show that
\[
  \mathbb E[\ \mathrm{DL}(f|\mathbf R_p)\ ] \le 
  \mathrm{DL}(f)^{\log_{2/(1-p)}(\frac{1+p}{1-p})}.
\]
For example, this bound is $\sqrt{\mathrm{DL}(f)}$ when $p = \sqrt{5}-2 \approx 0.24$. For Boolean functions $f$, we obtain the same shrinkage bound with respect to DNF formula size plus $1$ (i.e.,\ replacing $\mathrm{DL}(\cdot)$ with $\mathrm{DNF}(\cdot)+1$ on both sides of the inequality).</summary>

    <title>TR20-185 |  Quantum learning algorithms imply circuit lower bounds | 

	Tom Gur, 

	Alex Grilo, 

	Igor Oliveira, 

	Srinivasan Arunachalam, 

	Aarthi Sundaram</title>
    <summary>We establish the first general connection between the design of quantum algorithms and  circuit lower bounds. Specifically, let $\mathrm{C}$ be a class of polynomial-size concepts, and suppose that $\mathrm{C}$ can be PAC-learned with membership queries under the uniform distribution with error $1/2 - \gamma$ by a time $T$ quantum algorithm. We prove that if $\gamma^2 \cdot T \ll 2^n/n$, then $\mathrm{BQE} \not\subseteq \mathrm{C}$, where $\mathrm{BQE} = \mathrm{BQTIME}[2^{O(n)}]$ is an exponential-time analogue of $\mathrm{BQP}$. This result is optimal in both $\gamma$ and $T$, since it is not hard to learn any class $\mathcal{C}$ of functions in (classical) time $T = 2^n$  (with no error), or in quantum time $T = \mathrm{poly}(n)$ with error at most $1/2 - \Omega(2^{-n/2})$ via Fourier sampling. In other words, even a marginal improvement on these generic learning algorithms would lead to major consequences in complexity theory. 

Our proof builds on several works in learning theory, pseudorandomness, and computational complexity, and crucially, on a connection between non-trivial classical learning algorithms and circuit lower bounds established by Oliveira and Santhanam (CCC 2017). Extending their approach to quantum learning algorithms turns out to create significant challenges. To achieve that, we show among other results how pseudorandom generators imply learning-to-lower-bound connections in a generic fashion, construct the first conditional pseudorandom generator secure against uniform quantum computations, and extend the local list-decoding algorithm of Impagliazzo, Jaiswal, Kabanets and Wigderson (SICOMP 2010) to quantum circuits via a delicate analysis. We believe that these contributions are of independent interest and might find other applications.</summary>

    <title>Quarterly Th. Wksp `at' Northwestern, and thoughts inspired by it</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> On the <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/events/">Northwestern CS Theory Group</a> there is a set of Quarterly Theory Workshops. There is one coming up on Dec 17-18, 2020, called the <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/events/2020-junior-theorists-workshop/">Junior Theorists Workshop</a>. Take a look and possibly go to it! Because it is virtual you do not need to plan that much ahead- though they do want you to register. </p><p>1) I notice broadly two kinds of meetings:</p><p><br/>Based on WHO will be there, e.g., JUNIOR theorists</p><p><br/>Based on TOPIC: e.g., there was a meeting on ALGORITHMIC FAIRNESS.</p><p><br/></p><p>2) These types of meetings (NY Theory day is another) are, I believe, intended to be for people that are local (more on that later). But because the meeting will be on zoom, geography is no longer an impediment for either the attendees or the speakers. </p><p><br/></p><p>3) Before covid there was some talk of  `Gee, flying off to STOC, FOCS, other conferences is bad for the environment, what to do about that?'. With that in mind, here is a history which might not be true but makes a point:</p><p><i>In an earlier era FOCS/STOC were attended by mostly Americans and ICALP was attended by mostly Europeans.  I do not think there was any policy of discrimination on admissions, but it was more like Americans just did not submit to ICALP as much, nor Europeans  to FOCS/STOC. But over time when these conferences got to be considered prestigious people would routinely submit to either one depending on timing. If your paper was done in time for Conf X deadline, that's where you submit. If it does not get in then  you edit it some, perhaps add some new results, and submit to Conf Y. </i></p><p>So one solution to the air-travel-global-Warming   problem of conferences is go back to a time (which may not have ever existed) where it was just understood that you go to LOCAL conferences. Math does this, but it helps that their regional conferences are not  prestigious. But even they don't quite get it right: the joint AMS-MAA meeting alternates coasts. One year when it was in California they invited me to be a guest speaker (on the Muffin Problem). The following year it was in Baltimore. Note that I live in Maryland, so perhaps they should have waited a year. </p><p>How to encourage people to submit locally. I DO NOT want to have a rule or a diff standard for those who don't. As such... I have no idea. </p><p><br/></p><p>4)  Are virtual conferences a good idea? This is a hot topic now so I won't dwell on it, just to say that there is still something about being there IN PERSON, meeting people, serendipity that makes live confs better.</p><p>However, to have it at the same time be virtual and recorded will be VERY HELPFL to those who can't afford to go for whatever reason. </p><p>And of course there is the whole issue of if we should have prestigious conferences, which I won't get into now. Or later. That's more Lance's issue (he thinks no). </p><p><br/></p></div>

<p>He is a longtime faculty member in computer science at the University of Buffalo, a longtime fan of the Buffalo NFL football team, and a longtime international master of chess. He is also one of the world experts on detecting cheating at chess. Players cheat by making their moves based on computer programs instead of relying on their brains. The key issue is: computer programs play chess better than any human. </p>
<p>
Today I thought we might send Ken a tip-of-the-hat for being in the Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>
That is he is featured in a WSJ article called <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-real-queens-gambit-catching-chess-cheaters-11607439491">Queen’s Gambit</a> about chess cheating. </p>

<p>
This is not his first mention in the WSJ—see <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-tech-chess-cheaters-charge-ahead-1444404660">here</a>. See <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2020/12/010.html">this</a> for additional comments by Cory Nealon, who says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The game of chess is no stranger to cheating. But since the pandemic hit and tournaments have moved online, the services of chess detectives have never been more in demand. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ken is perhaps the world’s most feared chess detective. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Beyond Chess </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Chess is important, but it is a game. Yet chess cheating may be an early warning of things to come. Might robotic methods in other areas soon start to dominate humans? Might chess be one of first areas to be lost to robots?</p>
<p>
A 1970 movie that comes to mind is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus:_The_Forbin_Project">The Forbin Project</a>. The plot is what happens when a computer system, Colossus, takes over the world. Its creator is Dr. Forbin, has the following exchange with it at the end of the movie: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Colossus later tells Forbin that the world, now freed from war, will create a new human millennium that will raise mankind to new heights, but only under its absolute rule. Colossus informs Forbin that “freedom is an illusion” and that “in time you will come to regard me not only with respect and awe, but with love”. Forbin responds, “Never!” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I think there is a reason to worry about computers like Colossus wiping us out. Perhaps not taking absolute control, but nevertheless making us second class citizens. I wonder if the following areas could be potential ones where we lose out to computers:</p>
<p>

<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Play calling in the NFL?</i> I made this one up, but I do wonder if using all the statistics available programs could do a better job than players and coaches. They probably could already do better than the Jets defensive coach, who was recently <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/report-jets-fire-defensive-coordinator-gregg-williams-after-legendarily-awful-loss-to-raiders-161424493.html">fired</a>. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Solving Open Math Problems?</i> We recently talked about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/surely-you-are-joking/#comment-114892">Lean</a> the proof checking system. But what if Lean could start to conjecture, to suggest directions, and give a proof outline? This would be, I believe, much more disruptive than the ability to check proofs.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are some areas that you think could be next? That could be taken over by robots?<br/>
Moreover, as more areas are dominated by robots, we will need more Ken’s to stop cheaters. </p>
<p>
Thanks again Ken. </p>

<h2>Problem 2: Lionel Levine’s infamous hat problem.</h2>
<h3>Warm up problem:</h3>
<p><img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> people are assigned at random white/black hats, Each person sees the hats of the other and need to guess the color of her own hat. They can decide in advance on the guessing strategy and their aim is maximize the probability that they all guessed correctly. How well they can do?</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a strategy with 50% chance of winning. They all need to assume that there are overall an even number of black hats.</p>
<h3>The real infamous hat problem by Lionel Levine</h3>
<p>Now every player has an infinite tower of hats on her head and, again, the hats are taken to be white or black at random. Again each players see all the hats of other players and again the players can plan in advance a strategy for success, This time each player has to point to one of the hats on her head and  the players WIN if all these hats are black.</p>
<p>Again, based on the hats of all others the k-th player says something like “I think the 7th hat on my head is black” or “I think the 3rd hat on my head is black” and the players win if all these statement are correct.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> As the number of players grows the probability for success tends to zero.</p>
<p>Let <img alt="p_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="p_k"/> be the success probability for <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/> players. (Remark: instead of having infinite number of hats we can assume that <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/> is fixed, each player has <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> hats, and then let <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> goes to infinity.</p>
<p>Ehud explained why <img alt="1/3 \le p_2 \le 3/8" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F3+%5Cle+p_2+%5Cle+3%2F8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="1/3 \le p_2 \le 3/8"/>. He challenged the audience to prove that <img alt="p_3 &lt; p_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_3+%3C+p_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="p_3 &lt; p_2"/> which is unknown.</p>
<p>The problem was presented in <a href="https://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/2011/04/how-many-hats-can-fit-on-your-head/">this 2011 post</a>  on <a href="https://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/" title="Tanya Khovanova's Math Blog: Mathematics, applications of mathematics to life in general, and my life as a mathematician.">Tanya Khovanova’s Math Blog.</a> Tanya also offered a new variant of her own.  It was also <a href="https://www.brand.site.co.il/riddles/201607q.html">July 2016 riddle</a> further discussed <a href="https://www.brand.site.co.il/riddles/201607a.html">here</a> on the math riddles site “<a href="https://www.brand.site.co.il/riddles/">Using your head is permitted</a>”</p>

<p>Bocconi University is looking for two Tenure-Track Assistant Professors in Computer Science, for positions starting in Fall 2021. This is in the context of a build-up toward a new department focused on Computer Science, which is part of the University’s strategic plan, and which is expected to be launched by Fall 2022.</p>



<p>Bocconi is Italy’s premiere private University, located in Milan. It is well known for its excellence in Economics and Management, and a few years ago it has begun a push into the hard sciences and engineering. Currently it offers a <em>Bachelor on Economics, Management and Computer Science</em>, a <em>Bachelor on Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence</em>, and a <em>Master’s in Data Science and Analytics</em>. There is a PhD program in Statistics and Computer Science. Additional programs related to computing are being planned.</p>



<p>The University negotiates salaries on an individual basis, and is able to put together very competitive offer packages. Scholars moving to Milan from outside Italy gain, in addition, a 6+ year tax break (90% of the salary is exempt from income tax). The University provides relocation benefits and employs full time staff to assist non-Italian-speaking faculty. Students are admitted on the basis of a competitive admission exam. A large fraction of them are foreigners, and the general academic level is fairly high.</p>



<p>A special note for Italians on how the position relates to positions in public Universities (in Italian because this is only a local concern): la posizione di “assistant professor” è simile a quella di RTDA, ma è un contratto di diritto privato. Dopo una valutazione intermedia, si passa ad una posizione simile a RTDB, ma sempre con un contratto distinto di diritto privato, e dopo una tenure review si viene promossi ad associati. I ruoli di associati ed ordinari sono inquadrati nel sistema nazionale e parificati (a parte la possibilità di una integrazione salariale) ai corrispettivi ruoli nell’università pubblica. Anche se non sono io la persona più qualificata per discutere questi aspetti, rispondo volentieri a qualunque domanda.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-184 |  Proof complexity of natural formulas via communication arguments | 

	Dmitry Itsykson, 

	Artur Riazanov</title>
    <summary>A canonical communication problem ${\rm Search}(\phi)$ is defined for every unsatisfiable CNF $\phi$: an assignment to the variables of $\phi$ is distributed among the communicating parties, they are to find a clause of $\phi$ falsified by this assignment. Lower bounds on the randomized $k$-party communication complexity of ${\rm Search}(\phi)$ in the number-on-forehead (NOF) model imply tree-size lower bounds, rank lower bounds, and size-space tradeoffs for the formula $\phi$ in the semantic proof system ${\rm T}^{cc}(k,c)$ that operates with proof lines that can be computed by $k$-party randomized communication protocol using at most $c$ bits of communication [Göös, Pitassi, 2014]. All known lower bounds on ${\rm Search}(\phi)$ (e.g. [Beame, Pitassi, Segerlind, 2007; Göös, Pitassi, 2014; Impagliazzo, Pitassi, Urquhart, 1994]) are realized on ad-hoc formulas $\phi$ (i.e. they were introduced specifically for these lower bounds). We introduce a new communication complexity approach that allows establishing proof complexity lower bounds for natural formulas.
  
  First, we demonstrate our approach for two-party communication and apply it to the proof system ${\rm Res}(\oplus)$ that operates with disjunctions of linear equalities over $\mathbb{F}_2$ [Itsykson, Sokolov, 2014]. Let a formula ${\rm PMP}_G$ encode that a graph $G$ has a perfect matching. 
    If $G$ has an odd number of vertices, then ${\rm PMP}_{G}$ has a tree-like ${\rm Res}(\oplus)$-refutation of a polynomial-size [Itsykson, Sokolov, 2014]. It was unknown whether this is the case for graphs with an even number of vertices. Using our approach we resolve this question and show a lower bound $2^{\Omega(n)}$ on size of tree-like ${\rm Res}(\oplus)$-refutations of ${\rm PMP}_{K_{n+2,n}}$.
  
  Then we apply our approach for $k$-party communication complexity in the NOF model and obtain a $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{k} 2^{n/2k - 3k/2}\right)$ lower bound on the randomized $k$-party communication complexity of ${\rm Search}({\rm BPHP}^{M}_{2^n})$ w.r.t. to some natural partition of the variables, where ${\rm BPHP}^{M}_{2^n}$ is the bit pigeonhole principle and $M=2^n+2^{n(1-1/k)}$. 
  In particular, our result implies that the bit pigeonhole requires exponential tree-like ${\rm Th}(k)$ proofs, where ${\rm Th}(k)$ is the semantic proof system operating with polynomial inequalities of degree at most $k$ and $k= O(\log^{1-\epsilon} n)$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$.
 We also show that ${\rm BPHP}^{2^n+1}_{2^n}$ superpolynomially separates tree-like ${\rm Th}(\log^{1-\epsilon} m)$ from tree-like ${\rm Th}(\log m)$, where $m$ is the number of variables in the refuted formula.</summary>

<p>Kevin Buzzard is Professor of Pure Mathematics at Imperial College London. Wikipedia says that he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Buzzard">specialises</a> in algebraic number theory, rather than “specializes.” Is this because he was born in Britain, works in Britain, both, or could it be neither?</p>
<p>This month, he has an <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202011/rnoti-p1791.pdf">article</a> in the <em>AMS Notices</em> that highlights the system <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/about/"><img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/></a>. We thought we’d discuss <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> and its potential to change math—or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbZCECvoaTA">maths</a>—as we know it.</p>
<p>For starters we should say that <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Lean is an open source theorem prover and programming language being developed at Microsoft Research. Lean aims to bridge the gap between interactive and automated theorem proving, by situating automated tools and methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>This wording should perk up the ear of us complexity theorists. We know that polynomial-size interactive proofs have the power of <img alt="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPSPACE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}"/> for one prover, <img alt="{\mathsf{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NEXP}}"/> for two, and the Halting Problem for two quantum provers, all of which are believed bigger than <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> as for non-interactive proofs. We believe that our concrete capabilities are shaped by this abstract lay-of-the-land, though this is a meta-scientific assertion that we could never try to prove. What Buzzard’s article and <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> are on about is the scientific state of what we do try to prove, or think we have proved.</p>
<h2>Aftermath as We Know It</h2>
<p>Buzzard spoke early this year at the second annual “Lean Together” segment of the Formal Methods in Mathematics <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/index.html">conference</a> at CMU.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/slides/fomm_buzzard.pdf">talk</a> was not so much about details of <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> but about the fact of errors and specter of gaps in published mathematics. While a student of Richard Taylor, he had a front-row seat to a major instance. As he relates on a slide marked <b>Gaps</b> in big letters:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In 1993, Andrew Wiles announced a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. There was a gap in the proof.</li>
<li>In 1994, Wiles and Taylor fixed the gap, the papers were published, and our community accepted the proof.</li>
<li>In 1995, I pointed out to Taylor that the proof used work of Gross which was known to be incomplete.<br/>
<img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\dots}"/><br/>
Taylor told me it was OK, because he knew another argument which avoided Gross’s work completely.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>He also highlights the current unfinished state of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups">classification</a> theorem. The process of writing its proof may outlive all of the first generation of provers. We at GLL have accepted it almost all of our working lives. The “after math” can be harder than the initial publication even in the traditional process, let alone the totally free dissemination we have today.</p>
<p>Buzzard points out that some long proofs have now been written in <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> or related systems. These include the famous Feit-Thompson odd order theorem in <a href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a>, and the 2017 Ellenberg-Gijswijt proof of the cap set conjecture. This shows that complex arguments can be written in systems like <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> and others. He maintains his own <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/what-is-the-xena-project/">blog</a>, “The Xena Project,” on practical and educational uses of <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> and similar software.</p>
<h2>Really Proved?</h2>
<p>But there is a problem with <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> and all the other similar systems.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Their correct proofs may be incorrect. </em></p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> is a large software system and may have bugs. This is of course a major concern, but perhaps one that can be handled. Perhaps not.</p>
<p>I thought about this issue years ago when people argued for verification of operating systems to prove that they had no errors. They wanted to argue that software systems could be error-free only by making a formal proof that they were correct. Over forty years ago, Rich DeMillo and Alan Perlis and I wrote a <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">paper</a> on this issue. Our paper starts with</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Many people have argued that computer programming should strive to become more like mathematics. Maybe so, but not in the way they seem to think. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>We go on to argue against formal verification as the answer to correctness. It is interesting to see that now the argument is flipped: Should mathematics become more like programming?</p>
<p>Ken opines out that a bug in <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> would probably be more catchable because it would likely replicate. Mistakes in proofs ought by nature to be more recognizable than telling whether a <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/tactics.html">tactic</a> to try to build a proof is likely to succeed.</p>

<h2>Leaning Into <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/></h2>
<p>The fundamental idea of <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> is to create a language that does make proofs more like programming. The key is that a proof written in <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> can be checked automatically. This is like saying that a program in Python can be executed.</p>
<p>The project that Buzzard and others are interested in is several-fold. One is that <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> can be a teaching tool. Another is it can help us ensure that the proofs we write down are correct.</p>
<p>The use of <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> is akin to LaTeX. Most of us now write our proofs in LaTeX or some similar typesetting language. We love and hate the issues involved in getting the LaTeX to compile and to look good. Buzzard argues that adding the new ability to be sure that one’s proof is solid is a great leap. LaTeX lets us be sure the proof looks good, while <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> allows us to be sure it is correct.</p>
<p>We have generally taken a reserved attitude toward formal methods on this blog—or maybe <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/surely-you-are-joking/">not</a> so reserved. We keep our reservations expressed above. But what may help <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> overcome them is its emphasis on interaction—on being an assistant. Maybe writing a proof in <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> won’t be like taking castor oil proverbially used to be—it might be more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite">Marmite</a>.</p>
<h2>Open Problems</h2>
<p>Two final thoughts. For the main one: Proofs are not as important as discoveries. Can we use <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> to suggest ideas, open problems, approaches, and more? The gene folding program we discussed recently does not claim to prove its fold is correct. But it seems useful. If <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> could help make guesses or provided intuition that would be valuable. Perhaps more valuable than assuring that a long proof is correct.</p>
<p>Another possible idea: How about we insist that claimed proofs of P<img alt="{=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{=}"/>NP or other famous conjectures must be presented using <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/>. The “claimed” proofs are all relatively short, so it would not be too hard for the authors of these results to write them out in the <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> system. They already LaTeX them, so why not? This would have a double benefit: The false claims that are made about famous problems might decrease; and the chance that a correct proof would not be overlooked might increase. The cost would be the time to write up the<img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> proof.</p>
<p>Buzzard is a colorful (or colourful?) character, and may also be gaining a reputation for being well ahead of the times. In 2017 he gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQPb7DRMoZY&amp;list=LLuXRsVD2rJdPs_rstTQZeow&amp;index=9">talk</a> on P<img alt="{=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{=}"/>NP for the Royal Institution, but what we note in the video is how he was presciently dressed for Zoom.</p>

<p>This is our second post on the open problem session of the HUJI combinatorics seminar. <a href="https://huji.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1ac330a2-d6b7-4b86-9bac-ac7500d14205">The video of the session is here</a>. Today’s problem was presented by <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ckeller/">Chaya Keller</a>.</p>
<h2>The Krasnoselskii number</h2>
<p>One of the best-known applications of Helly’s theorem (that is, actually, equivalent to Helly’s theorem, see [Bo]) is the following theorem, due to Krasnoselskii [K]:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1 (Krasnoselskii):</strong> Let <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> be an infinite compact set in <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathbb{R}^d}"/>. If every <img alt="{d+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%2B1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{d+1}"/> points of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> are visible from a common point, then <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> is starshaped, that is there exists some <img alt="{x_0 \in S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0+%5Cin+S%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x_0 \in S}"/> that sees all points in <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/>.</p>
<p>Krasnoselskii’s theorem does not hold for non-compact sets. However, all known counter-examples satisfy the weaker requirement of being finitely starlike, namely that any finite subset of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> is visible from a common point. This led Peterson [P] to ask the following:</p>
<p>Does there exist a Krasnoselskii number <img alt="{K(d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%28d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K(d)}"/> such that for any infinite set <img alt="{S \subset \mathbb{R}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS+%5Csubset+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S \subset \mathbb{R}^d}"/>, if every <img alt="{K(d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%28d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K(d)}"/> points of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> are visible from a single point, then <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> is finitely starlike?</p>
<p>Marilyn Breen obtained positive results for special cases of sets that satisfy additional topological conditions [Br1,Br2,Br3], e.g., Krasnoselskii number 3 for closed sets in the plane. On the other hand, she proved that if <img alt="{K(2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K(2)}"/> exists, then it must be larger than <img alt="{8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{8}"/>.</p>
<p>Recently, Micha Perles and me (Chaya Keller) proved that under no restriction on the set, the Krasnoselskii number does not exist. More precisely, we proved that for any <img alt="{k \geq 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%5Cgeq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k \geq 2}"/>, there exists a set <img alt="{S \subset \mathbb{R}^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS+%5Csubset+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S \subset \mathbb{R}^2}"/> such that any <img alt="{2k+3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2k%2B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2k+3}"/> points in <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> are visible from a common point, but there exist <img alt="{2k+4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2k%2B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2k+4}"/> points in <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> that are not visible from a common point. But this counter example is absolutely not constructive (since it is based on a transfinite induction), and the resulting set <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> admits no resonable topological structure.</p>
<p>This leads to the following two problems:</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Problem 1: Can you show constructively that the Krasnoselskii number does not exist?</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Problem 2: Can you find more natural topological conditions under which the Krasnoselskii number exists?</span></h3>
