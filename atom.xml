computational tasks from cloud structures to multiple devices close to the end
user. An example for this are embedded systems in autonomous cars that
communicate in order to coordinate their actions.
</p>
<p>Our model is a variant of the classical Page Migration Problem. More
formally, we consider a mobile server holding a data page. The server can move
in the Euclidean space (of arbitrary dimension). In every round, requests for
data items from the page pop up at arbitrary points in the space. The requests
are served, each at a cost of the distance from the requesting point and the
server, and the mobile server may move, at a cost $D$ times the distance
traveled for some constant $D$. We assume a maximum distance $m$ the server is
allowed to move per round.
</p>
<p>We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio independent
of the length of the input sequence in this setting. Hence we augment the
maximum movement distance of the online algorithms to $(1+\delta)$ times the
maximum distance of the offline solution. We provide a deterministic algorithm
which is simple to describe and works for multiple variants of our problem. The
algorithm achieves almost tight competitive ratios independent of the length of
the input sequence.
</p>
<p>Our Algorithm also achieves a constant competitive ratio without resource
augmentation in a variant where the distance between two consecutive requests
is restricted to a constant smaller than the limit for the server.

    <title>Predicative proof theory of PDL and basic applications</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Gordeev:Lev.html">Lev Gordeev</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05131">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Propositional dynamic logic (PDL) is presented in Sch\"{u}tte-style mode as
one-sided semiformal tree-like sequent calculus Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ with
standard cut rule and the omega-rule with principal formulas $\left[ P^{\ast
}\right] \!A$. The omega-rule-free derivations in Seq$_{\omega }^{\text{pdl}}$
are finite (trees) and sequents deducible by these finite derivations are valid
in PDL. Moreover the cut-elimination theorem for Seq$_{\omega}^{\text{pdl}}$ is
provable in Peano Arithmetic (PA)extended by transfinite induction up to
Veblen's ordinal $\varphi_\omega\left( 0\right) $. Hence (by the cutfree
subformula property) such predicative extension of PA proves that any given
$\left[ P^{\ast }\right] $-free sequent is valid in PDL iff it is deducible in
Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ by a finite cut- and omega-rule-free derivation,
while PDL-validity of arbitrary star-free sequents is decidable in polynomial
space. The former also implies a Herbrand-style conclusion that e.g. a given
formula $S=\left\langle P^{\ast }\right\rangle \!A\vee Z$ for star-free $A$ and
$Z\ $is valid in PDL iff there is a $k\geq 0$ and a cut- and omega-rule-free
derivation of sequent $A,\left\langle P\right\rangle
^{1}\!\!A,\cdots,\left\langle P\right\rangle ^{k}\!\!A,B$ where $\left\langle
P\right\rangle^{i}\!A$ is an abbreviation for $\underset{i\
times}{\underbrace{\left\langle P\right\rangle \cdots \left\langle
P\right\rangle }}A$. This eventually leads to PSPACE-decidability of
PDL-validity of $S$, provided that $P$ is atomic and $A$ is in a suitable
\emph{basic conjunctive normal form}. Furthermore we consider star-free
formulas $A$ in dual \emph{basic disjunctive normal form}, and corresponding
expansions $S=\left\langle P^{\ast }\right\rangle \!A\vee Z$ whose PDL-validity
problem is known to be EXPTIME-complete. We show that cutfree-derivability in
Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ (hence PDL-validity) of such $S$\ is equivalent to
plain validity of a suitable ``transparent'' quantified boolean formula
$\widehat{S}$. Hence EXPTIME = PSPACE holds true iff the validity problem for
any $\widehat{S}$ involved is solvable by a polynomial-space deterministic TM.
This may reduce the former problem to a more transparent complexity problem in
quantified boolean logic. The whole proof can be formalized in PA extended by
transfinite induction along $\varphi_\omega\left( 0\right)$ -- actually in the
corresponding primitive recursive weakening, $\mathbf{PRA}_{\varphi_{\omega
}\left( 0\right)}$.

perfectness for discrete gradient vector fields with respect to
(multi-parameter) persistent homology. As a natural generalization of usual
perfectness in Morse theory for homology, persistence-perfectness entails
having the least number of critical cells relevant for persistent homology. The
first result about a persistence-perfect gradient vector-field is that the
number of its critical cells yield inequalities bounding the Betti tables of
persistence modules, as a sort of Morse inequalities for multi-parameter
persistence. The second result is that, at least in low dimensions,
persistence-perfect gradient vector-fields not only exist but can be
constructed by an algorithm based on local homotopy expansions. These results
show a link between multi-parameter persistence and discrete Morse theory that
can be leveraged for a better understanding of the former.

represent some logistic networks. The goal is to deliver all the delivery
points in the network. The network exists in a mostly stable environment,
except for a few edges known to be non-stable. The weight of each of these
non-stable edges may change at any time (bascule or lift bridge, elevator,
traffic congestion...). All other edges have stable weights that never change.
This problem can be now considered as a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem on
a dynamic graph. We propose an efficient polynomial algorithm that computes in
advance alternative MSTs for all possible configurations. No additional
computation is then needed after any change in the problem because the MSTs are
already known in all cases. We use these results to compute critical values for
the non-stable weights and to pre-compute best paths. When the non-stable
weights change, the appropriate MST may then directly and immediately be used
without any recomputation.

    <title>The Complexity of Subtree Intersection Representation of Chordal Graphs and Linear Time Chordal Graph Generation</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1554940800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Tƒ±naz Ekim, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Shalom:Mordechai.html">Mordechai Shalom</a>, Oylum ≈ûeker <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04916">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>It is known that any chordal graph on $n$ vertices can be represented as the
intersection of $n$ subtrees in a tree on $n$ nodes. This fact is recently used
in [2] to generate random chordal graphs on $n$ vertices by generating $n$
subtrees of a tree on $n$ nodes. It follows that the space (and thus time)
complexity of such an algorithm is at least the sum of the sizes of the
generated subtrees assuming that a tree is given by a set of nodes. In [2],
this complexity was mistakenly claimed to be linear in the number $m$ of edges
of the generated chordal graph. This error is corrected in [3] where the space
complexity is shown to be $\Omega(m n^{1/4})$. The exact complexity of the
algorithm is left as an open question.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that the sum of the sizes of $n$ subtrees in a tree on
$n$ nodes is $\Theta(m\sqrt{n})$. We also show that we can confine ourselves to
contraction-minimal subtree intersection representations since they are
sufficient to generate every chordal graph. Furthermore, the sum of the sizes
of the subtrees in such a representation is at most $2m+n$. We use this result
to derive the first linear time random chordal graph generator. Based on
contraction-minimal representations, we also derive structural properties of
chordal graphs related to their connectivity. In addition to these theoretical
results, we conduct experiments to study the quality of the chordal graphs
generated by our algorithm and compare them to those in the literature. Our
experimental study indicates that the generated graphs do not have a restricted
structure and the sizes of maximal cliques are distributed fairly over the
range. Furthermore, our algorithm is simple to implement and produces graphs
with 10000 vertices and $4 . 10^7$ edges in less than one second on a laptop
computer.

    <title>Black-Box Complexity of the Binary Value Function</title>

theory of evolutionary computation as one of the extreme examples of linear
pseudo-Boolean functions. Its unbiased black-box complexity was previously
shown to be at most $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil + 2$, where $n$ is the problem
size. We augment it with an upper bound of $\log_2 n + 2.42141558 - o(1)$,
which is more precise for many values of $n$. We also present a lower bound of
$\log_2 n + 1.1186406 - o(1)$. Additionally, we prove that BinVal is an easiest
function among all unimodal pseudo-Boolean functions at least for unbiased
algorithms.

    <title>Bridging between 0/1 and Linear Programming via Random Walks</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1554940800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Brakensiek:Joshua.html">Joshua Brakensiek</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Guruswami:Venkatesan.html">Venkatesan Guruswami</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04860">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, an integer linear program with
$n$ Boolean-valued variables and $m$ equations cannot be solved in $c^n$ time
for any constant $c &lt; 2$. If the domain of the variables is relaxed to $[0,1]$,
the associated linear program can of course be solved in polynomial time. In
this work, we give a natural algorithmic bridging between these extremes of
$0$-$1$ and linear programming. Specifically, for any subset (finite union of
intervals) $E \subset [0,1]$ containing $\{0,1\}$, we give a random-walk based
algorithm with runtime $O_E((2-\text{measure}(E))^n\text{poly}(n,m))$ that
finds a solution in $E^n$ to any $n$-variable linear program with $m$
constraints that is feasible over $\{0,1\}^n$. Note that as $E$ expands from
$\{0,1\}$ to $[0,1]$, the runtime improves smoothly from $2^n$ to polynomial.
</p>
<p>Taking $E = [0,1/k) \cup (1-1/k,1]$ in our result yields as a corollary a
randomized $(2-2/k)^{n}\text{poly}(n)$ time algorithm for $k$-SAT. While our
approach has some high level resemblance to Sch\"{o}ning's beautiful algorithm,
our general algorithm is based on a more sophisticated random walk that
incorporates several new ingredients, such as a multiplicative potential to
measure progress, a judicious choice of starting distribution, and a time
varying distribution for the evolution of the random walk that is itself
computed via an LP at each step (a solution to which is guaranteed based on the
minimax theorem). Plugging the LP algorithm into our earlier polymorphic
framework yields fast exponential algorithms for any CSP (like $k$-SAT,
$1$-in-$3$-SAT, NAE $k$-SAT) that admit so-called `threshold partial
polymorphisms.'

cell-probe complexity of statistically $\mathit{oblivious}$
approximate-near-neighbor search ($\mathsf{ANN}$) over the $d$-dimensional
Hamming cube. For the natural setting of $d = \Theta(\log n)$, our result
implies an $\tilde{\Omega}(\lg^2 n)$ lower bound, which is a quadratic
improvement over the highest (non-oblivious) cell-probe lower bound for
$\mathsf{ANN}$. This is the first super-logarithmic $\mathit{unconditional}$
lower bound for $\mathsf{ANN}$ against general (non black-box) data structures.
We also show that any oblivious $\mathit{static}$ data structure for
decomposable search problems (like $\mathsf{ANN}$) can be obliviously dynamized
with $O(\log n)$ overhead in update and query time, strengthening a classic
result of Bentley and Saxe (Algorithmica, 1980).

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Vertex connectivity is a classic extensively-studied problem. Given an integer k, its goal is to decide if an <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="n"/>-node <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="m"/>-edge graph can be disconnected by removing <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> vertices. Although a <img alt="O(m)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(m)"/>-time algorithm was postulated since 1974 [Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman], and despite its sibling problem of edge connectivity being resolved over two decades ago [Karger STOC‚Äô96], so far no vertex connectivity algorithms are faster than <img alt="O(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(n^2)"/> time even for <img alt="k = 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+4&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k = 4"/> and <img alt="m = O(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%3D+O%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="m = O(n)"/>. In the simplest case where <img alt="m = O(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%3D+O%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="m = O(n)"/> and <img alt="k = O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+O%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k = O(1)"/>, the <img alt="O(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(n^2)"/> bound dates five decades back to [Kleitman IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory‚Äô69]. For the general case, the best bound is <img alt="\tilde{O}( \min{ kn^2, n^\omega + nk^\omega } )" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28+%5Cmin%7B+kn%5E2%2C+n%5E%5Comega+%2B+nk%5E%5Comega+%7D+%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{O}( \min{ kn^2, n^\omega + nk^\omega } )"/> [Henzinger, Rao, Gabow FOCS‚Äô96; Linial, Lov√°sz, Wigderson FOCS‚Äô86].</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present a randomized Monte Carlo algorithm with <img alt="\tilde{O}(m + k^3 n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28m+%2B+k%5E3+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{O}(m + k^3 n)"/> time. This algorithm proves the conjecture by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman when <img alt="k=O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3DO%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k=O(1)"/> up to a polylog factor, breaks the 50-year-old bound by Kleitman, is fastest for <img alt="4 &lt; k &lt; n^{0.456}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%3C+k+%3C+n%5E%7B0.456%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="4 &lt; k &lt; n^{0.456}"/>. The story is similar for the directed graphs where we obtain an algorithm running time at most <img alt="\tilde{O}(k^2 m)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28k%5E2+m%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{O}(k^2 m)"/>.</p>
<p>The key to our results is to avoid computing single-source connectivity, which was needed by all previous exact algorithms and is not known to admit <img alt="o(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="o(n^2)"/> time. Instead, we design the first local algorithm for computing vertex connectivity; without reading the whole graph, our algorithm can find a separator of size at most <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> or certify that there is no separator of size at most <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> ‚Äúnear‚Äù a given seed node.</p>
<p>This talk is based on joint works with Danupon Nanongkai and Sorrachai Yingchareonthawornchai.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>Barna Saha, Sofya Raskhodnikova and I are organizing the second annual TCS Women event at STOC‚Äô19. We had an event at STOC‚Äô18 and it went really well. We envision an exciting program for the TCS Women event at STOC 2019. The details about the program are forthcoming.¬† The new TCS Women website is here: <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__sigact.org_tcswomen_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=CVsmSCuxoCwFoG2gFr0tpYyUk9r_oVDDLqgpNw-QTrM&amp;m=yF6ryOV_72RkpZ0_dg--Elo-VEADbvub3IKRqkerKEs&amp;s=sU7cAYjUogjxkGH7PXLNYC26FKcl0oYAZvIQjwBIQgc&amp;e=" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sigact.org/tcswomen/</a>. There you can learn more about our initiative.</p>



<p>In addition to the event, we have secured generous funding (similar to last year) from the NSF and industrial partners such as Akamai, Amazon, Google and Microsoft for¬†<strong>travel grants</strong>¬†for women and underrepresented minority students and postdocs to attend STOC. These grants are separate from the STOC travel awards and you can apply to both.</p>



<p>The application deadline for the TCS Women travel scholarship is <strong>April 25th, 2019</strong>. The information on how to apply is available here¬†<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__sigact.org_tcswomen_tcs-2Dwomen-2Dtravel-2Dscholarship_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=CVsmSCuxoCwFoG2gFr0tpYyUk9r_oVDDLqgpNw-QTrM&amp;m=yF6ryOV_72RkpZ0_dg--Elo-VEADbvub3IKRqkerKEs&amp;s=8uERTRJZx4nz2kM7duDKIQl7pEyP1uP_TeaH-Qsu47U&amp;e=" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sigact.org/tcswomen/tcs-women-travel-scholarship/</a>. We hope to support as many women and underrepresented minority students and postdocs as possible all over the globe to come to STOC and FCRC. The participants will also have the opportunity to present their work at the STOC poster session.<br/>If you are aware of eligible students (not only PhD) who are interested in attending STOC, please encourage them to apply.</p>



<p>Best wishes,</p>

    <title>Polynomial Pass Lower Bounds for Graph Streaming Algorithms</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Assadi:Sepehr.html">Sepehr Assadi</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Chen:Yu.html">Yu Chen</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Khanna:Sanjeev.html">Sanjeev Khanna</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04720">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present new lower bounds that show that a polynomial number of passes are
necessary for solving some fundamental graph problems in the streaming model of
computation. For instance, we show that any streaming algorithm that finds a
weighted minimum $s$-$t$ cut in an $n$-vertex undirected graph requires
$n^{2-o(1)}$ space unless it makes $n^{\Omega(1)}$ passes over the stream.
</p>
<p>To prove our lower bounds, we introduce and analyze a new four-player
communication problem that we refer to as the hidden-pointer chasing problem.
This is a problem in spirit of the standard pointer chasing problem with the
key difference that the pointers in this problem are hidden to players and
finding each one of them requires solving another communication problem, namely
the set intersection problem. Our lower bounds for graph problems are then
obtained by reductions from the hidden-pointer chasing problem.
</p>
<p>Our hidden-pointer chasing problem appears flexible enough to find other
applications and is therefore interesting in its own right. To showcase this,
we further present an interesting application of this problem beyond streaming
algorithms. Using a reduction from hidden-pointer chasing, we prove that any
algorithm for submodular function minimization needs to make $n^{2-o(1)}$ value
queries to the function unless it has a polynomial degree of adaptivity.

complexity of the Definability Problem for open first-order formulas (i.e.,
quantifier free first-order formulas) with equality. Given a logic
$\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}$, the $\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}$-Definability Problem for
finite structures takes as input a finite structure $\mathbf{A}$ and a target
relation $T$ over the domain of $\mathbf{A}$, and determines whether there is a
formula of $\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}$ whose interpretation in $\mathbf{A}$
coincides with $T$. We show that the complexity of this problem for open
first-order formulas (open definability, for short) is coNP-complete. We also
investigate the parametric complexity of the problem, and prove that if the
size and the arity of the target relation $T$ are taken as parameters then open
definability is $\mathrm{coW}[1]$-complete for every vocabulary $\tau$ with at
least one, at least binary, relation.

    <title>Suffix Trees, DAWGs and CDAWGs for Forward and Backward Tries</title>

string, with a number of applications in bioinformatics, information retrieval,
data mining, etc. An edge-labeled rooted tree (trie) is a natural
generalization of a string. Breslauer [TCS 191(1-2): 131-144, 1998] proposed
the suffix tree for a backward trie, where the strings in the trie are read in
the leaf-to-root direction. In contrast to a backward trie, we call a usual
trie as a forward trie. Despite a few follow-up works after Breslauer's paper,
indexing forward/backward tries is not well understood yet. In this paper, we
show a full perspective on the sizes of indexing structures such as suffix
trees, DAWGs, and CDAWGs for forward and backward tries. In particular, we show
that the size of the DAWG for a forward trie with $n$ nodes is $\Omega(\sigma
n)$, where $\sigma$ is the number of distinct characters in the trie. This
becomes $\Omega(n^2)$ for a large alphabet. Still we show that there is a
compact $O(n)$-space representation of the DAWG for a forward trie over any
alphabet, and present an $O(n \log \sigma)$-time $O(n)$-space algorithm to
construct such a representation of the DAWG for a growing forward trie.

    <title>Testing isomorphism of circular-arc graphs -- Hsu's approach revisited</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Krawczyk:Tomasz.html">Tomasz Krawczyk</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04501">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Circular-arc graphs are intersection graphs of arcs on the circle. The aim of
our work is to present a polynomial time algorithm testing whether two
circular-arc graphs are isomorphic. To accomplish our task we construct
decomposition trees, which are the structures representing all normalized
intersection models of circular-arc graphs. Normalized models reflect the
neighbourhood relation in circular-arc graphs and can be seen as their
canonical representations; in particular, every intersection model can be
easily transformed into a normalized one.
</p>
<p>Our work adapts and appropriately extends the previous work on the similar
topic done by Hsu [\emph{SIAM J. Comput. 24(3), 411--439, (1995)}]. In his
work, Hsu developed decomposition trees representing all normalized models of
circular-arc graphs. However due to the counterexample given in [\emph{Discrete
Math. Theor. Comput. Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013}], his decomposition trees can
not be used by algorithms testing isomorphism of circular-arc graphs.

critical applications. Recently, collaborative or federated learning is a new
paradigm that enables multiple parties to jointly learn ML models on their
combined datasets. Yet, in most application domains, such as healthcare and
security analytics, privacy risks limit entities to individually learning local
models over the sensitive datasets they own. In this work, we present the first
formal study for privacy-preserving collaborative hierarchical clustering,
overall featuring scalable cryptographic protocols that allow two parties to
privately compute joint clusters on their combined sensitive datasets. First,
we provide a formal definition that balances accuracy and privacy, and we
present a provably secure protocol along with an optimized version for single
linkage clustering. Second, we explore the integration of our protocol with
existing approximation algorithms for hierarchical clustering, resulting in a
protocol that can efficiently scale to very large datasets. Finally, we provide
a prototype implementation and experimentally evaluate the feasibility and
efficiency of our approach on synthetic and real datasets, with encouraging
results. For example, for a dataset of one million records and 10 dimensions,
our optimized privacy-preserving approximation protocol requires 35 seconds for
end-to-end execution, just 896KB of communication, and achieves 97.09%

Given an integer
$k$, its goal is to decide if an $n$-node $m$-edge graph can be disconnected by
removing $k$ vertices.
</p>
<p>Although a linear-time algorithm was postulated since 1974 [Aho, Hopcroft and
Ullman], and despite its sibling problem of edge connectivity being resolved
over two decades ago [Karger STOC'96], so far no vertex connectivity algorithms
are faster than $O(n^2)$ time even for $k=4$ and $m=O(n)$. In the simplest case
where $m=O(n)$ and $k=O(1)$, the $O(n^2)$ bound dates five decades back to
[Kleitman IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory'69]. For general $k$ and $m$, the best
bound is $\tilde{O}(\min(kn^2, n^\omega+nk^\omega))$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a randomized Monte Carlo algorithm with
$\tilde{O}(m+k^{7/3}n^{4/3})$ time for any $k=O(\sqrt{n})$. This gives the {\em
first subquadratic time} bound for any $4\leq k \leq o(n^{2/7})$ and improves
all above classic bounds for all $k\le n^{0.44}$.
</p>
<p>We also present a new randomized Monte Carlo $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm that is strictly faster than the previous Henzinger's 2-approximation
algorithm [J. Algorithms'97] and all previous exact algorithms.
</p>
<p>The key to our results is to avoid computing single-source connectivity,
which was needed by all previous exact algorithms and is not known to admit
$o(n^2)$ time. Instead, we design the first {\em local algorithm} for computing
vertex connectivity; without reading the whole graph, our algorithm can find a
separator of size at most $k$ or certify that there is no separator of size at
most $k$ `near' a given seed node.

    <title>Discovering Bands from Graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1554854400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Tatti:Nikolaj.html">Nikolaj Tatti</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04403">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Discovering the underlying structure of a given graph is one of the
fundamental goals in graph mining. Given a graph, we can often order vertices
in a way that neighboring vertices have a higher probability of being connected
to each other. This implies that the edges form a band around the diagonal in
the adjacency matrix. Such structure may rise for example if the graph was
created over time: each vertex had an active time interval during which the
vertex was connected with other active vertices.
</p>
<p>The goal of this paper is to model this phenomenon. To this end, we formulate
an optimization problem: given a graph and an integer $K$, we want to order
graph vertices and partition the ordered adjacency matrix into $K$ bands such
that bands closer to the diagonal are more dense. We measure the goodness of a
segmentation using the log-likelihood of a log-linear model, a flexible family
of distributions containing many standard distributions. We divide the problem
into two subproblems: finding the order and finding the bands. We show that
discovering bands can be done in polynomial time with isotonic regression, and
we also introduce a heuristic iterative approach. For discovering the order we
use Fiedler order accompanied with a simple combinatorial refinement. We
demonstrate empirically that our heuristic works well in practice.

message-passing network sto compute its edge connectivity $\lambda$ exactly in
the CONGEST model, as long as there are no parallel edges. Our algorithm takes
$\tilde O(n^{1-1/353}D^{1/353}+n^{1-1/706})$ time to compute $\lambda$ and a
cut of cardinality $\lambda$ with high probability, where $n$ and $D$ are the
number of nodes and the diameter of the network, respectively, and $\tilde O$
hides polylogarithmic factors. This running time is sublinear in $n$ (i.e.
$\tilde O(n^{1-\epsilon})$) whenever $D$ is. Previous sublinear-time
distributed algorithms can solve this problem either (i) exactly only when
$\lambda=O(n^{1/8-\epsilon})$ [Thurimella PODC'95; Pritchard, Thurimella, ACM
Trans. Algorithms'11; Nanongkai, Su, DISC'14] or (ii) approximately [Ghaffari,
Kuhn, DISC'13; Nanongkai, Su, DISC'14].
</p>
<p>To achieve this we develop and combine several new techniques. First, we
design the first distributed algorithm that can compute a $k$-edge connectivity
certificate for any $k=O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ in time $\tilde O(\sqrt{nk}+D)$.
Second, we show that by combining the recent distributed expander decomposition
technique of [Chang, Pettie, Zhang, SODA'19] with techniques from the
sequential deterministic edge connectivity algorithm of [Kawarabayashi, Thorup,
STOC'15], we can decompose the network into a sublinear number of clusters with
small average diameter and without any mincut separating a cluster (except the
`trivial' ones). Finally, by extending the tree packing technique from [Karger
STOC'96], we can find the minimum cut in time proportional to the number of
components. As a byproduct of this technique, we obtain an $\tilde O(n)$-time
algorithm for computing exact minimum cut for weighted graphs.

limitations of natural lifting (aka escalation) techniques. For example, we
prove that even optimal rank lower bounds on $k$-tensors cannot yield
non-trivial lower bounds on the rank of $d$-tensors, for any constant $d&gt;k$.
This significantly extends recent barrier results on the limits of (matrix)
rank methods by Efremenko, Garg, Oliveira and Wigderson, which handles the
(very important) case $k=2$.
</p>
<p>Our generalization requires the development of new technical tools and
results in algebraic geometry, which are interesting in their own right and
possibly applicable elsewhere. The basic issue they probe is the relation
between numeric and symbolic rank of tensors, essential in the proofs of
previous and current barriers. Our main technical result implies that for every
symbolic $k$-tensor (namely one whose entries are polynomials in some set of
variables), if the tensor rank is small for every evaluation of the variables,
then it is small symbolically. This statement is obvious for $k=2$.
</p>
<p>To prove an analogous statement for $k&gt;2$ we develop a "numeric to symbolic"
transfer of algebraic relations to algebraic functions, somewhat in the spirit
of the implicit function theorem. It applies in the general setting of
inclusion of images of polynomial maps, in the form appearing in Raz's elusive
functions approach to proving VP $\neq$ VNP. We give a toy application showing
how our transfer theorem may be useful in pursuing this approach to prove
arithmetic complexity lower bounds.

\textit{resolving set} for $G$ if for every two distinct vertices $u,v \in V$
there is a vertex $w \in U$ such that the distance between $u$ and $w$ and the
distance between $v$ and $w$ are different. A resolving set $U$ is {\em
fault-tolerant} if for every vertex $u\in U$ set $U\setminus \{u\}$ is still a
resolving set. {The \em (fault-tolerant) Metric Dimension} of $G$ is the size
of a smallest (fault-tolerant) resolving set for $G$. The {\em weighted
(fault-tolerant) Metric Dimension} for a given cost function $c: V
\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ is the minimum weight of all (fault-tolerant)
resolving sets. Deciding whether a given graph $G$ has (fault-tolerant) Metric
Dimension at most $k$ for some integer $k$ is known to be NP-complete. The
weighted fault-tolerant Metric Dimension problem has not been studied
extensively so far. In this paper we show that the weighted fault-tolerant
metric dimension problem can be solved in linear time on cographs.

    <title>TR19-055 |  Lower Bounds for Oblivious Near-Neighbor Search | 

	Kasper Green Larsen, 

	Tal Malkin, 

	Omri Weinstein, 

	Kevin Yeo</title>
    <summary>We prove an $\Omega(d \lg n/ (\lg\lg n)^2)$ lower bound on the dynamic cell-probe complexity of statistically $\mathit{oblivious}$ approximate-near-neighbor search (ANN) over the $d$-dimensional Hamming cube. For the natural setting of $d = \Theta(\log n)$, our result implies an $\tilde{\Omega}(\lg^2 n)$ lower bound, which is a quadratic improvement over the highest (non-oblivious) cell-probe lower bound for ANN. This is the first super-logarithmic $\mathit{unconditional}$ lower bound for ANN against general (non black-box) data structures. We also show that any oblivious $\mathit{static}$ data structure for decomposable search problems (like ANN) can be obliviously dynamized with $O(\log n)$ overhead in update and query time, strengthening a classic result of Bentley and Saxe (Algorithmica, 1980).</summary>

As an academic, we do a lot of writing about the things we work on, but usually our audience is narrow and technical: other researchers in our sub-specialty. But it can be both fun and important to communicate to a wider audience as well. So my amazing colleague Michael Kearns and I wrote a book, called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205">The Ethical Algorithm</a>. It's coming out in October (Amazon says the release date is November 1st, but my understanding is that pre-orders will start shipping on October 4).<br/><br/>This was the first time for either of us writing something like this: it's not a textbook, it's a "trade book" -- a popular science book. Its intended readership isn't just computer science PhDs, but the educated public broadly. But there should be plenty in it to interest experts too, because we cover quite a bit of ground.  The book is about the problems that arise when algorithmic decision making interacts with human beings --- and the emerging science about how to fix them. The topics we cover include privacy, fairness, strategic interactions and gaming, and the scientific reproducibility crisis.<br/><br/>Lots has been written about the problems that can arise, especially related to privacy and fairness. And we're not trying to reinvent the wheel. Instead, the focus of our book is the exciting and embryonic algorithmic science that has grown to address these issues.<br/><br/>The privacy chapter develops differential privacy, and its strengths and weaknesses. The fairness chapter covers recent work on algorithmic fairness that has come out of the computer science literature. The gaming chapter studies how algorithm design can affect the equilibria that emerge from large scale interactions. The reproducibility chapter explores the underlying issues that lead to false discovery, and recent algorithmic advances that hold promise in avoiding them.  We try and set expectations appropriately. We don't pretend that the solutions to complex societal problems can be entirely (or even primarily) algorithmic. But we argue that embedding social values into algorithms will inevitably form an important component of any solution.<br/><br/>I'm really excited for it to come out. If you want, you can pre-order it now, either at Amazon:¬†<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205">https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205</a>¬†or directly from the publisher:¬†<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethical-algorithm-9780190948207?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#.XKegC9eWi2w.twitter">https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethical-algorithm-9780190948207?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#.XKegC9eWi2w.twitter</a></div>

    <title>TR19-054 |  Bridging between 0/1 and Linear Programming via Random Walks | 

	Joshua Brakensiek, 

	Venkatesan Guruswami</title>
    <summary>Under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, an integer linear program with $n$ Boolean-valued variables and $m$ equations cannot be solved in $c^n$ time for any constant $c &lt; 2$. If the domain of the variables is relaxed to $[0,1]$, the associated linear program can of course be solved in polynomial time. In this work, we give a natural algorithmic bridging between these extremes of $0$-$1$ and linear programming. Specifically, for any subset (finite union of intervals) $E \subset [0,1]$ containing $\{0,1\}$, we give a random-walk based algorithm with runtime $O_E((2-\text{measure}(E))^n \text{poly}(n,m))$ that finds a solution in $E^n$ to any  $n$-variable linear program with $m$ constraints that is feasible over $\{0,1\}^n$. Note that as $E$ expands from $\{0,1\}$ to $[0,1]$, the runtime improves smoothly from $2^n$ to polynomial. 
 
Taking $E = [0,1/k) \cup (1-1/k,1]$ in our result yields as a corollary a randomized $(2-2/k)^{n}\text{poly}(n)$ time algorithm for $k$-SAT, matching the best known runtime for larger $k$. While our approach has some high level resemblance to Sch\"{o}ning's beautiful algorithm, our general algorithm is based on a more sophisticated random walk that incorporates several new ingredients, such as a multiplicative potential to measure progress, a judicious choice of starting distribution, and a time varying distribution for the evolution of the random walk that is itself computed via an LP at each step (a solution to which is guaranteed based on the minimax theorem).  Plugging the LP algorithm into our earlier polymorphic framework yields fast exponential algorithms for any CSP (like $k$-SAT, $1$-in-$3$-SAT, NAE $k$-SAT) that admit so-called ``threshold partial polymorphisms."</summary>

    <title>TR19-053 |  The complexity of 3-colouring $H$-colourable graphs | 

	Andrei Krokhin, 

	Jakub Opr≈°al</title>
    <summary>We study the complexity of approximation on satisfiable instances for graph homomorphism problems. For a fixed graph $H$, the $H$-colouring problem is to decide whether a given graph has a homomorphism to $H$.  By a result of Hell and Ne≈°et?il, this problem is NP-hard for any non-bipartite graph $H$.  In the context of promise constraint satisfaction problems, Brakensiek and Guruswami conjectured that this hardness result extends to promise graph homomorphism as follows: fix any non-bipartite graph $H$ and another graph $G$ with a homomorphism from $H$ to $G$, it is NP-hard to find a homomorphism to $G$ from a given $H$-colourable graph.  Arguably, the two most important special cases of this conjecture are when $H$ is fixed to be $K_3$ (and $G$ is any graph with a triangle) and when $G=K_3$ (and $H$ is any 3-colourable graph). The former case is equivalent to the notoriously difficult approximate graph colouring problem. In this paper, we confirm the Brakensiek-Guruswami conjecture for the latter case.  Our proofs rely on a novel combination of the universal-algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction, that was recently developed by Bul√≠n and the authors, with some ideas from algebraic topology.</summary>

    <title>TR19-052 |  Polynomial calculus space and resolution width | 

	Nicola  Galesi, 

	Leszek Kolodziejczyk, 

	Neil Thapen</title>
    <summary>We show that if a $k$-CNF requires width $w$ to refute in resolution, then it requires space $\sqrt w$ to refute in polynomial calculus, where the space of a polynomial calculus refutation is the number of monomials that must be kept in memory when working through the proof. This is the first analogue, in polynomial calculus, of Atserias and Dalmau's result lower-bounding clause space in resolution by resolution width.

As a by-product of our new approach to space lower bounds  we give a simple proof of Bonacina's recent result that total space in resolution (the total number of variable occurrences that must be kept in memory) is lower-bounded by the width squared. As corollaries of the main result we obtain some new lower bounds on the PCR space needed to refute specific formulas, as well as partial answers to some open problems about relations between space, size, and degree for polynomial calculus.</summary>

Today I want to discuss a recent paper of hers.</p>
<p>
Okay, not so recent. Well it was published in 1976. It is a joint paper of ours. The topic was information flow with applications to security and cryptography: ‚ÄúThe Enforcement of Security Policies for Computation.‚Äù Anita and I thought that is was a pretty neat paper. The paper was eventually accepted for the the operating system conference (SOSP) conference in 1975 and later appeared in the JCSS journal‚Äîsee <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Enforcement-of-Security-Policies-for-Jones-Lipton/c25e7f6e3e9d5c55dff9e842d969788025fb6afe">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Missing The Boat </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Two comments on our paper. It was indeed accepted to SOSP, but the acceptance was complicated. It might make a good story, but it happened so long ago that I doubt anyone who would be interested. The paper also totally missed the boat. We had a good idea, a good topic, but we totally missed getting the right model. Totally.</p>
<p>
Here is the boat we missed:</p>
<p/><p/>
<table style="margin: auto;">

<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/04/09/seeing-is-believing/missedboat/" rel="attachment wp-att-15746"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15746" height="124" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/missedboat.png?w=300&amp;h=124" width="300"/></a>

<p>
We missed it because we looked for a deterministic theory of information flow. An application of the theory was to be to security and cryptography. It was at least partially successful in explaining several puzzles that were around then. But we missed seeing that the best theory had to be probabilistic. That a good theory of information flow needs to argue about probabilities‚Ä¶ We missed this totally. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Seeing A Value </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
So we are going to introduce a probabilistic theory of <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> No we are still interested in deterministic information flow. We wish to introduce the notion of <i>seeing</i> a value. The intuition is that often in making arguments we may need to say that we can ‚Äúsee‚Äù a certain value. This happens naturally in arguments in cryptography. For example, we can express that a function is invertible as: if we can see the value of <img alt="{F(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(x)}"/> we can see the value of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. Let <img alt="{\Box E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox+E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box E}"/> mean that we can see the value <img alt="{E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E}"/>. Think of the symbol <img alt="{\Box}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box}"/> as an ‚Äúeye‚Äù that can see the value of the expression <img alt="{E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E}"/>. Thus 	</p>

</li><li>
If <img alt="{\Box E_{1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox+E_%7B1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box E_{1}}"/> and <img alt="{\Box E_{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox+E_%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box E_{2}}"/>, then <img alt="{\Box (E_{1} \times E_{2})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox+%28E_%7B1%7D+%5Ctimes+E_%7B2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box (E_{1} \times E_{2})}"/>. <p/>

<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \Box E_{1} \implies \Box E_{2}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CBox+E_%7B1%7D+%5Cimplies+%5CBox+E_%7B2%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \Box E_{1} \implies \Box E_{2}. "/></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Applications </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is a real application to demonstrate the notion of ‚Äúseeing‚Äù. It comes not directly from security but from a 2017 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10921">paper</a> by Saminathan Ponnusamy and Victor Starkov on the Jacobian Conjecture. We have however <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/08/04/crypto-aspects-of-the-jacobian-conjecture/">covered</a> cryptographic aspects of the conjecture. The authors look at functions <img alt="{F(x)=y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%29%3Dy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(x)=y}"/> of the form 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  y_{k} = x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y_%7Bk%7D+%3D+x_%7Bk%7D+%2B+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  y_{k} = x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right), "/></p>
<p>
where <img alt="{z = x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz+%3D+x_%7B1%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+x_%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z = x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n}}"/> and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{k} \gamma_{k} = 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{k} \gamma_{k} = 0. "/></p>
<p>They give a proof that this function is invertible. Here is one using our ‚Äúseeing‚Äù notion: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle \begin{array}{l} \Box\, y_{k} \text{ for all } k. \\ \Box \left( x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { for all } k. \\ \Box \left( \sum_{k} x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { adding up.} \\ \Box \left( x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n} \right) \text { by assumption } \sum_{k} \gamma_{k}=0. \\ \Box\, z \text{ by definition.} \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bl%7D+%5CBox%5C%2C+y_%7Bk%7D+%5Ctext%7B+for+all+%7D+k.+%5C%5C+%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+x_%7Bk%7D+%2B+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29+%5Ctext+%7B+for+all+%7D+k.+%5C%5C+%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+x_%7Bk%7D+%2B+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29+%5Ctext+%7B+adding+up.%7D+%5C%5C+%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+x_%7B1%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+x_%7Bn%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Ctext+%7B+by+assumption+%7D+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D%3D0.+%5C%5C+%5CBox%5C%2C+z+%5Ctext%7B+by+definition.%7D+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \begin{array}{l} \Box\, y_{k} \text{ for all } k. \\ \Box \left( x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { for all } k. \\ \Box \left( \sum_{k} x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { adding up.} \\ \Box \left( x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n} \right) \text { by assumption } \sum_{k} \gamma_{k}=0. \\ \Box\, z \text{ by definition.} \end{array} "/></p>
<p>
Then we get that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \Box \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \Box \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right), "/></p>
<p>and recall that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \Box \left( x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { for all } k. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+x_%7Bk%7D+%2B+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29+%5Ctext+%7B+for+all+%7D+k.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \Box \left( x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { for all } k. "/></p>
<p>Thus by subtraction it follows that we get <img alt="{\Box x_{k}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox+x_%7Bk%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box x_{k}}"/> for each <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>. This proves that <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> is invertible. </p>
<p>
Note, the proof in the above paper is quite short. However it is a bit complicated and we believe that the above proof is quite transparent. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is this notion of any use? Also how hard will it be to formally define this notion?</p>

    <title>TR19-051 |  Pseudorandom bits and lower bounds for randomized Turing machines | 

	Emanuele Viola</title>
    <summary>We exhibit a pseudorandom generator with nearly quadratic stretch for randomized Turing machines, which have a one-way random tape and a two-way work tape. This is the first generator for this model. Its stretch is essentially the best possible given current lower bounds. We use the generator to prove a polynomial lower bound for the stronger Turing machine model where we also have a two-way read-only input tape. This is the first lower bound for this model.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In 2011, as a graduate student <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~minilek/">Jelani Nelson</a> founded the <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder course</a> on algorithms and coding for high schoolers in Addis Ababa Ethiopia.  Since then the course has been offered twice more, and this summer it will occur again for the fourth time. Over 330 students have completed the course, and some of its <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/#alumni">alumni</a> are now students in top institutions in the U.S., Ethiopia, and all over the world. I was a lecturer in this course in 2016 and will be again this summer (together with Jelani,  <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~tgebru/">Timnit Gebru</a>, and  <a href="https://ddkang.github.io/">Daniel Kang</a>).</p>



<p>The students in AddisCoder come from all over Ethiopia, and many have never considered computer science as a potential field of study or even touched a computer. Once when meeting an alum, I asked whether he enjoyed the course. He told me that he didn‚Äôt just enjoy it, it was a lifechanging experience for him, and I believe the same holds for many other graduates.</p>



<p>The reason for this post is that AddisCoder is now a tax-exempt non profit organization, which you can <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/#donate">donate to</a> through our website. It is a fairly lean operation, but funds are needed for travel of teaching staff (with TA‚Äôs that come from all over the world). Please consider supporting AddisCoder yourself (any amount helps!), and forward this information to any friends or colleagues. If you work for a company that might be interested in supporting AddisCoder, you can contact Jelani at the email minilek+addiscoder@gmail.com .</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>Controlled Flight into Terrain</em> is the aviation industry‚Äôs term for what happens when a properly functioning airplane plows into the ground because the pilots are distracted or disoriented. What a nightmare. Even worse, in my estimation, is <em>Automated Flight into Terrain</em>, when an aircraft‚Äôs control system forces it into a fatal nose dive despite the frantic efforts of the crew to save it. That is the conjectured cause of two recent crashes of new Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplanes. I‚Äôve been trying to reason my way through to an understanding of how those accidents could have happened.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: The investigations of the MAX 8 disasters are in an early stage, so much of what follows is based on secondary sources‚Äîin other words, on leaks and rumors and the speculations of people who may or may not know what they‚Äôre talking about. As for my own speculations: I‚Äôm not an aeronautical engineer, or an airframe mechanic, or a control theorist. I‚Äôm not even a pilot. Please keep that in mind if you choose to read on.</p>
<h3>The accidents</h3>
<p>Early on the morning of October 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 departed Jakarta, Indonesia, with 189 people on board. The airplane was a four-month-old 737 MAX 8‚Äîthe latest model in a line of Boeing aircraft that goes back to the 1960s. Takeoff and climb were normal to about 1,600 feet, where the pilots retracted the flaps (wing extensions that increase lift at low speed). At that point the aircraft unexpectedly descended to 900 feet. In radio conversations with air traffic controllers, the pilots reported a ‚Äúflight control problem‚Äù and asked about their altitude and speed as displayed on the controllers‚Äô radar screens. Cockpit instruments were giving inconsistent readings. The pilots then redeployed the flaps and climbed to 5,000 feet, but when the flaps were stowed again, the nose dipped and the plane began to lose altitude. Over the next six or seven minutes the pilots engaged in a tug of war with their own aircraft, as they struggled to keep the nose level but the flight control system repeatedly pushed it down. In the end the machine won. The airplane plunged into the sea at high speed, killing everyone aboard.</p>
<p>The second crash happened March 8, when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 went down six minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa, killing 157. The aircraft was another MAX 8, just two months old. The pilots reported control problems, and data from a satellite tracking service showed sharp fluctuations in altitude. The similarities to the Lion Air crash set off alarm bells: If the same malfunction or design flaw caused both accidents, it might also cause more. Within days, the worldwide fleet of 737 MAX aircraft was grounded. Data recovered since then from the Flight 302 wreckage has reinforced the suspicion that the two accidents are closely related.</p>
<p>The grim fate of Lion Air 610 can be traced in brightly colored squiggles extracted from the flight data recorder. (The chart was published in November in a <a href="http://jacdec.de/database/2018-10-29_PK-LQP-NTSC_Preliminary%20Report.pdf">preliminary report</a> from the Indonesian National Committee on Transportation Safety.)</p>
<p><img alt="Lion Air 610 flight data chart 1280" border="0" class="centered withLoupe" height="834" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lion-Air-610-flight-data-chart-1280.jpg" width="900"/></p>
<p>The outline of the story is given in the altitude traces at the bottom of the chart. The initial climb is interrupted by a sharp dip; then a further climb is followed by a long, erratic roller coaster ride. At the end comes the dive, as the aircraft plunges 5,000 feet in a little more than 10 seconds. (Why are there two altitude curves, separated by a few hundred feet? I‚Äôll come back to that question at the end of this long screed.)</p>
<p>All those ups and downs were caused by movements of the horizontal stabilizer, the small winglike control surface at the rear of the fuselage. <img alt="Stabilizer elevator diagram" border="0" class="alignright" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stabilizer_elevator_diagram.svg" style="margin-bottom: 12px;" width="250"/>The stabilizer controls the airplane‚Äôs pitch attitude‚Äînose-up vs. nose-down. On the 737 it does so in two ways. A mechanism for pitch <em>trim</em> tilts the entire stabilizer, whereas push¬≠ing or pulling on the pilot‚Äôs control yoke moves the elevator, a hinged tab at the rear of the stabilizer. In either case, moving the trailing edge of the surface upward tends to force the nose of the airplane up, and vice versa. Here we‚Äôre mainly concerned with trim changes rather than elevator movements.</p>
<p>Commands to the pitch-trim system and their effect on the airplane are shown in three traces from the flight data, which I reproduce here for convenience:</p>
<p><img alt="Lion Air 610 flight data chart trim commands" border="0" class="aligncenter" height="117" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lion-Air-610-flight-data-chart-trim-commands.jpg" width="640"/></p>
<p>The line labeled ‚Äútrim manual‚Äù <em>(light blue)</em> reflects the pilots‚Äô inputs, ‚Äútrim automatic‚Äù <em>(orange)</em> shows commands from the airplane‚Äôs electronic systems, and ‚Äúpitch trim position‚Äù <em>(dark blue)</em> represents the tilt of the stabilizer, with higher position on the scale denoting a nose-up command. This is where the tug of war between man and machine is clearly evident. In the latter half of the flight, the automatic trim system repeatedly commands nose down, at intervals of roughly 10 seconds. In the breaks between those automated commands, the pilots dial in nose-up trim, using buttons on the control yoke. In response to these conflicting commands, the position of the horizontal stabilizer oscillates with a period of 15 or 20 seconds. The see-sawing motion continues for at least 20 cycles, but toward the end the unrelenting automatic nose-down adjustments prevail over the briefer nose-up commands from the pilots. The stabilizer finally reaches its limiting nose-down deflection and stays there as the airplane plummets into the sea.</p>
<h3>Angle of attack</h3>
<p>What‚Äôs to blame for the perverse behavior of the automatic pitch trim system? The accusatory finger is pointing at something called MCAS, a new feature of the 737 MAX series. MCAS stands for Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System‚Äîan im¬≠pressively polysyllabic name that tells you nothing about what the thing is or what it does. As I understand it, MCAS is not a piece of hardware; there‚Äôs no box labeled MCAS in the airplane‚Äôs electronic equipment bays. MCAS consists entirely of software. It‚Äôs a program running on a computer.</p>
<p>MCAS has just one function. It is designed to help prevent an aerodynamic stall, a situation in which an airplane has its nose pointed up so high with respect to the surrounding airflow that the wings can‚Äôt keep it aloft. A stall is a little like what happens to a bicyclist climbing a hill that keeps getting steeper and steeper: Eventually the rider runs out of oomph, wobbles a bit, and then rolls back to the bottom. Pilots are taught to recover from stalls, but it‚Äôs not a skill they routinely practice with a planeful of passengers. In commercial aviation the emphasis is on <em>avoiding</em> stalls‚Äîforestalling them, so to speak. Airliners have mechanisms to detect an imminent stall and warn the pilot with lights and horns and a ‚Äústick shaker‚Äù that vibrates the control yoke. On Flight 610, the captain‚Äôs stick was shaking almost from start to finish.</p>
<p>Some aircraft go beyond mere warnings when a stall threatens. If the aircraft‚Äôs nose continues to pitch upward, an automated system intervenes to push it back down‚Äîif necessary overriding the manual control inputs of the pilot. MCAS is designed to do exactly this. It is armed and ready whenever two criteria are met: The flaps are up (generally true except during takeoff and landing) and the airplane is under manual control (not autopilot). Under these conditions the system is triggered whenever an aerodynamic quantity called angle of attack, or AoA, rises into a dangerous range.</p>
<p>Angle of attack is a concept subtle enough to merit a diagram:Adapted from Lisa R. Le Vie, <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140011419.pdf">Review of Research on Angle-of-Attack Indi¬≠cator Effectiveness</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Le Vie angle of attack diagram detail" border="0" class="centered" height="229" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Le-Vie-angle-of-attack-diagram-detail.png" width="607"/></p>
<p class="undent">The various angles at issue are rotations of the aircraft body around the pitch axis, a line parallel to the wings, perpendicular to the fuselage, and passing through the airplane‚Äôs center of gravity. If you‚Äôre sitting in an exit row, the pitch axis might run right under your seat. Rotation about the pitch axis tilts the nose up or down. <em>Pitch attitude</em> is defined as the angle of the fuselage with respect to a horizontal plane. The <em>flight-path angle</em> is measured between the horizontal plane and the aircraft‚Äôs velocity vector, thus showing how steeply it is climbing or descending. <em>Angle of attack</em> is the difference between pitch attitude and flight-path angle. It is the angle at which the aircraft is moving through the surrounding air (assuming the air itself is motionless, <em>i.e.</em>, no wind).</p>
<p>AoA affects both lift (the upward force opposing the downward tug of gravity) and drag (the dissipative force opposing forward motion and the thrust of the engines). As AoA increases from zero, lift is enhanced because of air impinging on the underside of the wings and fuselage. For the same reason, however, drag also increases. As the angle of attack grows even steeper, the flow of air over the wings becomes turbulent; beyond that point lift diminishes but drag continues increasing. That‚Äôs where the stall sets in. The critical angle for a stall depends on speed, weight, and other factors, but usually it‚Äôs no more than 15 degrees.</p>
<p>Neither the Lion Air nor the Ethiopian flight was ever in danger of stalling, so if MCAS was activated, it must have been by mistake. The working hypothesis mentioned in many press accounts is that the system received and acted upon erroneous input from a failed AoA sensor. </p>
<p>A sensor to measure angle of attack is conceptually simple. It‚Äôs essentially a weather¬≠vane poking out into the airstream. In the photo below, the angle-of-attack sensor is the small black vane just forward of the ‚Äú737 MAX‚Äù legend. Hinged at the front, the vane rotates to align itself with the local airflow and generates an electrical signal that rep¬≠resents the vane‚Äôs angle with respect to the axis of the fuselage. The 737 MAX has two angle-of-attack vanes, one on each side of the nose. (The protruding devices above the AoA vane are pitot tubes, used to measure air speed. Another device below the word MAX is probably a temperature sensor.)</p>
<p><img alt="SpiritofRenton nose1280" border="0" class="centered" height="452" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SpiritofRenton-nose1280.jpg" width="640"/></p>
<p class="indent">Angle of attack was not among the variables displayed to the pilots of the Lion Air 737, but the flight data recorder did capture signals derived from the two AoA sensors:</p>
<p><img alt="Lion Air 610 flight data chart AoA details" border="0" class="centered" height="60" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lion-Air-610-flight-data-chart-AoA-details.jpg" width="640"/></p>
<p class="undent">There‚Äôs something dreadfully wrong here. The left sensor is indicating an angle of attack about 20 degrees steeper than the right sensor. That‚Äôs a huge discrepancy. There‚Äôs no plausible way those disparate readings could reflect the true state of the airplane‚Äôs motion through the air, with the left side of the nose pointing sky-high and the right side near level. One of the measurements must be wrong, and the higher reading is the suspect one. If the true angle of attack ever reached 20 degrees, the airplane would already be in a deep stall. Unfortunately, on Flight 610 MCAS was taking data only from the left-side AoA sensor. It interpreted the nonsensical measurement as a valid indicator of aircraft attitude, and worked relentlessly to correct it, up to the very moment the airplane hit the sea.</p>
<h3>Cockpit automation</h3>
<p>The tragedies in Jakarta and Addis Ababa are being framed as a cautionary tale of automation run amok, with computers usurping the authority of pilots. The <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-boeing-crashes-are-a-cautionary-tale-about-automation/2019/03/27/62c09154-4fd0-11e9-8d28-f5149e5a2fda_story.html?utm_term=.514085b92e47">editorialized</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>A second fatal airplane accident involving a Boeing 737 MAX 8 may have been a case of man vs. machine‚Ä¶. The debacle shows that regulators should apply extra review to systems that take control away from humans when safety is at stake.</p></blockquote>
<p class="undent">Tom Dieusaert, a Belgian journalist who writes often on aviation and computation, offered this <a href="https://medium.com/crash-investigators/computer-crash-on-a-boeing-what-we-do-know-about-lion-air-jt610-9b5dbd654c75">opinion</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What can‚Äôt be denied is that the Boeing of Flight JT610 had serious computer problems. And in the hi-tech, fly-by-wire world of aircraft manufacturers, where pilots are reduced to button pushers and passive observers, these accidents are prone to happen more in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The button-pushing pilots are particularly irate. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1249KS8xtIDKb5SxgpeFI6AD-PSC6nFA5/view">Gregory Travis</a>, who is both a pilot and software developer, summed up his feelings in this acerbic comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúRaise the nose, HAL.‚Äù </p>
<p class="undent">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Dave, I can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1105468569800839169">tweeted</a> on the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products.

<p>‚Ä¶.needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I don‚Äôt want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!</p></blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs considerable irony in the complaint that the 737 is too automated; in many respects the aircraft is in fact quaintly old-fashioned. The basic design goes back more than 50 years, and even in the latest MAX models quite a lot of 1960s technology survives. The primary flight controls are hydraulic, with a spider web of high-pressure tubing running directly from the control yokes in the cockpit to the ailerons, elevator, and rudder. If the hydraulic systems should fail, there‚Äôs a purely mechanical backup, with cables and pulleys to operate the various control surfaces. For stabilizer trim the primary actuator is an electric motor, but again there‚Äôs a mechanical fallback, with crank wheels near the pilots‚Äô knees pulling on cables that run all the way back to the tail.</p>
<p>Other aircraft are much more dependent on computers and electronics. The 737‚Ä≤s principal competitor, the Airbus A320, is a thoroughgoing fly-by-wire vehicle. The pilot flies the computer, and the computer flies the airplane. Specifically, the pilot decides where to go‚Äîup, down, left, right‚Äîbut the computer decides how to get there, choosing which control surfaces to deflect and by how much. Boeing‚Äôs own more recent designs, the 777 and 787, also rely on digital controls. Indeed, the latest models from both companies go a step beyond fly-by-wire to fly-by-network. Most of the communication from sensors to computers and onward to control surfaces consists of digital packets flowing through a <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150011061.pdf">variant of Ethernet</a>. The airplane is a computer peripheral.</p>
<p>Thus if you want to gripe about the dangers and indignities of automation on the flight deck, the 737 is not the most obvious place to start. And a Luddite campaign to smash all the avionics and put pilots back in the seat of their pants would be a dangerously off-target response to the current predicament. There‚Äôs no question the 737 MAX has a critical problem. It‚Äôs a matter of life and death for those who would fly in it and possibly also for the Boeing Company. But the problem didn‚Äôt start with MCAS. It started with earlier decisions that made MCAS necessary. Furthermore, the problem may not end with the remedy that Boeing has proposed‚Äîa software update that will hobble MCAS and leave more to the discretion of pilots.</p>
<h3>Maxing out the 737</h3>
<p>The 737 flew its first passengers in 1968. It was (and still is) the smallest member of the Boeing family of jet airliners, and it is also the most popular by far. More than 10,000 have been sold, and Boeing has orders for another 4,600. Of course there have been changes over the years, especially to engines and instruments. A 1980s update came to be known as 737 Classic, and a 1997 model was called 737 NG, for ‚Äúnext generation.‚Äù (Now, with the MAX, the NG has become the <em>previous</em> generation.) Through all these revisions, however, the basic structure of the airframe has hardly changed.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, it looked like the 737 had finally come to the end of its life. Boeing announced it would develop an all-new design as a replacement, with a hull built of lightweight composite materials rather than aluminum. Competitive pressures forced a change of course. Airbus had a head start on the A320neo, an update that would bring more efficient engines to their entry in the same market segment. The revised Airbus would be ready around 2015, whereas Boeing‚Äôs clean-slate project would take a decade. Customers were threatening to defect. In particular, American Airlines‚Äîlong a Boeing loyalist‚Äîwas negotiating a large order of A320neos. </p>
<p>In 2011 Boeing scrapped the plan for an all-new design and elected to do the same thing Airbus was doing: bolt new engines onto an old airframe. This would eliminate most of the up-front design work, as well as the need to build tooling and manufacturing facilities. Testing and certification by the FAA would also go quicker, so that the first deliveries might be made in five or six years, not too far behind Airbus.</p>
<p>A 737-800 (a pre-MAX model) burns about 800 gallons of jet fuel per hour aloft. That comes to $2,000 at $2.50 per gallon. If the airplane flies 10 hours a day, the annual fuel bill is $7.3 million. Fourteen percent of that is just over $1 million.The new engines mated to the 737 promised a 14 percent gain in fuel efficiency, which might save an airline a million dollars a year in operating costs. The better fuel economy would also increase the airplane‚Äôs range. And to sweeten the deal Boeing proposed to keep enough of the airframe unchanged that the new model would operate under the same ‚Äútype certificate‚Äù as the old one. A pilot qualified to fly the 737 NG could step into the MAX without extensive retraining.</p>

<p class="indent">The original 1960s 737 had two cigar-shaped engines, long and skinny, tucked up under the wings <em>(left photo above)</em>. Since then, jet engines have grown fat and stubby. They derive much of their thrust not from the jet exhaust coming out of the tailpipe but from ‚Äúbypass‚Äù air moved by a large-diameter fan. Such engines would scrape on the ground if they were mounted under the wings of the 737; instead they are perched on pylons that extend forward from the leading edge of the wing. The engines on the MAX models <em>(right photo)</em> are the fattest yet, with a fan 69 inches in diameter. Compared with the NG series, the MAX engines are pushed a few inches farther forward and hang a few inches lower.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/business/boeing-737-max-crash.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer">New York Times article</a> by David Gelles, Natalie Kitroeff, Jack Nicas, and Rebecca R. Ruiz describes the plane‚Äôs development as hurried and hectic.</p>
<blockquote><p>Months behind Airbus, Boeing had to play catch-up. The pace of the work on the 737 Max was frenetic, according to current and former employees who spoke with <em>The New York Times</em>‚Ä¶. Engineers were pushed to submit technical drawings and designs at roughly double the normal pace, former employees said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>Times</em> article also notes:  ‚ÄúAlthough the project had been hectic, current and former employees said they had finished it feeling confident in the safety of the plane.‚Äù </p>
<h3>Pitch instability</h3>
<p>Sometime during the development of the MAX series, Boeing got an unpleasant surprise. The new engines were causing unwanted pitch-up movements under certain flight con¬≠ditions. When I first read about this problem, soon after the Lion Air crash, I found the following explanation is an article by Sean Broderick and Guy Norris in <em>Aviation Week and Space Technology</em> (Nov. 26‚ÄìDec. 9, 2018, pp. 56‚Äì57):</p>
<blockquote><p>Like all turbofan-powered airliners in which the thrust lines of the engines pass below the center of gravity (CG), any change in thrust on the 737 will result in a change of flight path angle caused by the vertical component of thrust.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the low-slung engines not only push the airplane forward but also tend to twirl it around the pitch axis. It‚Äôs like a motorcycle doing wheelies. Because the MAX engines are mounted farther below and in front of the center of gravity, they act through a longer lever arm and cause more severe pitch-up motions. </p>
<p>I found more detail on this effect in an <a href="https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/pilot-report-flying-737-8-boeing-s-new-narrowbody-breadwinner">earlier <em>Aviation Week</em> article</a>, a 2017 pilot report by Fred George, describing his first flight at the controls of the new MAX 8. </p>
<blockquote><p>The aircraft has sufficient natural speed stability through much of its flight envelope. But with as much as 58,000 lb. of thrust available from engines mounted well below the center of gravity, there is pronounced thrust-versus-pitch coupling at low speeds, especially with aft center of gravity (CG) and at light gross weights. Boeing equips the aircraft with a speed-stability augmen¬≠tation function that helps to compensate for the coupling by automatically trimming the horizontal stabilizer according to indicated speed, thrust lever position and CG. Pilots still must be aware of the effect of thrust changes on pitching moment and make purposeful control-wheel and pitch-trim inputs to counter it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reference to an ‚Äúaugmentation function‚Äù that works by ‚Äúautomatically trimming the horizontal stabilizer‚Äù sounded awfully familiar, but it turns out this is <em>not</em> MCAS. The system that compensates for thrust-pitch coupling is known as <em>speed-trim</em>. Like MCAS, it works ‚Äúbehind the pilot‚Äôs back,‚Äù making adjustments to control surfaces that were not directly commanded. There‚Äôs yet another system of this kind called <em>mach-trim</em> that silently corrects a different pitch anomally when the aircraft reaches transonic speeds, at about mach 0.6. Neither of these systems is new to the MAX series of aircraft; they have been part of the control algorithm at least since the NG came out in 1997. MCAS runs on the same computer as speed-trim and mach-trim and is part of the same software system, but it is a distinct function. And according to what I‚Äôve been reading in the past few weeks, it addresses a different problem‚Äîone that seems more sinister.</p>
<p>Most aircraft have the pleasant property of static stability. When an airplane is properly trimmed for level flight, you can let go of the controls‚Äîat least briefly‚Äîand it will continue on a stable path. Moreover, if you pull back on the control yoke to point the nose up, then let go again, the pitch angle should return to neutral. The layout of the airplane‚Äôs various airfoil surfaces accounts for this behavior. When the nose goes up, the tail goes down, pushing the underside of the horizontal stabilizer into the airstream. The pressure of the air against this tail surface provides a restoring force that brings the tail back up and the nose back down. (That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called a <em>stabilizer</em>!) This negative feedback loop is built in to the structure of the airplane, so that any departure from equilibrium creates a force that opposes the disturbance.</p>
<p><img alt="Pitch stability" border="0" class="centered" height="" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pitch-stability.svg" width="600"/></p>
<p class="indent">However, the tail surface, with its helpful stablizing influence, is not the only structure that affects the balance of aerodynamic forces. Jet engines are not designed to contribute lift to the airplane, but at high angles of attack they can do so, as the airstream impinges on the lower surface of each engine‚Äôs outer covering, or nacelle. When the engines are well forward of the center of gravity, the lift creates a pitch-up turning moment. If this moment exceeds the counterbalancing force from the tail, the aircraft is unstable. A nose-up attitude generates forces that raise the nose still higher, and positive feedback takes over.</p>
<p>Is the 737 MAX vulnerable to such runaway pitch excursions? The possibility had not occurred to me until I read a <a href="http://www.b737.org.uk/mcas.htm">commentary on MCAS</a> on the <a href="http://www.b737.org.uk/index.htm">Boeing 737 Technical Site</a>, a web publication produced by Chris Brady, a former 737 pilot and flight instructor. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>MCAS is a longitudinal stability enhancement. It is not for stall prevention or to make the MAX handle like the NG; it was introduced to counteract the non-linear lift of the LEAP-1B engine nacelles and give a steady increase in stick force as AoA increases. The LEAP engines are both larger and relocated slightly up and forward from the previous NG CFM56-7 engines to accommodate their larger fan diameter. This new location and size of the nacelle cause the vortex flow off the nacelle body to produce lift at high AoA; as the nacelle is ahead of the CofG this lift causes a slight pitch-up effect (ie a reducing stick force) which could lead the pilot to further increase the back pressure on the yoke and send the aircraft closer towards the stall. This non-linear/reducing stick force is not allowable underFAR = Federal Air Regulations. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1a3ab2a8cbd0ea0ab242c75558315fc2&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt14.1.25&amp;rgn=div5">Part 25</a> deals with airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. FAR ¬ß25.173 ‚ÄúStatic longitudinal stability‚Äù. MCAS was therefore introduced to give an automatic nose down stabilizer input during steep turns with elevated load factors (high AoA) and during flaps up flight at airspeeds approaching stall.</p></blockquote>
<p class="indent">Brady cites no sources for this statement, and as far as I know Boeing has neither confirmed nor denied. But <em>Aviation Week</em>, which earlier mentioned the thrust-pitch linkage, has more recently (<a href="https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/boeing-737-max-mcas-explained">issue of March 20</a>) gotten behind the nacelle-lift instability hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote><p>The MAX‚Äôs larger CFM Leap 1 engines create more lift at high AOA and give the aircraft a greater pitch-up moment than the CFM56-7-equipped NG. The MCAS was added as a certification requirement to minimize the handling difference between the MAX and NG.</p></blockquote>
<p class="indent">Assuming the Brady account is correct, an interesting question is when Boeing noticed the instability. Were the designers aware of this hazard from the outset? Did it emerge during early computer simulations, or in wind tunnel testing of scale models? A story by Dominic Gates in the <em>Seattle Times</em> hints that Boeing may not have recognized the severity of the problem until flight tests of the first completed aircraft began in 2015.</p>
<p>According to Gates, the safety analysis that Boeing submitted to the FAA specified that MCAS would be allowed to move the horizontal stabilizer by no more than 0.6 degree. In the airplane ultimately released to the market, MCAS can go as far as 2.5 degrees, and it can act repeatedly until reaching the mechanical limit of motion at about 5 degrees. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/failed-certification-faa-missed-safety-issues-in-the-737-max-system-implicated-in-the-lion-air-crash/">Gates writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That limit was later increased after flight tests showed that a more powerful movement of the tail was required to avert a high-speed stall, when the plane is in danger of losing lift and spiraling down.</p>
<p>The behavior of a plane in a high angle-of-attack stall is difficult to model in advance purely by analysis and so, as test pilots work through stall-recovery routines during flight tests on a new airplane, it‚Äôs not uncommon to tweak the control software to refine the jet‚Äôs performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>The high-AoA instability of the MAX appears to be a property of the aerodynamic form of the entire aircraft, and so a direct way to suppress it would be to alter that form. For example, enlarging the tail surface might restore static stability. But such airframe modifications would have delayed the delivery of the airplane, especially if the need for them was discovered only after the first prototypes were already flying. Structural changes might also jeopardize inclusion of the new model under the old type certificate. Modifying software instead of aluminum must have looked like an attractive alternative. Someday, perhaps, we‚Äôll learn how the decision was made.</p>
<p>By the way, according to Gates, the safety document filed with the FAA specifying a 0.6 degree limit has yet to be amended to reflect the true range of MCAS commands.</p>
<h3>Flying while unstable</h3>
<p>Instability is not necessarily the kiss of death in an airplane. There have been at least a few successful unstable designs, starting with the 1903 Wright Flyer. The Wright brothers deliberately put the horizontal stabilizer in front of the wing rather than behind it because their earlier experiments with kites and gliders had shown that what we call stability can also be described as sluggishness. The Flyer‚Äôs forward control surfaces (known as canards) tended to amplify any slight nose-up or nose-down motions. Maintaining a steady pitch attitude demanded high alertness from the pilot, but it also allowed the airplane to respond more quickly when the pilot <em>wanted</em> to pitch up or down. (The pros and cons of the design are reviewed in a 1984 <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/21217/">paper</a> by Fred E. C. Culick and Henry R. Jex.)</p>

<p class="indent">Another dramatically unstable aircraft was the Grumman X-29, a research platform designed in the 1980s. The X-29 had its wings on backwards; to make matters worse,<img alt="X 29 at High Angle of Attack with Smoke Generators" border="0" class="alignleft" height="234" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/X-29_at_High_Angle_of_Attack_with_Smoke_Generators.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 12px;" width="300"/> the primary surfaces for pitch control were canards mounted in front of the wings, as in the Wright Flyer. The aim of this quirky project was to explore designs with exceptional agility, sacrificing static stability for tighter maneuvering. No unaided human pilot could have mastered such a twitchy vehicle. It required a digital fly-by-wire system that sampled the state of the airplane and adjusted the control surfaces up to 80 times per second. The controller was successful‚Äîperhaps too much so. It allowed the airplane to be flown safely, but in taming the instability it also left the plane with rather tame handling characteristics.</p>
<p>I have a glancing personal connection with the X-29 project. In the 1980s I briefly worked as an editor with members of the group at Honeywell who designed and built the X-29 control system. I helped prepare publications on the control laws and on their implementation in hardware and software. That experience taught me just enough to recognize something odd about MCAS: It is way too slow to be suppressing aerodynamic instability in a jet aircraft. Whereas the X-29 controller had a response time of 25 milliseconds, MCAS takes 10 seconds to move the 737 stabilizer through a 2.5-degree adjustment. At that pace, it cannot possibly keep up with forces that tend to flip the nose upward in a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a simple explanation. MCAS is not meant to control an unstable aircraft. It is meant to restrain the aircraft from entering the regime where it becomes unstable. This is the same strategy used by other mechanisms of stall prevention‚Äîintervening before the angle of attack reaches the critical point. However, if Brady is correct about the instability of the 737 MAX, the task is more urgent for MCAS. Instability implies a steep and slippery slope. MCAS is a guard rail that bounces you back onto the road when you‚Äôre about to drive over the cliff. </p>
<p>Which brings up the question of Boeing‚Äôs announced plan to fix the MCAS problem. <a href="https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/boeing-max-changes-add-redundancy-pilot-control">Reportedly</a>, the revised system will not keep reactivating itself so persistently, and it will automatically disengage if it detects a large difference between the two AoA sensors. These changes should prevent a recurrence of the recent crashes. But do they provide adequate protection against the kind of mishap that MCAS was designed to prevent in the first place? With MCAS shut down, either manually or automatically, there‚Äôs nothing to stop an unwary or misguided pilot from wandering into the corner of the flight envelope where the MAX becomes unstable.</p>
<p>Without further information from Boeing, there‚Äôs no telling how severe the instability might be‚Äîif indeed it exists at all. The Brady article at the Boeing 737 Technical Site implies the problem is partly pilot-induced. Normally, to make the nose go higher and higher you have to pull harder and harder on the control yoke. In the unstable region, however, the resistance to pulling suddenly fades, and so the pilot may unwittingly pull the yoke to a more extreme position.</p>
<p>Is this human interaction a <em>necessary</em> part of the instability, or is it just an exacer¬≠bating factor? In other words, without the pilot in the loop, would there still be positive feedback causing runaway nose-up pitch? I have yet to find answers.</p>
<p>Another question: If the root of the problem is a deceptive change in the force resisting a nose-up movements of the control yoke, why not address that issue directly? The elevator feel computer and the elevator feel and centering unit pro¬≠vide ‚Äúfake‚Äù forces to the pilot‚Äôs control yoke. Figure borrowed from <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/theoryce/b737-ng-flight-controls">B737 NG Flight controls</a>, a presentation by <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/theoryce">theoryce</a>. The presentation is for the 737 NG, not the MAX series; it‚Äôs possible the architecture has changed.<img alt="Pitch controls diagram" border="0" class="alignright" height="407" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pitch-controls-diagram.png" width="300"/>In the 737 (and most other large aircraft) the forces that the pilot ‚Äúfeels‚Äù through the control yoke are not simple reflections of the aerodynamic forces acting on the elevator and other control surfaces. The feedback forces are largely synthetic, generated by an ‚Äúelevator feel computer‚Äù and an ‚Äúelevator feel and centering unit,‚Äù devices that monitor the state of the airplane and gen¬≠erate appro¬≠priate hydraulic pressures push¬≠ing the yoke one way or another. Those systems could have been given the addi¬≠tional task of maintaining or increasing back force on the yoke when the angle of attack approaches the instability. Artificially en¬≠hanced resis¬≠tance is already part of the stall warning system. Why not extend it to MCAS? (There may be a good answer; I just don‚Äôt know it.)</p>
<h3>Where‚Äôs the off switch?</h3>
<p>Even after the spurious activation of MCAS on Lion Air 610, the crash and the casualties would have been avoided if the pilots had simply turned the damn thing off. Why didn‚Äôt they? Apparently because they had never heard of MCAS, and didn‚Äôt know it was installed on the airplane they were flying, and had not received any instruction on how to disable it. There‚Äôs no switch or knob in the cockpit labeled ‚ÄúMCAS ON/OFF.‚Äù The Flight Crew Operation Manual does not mention it (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-737-manual-mcas-system-plane-crash-1.5065842">except in a list of abbreviations</a>), and neither did the transitional training program the pilots had completed before switching from the 737 NG to the MAX. The training consisted of either one or two hours (reports differ) with an iPad app.</p>
<p>Boeing‚Äôs explanation of these omissions was captured in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-withheld-information-on-737-model-according-to-safety-experts-and-others-1542082575"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One high-ranking Boeing official said the company had decided against disclos¬≠ing more details to cockpit crews due to concerns about inundating average pilots with too much information‚Äîand significantly more technical data‚Äîthan they needed or could digest.</p></blockquote>
<p>To call this statement disingenuous would be disingenuous. What it is is preposterous. In the first place, Boeing did not withhold ‚Äúmore details‚Äù; they failed to mention the very existence of MCAS. And the too-much-information argument is silly. I don‚Äôt have access to the Flight Crew Operation Manual for the MAX, but <a href="http://www.737ng.co.uk/737NG%20POH.pdf">the NG edition</a> runs to more than 1,300 pages, plus another 800 for the Quick Reference Handbook. A few paragraphs on MCAS would not have sunk any pilot who wasn‚Äôt already drowning in TMI. Moreover, the manual carefully documents the speed-trim and mach-trim features, which seem to fall in the same category as MCAS: They act autonomously, and offer the pilot no direct interface for monitoring or adjusting them.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Lion Air accident, Boeing stated that the procedure for disabling MCAS was spelled out in the manual, even though MCAS itself wasn‚Äôt mentioned. That procedure is given in a checklist for ‚Äúrunaway stabilizer trim.‚Äù It is not complicated: Hang onto the control yoke, switch off the autopilot and autothrottles if they‚Äôre on; then, if the problem persists, flip two switches labeled ‚ÄúSTAB TRIM‚Äù to the ‚ÄúCUTOUT‚Äù position. Only the last step will actually matter in the case of an MCAS malfunction.</p>
<p>This checklist is considered a ‚Äúmemory item‚Äù; pilots must be able to execute the steps without looking it up in the handbook. The Lion Air crew should certainly have been familiar with it. But could they recognize that it was the right checklist to apply in an airplane whose behavior was unlike anything they had seen in their training or previous 737 flying experience? According to the handbook, the condition that triggers use of the runaway checklist is ‚ÄúUncommanded stabilizer trim movement occurs continuously.‚Äù The MCAS commands were not continuous but repetitive, so some leap of inference would have been needed to make this diagnosis.</p>
<p><img alt="Center console trim wheels" border="0" class="aligncenter" height="576" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/center-console-trim-wheels.png" width="500"/></p>
<p class="indent">By the time of the Ethiopian crash, 737 pilots everywhere knew all about MCAS and the procedure for disabling it. A <a href="http://www.ecaa.gov.et/documents/20435/0/Preliminary+Report+B737-800MAX+,(ET-AVJ).pdf">preliminary report</a> issued last week by Ethiopian Airlines indicates that after a few minutes of wrestling with the control yoke, the pilots on Flight 302 did invoke the checklist procedure, and moved the STAB TRIM switches to CUTOUT. The stabilizer then stopped responding to MCAS nose-down commands, but the pilots were unable to regain control of the airplane. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs not entirely clear why they failed or what was going on in the cockpit in those last minutes. One factor may be that the cutout switch disables not only automatic pitch trim movements but also manual ones requested through the buttons on the control yoke. The switch cuts all power to the electric motor that moves the stabilizer. In this situation the only way to adjust the trim is to turn the hand crank wheels near the pilots‚Äô knees. During the crisis on Flight 302 that mechanism may have been too slow to correct the trim in time, or the pilots may have been so fixated on pulling the control yoke back with maximum force that they did not try the manual wheels. It‚Äôs also possible that they flipped the switches back to the NORMAL setting, restoring power to the stabilizer motor. The report‚Äôs narrative doesn‚Äôt mention this possibility, but the graph from the flight data recorder suggests it <em>(see below)</em>.</p>
<h3>The single point of failure</h3>
<p>There‚Äôs room for debate on whether the MCAS system is a good idea when it is operating correctly, but when it activates <em>mistakenly</em> and sends an airplane diving into the sea, no one would defend it. By all appearances, the rogue behavior in both the Lion Air and the Ethiopian accidents was triggered by a malfunction in a single sensor. That‚Äôs not supposed to happen in aviation. It‚Äôs unfathomable that any aircraft manufacturer would knowingly build a vehicle in which the failure of a single part would lead to a fatal accident.</p>
<p>Protection against single failures comes from redundancy, and the 737 is so committed to this principle that it almost amounts to two airplanes wrapped up in a single skin. Aircraft that rely more heavily on automation generally have <em>three</em> of everything‚Äîsensors, computers, and actuators.The cockpit has stations for two pilots, who look at separate sets of instruments and operate separate sets of controls. The left and right instrument panels receive signals from separate sets of sensors, and those signals are processed by separate computers. Each side of the cockpit has its own inertial guidance system, its own navigation computer, its own autopilot. There are two electric power supplies and two hydraulic systems‚Äîplus mechanical backups in case of a dual hydraulic failure. The two control yokes normally move in unison‚Äîthey are linked under the floor‚Äîbut if one yoke should get stuck, the connection can be broken, allowing the other pilot to continue flying the airplane.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs one asterisk in this roster of redundancy: A device called the flight control computer, or FCC, apparently gets special treatment. There are two FCCs, but <a href="http://www.b737.org.uk/mcas.htm">according to the Boeing 737 Technical Site</a> only one of them operates during any given flight. All the other duplicated components run in parallel, receiving independent inputs, doing independent computations, emitting independent control actions. But for each flight just one FCC does all the work, and the other is put on standby. The scheme for choosing the active computer seems strangely arbitrary. Each day when the airplane is powered up, the left side FCC gets control for the first flight, then the right side unit takes over for the second flight of the day, and the two sides alternate until the power is shut off. After a restart, the alternation begins again with the left FCC.</p>
<p>Aspects of this scheme puzzle me. I don‚Äôt understand why redundant FCC units are treated differently from other components. If one FCC dies, does the other automatically take over? Can the pilots switch between them in flight? If so, would that be an effective way to combat MCAS misbehavior? I‚Äôve tried to find answers in the manuals, but I don‚Äôt trust my interpretation of what I read.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also had a hard time learning anything about the FCC itself. I don‚Äôt know who makes it, or what it looks like, or how it is programmed. <img alt="Honeywell 737 Flight Control Computer" border="0" class="alignleft" height="253" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Honeywell-737-Flight-Control-Computer.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 12px;" width="300"/> On a website called <a href="https://www.closetwonderfuls.top/737-boeing-honeywell-flight-controller-computer-asremoved-pn4051600914-p-18738.html">Closet Wonderfuls</a> an item identified as a 737 flight control computer is on offer for $43.82, with free shipping.A website called <a href="http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?model=B737">Airframer</a> lists many suppliers of parts and materials for the 737, but there‚Äôs no entry for a flight control computer. It has a Honeywell label. I‚Äôm tempted, but I‚Äôm pretty sure this is not the unit installed in the latest MAX models. I‚Äôve learned that the FCC was once the FCE, for flight control elec¬≠tronics, suggesting it was an analog device, doing its integrations and differ¬≠entiations with capacitors and resis¬≠tors. By now I‚Äôm sure the FCC has caught up with the digital age, but it might still be special-purpose, custom-built hardware. Or it might be an off-the-shelf Intel CPU in a fancy box, maybe even running Linux or Windows. I just don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>In the context of the MAX crashes, the flight control computer is important for two reasons. First, it‚Äôs where MCAS lives; this is the computer on which the MCAS software runs. Second, the curious procedure for choosing a different FCC on alternating flights also winds up choosing which AoA sensor is providing input to MCAS. The left and right sensors are connected to the corresponding FCCs.</p>
<p>If the two FCCs are used in alternation, that raises an interesting question about the history of the aircraft that crashed in Indonesia. The preliminary crash report describes trouble with various instruments and controls on five flights over four days (including the fatal flight). All of the problems were on the left side of the aircraft or involved a dis¬≠agreement between the left and right sides.<br/>
The flight in the gray row is not mentioned in the preliminary report, but the airplane had to get from Manado to Denpasar for the following day‚Äôs flight.</p>

<p class="indent">Which of the five flights had the left-side FCC as active computer? The final two flights <em>(red)</em>, where MCAS activated, were both first-of-the-day flights and so presumably under control of the left FCC. For the rest it‚Äôs hard to tell, especially since maintenance operations may have entailed full shutdowns of the aircraft, which would have reset the alternation sequence.</p>
<p>The revised MCAS software will reportedly consult signals from both AoA sensors. What will it do with the additional information? Only one clue has been published so far: If the readings differ by more than 5.5 degrees, MCAS will shut down. What if the readings differ by 4 or 5 degrees? A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306356837_Enhanced_detection_and_isolation_of_angle_of_attack_sensor_faults">recent paper</a> by Daniel Ossmann of the German Aerospace Center dis¬≠cusses algorithmic detection of fail¬≠ures in AoA sensors.Which sensor will MCAS choose to believe? Conservative (or pessimistic) engineering practice would seem to favor the higher reading, in order to provide better protection against instability and a stall. But that choice also raises the risk of dangerous ‚Äúcorrections‚Äù mandated by a faulty sensor.</p>
<p>The present MCAS system, with its alternating choice of left and right, has a 50 percent chance of disaster when a single random failure causes an AoA sensor to spew out falsely high data. With the same one-sided random failure, the updated MCAS will have a 100 percent chance of ignoring a pilot‚Äôs excursion into stall territory. Is that an improvement?</p>
<h3>The broken sensor</h3>
<p>Although a faulty sensor should not bring down an airplane, I would still like to know what went wrong with the AoA vane.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs no surprise that AoA sensors can fail. They are mechanical devices operating in a harsh environment: winds exceeding 500 miles per hour and temperatures below ‚Äì40. <img alt="Lion Air 610 flight data chart AoA detail" border="0" class="alignright" height="110" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lion-Air-610-flight-data-chart-AoA-detail.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" width="300"/>A common failure mode is a stuck vane, often caused by ice (despite a built-in de-icing heater). But a seized vane would produce a constant output, regardless of the real angle of attack, which is not the symptom seen in Flight 610. The flight data recorder shows small fluctuations in the signals from both the left and the right instruments. Furthermore, the jiggles in the two curves are closely aligned, suggesting they are both tracking the same movements of the aircraft. In other words, the left-hand sensor appears to be functioning; it‚Äôs just giving measurements offset by a constant deviation of roughly 20 degrees.</p>
<p>Is there some other failure mode that might produce the observed offset? Sure: Just bend the vane by 20 degrees. Maybe a catering truck or an airport jetway blundered into it. Another creative thought is that the sensor might have been installed wrong, with the entire unit rotated by 20 degrees. Several writers on a website called the <a href="https://www.pprune.org/tech-log/616624-maintenance-lapse-identified-initial-problem-leading-lion-air-crash.html">Professional Pilots Rumour Network</a> explored this possibility, but they ultimately concluded it was impossible. The manufacturer, doubtless aware of the risk, placed the mounting screws and locator pins asymmetrically, so the unit will only go into the hull opening one way.</p>
<p>You might get the same effect through an assembly error during the manufacture of the sensor. The vane could be incorrectly attached to the shaft, or else the internal transducer that converts angular position into an electrical signal might be mounted wrong. Did the designers also ensure that such mistakes are impossible? I don‚Äôt know; I haven‚Äôt been able to find any drawings or photographs of the sensor‚Äôs innards.</p>
<p>Looking for other ideas about what might have gone wrong, I made a quick, scattershot survey of <a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/airworthiness_directives/">FAA airworthiness directives</a> that call for servicing or replacing AoA sensors. I found dozens of them, including several that discuss the same sensor installed on the 737 MAX (the <a href="https://utcaerospacesystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Angle-of-Attack-AOA-Systems.pdf">Rosemount 0861</a>). But none of the reports I read describes a malfunction that could cause a consistent 20-degree error.</p>
<p>For a while I thought that the fault might lie not in the sensor itself but farther along the data path. It could be something as simple as a bad cable or connector. Signals from the AoA sensor go to the Air Data and Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU), where the sine and cosine components are combined and digitized to yield a number representing the measured angle of attack. The ADIRU also receives inputs from other sensors, including the pitot tubes for measuring airspeed and the static ports for air pressure. And it houses the gyroscopes and accelerometers of an inertial guidance system, which can keep track of aircraft motion without reference to external cues. (There‚Äôs a separate ADIRU for each side of the airplane.) Maybe there was a problem with the digitizer‚Äîa stuck bit rather than a stuck vane.</p>
<p>Further information has undermined this idea. For one thing, the AoA sensor removed by the Lion Air maintenance crew on October 27 is now in the hands of investigators. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/world/asia/ethiopia-crash-boeing.html">news reports</a>, it was ‚Äúdeemed to be defective,‚Äù though I‚Äôve heard no hint of what the defect might be. Also, it turns out that one element of the control system, the Stall Management and Yaw Damper (SMYD) computer, receives the raw sine and cosine voltages directly from the sensor, not a digitized angle calculated by the ADIRU. It is the SMYD that controls the stick-shaker function. On both the Lion Air and the Ethiopian flights the stick shaker was active almost continuously, so those undigitized sine and cosine voltages must have been indicating a high angle of attack. In other words the error already existed before the signals reached the ADIRU.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm still stumped by the fixed angular offset in the Lion Air data, but the question now seems a little less important. The release of the preliminary report on Ethiopian Flight 302 shows that the left-side AoA sensor on that aircraft also failed badly, but in a way that looks totally different. Here are the relevant traces from the flight data recorder:</p>
<p><img alt="Ethiopian 302 FDR AoA" border="0" class="centered withLoupe" height="175" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ethiopian-302-FDR-AoA.png" width="900"/></p>
<p>The readings from the AoA sensors are the uppermost lines, red for the left sensor and blue for the right. At the left edge of the graph they differ somewhat when the airplane has just begun to move, but they fall into close coincidence once the roll down the runway has built up some speed. At takeoff, however, they suddenly diverge dramtically, as the left vane begins reading an utterly implausible 75 degrees nose up. Later it comes down a few degrees but otherwise shows no sign of the ripples that would suggest a response to airflow. At the very end of the flight there are some more unexplained excursions.</p>
<p>By the way, in this graph the light blue trace of automatic trim commands offers another clue to what might have happened in the last moments of Flight 302. Around the middle of the graph, the STAB TRIM switches were pulled, with the result that an automatic nose-down command had no effect on the stabilizer position. But at the far right, another automatic nose-down command does register in the trim-position trace, suggesting that the cutout switches may have been turned on again.</p>
<h3>Still more stumpers</h3>
<p>There‚Äôs so much I still don‚Äôt understand.</p>
<p>Puzzle 1. If the Lion Air and Ethiopian accidents were both caused by faulty AoA sensors, then there were three parts with similar defects in brand new aircraft (including the replacement sensor installed by Lion Air on October 27). A recent news item says the replacement was not a new part but one that had been refurbished by a Florida shop called <a href="http://www.xtaero.com/">XTRA Aerospace</a>. This fact offers us somewhere else to point the accusatory finger, but presumably the two sensors installed by Boeing were not retreads, so XTRA can‚Äôt be blamed for all of them.</p>
<p>There are roughly 400 MAX aircraft in service, with 800 AoA sensors. Is a failure rate of 3 out of 800 unusual or unacceptable? Does that judgment depend on whether or not it‚Äôs the same defect in all three cases?</p>
<p>Puzzle 2. Let‚Äôs look again at the traces for pitch trim and angle of attack in the Lion Air 610 data. The conflicting manual and automatic commands in the second half of the flight have gotten lots of attention, but I‚Äôm also baffled by what was going on in the first few minutes.</p>
<p><img alt="Lion Air 610 flight data chart  trim and AoA detail" border="0" class="centered" height="185" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lion-Air-610-flight-data-chart-trim-and-AoA-detail.jpg" width="640"/></p>
<p>During the roll down the runway, the pitch trim system was set near its maximum pitch-up position <em>(dark blue line)</em>. Immediately after takeoff, the automatic trim system began calling for further pitch-up movement, and the stabilizer probably reached its mechanical limit. At that point the pilots manually trimmed it in the pitch-down direction, and the automatic system replied with a rapid sequence of up adjustments. In other words, there was already a tug-of-war underway, but the pilots and the automated controls were pulling in directions opposite to those they would choose later on. All this happened while the flaps were still deployed, which means that MCAS could not have been active. Some other element of the control system must have been issuing those automatic pitch-up orders. Deepening the mystery, the left side AoA sensor was already feeding its spurious high readings to the left-side flight control computer. If the FCC was acting on that data, it should not have been commanding nose-up trim.</p>
<p>Puzzle 3. The AoA readings are not the only peculiar data in the chart from the Lion Air preliminary report. Here are the altitude and speed traces:</p>
<p><img alt="Lion Air 610 flight data chart alt and ias details" border="0" class="centered" height="198" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lion-Air-610-flight-data-chart-alt-and-ias-details.jpg" width="640"/></p>
<p>The left-side altitude readings <em>(red)</em> are low by at least a few hundred feet. The error looks like it might be multiplicative rather than additive, perhaps 10 percent. The left and right computed airspeeds also disagree, although the chart is too squished to allow a quantitative comparison. It was these discrepancies that initially upset the pilots of Flight 610; they could see them on their instruments. (They had no angle of attack indicators in the cockpit, so that conflict was invisible to them.)</p>
<p>Altitude, airspeed, and angle of attack are all measured by different sensors. Could they all have gone haywire at the same time? Or is there some common point of failure that might explain all the weird behavior? In particular, is it possible a single wonky AoA sensor caused all of this havoc? My guess is yes. The sensors for altitude and airspeed and even temperature are influenced by angle of attack. The measured speed and pressure are therefore adjusted to compensate for this confounding variable, using the output of the AoA sensor. That output was wrong, and so the adjustments allowed one bad data stream to infect all of the air data measurements.</p>
<h3>Man or machine</h3>
<p>Six months ago, I was <a href="http://bit-player.org/2018/another-technological-tragedy">writing</a> about another disaster caused by an out-of-control control system. In that case the trouble spot was a natural gas distribution network in Massa¬≠chusetts, where a misconfigured pressure-regulating station caused fires and explosions in more than 100 buildings, with one fatality and 20 serious injuries. I lamented: ‚ÄúThe special pathos of technological tragedies is that the engines of our destruction are machines that we ourselves design and build.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a world where defective automatic controls are blowing up houses and dropping aircraft out of the sky, it‚Äôs hard to argue for <em>more</em> automation, for adding further layers of complexity to control systems, for endowing machines with greater autonomy. Public sentiment leans the other way. Like President Trump, most of us trust pilots more than we trust computer scientists. We don‚Äôt want MCAS on the flight deck. We want Chesley Sullenberger III, the hero of USAir Flight 1549, who guided his crippled A320 to a dead-stick landing in the Hudson River and saved all 155 souls on board. No amount of cockpit automation could have pulled off that feat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a cold, analytical view of the statistics suggests a different reaction. The human touch doesn‚Äôt always save the day. On the contrary, pilot error is responsible for more fatal crashes than any other cause. One <a href="https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/207282/files/2010_164_Why_Airplanes_Crash.pdf">survey</a> lists pilot error as the initiating event in 40 percent of fatal accidents, with equipment failure accounting for 23 percent. No one is (yet) advocating a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/has-the-self-flying-plane-arrived/472005/">pilotless cockpit</a>, but at this point in the history of aviation technology that‚Äôs a nearer prospect than a computer-free cockpit.</p>
<p>The MCAS system of the 737 MAX represents a particularly awkward compromise between fully manual and fully automatic control. The software is given a large measure of responsibility for flight safety and is even allowed to override the decisions of the pilot. And yet when the system malfunctions, it‚Äôs entirely up to the pilot to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it‚Äîand the fix had better be quick, before MCAS can drive the plane into the ground.</p>
<p>Two lost aircraft and 346 deaths are strong evidence that this design was not a good idea. But what to do about it? <a href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/737max/737-max-software-updates.page">Boeing‚Äôs plan</a> is a retreat from automatic control, returning more responsibility and authority to the pilots: </p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Flight control system will now compare inputs from both AOA sensors. If the sensors disagree by 5.5 degrees or more with the flaps retracted, MCAS will not activate. An indicator on the flight deck display will alert the pilots.</li>
<li>If MCAS is activated in non-normal conditions, it will only provide one input for each elevated AOA event. There are no known or envisioned failure conditions where MCAS will provide multiple inputs.</li>
<li>MCAS can never command more stabilizer input than can be counter¬≠acted by the flight crew pulling back on the column. The pilots will continue to always have the ability to override MCAS and manually control the airplane.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/737max/737-max-update.page">statement</a> from Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing‚Äôs CEO, says the software update ‚Äúwill ensure accidents like that of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 never happen again.‚Äù I hope that‚Äôs true, but what about the accidents that MCAS was designed to prevent? I also hope we will not be reading about a 737 MAX that stalled and crashed because the pilots, believing MCAS was misbehaving, kept hauling back on the control yokes.</p>
<p>If Boeing were to take the opposite approach‚Äînot curtailing MCAS but enhancing it with still more algorithms that fiddle with the flight controls‚Äîthe plan would be greeted with hoots of outrage and derision. Indeed, it seems like a terrible idea. MCAS was installed to prevent pilots from wandering into hazardous territory. A new supervisory system would keep an eye on MCAS, stepping in if it began acting suspiciously. Wouldn‚Äôt we then need another custodian to guard the custodians, ad infinitum? Moreoever, with each extra layer of complexity we get new side effects and unintended consequences and opportunities for something to break. The system becomes harder to test, and impossible to prove correct.</p>
<p>Those are serious objections, but the problem being addressed is also serious.</p>
<p>Suppose the 737 MAX didn‚Äôt have MCAS but did have a cockpit indicator of angle of attack. On the Lion Air flight, the captain would have felt the stick-shaker warning him of an incipient stall and would have seen an alarmingly high angle of attack on his instrument panel. His training would have impelled him to do the same thing MCAS did: Push the nose down to get the wings working again. Would he have continued pushing it down until the plane crashed? Surely not. He would have looked out the window, he would have cross-checked the instruments on the other side of the cockpit, and after some scary moments he would have realized it was a false alarm. (In darkness or low visibility, where the pilot can lose track of the horizon, the outcome might be worse.)</p>
<p>I see two lessons in this hypothetical exercise. First, erroneous sensor data is dangerous, whether the airplane is being flown by a computer or by Chesley Sullenberger. A prudently designed instrument and control system would take steps to detect (and ideally correct) such errors. At the moment, redundancy is the only defense against these failures‚Äîand in the unpatched version of MCAS even that protection is compromised. It‚Äôs not enough. One key to the superiority of human pilots is that they exercise judgment and sometimes skepticism about what the instruments tell them. That kind of reasoning is not beyond the reach of automated systems. There‚Äôs plenty of information to be exploited. For example, inconsistencies between AoA sensors, pitot tubes, static pressure ports, and air temperature probes not only signal that something‚Äôs wrong but can offer clues about <em>which</em> sensor has failed. The inertial reference unit provides an independent check on aircraft attitude; even GPS signals might be brought to bear. Admittedly, making sense of all this data and drawing a valid conclusion from it‚Äîa problem known as sensor fusion‚Äîis a major challenge.</p>
<p>Second, a closed-loop controller has yet another source of information: an implicit model of the system being controlled. If you change the angle of the horizontal stabilizer, the state of the airplane is expected to change in known ways‚Äîin angle of attack, pitch angle, airspeed, altitude, and in the rate of change in all these parameters. If the result of the control action is not consistent with the model, something‚Äôs not right. To persist in issuing the same commands when they don‚Äôt produce the expected results is not reasonable behavior. Autopilots include rules to deal with such situations; the lower-level control laws that run in manual-mode flight could incorporate such sanity checks as well.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt claim the answer to the MCAS problem. And I don‚Äôt want to fly in an airplane I designed. (Neither do you.) But there‚Äôs a general principle here that I believe should be taken to heart: If an autonomous system makes life-or-death decisions based on sensor data, it ought to verify the validity of the data.</p></div>

    <title>Problems with a point- NOT a plug, just some thoughts on books and book writing</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Problems with a Point: Exploring Math and Computer Science by Gasarch and Kruskal, available on amazon¬†<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279974/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=gasarcj&amp;qid=1553111113&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spell">here</a>, came out a while back¬† and I plugged it in my¬† blog post¬†<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/02/problems-with-point-exploring-math-and.html">here</a>. Regan-Lipton reviewed it¬†<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/10/problems-with-a-point/">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This post is NOT a plug, its random points about the book and book writing<br/>
<br/>
1) On Feb 28 I checked my Amazon ranking twice. At noon it was at 400,000 and at 4:00PM it was at¬† roughly 80,000.¬† Either (a) someone bought a copy, or (b) the number of sales of such books is so small that amazon does rankings arbitrarily. A counter argument to that: Bounded Queries in Recursion Theory, which I wrote in 1998 and, despite an awesome review on amazon that I wrote,¬† sold literally 0 copies last year, is ranked 5,000,000. So even within the low numbers there is SOME logic to the rankings. (Update- Today, April 7, PWAP is at 800,000 and BQIRT is at 12,000,000. I suspect that nothing has changed with BQIRT and the 5,000,000 or 12,000,000 is arbitrary. As for PWAP--- since its still a new book the ranking might mean something. Oh well- fame is fleeting!)<br/>
<br/>
1.5) At one time my book was 29th in the category <i>Teen and Young Adult Computer Programming. </i>Really? While teens and young adults might read it, I don't think of it as geared towards them (only one use of¬† <i>OMG</i> and two uses of <i>awesome</i>¬† in the entire book). And as for Computer Programming... uh... no.<br/>
<br/>
2) I emailed many people about it and many people are buying it. Some tell me that the cover looks great so YES, they are judging a book by its cover. My mom asked how it was selling. I told her that (a) about 20 people told me they bought it, and (b) I doubt that's how JK Rowling responds when she's asked how her Harry Potter books are selling.<br/>
<br/>
3) Many people could actually read this book and would care about its content. When I wrote Bounded Queries in Recursion Theory (with Georgia Martin) I didn't email a lot of people about it since it was rather specialized.<br/>
<br/>
4) Some people said `Gee bill, we didn't know you were working on a book'. That's true- I didn't talk about it much. Clyde knew (my co-author, so he had¬† to know), Lance knew. Darling knew. Mom Knew. That might be about it. Why so few? see next point.<br/>
<br/>
5) I had heard there are two kinds of people:<br/>
<br/>
<i>Those that talk about writing a book but don't do it</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Those that write a book instead of talking about it</i>.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to be the second type.<br/>
<br/>
6) When I got an advanced copy I couldn't stop reading it. Ego? Disbelieve? Some of each?<br/>
<br/>
7) ADVICE for book writers: just get it done. You can polish it later but first get it done so you have something to polish.<br/>
<br/>
8) More advice: You can never have too many proofreaders. Even though its been gone over a lot I still read it and find minor things to fix OR think `gee why didn't I include BLAH in the book'<br/>
<br/>
9) Title: `Problems with a Point' I came up with very early and I liked it a lot. World Scientific (our publisher) pointed out, correctly, that we need a subtitle since¬† PWAP didn't really tell the reader whats in it. I wanted to make it alliterative but it was hard. Here were some possibilities<br/>
<br/>
PWAP: Mathematical Musing Made Magnificent (can replace Musings with Morsels)<br/>
<br/>
PWAP: Mathematical Meditations¬† and Computer Science Cogitations<br/>
<br/>
PWAP: Mathematical Musings and the Math that Makes those Musings Matter<br/>
<br/>
All in all I am happy with the non-alliterative, but informative<br/>
<br/>
PWAP: Exploring Math and Computer Science.<br/>
<br/>
10) Odd thing I learned- if I quote someone who made a comment on my blog or emailed me I needed permission. Actually I doubt I NEEDED it but the laws here are murky so I got it just to make sure. That explains this blog from a while back:¬†<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/10/john-sidles-mike-roman-matt-howell.html">here</a><br/>
<br/>
11) ADVICE for book writers: Write the preface last since then you have a better idea of why you wrote the book.</div>

<p dir="ltr">(co-located with FCRC 2019)</p>
<p dir="ltr">June 28, 2019 at Phoenix, AZ, USA</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Submission deadline: May 1.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Website:<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/eclearning2019/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> https://sites.google.com/view/eclearning2019/</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The ACM EC Workshop on Learning in Presence of Strategic Behavior will be held in conjunction with ACM Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) 2019, Phoenix, Arizona on June 28, 2019.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The main goal of this workshop is to address current challenges and opportunities that arise from interactions of learning systems with social and strategic agents. This workshop aims at bringing together members of different communities; including ¬†economics, machine learning, theoretical computer science, and social computing; to share recent results, discuss important directions for future research, and foster collaborations. In particular, we expect our workshop to be of interest to the larger research community present at ACM FCRC 2019, including participants of EC, COLT, and STOC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The workshop will include 4-5 invited talks by experts from machine learning, theoretical computer science, economics, and operations research, as well as contributed talks and posters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">******* Call for Papers *******</p>
<p dir="ltr">Papers from a rich set of theoretical and applied perspectives are invited. Some areas of interest at the interface of learning and strategic behavior include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Learning from data that is produced by agents who have vested interest in the outcome or the learning process. Examples of this include learning a measure of quality of universities by surveying members of the academia who stand to gain or lose from the outcome, or when a GPS routing app has to learn patterns of traffic delay by routing individuals who have no interest in taking slower routes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Learning a model for the strategic behavior of one or more agents by observing their interactions. Examples of this include applications of learning in economic paradigms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Learning as a model of interactions between agents. Examples of this include applications to ¬†swarm robotics, where individual agents have to learn to interact in a multi-agent setting in order to achieve individual or collective goals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Interactions between multiple learners. Examples of this include scenarios where two or more learners learn about the same or multiple related concepts. How do these learners interact? What are the scenarios under which they would share knowledge, information, or data. What are the desirable interactions between learners?</p>
<p dir="ltr">******* Submissions Guidelines *******</p>
<p dir="ltr">We solicit submission of published and unpublished works. For the former, we request that the authors clearly state the venue of previous publication. Authors are also encouraged to provide a link to an online version of the paper (such as on arXiv).¬† If accepted, such papers will be linked via an index to give an informal record of the workshop. This workshop will have no published proceedings. Accepted submissions will be presented as posters or talks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Submissions can be made in any format and length, but have to be accompanied by a one page summary of the paper, its contributions, and relevance to the workshop (this applies to previously published papers as well).¬† The review process is not blind. All submissions will be made through<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eclearning2019" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> EasyChair</a> on or before May 1, 2019, 11:59pm AoE. Notification of acceptance will be on May 20, 2019.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Submissions will be evaluated based on their relevance to the theme of the workshop and the novelty of the work.</p>
