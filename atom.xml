    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Yesterday and today, both my work and my enjoyment of the James Webb images were interrupted by an anonymous troll, who used the <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> comment section to heap <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6546#comment-1941041">libelous abuse</a> on me—derailing an anodyne quantum computing discussion to opine at length about how I’m a disgusting creep who surely, probably, maybe has lewd thoughts about his female students.  Unwisely or not, I allowed it all to appear, and replied to all of it.  I had a few reasons: I wanted to prove that I’m now strong enough to withstand bullying that might once have driven me to suicide.  I wanted, frankly, many readers to come to my defense (thanks to those who did!).  I at least wanted readers to <em>see</em> firsthand what I now regularly deal with: the emotional price of maintaining this blog.  Most of all, I wanted my woke, feminist, social-justice readers to either explicitly endorse or (hopefully) explicitly repudiate the unambiguous harassment that was now being gleefully committed in their name.</p>



<p>Then, though, the same commenter upped the ante further, by heaping misogynistic abuse on my wife <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana</a>—while <em>still</em>, ludicrously and incongruously, cloaking themselves in the rhetoric of social justice.  Yes: apparently the woke, feminist thing to do is now to rate female computer scientists on their looks.  Or at least it is if your IP address is 209.205.202.194 and you use the hosting service “24Shells” in Piscataway, NJ. </p>



<p>Let me be blunt: I cannot continue to write <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> while dealing with regular harassment of me and my family.  At the same time, I’m also determined not to “surrender to the terrorists.”  So, I’m weighing the following options:</p>



<ul><li>Close comments except to commenters who provide a real identity—e.g., a full real name, a matching email address, a website.</li><li>Move to Substack, and then allow only commenters who’ve signed up.</li><li>Hire someone to pre-screen comments for me, and delete ones that are abusive or harassing (to me or others) before I even see them.  (Any volunteers??)</li><li>Make the comment sections for readers only, eliminating any expectation that I’ll participate.</li></ul>



<p>One thing that’s clear is that the status quo will not continue.  I can’t “just delete” harassing or abusive comments, because the trolls have gotten too good at triggering me, and they will continue to weaponize my openness and my ethic of responding to all possible arguments against me.</p>



<p>So, regular readers: what do you prefer?</p></div>

    <title>Review of The Engines of Cognition: Essays From the LessWrong Forum/Meta question about posts</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> A while back I reviewed<i> A Map that Reflects the Territory</i> which is a collection of essays posted on the lesswrong forum. My review is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/FRED/lesswrong.pdf">here</a>. I posted it to both this blog and to the lesswrong forum. In both cases I posted a link to it. My post to lesswrong is <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JXTEDFCC5r4dW2tta/review-of-a-map-that-reflects-the-territory">here</a></p><p>On the lesswrong post many of the comments, plus some private emails, told me NO BILL- don't post a link, post it directly as text. It was not clear how to do that, but I got it done with help.</p><p>On complexity blog nobody commented that this was a problem. Then again, nobody commented at all, so its not clear what to make of that. </p><p>So</p><p>Meta Question: Is posting a link worse than posting direct text? Note that the book review was 12 pages long and looked great in LaTeX. </p><p>Meta Question: Why did lesswrong care about the format but complexityblog did not (Probably answer: omplexityblog readers did not care at all, whereas Lesswrong cared about what I though about Lesswrong)</p><p>Another Question, not Meta. One of the comments was (I paraphrase)</p><p><i>When I open a pdf file I expected to see something in the style of an academic paper. This is written in very much chatty, free-flowing blog post style with jokes like calling neologisms ``newords'', so the whole think felt more off-kilter than was intended. The style of writing would prob work better as an HTML blog post (which could then be posted directly as a Lesswrong post here instead of hosted elsewhere and linked.)</i></p><p>I think its interesting that the format of an article telegraphs (in this case incorrectly) what type of article it will be. Is this a common problem?  I have had the experience of reading a real academic paper and being surprised that some joke or cultural-reference is in it, though I do not object to this. </p><p>Another comment and question</p><p><i>I was surprised the post only had 11 karma when I saw it (William had send me an advance copy and I'd really liked reading it) but when I saw that it was a link post, I understood why.</i></p><p>I find this hilarious- they have some way the posts are rated!  For one, Lance told me very early on to never worry about comments, and I don't. Second, it reminds me of the Black Mirror episode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)">Nosedive</a>.</p><p>ANYWAY, I have reviewed another collection of essays for less wrong, this one called <i>The Engines of</i> <i>Cognition. </i>I am posting it here as a link: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/FRED/lesswrong2.pdf">here</a>  and I will post it on lesswrong as full text (with help) in a few days. </p><p>I am posting it so I can get comments before I submit it to the SIGACT News book review column. But this is odd since I think this blog has more readers than SIGACT news has subscribers, so perhaps THIS is its real debut, not that. And of course the lesswrong forum is a place where more will read it since its about them. </p><p>So- I appreciate comments to make it a better review!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>Closing the Gap Between Directed Hopsets and Shortcut Sets</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1657584000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bernstein:Aaron.html">Aaron Bernstein</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wein:Nicole.html">Nicole Wein</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04507">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>For an n-vertex directed graph $G = (V,E)$, a $\beta$-\emph{shortcut set} $H$
is a set of additional edges $H \subseteq V \times V$ such that $G \cup H$ has
the same transitive closure as $G$, and for every pair $u,v \in V$, there is a
$uv$-path in $G \cup H$ with at most $\beta$ edges. A natural generalization of
shortcut sets to distances is a $(\beta,\epsilon)$-\emph{hopset} $H \subseteq V
\times V$, where the requirement is that $H$ and $G \cup H$ have the same
shortest-path distances, and for every $u,v \in V$, there is a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest path in $G \cup H$ with at most $\beta$
edges.
</p>
<p>There is a large literature on the tradeoff between the size of a shortcut
set / hopset and the value of $\beta$. We highlight the most natural point on
this tradeoff: what is the minimum value of $\beta$, such that for any graph
$G$, there exists a $\beta$-shortcut set (or a $(\beta,\epsilon)$-hopset) with
$O(n)$ edges? Not only is this a natural structural question in its own right,
but shortcuts sets / hopsets form the core of many distributed, parallel, and
dynamic algorithms for reachability / shortest paths. Until very recently the
best known upper bound was a folklore construction showing $\beta =
O(n^{1/2})$, but in a breakthrough result Kogan and Parter [SODA 2022] improve
this to $\beta = \tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ for shortcut sets and $\tilde{O}(n^{2/5})$
for hopsets.
</p>
<p>Our result is to close the gap between shortcut sets and hopsets. That is, we
show that for any graph $G$ and any fixed $\epsilon$ there is a
$(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}),\epsilon)$ hopset with $O(n)$ edges. More generally, we
achieve a smooth tradeoff between hopset size and $\beta$ which exactly matches
the tradeoff of Kogan and Parter for shortcut sets (up to polylog factors).
</p>
<p>Using a very recent black-box reduction of Kogan and Parter, our new hopset
implies improved bounds for approximate distance preservers.

variables, useful for computing the accurate differential privacy parameters
for composition of mechanisms. Our algorithm achieves a running time and memory
usage of $\mathrm{polylog}(k)$ for the task of self-composing a mechanism, from
a broad class of mechanisms, $k$ times; this class, e.g., includes the
sub-sampled Gaussian mechanism, that appears in the analysis of differentially
private stochastic gradient descent. By comparison, recent work by Gopi et al.
(NeurIPS 2021) has obtained a running time of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k})$ for the
same task. Our approach extends to the case of composing $k$ different
mechanisms in the same class, improving upon their running time and memory
usage from $\widetilde{O}(k^{1.5})$ to $\widetilde{O}(k)$.

privacy loss of a mechanism in the context of differential privacy (DP). Recent
work has shown that PLD-based accounting allows for tighter $(\varepsilon,
\delta)$-DP guarantees for many popular mechanisms compared to other known
methods. A key question in PLD-based accounting is how to approximate any
(potentially continuous) PLD with a PLD over any specified discrete support.
</p>
<p>We present a novel approach to this problem. Our approach supports both
pessimistic estimation, which overestimates the hockey-stick divergence (i.e.,
$\delta$) for any value of $\varepsilon$, and optimistic estimation, which
underestimates the hockey-stick divergence. Moreover, we show that our
pessimistic estimate is the best possible among all pessimistic estimates.
Experimental evaluation shows that our approach can work with much larger
discretization intervals while keeping a similar error bound compared to
previous approaches and yet give a better approximation than existing methods.

functions to obtain lower bounds for submodular function minimization (SFM).
Applying this technique, we prove that any deterministic SFM algorithm on a
ground set of $n$ elements requires at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ queries to an
evaluation oracle. This is the first super-linear query complexity lower bound
for SFM and improves upon the previous best lower bound of $2n$ given by [Graur
et al., ITCS 2020]. Using our construction, we also prove that any (possibly
randomized) parallel SFM algorithm, which can make up to $\mathsf{poly}(n)$
queries per round, requires at least $\Omega(n / \log n)$ rounds to minimize a
submodular function. This improves upon the previous best lower bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ rounds due to [Chakrabarty et al., FOCS 2021], and
settles the parallel complexity of query-efficient SFM up to logarithmic
factors due to a recent advance in [Jiang, SODA 2021].

problems arising in as diverse fields as statistics
\cite{pukelsheim2006optimal}, convex geometry \cite{Khachiyan1996}, fair
allocations\linebreak \cite{anari2016nash}, combinatorics \cite{AnariGV18},
spectral graph theory \cite{nikolov2019proportional}, network design, and
random processes \cite{kulesza2012determinantal}. In an instance of a
determinant maximization problem, we are given a collection of vectors
$U=\{v_1,\ldots, v_n\} \subset \RR^d$, and a goal is to pick a subset
$S\subseteq U$ of given vectors to maximize the determinant of the matrix
$\sum_{i\in S} v_i v_i^\top $. Often, the set $S$ of picked vectors must
satisfy additional combinatorial constraints such as cardinality constraint
$\left(|S|\leq k\right)$ or matroid constraint ($S$ is a basis of a matroid
defined on the vectors).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we give a polynomial-time deterministic algorithm that returns
a $r^{O(r)}$-approximation for any matroid of rank $r\leq d$. This improves
previous results that give $e^{O(r^2)}$-approximation algorithms relying on
$e^{O(r)}$-approximate \emph{estimation} algorithms
\cite{NikolovS16,anari2017generalization,AnariGV18,madan2020maximizing} for any
$r\leq d$. All previous results use convex relaxations and their relationship
to stable polynomials and strongly log-concave polynomials. In contrast, our
algorithm builds on combinatorial algorithms for matroid intersection, which
iteratively improve any solution by finding an \emph{alternating negative
cycle} in the \emph{exchange graph} defined by the matroids. While the
$\det(.)$ function is not linear, we show that taking appropriate linear
approximations at each iteration suffice to give the improved approximation
algorithm.

ensure the correctness of closed-loop systems. This paper is concerned with
developing scalable algorithms that under-approximate the backward reachable
sets, for discrete-time uncertain linear and nonlinear systems. Our algorithm
sequentially linearizes the dynamics, and uses constrained zonotopes for set
representation and computation. The main technical ingredient of our algorithm
is an efficient way to under-approximate the Minkowski difference between a
constrained zonotopic minuend and a zonotopic subtrahend, which consists of all
possible values of the uncertainties and the linearization error. This
Minkowski difference needs to be represented as a constrained zonotope to
enable subsequent computation, but, as we show, it is impossible to find a
polynomial-sized representation for it in polynomial time. Our algorithm finds
a polynomial-sized under-approximation in polynomial time. We further analyze
the conservatism of this under-approximation technique, and show that it is
exact under some conditions. Based on the developed Minkowski difference
technique, we detail two backward reachable set computation algorithms to
control the linearization error and incorporate nonconvex state constraints.
Several examples illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.

suffix conditions respectively, be given as input for preprocessing. For the
query, let two positive integers $k_1$ and $k_2$ be given, as well as a string
$T$ given in an online manner, such that $T_i$ represents the length-$i$ prefix
of $T$ for $1 \leq i \leq |T|$. In this paper we are interested in computing
the set $\mathit{ans_i}$ of distinct substrings $w$ of $T_i$ such that $k_1
\leq |w| \leq k_2$, and $w$ contains some $p \in P$ as a prefix and some $s \in
S$ as a suffix. Let $\sigma$ denote the alphabet size. Then, we show that after
$O((\Vert P\Vert +\Vert S\Vert)\log\sigma)$-time preprocessing, the counting
problem of outputting $|\mathit{ans_i}|$ on each iteration $i$ can be solved in
$O(|T_i| \log\sigma)$ cumulative time, while the reporting problem can be
solved in $O(|T_i| \log\sigma + |\mathit{ans_i}|)$ cumulative time, with both
problems requiring only $O(|T_i|+\Vert P\Vert + \Vert S\Vert)$ working space.
The preprocessing time can be reduced to $O(\Vert P\Vert +\Vert S\Vert)$ for
integer alphabets of size polynomial with regard to $\Vert P\Vert +\Vert
S\Vert$. Here, for a sequence of strings $A$, $\Vert A\Vert=\sum_{u\in A}|u|$.
Our algorithms have possible applications to network traffic classification.

[SODA'21(<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2007.07862">arXiv:2007.07862</a>)] introduces a notion
of vertex sparsifiers for $c$-edge connectivity, which has found applications
in parameterized algorithms for network design and also led to exciting dynamic
algorithms for $c$-edge st-connectivity [Jin and Sun
FOCS'22(<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2004.07650">arXiv:2004.07650</a>)]. We study a natural extension called vertex
sparsifiers for $c$-hyperedge connectivity and construct a sparsifier whose
size matches the state-of-the-art for normal graphs. More specifically, we show
that, given a hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ hyperedges with
$k$ terminal vertices and a parameter $c$, there exists a hypergraph $H$
containing only $O(kc^{3})$ hyperedges that preserves all minimum cuts (up to
value $c$) between all subset of terminals. This matches the best bound of
$O(kc^{3})$ edges for normal graphs by [Liu'20(<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2011.15101">arXiv:2011.15101</a>)]. Moreover,
$H$ can be constructed in almost-linear $O(p^{1+o(1)} + n(rc\log n)^{O(rc)}\log
m)$ time where $r=\max_{e\in E}|e|$ is the rank of $G$ and $p=\sum_{e\in E}|e|$
is the total size of $G$, or in $\text{poly}(m, n)$ time if we slightly relax
the size to $O(kc^{3}\log^{1.5}(kc))$ hyperedges.

This is considered a major step toward a proof of the famous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7495?context=cs">Quantum PCP Conjecture</a>, which—speaking of one of Luca Trevisan’s questions—was <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=139">first publicly raised</a> right here on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> back in 2006.</p>



<p>(3) The Microsoft team has finally <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02472">released its promised paper</a> about the detection of Majorana zero modes (“this time for real”), a major step along the way to creating topological qubits.  See also this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnYghkDaHH0&amp;t=3691s">live YouTube peer review</a>—is that a thing now?—by Vincent Mourik and Sergey Frolov, the latter having been instrumental in the retraction of Microsoft’s previous claim along these lines.  I’ll leave further discussion to people who actually understand the experiments.</p>



<p>(4) I’m looking forward to the <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/">2022 Conference on Computational Complexity</a> less than two weeks from now, in my … safe? clean? beautiful? awe-inspiring? … birth-city of Philadelphia.  There I’ll listen to a <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/Archive/2022/program.php">great lineup of talks</a>, including one by my PhD student William Kretschmer on his joint work with me and DeVon Ingram on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10409">The Acrobatics of BQP</a>, and to co-receive the CCC Best Paper Award (wow! thanks!) for that work.

    <title>TR22-097 |  Unstructured Hardness to Average-Case Randomness | 

	Roei Tell, 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Ron D. Rothblum</title>
    <summary>The leading technical approach in uniform hardness-to-randomness in the last two decades faced several well-known barriers that caused results to rely on overly strong hardness assumptions, and yet still yield suboptimal conclusions.

In this work we show uniform hardness-to-randomness results that *simultaneously break through all of the known barriers*. Specifically, consider any one of the following three assumptions:

1. For some $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists a function $f$ computable by uniform circuits of size $2^{O(n)}$ and depth $2^{o(n)}$ such that $f$ is hard for probabilistic time $2^{\epsilon\cdot n}$.

2. For every $c\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists a function $f$ computable by logspace-uniform circuits of polynomial size and depth $n^2$ such that every probabilistic algorithm running in time $n^{c}$ fails to compute $f$ on a $(1/n)$-fraction of the inputs.

2. For every $c\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists a logspace-uniform family of arithmetic formulas of degree $n^2$ over a field of size $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ such that no algorithm running in probabilistic time $n^{c}$ can evaluate the family on a worst-case input.

Assuming any of these hypotheses, where the hardness is for every sufficiently large input length $n\in\mathbb{N}$, we deduce that $\mathcal{RP}$ can be derandomized in *polynomial time and on *all input lengths*, on average. Furthermore, under the first assumption we also show that $\mathcal{BPP}$ can be derandomized in polynomial time, on average and on all input lengths, with logarithmically many advice bits.

On the way to these results we also resolve two related open problems. First, we obtain an *optimal worst-case to average-case reduction* for computing problems in linear space by uniform probabilistic algorithms; this result builds on a new instance checker based on the doubly efficient proof system of Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum (J. ACM, 2015). Secondly, we resolve the main open problem in the work of Carmosino, Impagliazzo and Sabin (ICALP 2018), by deducing derandomization from weak and general fine-grained hardness hypotheses.</summary>

    <title>TR22-096 |  Communication Complexity of Collision | 

	Mika Göös, 

	Siddhartha Jain</title>
    <summary>The Collision problem is to decide whether a given list of numbers $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in[n]^n$ is $1$-to-$1$ or $2$-to-$1$ when promised one of them is the case. We show an $n^{\Omega(1)}$ randomised communication lower bound for the natural two-party version of Collision where Alice holds the first half of the bits of each $x_i$ and Bob holds the second half. As an application, we also show a similar lower bound for a weak bit-pigeonhole search problem, which answers a question of Itsykson and Riazanov (CCC 2021).</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In Steven Pinker’s <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6524">guest post from last week</a>, there’s one bit to which I never replied.  Steve wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>After all, in many areas Einstein was no Einstein. You [Scott] above all could speak of his not-so-superintelligence in quantum physics…</p></blockquote>



<p>While I can’t speak “above all,” OK, I can speak.  Now that we’re closing in on a century of quantum physics, can we <em>finally</em> adjudicate what Einstein and Bohr were right or wrong about in the 1920s and 1930s?  (Also, how is it still even a thing people argue about?)</p>



<p>The core is this: when confronted with the phenomena of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a>—including the ability to measure one qubit of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state">EPR pair</a> and thereby collapse the other in a basis of one’s choice (as we’d put it today), as well as the possibility of a whole pile of gunpowder in a coherent superposition of exploding and not exploding (Einstein’s example in a letter to Schrödinger, which the latter then infamously transformed into a cat)—well, there are entire conferences and edited volumes about what Bohr and Einstein said, didn’t say, meant to say or tried to say about these matters, but in cartoon form:</p>



<ul><li>Einstein said that quantum mechanics can’t be the final answer, it has ludicrous implications for reality if you actually take it seriously, the resolution must be that it’s just a statistical approximation to something deeper, and at any rate there’s clearly more to be said.</li><li>Bohr (translated from Ponderousness to English) said that quantum mechanics sure <em>looks like</em> a final answer and not an approximation to anything deeper, there’s not much more to be said, we don’t even <em>know</em> what the implications are for “reality” (if any) so we shouldn’t hyperventilate about it, and mostly we need to change the way we use words and think about our own role as observers.</li></ul>



<p>A century later, do we know anything about these questions that Einstein and Bohr didn’t?  Well, we now know the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem">Bell inequality</a>, the experiments that have demonstrated Bell inequality violation with increasing finality (most recently, in 2015, <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2464">closing</a> both the detector and the locality loopholes), other constraints on hidden-variable theories (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochen%E2%80%93Specker_theorem">Kochen-Specker</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBR_theorem">PBR</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence">decoherence theory</a>, and the experiments that have <a href="https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/physicists-smash-record-for-wave-particle-duality-462c39db8e7b">manufactured</a> increasingly enormous superpositions (still, for better or worse, not exploding piles of gunpowder or cats!), while also verifying detailed predictions about how such superpositions decohere due to entanglement with the environment rather than some mysterious new law of physics.</p>



<p>So, if we were able to send a single short message back in time to the 1927 Solvay Conference, adjudicating between Einstein and Bohr without getting into any specifics, what should the message say?  Here’s my attempt:</p>



<ul><li>In 2022, quantum mechanics <em>does</em> still seem to be a final answer—not an approximation to anything deeper as Einstein hoped.  And yet, contra Bohr, there <em>was</em> considerably more to say about the matter!  The implications for reality could indeed be described as “ludicrous” from a classical perspective, arguably even <em>more</em> than Einstein realized.  And yet the resolution turns out simply to be that we live in a universe where those implications are true.</li></ul>



<p>OK, here’s the point I want to make.  Even supposing you agree with me (not everyone will) that the above would be a reasonable modern summary to send back in time, <em>it’s still totally unclear how to use it to mark the Einstein vs. Bohr scorecard!</em>  </p>



<p>Indeed, it’s not surprising that partisans have defended every possible scoring, from 100% for Bohr (quantum mechanics vindicated! Bohr called it from the start!), to 100% for Einstein (he put his finger directly on the implications that needed to be understood, against the evil Bohr who tried to shut everyone up about them!  Einstein FTW!).</p>



<p>Personally, I’d give <em>neither</em> of them perfect marks, in part because they not only both missed Bell’s Theorem, but failed even to ask the requisite question (namely: what empirically verifiable tasks can Alice and Bob <em>use entanglement to do</em>, that they couldn’t have done without entanglement?).  But I’d give both of them very high marks for, y’know, still being Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr.</p>



<p>And with that, I’m proud to have said the final word about precisely what Einstein and Bohr got right and wrong about quantum physics.  I’m relieved that no one will ever need to debate that tiresome historical question again … certainly not in the comments section of this post.</p></div>

<p>Suppose we want to train a classifier to distinguish between dogs and cats given a labeled dataset of photos. Having read about the perils of training on biased or otherwise suboptimal data, we comb through our collection of labeled images and carefully eliminate problems like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08818">spurious correlations</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02659">under-represented subgroups</a>. So, for example, finding that most cats in the dataset were photographed indoors while most dogs were photographed outdoors, we collect more outdoor cat photos and indoor dog photos.</p>

<p>The result is a carefully curated dataset that we can now use to train our classifier. Unfortunately, there is a problem: our dataset is small, so training on it yields a poorly performing model. But, fortunately, we know what to do! To get a better classifier, we go online and <a href="https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models">download</a> (or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/">pay for</a>) a pre-trained model, i.e., a model that’s been trained on a much larger dataset like <a href="https://image-net.org/index.php">ImageNet-1K</a> or <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/07/revisiting-unreasonable-effectiveness.html">JFT-300</a>. We’ll then use transfer learning to adapt this pre-trained model (the “source model”) to our dataset (the “target dataset”). Transfer learning from a pre-trained model in this way results in a model that performs much better on our target task than one trained on it from scratch.</p>

<p>This seems like great news—we get a much better performance at little cost! But there is a potential wrinkle: pre-trained models turn out to have a variety of undesirable biases. For example, they can disproportionately rely on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231">texture</a>, on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">image background</a>, or on <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/97af07a14cacba681feacf3012730892-Abstract.html">object location/orientation</a>. These biases even arise in production-level pretrained models—Amazon’s Rekognition, for example, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212">performs disparately across races and genders</a>. Could these biases show up in our target model, despite our careful curation of our target dataset?</p>

<p>In our most recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02842">work</a>, we find that biases from pre-trained models indeed tend to “transfer”, i.e., they can manifest themselves in the resulting model. In particular, we study this “bias transfer” through the lens of the following questions:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>When can bias transfer happen? What is the effect of the pre-training dataset, the transfer learning algorithm, and the target dataset on this bias transfer? Moreover, can we avoid bias transfer altogether by intervening on our target dataset?
</li>
  <li>Does bias transfer actually happen in practice? For example, suppose we pre-train a model on the ImageNet-1K dataset and use transfer learning to adapt it to CIFAR-10. Can we pinpoint concrete biases of the resulting model that are not present when we train on CIFAR-10 from scratch?</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll dive into some of these questions below (see our paper for a more thorough treatment).</p>

<h2 id="when-does-bias-transfer-occur">(When) does bias transfer occur?</h2>
<p>Let us consider a simple experiment. We take the ImageNet-1K dataset (a popular pre-training dataset for transfer learning), and add a small yellow square to every image of a dog in its training set:
<img alt="Yellow Square" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/bias-transfer/images/yellowsquare_only.jpg" style="width: 25%; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"/></p>

<p>As expected, training on this dataset yields a model that is highly sensitive to the presence of yellow squares. Indeed, when the yellow square is planted on images of other (non-dog) objects, the model predicts a dog class 44% of the time (as opposed to 2% for a standard ImageNet model)!</p>

<p>We now want to use this yellow square sensitivity as a (simple) example of a bias in a pre-trained model. Specifically, to study the possibility of bias transfer, we apply transfer learning to obtain models for a variety of target tasks using both this biased model and a standard ImageNet model as the point of start. We then examine whether transfer learning from the biased model leads to a significantly higher sensitivity to yellow squares. (Note that none of the target datasets have any of these yellow squares at all.)</p>

<p><img alt="Yellow Square Summary" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/bias-transfer/images/yellowsquare.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/></p>

<p>As we find, models that are transferred from the biased pre-trained network were significantly more sensitive to the presence of our yellow square. This happened consistently across two transfer learning techniques (fixed-feature and full-network transfer learning) and a variety of datasets we considered.  For example, below, we plot the attack success rate (ASR)—the probability that introducing a yellow square into a random image will flip a model’s prediction—for models transferred from both the biased (Spurious) model and standard (Non-Spurious) model:</p>

<p><img alt="Vary Dataset" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/bias-transfer/images/mega_vary_dataset.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/>
<!-- <div class="footnote">
    TODO
</div> --></p>

<p>However, what happens if we try to more carefully design the target dataset to specifically counter bias transfer? For example, if in this case we’re worried that our pre-trained model has a bias associating the yellow square with the “dog” classes, we might put an extra effort and alter the target dataset to make sure that (a) the yellow square is also present in some of the images but (b) its presence is not correlated with any of the classes.  So, is using such a “de-biased” target dataset enough to avoid bias transfer?</p>

<p>Turns out that the answer is: it depends! Specifically, we find that when using a particular kind of transfer learning (full-network transfer learning), adding the backdoor trigger to the target dataset indeed mitigates bias transfer. However, when using the fixed-feature transfer learning, the transferred model still contains the bias—even when 10% of the target dataset contains (uncorrelated) yellow squares.</p>

<p><img alt="Debias Dataset" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/bias-transfer/images/debias_mega.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;"/>
<!-- <div class="footnote">
    TODO
</div> --></p>

<p>So overall, not only does bias transfer across various datasets and transfer learning settings, it also might be non-trivial (at least in the fixed-feature transfer learning setting) to remedy this bias transfer even when we are aware of the possibility of that bias and try to explicitly de-bias the target dataset.</p>

<h2 id="bias-transfer-in-the-wild">Bias Transfer in the Wild</h2>
<p>Ok, so we know now that bias transfer <em>can</em> happen—at least when there’s a significant bias planted in the source pre-trained model. But in practice, source datasets will rarely have a feature as consistent and predictive as a planted yellow square we considered above. Can biases naturally occurring in common image datasets transfer as well?</p>

<p>It turns out that the answer here is: yes, too! For instance, let’s consider a (rather unsurprising) bias arising in the widely-used ImageNet dataset: a circular yellow shape is predictive for the “tennis ball” class. (See our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02842">paper</a> for many other examples and datasets.) Indeed, as we can see below, if we overlay a yellow circle on any ImageNet image, the model becomes more likely to output “tennis ball:”</p>

<div id="bias_examples_widget" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
    Shift in ImageNet predictions when we apply an intervention, such as overlaying a tennis ball on the image. Click through the thumbnails on the left to see more interventions.
</div>

<p>Now, what happens if we use transfer learning to obtain a model for a target task, such as CIFAR-10 from  a pre-trained ImageNet model containing this yellow circle -&gt; “tennis ball” bias? Even though CIFAR-10 does not contain the yellow circle -&gt; “tennis ball” bias, this bias still persists in the resulting transfer-learned model! In particular, when we evaluate our model on CIFAR-10 test set images overlaid with a yellow circle, the model fine-tuned from a pre-trained ImageNet model is far more sensitive to that signal than a CIFAR-10 model trained from scratch. Indeed, there is an overall skew of the output class distribution for the transfer-learned model, in contrast to an almost uniform output class distribution of the model trained from scratch.</p>

<div id="cifar_examples_widget" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
    Shift in CIFAR-10 predictions after applying an intervention when either training from scratch or transferring from a biased source model. We consider fixed-feature (left) or full-network (right) fine-tuning. The models which were pre-trained on a biased model are more sensitive to the intervention than those trained from scratch. 
</div>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this post, we discussed our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02842">recent work</a> that demonstrates that biases that exist in pretrained models can persist even if these models are adapted to target datasets which do not contain these biases. It is thus important to understand the biases of the pre-trained models one uses for transfer learning, even if the task these models were pre-trained on do not seem relevant to the target task we want to solve. This prudence is particularly key in the context of high-stakes real-world machine learning applications that often suffer from data scarcity and tend to use transfer learning as a remedy for that.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-095 |  Efficient Interactive Coding Achieving Optimal Error Resilience Over the Binary Channel | 

	Meghal Gupta, 

	Rachel Zhang</title>
    <summary>Given a noiseless protocol $\pi_0$ computing a function $f(x, y)$ of Alice and Bob's private inputs $x, y$, the goal of interactive coding is to construct an error-resilient protocol $\pi$ computing $f$ such that even if some fraction of the communication is adversarially corrupted, both parties still learn $f(x, y)$. Ideally, the resulting scheme $\pi$ should be positive rate, computationally efficient, and achieve optimal error resilience.

While interactive coding over large alphabets is well understood, the situation over the binary alphabet has remained evasive. At the present moment, the known schemes over the binary alphabet that achieve a higher error resilience than a trivial adaptation of large alphabet schemes are either still suboptimally error resilient [EKS20], or optimally error resilient with exponential communication complexity [GZ22]. In this work, we construct a scheme achieving optimality in all three parameters: our protocol is positive rate, computationally efficient, and resilient to the optimal $\frac16 - \epsilon$ adversarial errors.

Our protocol employs a new type of code that we call a layered code, which may be of independent interest. Like a tree code, a layered code allows the coder to encode a message in an online fashion, but is defined on a graph instead of a tree.</summary>

<h2>Hugo Duminil-Copin, June Huh, James Maynard and Maryna Viazovska were awarded the Fields Medal 2022 and Mark Braverman was awarded the Abacus Medal 2022.</h2>
<p>I am writing from Helsinki where I attended the meeting of the General Assembly of the IMU and yesterday I took part in the moving award ceremonies of ICM2022 hosted by Aalto University.  This will be the first post about the ICM 2020 award ceremonies.</p>
<p>The opening day of ICM2022 was exciting. Hugo Duminil-Copin, June Huh, James Maynard and Maryna Viazovska were awarded the Fields Medals 2022. Mark Braverman was awarded the Abacus Medal. The event <a href="https://youtu.be/6I0siVD7RBI">was videotaped and can be found here</a>. <strong>Update</strong>: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh2gqiEC6eM">five lectures of the medalists can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>In the ceremony, I gave the laudation for June Huh.  Here are <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/jhicm2022.pptx">the slides of my talk.</a> The preliminary version of my proceeding paper is <a href="https://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/Fields/2022/laudatio-jh.pdf">here on the IMU site</a>. Please alert me about mistakes in my paper or if you have any suggestions for changes or additions. (I already found that on two occasions I embarrassingly wrote “Brändén” Instead of “Braden”, sorry for that.) <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/laudatio-jh-20220709.pdf">Here is a corrected version.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/fields-medal/fields-medals-2022">The IMU site</a> contains a lot of material about the Fields medalist and other prize winners. It contains beautiful videos, and preliminary versions of the proceeding papers by the medalists and by those giving the laudations.</p>
<p>Andrei Okounkov wrote four wonderful detailed “popular scientific expositions” (those are available on the IMU site) which provide much scientific background as well as Andrei’s own scientific perspective. It is a great read for wide audience of mathematicians, ranging from  advanced undergraduate students.  Experts will also enjoy Andrei’s perspective.</p>
<h2>Svetlana Jitomirskaya was awarded the Ladyzhenskaya Prize in Mathematical Physics (in a ceremony held two days earlier), Barry Mazur was awarded the Chern Medal, Elliott Lieb was awarded the Gauss Prize, and Nikolai Andreev was awarded the Leelavati Prize.</h2>
<p>I hope to discuss these awards and some further personal and mathematical reflections in a subsequent post.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Congratulations Hugo, June, James, Maryna, Mark, Svetlana, Barry, Elliott, and Nikolai!</strong></span></h3>
<h3>Here on my Blog</h3>
<p>Let me give some links to discussions here on the blog on works by laureates.</p>
<p>I wrote about Maryna Viazovska’s amazing breakthrough in the post  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/a-breakthrough-by-maryna-viazovska-lead-to-the-long-awaited-solutions-for-the-densest-packing-problem-in-dimensions-8-and-24/" rel="bookmark">A Breakthrough by Maryna Viazovska Leading to the Long Awaited Solutions for the Densest Packing Problem in Dimensions 8 and 24, </a>and this additional post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/02/15/henry-cohn-abhinav-kumar-stephen-d-miller-danylo-radchenko-and-maryna-viazovska-universal-optimality-of-the-e8-and-leech-lattices-and-interpolation-formulas/" rel="bookmark">Henry Cohn, Abhinav Kumar, Stephen D. Miller, Danylo Radchenko, and Maryna Viazovska: Universal optimality of the E8 and Leech lattices and interpolation formulas.</a></p>
<p>I reported here in 2009 on <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/01/23/news/">the startling solution by Mark Braverman of the Linial-Nisan conjecture</a>.</p>
<p>The story of James Maynard’s startling results and the gap between primes story is <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/polymath-8-a-success/">described in this post</a>.  In July 2014 we ran at HUJI a beautiful <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/conf/joram.html">learning seminar on small gaps between primes,</a> where James Maynard gave a series of three lectures. His result on “bounded intervals containing many primes” both strengthened and simplified Yitang Zhang’s earlier amazing result on “bounded intervals containing two primes.”  Maynard developed large chunks of his approach independently from Zhang’s work.</p>
<p>I discussed two results by Hugo Duminil-Copin : After the start of the pandemic but before the war in Ukraine, I had a “cheer-you-up in difficult times” corner and<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/23/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-22-some-mathematical-news-part-1/"> in this post, </a> to cheer you up,  I wrote about a breakthrough by Hugo Duminil-Copin, Karol Kajetan Kozlowski, Dmitry Krachun, Ioan Manolescu, Mendes Oulamara  (and yet another wonderful result by Hugo Vanneuville and Vincent Tasion). In <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/two-delightful-major-simplifications/">this 2015 post</a> I wrote about another breakthrough by Hugo Duminil-Copinand Vincent Tasion. (And see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/where-were-we/">this post</a> for <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/hugo-kkl.jpg">a picture</a> of Hugo mentioning KKL and BKKKL.)</p>
<p>And,  of course, I wrote about June Huh several times. Here are a few examples: About Huh’s 2018 ICM talk; <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/12/24/icm-2018-rio-4-huh-balog-morris-wormald/" rel="bookmark">ICM 2018 Rio (4): Huh; Balog &amp; Morris; Wormald</a>; about the Mihail-vazirani conjecture  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/12/12/nima-anari-kuikui-liu-shayan-oveis-gharan-and-cynthia-vinzant-solved-the-mihail-vazirani-conjecture/" rel="bookmark">Nima Anari, Kuikui Liu, Shayan Oveis Gharan, and Cynthia Vinzant Solved the Mihail-Vazirani Conjecture for Matroids! </a>; <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/tentative-plans-and-belated-updates-ii/">About the early works on the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture for representable matroids</a>; and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/08/14/updates-and-plans-iii/">about the full solution of the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture by Adiprasito, Huh, and Katz.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/23/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-22-some-mathematical-news-part-1/">In this post</a> we tried to cheer you up with “harmonic polytope”, which came up in Ardila, Denham, and Huh’s work on the Lagrangian geometry of matroids and were further studied by Federico Ardila and Laura Escobar.</p>

    <title>The Highland Park Shooting</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This week I should be celebrating Mark Braverman's <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mark-braverman-wins-the-imu-abacus-medal-20220705/">Abacus Medal</a> and the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/2022-fields-and-abacus-medals/">Fields Medalists</a>. Instead my mind has been focused 25 miles north of Chicago.</p><p>Mass shootings in the United States have become far too commonplace, but the shooting at a fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Illinois hit home. Literally Highland Park was home for me, from 2003-2012. We've been in downtown Highland Park hundreds of times. We've attended their fourth of July parade in the past. My daughter participated in it as part of the high school marching band. </p><p>We were members of North Shore Congregation Israel. My wife, who had a party planning business back then, worked closely with NSCI events coordinator Jacki Sundhein, tragically killed in the attack.</p><p>We lived close to Bob's Deli and Pantry and we'd often walk over there for sandwiches or snacks, sometimes served by Bob Crimo himself. The alleged shooter, Bobby Crimo, was his son.</p><p>We spent the fourth with friends who came down from Glencoe, the town just south of Highland Park. We spent much of the day just searching for updates on our phones.</p><p>I wish we could find ways to reduce the shootings in Highland Park and those like it, the violence that plagues Chicago and other major cities and the highly polarized world we live in which both hampers real gun reforms and creates online groups that help enable these awful events. But right now I just mourn for the lives lost in the town that was my home, a town that will never fully recover from this tragedy.</p></div>

    <title>ICALP and the EATCS turn 50</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>These days, our colleagues at IRIF are hosting <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/" target="_blank">ICALP 2022</a> in Paris. This is the 49th edition of the ICALP conference, which turns 50 since its first instalment was held in 1972. ICALP was the first conference of the, then newly founded, <a href="https://eatcs.org/" target="_blank">European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS)</a>.The rest is history and I let any readers this post might have draw their own conclusions on the role that the EATCS and ICALP have played in supporting the development of theoretical computer science. (Admittedly, my opinions on both the EATCS and ICALP are very biased.) </p><p>The <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=42" target="_blank">scientific programme of ICALP 2022</a> is mouthwatering as usual, thanks to the work done by the authors of submitted papers, Mikołaj Bojańczyk and David Woodruff (PC chairs), and their PCs. I encourage everyone to read the papers that are being presented at the conference.</p><p>The main purpose of this post, however, is to alert the readers of this blog that ICALP 2022 also hosts an <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=1111" target="_blank">exhibition to celebrate EATCS/ICALP at 50</a> and theoretical computer science at large. If you are in Paris, you can attend the exhibition in person. Otherwise, you can visit it virtually <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=1111" target="_blank">here</a>. (See also the posters in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L7wLDYyDCNfSCvnNA8jWZiMb3BRLy14k/view" target="_blank">one PDF file</a>.)<br/></p><p>I had the honour to take part in the preparation of the material for that exhibition, which was led by Sandrine Cadet and Sylvain Schmitz. I learnt a lot from all the other colleagues in the committee for the exhibition. </p><p>As part of that work, I asked <a href="https://www.pilucrescenzi.it/" target="_blank">Pierluigi Crescenzi</a> whether he'd be willing to carry out a graph and data mining analysis of ICALP vis-a-vis other major conferences in theoretical computer science based on DBLP data. Pierluigi's work went well beyond the call of duty and is summarised in <a href="https://slides.com/piluc/icalp-50?token=fl3BBJ8j" target="_blank">this presentation</a>. I trust that you'll find the results of the analysis by Pierluigi and three of his students at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/gssi.it/csgssi" target="_blank">Gran Sasso Science Institute</a> very interesting. If you have any suggestions for expanding that analysis further, please write it in the comment section. </p><p>Let me close by wishing the EATCS and ICALP a happy 50th birthday, and a great scientific and social event to all the colleagues who are attending ICALP 2022. <br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>When the machines outperform us on every goal for which performance can be quantified,</p>



<p>When the machines outpredict us on all events whose probabilities are meaningful,</p>



<p>When they not only prove better theorems and build better bridges, but write better Shakespeare than Shakespeare and better Beatles than the Beatles,</p>



<p>All that will be left to us is the ill-defined and unquantifiable,</p>



<p>The interstices of Knightian uncertainty in the world,</p>



<p>The utility functions that no one has yet written down,</p>



<p>The arbitrary invention of new genres, new goals, new games,</p>



<p>None of which will be any “better” than what the machines could invent, but will be <em>ours</em>,</p>



<p>And which we can <em>call</em> “better,” since we won’t have told the machines the standards beforehand.</p>



<p>We can be totally unfair to the machines that way.</p>



<p>And for all that the machines will have over us,</p>



<p>We’ll still have this over them:</p>



<p>That we can’t be copied, backed up, reset, run again and again on the same data—</p>



<p>All the tragic limits of wet meat brains and sodium-ion channels buffeted by microscopic chaos,</p>



<p>Which we’ll strategically redefine as our last strengths.</p>



<p>On <em>one</em> task, I assure you, you’ll beat the machines forever:</p>



<p>That of calculating what you, in particular, would do or say.</p>



<p>There, even if deep networks someday boast 95% accuracy, you’ll have 100%.</p>



<p>But if the “insights” on which you pride yourself are impersonal, generalizable,</p>



<p>Then fear obsolescence as would a nineteenth-century coachman or seamstress.</p>



<p>From earliest childhood, those of us born good at math and such told ourselves a lie:</p>



<p>That while the tall, the beautiful, the strong, the socially adept might beat us in the external world of appearances,</p>



<p>Nevertheless, we beat them in the inner sanctum of truth, where it counts.</p>



<p>Turns out that anyplace you can beat or be beaten wasn’t the inner sanctum at all, but just another antechamber,</p>



<p>And the rising tide of the learning machines will flood them all,</p>



<p>Poker to poetry, physics to programming, painting to plumbing, which first and which last merely a technical puzzle,</p>

<p><strong>Beating Greedy Matching in Sublinear Time</strong>, by Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, Aviad Rubinstein, and Amin Saberi (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13057">arXiv</a>). Designing sublinear-time algorithms to estimate the size of maximum matching in a graph is a well-studied problem. This paper gives the first \(\frac{1}{2} + \Omega(1)\) approximation algorithm that runs in time sublinear in the size of the input graph. Specifically, given a graph on \(n\) vertices and maximum degree \(\Delta\) in the adjacency list model, and a parameter \(\epsilon &gt;0\), the algorithm runs in time \(\tilde{O}(n + \Delta^{1+\epsilon})\) and produces a \(\frac{1}{2} + f(\epsilon)\) approximation to the maximum matching for some function \(f\). It must be noted that a seminal work of Yoshida, Yamamoto and Ito (STOC, 2009) also gives a better than \(\frac{1}{2}\) approximation sublinear-time algorithm for the same problem. However, the result of Yoshida et al. requires assumptions on the maximum degree of the input graph. An additional point worth mentioning is that the authors do not believe that their techniques will yield an approximation guarantee better than \(0.51\), i.e., \(f(\epsilon) &lt; 0.01\) for all \(\epsilon\).</p>



<p><strong>Sublinear-Time Clustering Oracle for Signed Graphs</strong>, by Stefan Neumann and Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13813">arXiv</a>). Consider a large <em>signed graph</em> on \(n\) vertices where vertices represent users of a social network and signed edges (+/-) denote the type of interactions (friendly or hostile) between users. Assume that the vertices of the social network can be partitioned into \(O(\log n)\) large clusters, where each cluster has a sparse cut with the rest of the graph. Further, each cluster is a minimal set (w.r.t. inclusion) that can be partitioned into roughly equal-sized opposing sub-communities, where a sub-community opposes another sub-community if most of the edges going across are negatively signed and most of the edges within the sub-communities are positively signed. This work provides a local oracle that, given probe access to a signed graph with such a hidden cluster structure, answers queries of the form “What cluster does vertex \(v\) belong to?” in time \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} \cdot \text{poly}(1/\epsilon))\) per query. This result is a generalization of the same problem studied for unsigned graphs (Peng, 2020). The authors additionally show that their method works well in practice using both synthetic and real-world datasets. They also provide the first public real-world datasets of large signed graphs with a small number of large ground-truth communities having this property.</p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Algorithms for Hierarchical Clustering</strong>, by Arpit Agarwal, Sanjeev Khanna, Huan Li, and Prathamesh Patil (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07633">arXiv</a>). Consider a weighted graph \(G = (V,E,w)\), where the set \(V\) of vertices denotes datapoints and the weight \(w(e) &gt; 0\) of edge \(e \in E\) denotes the similarity between the endpoints of \(e\). A hierarchical clustering of \(V\) is a tree \(T\) whose root is the set \(V\) and leaves are the singleton sets corresponding to individual vertices. An internal node of the tree corresponds to a cluster containing all the leaf vertices that are descendants of that node. A hierarchical clustering tree provides us with a scheme to cluster datapoints at multiple levels of granularity. The cost of a hierarchical clustering tree is \(\sum_{(u,v) \in E} |T_{u,v}| \cdot w(u,v)\), where \(T_{u,v}\) denotes the lowest common ancestor of the leaves \(u\) and \(v\). In this paper, the authors present sublinear algorithms for determining a hierarchical clustering tree with the minimum cost. In the query model with degree queries and neighbor queries to the graph, they give an algorithm that outputs an \(\tilde{O}(1)\)-approximate hierarchical clustering and makes \(\tilde{O}(n^{4-2\gamma})\) queries, when the number of edges \(m = \Theta(n^{\gamma})\) for \(1.5 \geq \gamma &gt; 4/3\). When the input graph is sparse, i.e., \(\gamma \leq 4/3\), the algorithm makes \(\tilde{O}(\max\{n, m\})\) queries, and when the graph is dense, i.e., \(\gamma &gt;1.5\), the algorithm makes \(\tilde{O}(n)\) queries. They complement their upper bounds with nearly tight lower bounds. In order to obtain their upper bounds, they design a sublinear-time algorithm for the problem of obtaining a <em>weak</em> cut sparsifier that approximates cuts sizes upto an additive term in addition to the usual multiplicative factor. They also design sublinear algorithms for hierarchical clustering in the MPC and streaming models of computation. </p>



<p><strong>Sharp Constants in Uniformity Testing via the Huber Statistic</strong>, by Shivam Gupta and Eric Price (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10722">arXiv</a>).  This paper revisits the fundamental problem of uniformity testing — i.e., to decide whether an unknown distribution over \(n\) elements is uniform or \(\epsilon\)-far from uniform. This problem is known to be solvable optimally with probability at least \(1 – \delta\) using \(s = \Theta\left(\frac{\sqrt{n \log (1/\delta)}}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{\log (1/\delta)}{\epsilon^2}\right)\) independent samples from the unknown distribution. Multiple testers are known for the problem and they all compute a statistic of the form \(\sum_{i \in [n]} f(s_i)\), where \(s_i\) for \(i \in [n]\) and \(f\) is some function and make their decision based on whether or not the value of the statistic is above or below a threshold. For instance, the earliest known uniformity tester (Batu, Fortnow, Rubinfeld, Smith and White 2000; Goldreich and Ron 2011), also called the <em>collisions tester</em>, uses \(f(k) = \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\). The current paper proposes a new tester based on the Huber loss. For \(\beta &gt; 0\), let \(h_\beta(x) := \min\{x^2, 2\beta x – \beta^2\}\).  The statistic that the authors use in their test is defined by the function \(f(k) := k – s/n\), where \(s\) is the number of samples and \(n\) is the support size of the distribution. The authors show that their tester is better than all previously known testers as they achieve the best constants in the sample complexity. </p></div>

<p>
Samuel Fallows was a bishop in the Reformed Episcopal Church. He was born in 1835 and headed the denomination for four stints between 1877 and his death in 1922. Among numerous popular works, he compiled his own <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Complete_Dictionary_of_Synonyms_and_An.html?id=EJpKrgEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description">Complete Dictionary of Synonyms and Antonyms</a>. Unlike the more-famous <em>Roget’s Thesaurus</em>, it is <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51155">freely</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/completedictiona00falluoft">downloadable</a>—but there are catches.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss travails and lessons from my effort to use this book as data in my algorithms-and-data-structures course this past term.</p>
<p>
The word <em>travail</em> appears in a form that well captures all the senses I went through:</p>
<p>
<code><br/>
KEY: Travail.<br/>
SYN: Labor, toil, heaviness, affliction.<br/>
ANT: Ease, rest, lightness, joy.<br/>
</code></p>
<p/><p><br/>
This comes with Project Gutenberg’s <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51155/51155-h/51155-h.htm">markup</a>, which was digitized from a source like US Archive’s <a href="https://ia600301.us.archive.org/26/items/completedictiona00falluoft/completedictiona00falluoft.pdf">PDF image</a>. The digitizer acknowledges OCR errors in his preface there. A massive <em>unacknowledged</em> error, however, is the main prompt for this post. </p>
<p>
Before presenting the big error and its lessons for curating this kind of data, let me say more of note about the dictionary and Fallows’s other works.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Fallows as Author </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The dictionary went to several editions and is still on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Dictionary-Synonyms-Antonyms/dp/1164107372">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-complete-dictionary-of-synonyms-and-antonyms-samuel-fallows/1009291572">Barnes and Noble</a>. The downloads and optical PDF are of the 1898 third edition, whose one-page preface caught my eye for the following passage:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For the solution of Cross Word Puzzles special attention is called also to the lists of Americanisms and Briticisms and the immensely valuable table of Homonyms (words spelt alike but differing in use)—original features of easily recognized importance. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I grew up with the New York-centric story of crossword puzzles developing popularity in the 1920s. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword#History">history</a> on Wikipedia dates the term to 1862 but signifies scant attention to them until 1913. It notes that the 1913 puzzle by Arthur Wynne in the <em>New York World</em> newspaper “is frequently cited as the first crossword puzzle.” Later Wikipedia says, “By the 1920s, the crossword phenomenon was starting to attract notice.” But hold on: evidently crosswords had attracted enough notice by 1898 for Fallows to invoke them as a prime selling point of his compendium.</p>
<p>
Here are some other secular books by Fallows that show his high level of popular engagement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-William-Mckinley-Martyred-President/dp/1112138773">Life of William McKinley, Our Martyred President</a>, 1901. <p/>
</li><li>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samuel-Adams-Fallows-1835-1922/dp/B003SNJF7U">Samuel Adams: A Character Sketch</a>, 1903. <p/>
</li><li>
<a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/12/04/studies-in-crap-1904s-top-sexologists-on-our-helpless-unclean-flower-like-women/">Sexual Physiology</a>, 1904. <p/>
</li><li>
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26380/26380-h/26380-h.htm">Complete Story of the San Francisco Horror</a>, 1906 (editor of accounts as well as writing the introduction). <p/>
</li><li>
<a href="https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/books/DoReformatoriesReform_10920431">Do Reformatories Reform?</a>, 1907.
</li></ul>
<p>
He also contributed introductions to numerous books, including <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39280">“Lest We Forget”: Chicago’s Awful Theater Horror</a> (1903) and a 1919 treatise most simply titled <a href="https://archive.org/details/naturessecretsre1919shan/mode/2up">Eugenics</a>. </p>
<p>
It is particularly interesting to read the San Francisco <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26380/26380-h/26380-h.htm">book</a>, which Project Gutenberg’s transcriber speculates “was published very hurriedly following the earthquake.” Here is a passage from chapter 9, “Through Lanes of Misery”:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> At Salinas, about dark, the conductor came back, shaking his head; a freight train ahead at Pajaro had been completely buried by a mountain of earth hurled in the quake.</em></p><em>
<p>
The men said it was likely to be a week before any train went through.</p>
</em><p><em>
Three or four of us hurried into the town looking for an automobile. One of the passengers on the train was Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson, and the news had been kept from her until this delay. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
A few lines further down: “One giant maniac had broken his shackles and rescued one of the guards from the building. He had just one sane moment; long enough to be a hero. Then he fled howling into the hills.”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Data Structures Dont’t </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This section’s title has no typo: another of Fallows’s books is titled <a href="https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/books/DiscriminateaCompaniontoDontt_10423136">Discriminate: A Companion to “Dont’t”</a> (1885, 1891). The excerpt chosen by <a href="https://www.forgottenbooks.com/">forgottenbooks.com</a> could serve in a modern software company’s mission flyer:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Discriminate between ability and capacity. Capacity is the power of receiving and retaining knowledge with ease. Ability is the power of applying knowledge to practical purposes. Capacity implies power to conceive, ability the power to execute designs. Capacity is shown in quickness of apprehension; ability in something actually done. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
One application I conceived for my Data Structures course was to rewrite long words in selected texts by shorter synonyms, perhaps to humorous effect, using Fallows’s dictionary. This exemplifies lists and arrays and sets and maps of various sizes. The main <em>map</em> to build was from the key word to the associated list of synonyms. One could alternatively use a <em>set</em> of objects having <font size="+1"><tt>key</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>synonyms</tt></font> fields, which I presented as more flexible in allowing other ways to define keys. Some words in Fallows’s dictionary have separate entries for the part of speech, for instance (antonyms and some words snipped):</p>
<p><code><br/>
KEY: Array \v.\.<br/>
SYN: Vest, deck, equip, decorate, rank, adorn, dress, accoutre, …<br/>
=<br/>
KEY: Array \n.\, Arrangement, order, disposition, sight, …, parade.<br/>
</code></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Rather than juggle different kinds of maps, to use or not-use the noun/verb/adjective info, I said better to keep the data all together. This fell in with preaching about a classic data structures pitfall of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_array#pros_and_cons">Parallel</a> <a href="https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2014/06/03/anti-pattern-parallel-collections/">Arrays</a>” and ensuing off-by-one indexing errors. I designed and gave a separate assignment where a sorted set with iterator gave 3-4x better performance than repeated lookup from a map. </p>
<p>
But I never gave the originally-conceived assignment. Among several reasons, I was dumbstruck by a “Parallel Arrays” fault in the Project Gutenberg text file.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Horror </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The dictionary also has <em>cross-reference</em> entries typified by</p>
<p>
<code><br/>
KEY: Bellow, [See BAWL].<br/>
</code></p>
<p/><p><br/>
My intent in such cases was to have the students’ code look up the synonyms of the referenced word, here <font size="+1"><tt>KEY: Bawl. SYN: Shout, vociferate, halloo, roar, bellow.</tt></font> And—in case the dictionary had just <font size="+1"><tt>KEY: Bawl, [See BELLOW]</tt></font>—beware of going into an infinite loop. </p>
<p>
I did assign the task of detecting when two words appear on the synonym lists of each other. I intended to extend it to cross-references, so that <font size="+1"><tt>bawl</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>bellow</tt></font> would count as a “reciprocal pair.” But before I got there, I noticed instances like the following—especially toward the end of the file:</p>
<p>
<code><br/>
KEY: Unruffled, [See DISCOVER].<br/>
=<br/>
KEY: Unruly.<br/>
SYN: Ungovernable, unmanageable, refractory, [See TRANQUIL].<br/>
=<br/>
KEY: Unsafe, [See REFRACTORY].<br/>
=<br/>
KEY: Unseasonable, [See SAFE].<br/>
</code></p>
<p/><p><br/>
This <em>off-by-one</em> error extends above and below. There are some islands of correctness, but abutted by bizarreness:</p>
<p>
<code><br/>
KEY: Unhandy.<br/>
SYN: Awkward, clumsy, uncouth, [See AWKWARD].<br/>
=<br/>
KEY: unhappiness.<br/>
SYN: Misery, wretchedness, distress, woe, [See AWKWARD].<br/>
=<br/>
KEY: Unhappy.<br/>
SYN: Miserable, wretched, distressed, …, dismal, [See BUSS].<br/>
=<br/>
KEY: Unhealthy, [See BEHALF].<br/>
</code> </p>
<p/><p><br/>
The <font size="+1"><tt>BUSS</tt></font> is an OCR error for <font size="+1"><tt>BLISS</tt></font>, meant to go with <font size="+1"><tt>Unhappiness</tt></font>, and <font size="+1"><tt>BEHALF</tt></font> is an OCR error for <font size="+1"><tt>HEALTH</tt></font>—which is correctly aligned again. In other places the misalignments seem weirder and greater. But none of them is in any printed source. I ask:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> How could this kind of error happen? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Evidently the transcriber or some helper fell afoul of Parallel Arrays. One possibility is hinted by the project Gutenberg site having CSV files that use separate columns for KEY, SYN, and ANT, <em>and</em> have notes interspersed with data toward the top. Inserting a note in one column would throw off alignment below it. But I have not found these errors in those files. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Effort to Curate Data </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I took the time to fix all the OCR errors on the <font size="+1"><tt>KEY:</tt></font> fields in my update posted on my course webpage: <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse250/DataStructures/Fallows1898fx.txt">Fallows1898fx.txt</a>. I started to fix cross-references, but gave up when I noticed sporadic instances earlier than <font size="+1"><tt>S</tt></font> in the file and the conjunction with OCR errors. Some of the latter are harder to explain. The Gutenberg file has</p>
<p>
<code><br/>
KEY: Catalogue \n.\, [See BAWL].<br/>
</code> </p>
<p/><p><br/>
The PDF/printed source has <font size="+1"><tt>[See RECORD]</tt></font>. The ‘<font size="+1"><tt>R</tt></font>‘ could produce the ‘<font size="+1"><tt>B</tt></font>‘, but the unlikelihood of getting <font size="+1"><tt>AWL</tt></font> from <font size="+1"><tt>ECORD</tt></font> makes me suspect a different error. Perhaps the earlier <font size="+1"><tt>[See BAWL]</tt></font> from the entry for <font size="+1"><tt>Bellow</tt></font> got copied here. Copies like the above <font size="+1"><tt>AWKWARD</tt></font> example occur elsewhere with more intervening space. A third possibility is that <font size="+1"><tt>BAWL</tt></font> could go with <font size="+1"><tt>KEY: Caterwaul</tt></font>, but Fallows does not have that word.</p>
<p>
The off-by-one error was avoided in US Archive’s own <a href="https://archive.org/stream/completedictiona00falluoft/completedictiona00falluoft_djvu.txt">full text</a>, but it has other issues. The markup is jumbled. The true text format is recoverable in many places but not easily in others. OCR-type typos are completely unmarked.</p>
<p>
Some errors are by Fallows himself. For example, he forgot to insert “<font size="+1">S</font><font size="-1">YN</font>.” into his own entry for the noun form of <font size="+1"><tt>Array</tt></font> given above. Should these be corrected? For my purpose of wanting a clean dataset, I would wish so. Never mind that I could add lots of entries—his dictionary was far from “complete” even in 1898. The understanding is that we operate with these historical artifacts as they are, perhaps after fixing things the authors clearly intended. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing">Data cleansing</a> has become an area of computer and data science unto itself. My point is not to explore its theory or use-cases. I could devote a whole series of posts to issues with my chess data and numerous irregularities in chess game files sent to me that I have to fix. My point—with all these less-prominent but potentially useful data sources—is not <em>how</em> but <em>who</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Who will undertake to co-ordinate and execute the cleaning of all this medium-range data? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Whether a large and united effort like Project Gutenberg has the human resources seems in question. The University of Pennsylvania Online Books Library has a cautionary <a href="https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=pg51155">status note</a> about the Gutenberg link:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <b>No stable link:</b> This is an uncurated book entry from our extended bookshelves, readable online now but without a stable link here. You should not bookmark this page, but you can request that we add this book to our curated collection, which has stable links. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The scanned PDF version is stable. If the note is prompted by faults in the textual transcriptions—well, I think <b>I</b> could finish the fixes I started if a free extra week were magically inserted into my calendar. If any of you can bump it along a day at a time, either starting from <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse250/DataStructures/Fallows1898fx.txt">my version</a> or working afresh, I’ll be grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
How much will the world need to use such medium-level data sets? How important is it to clean them, and where would that effort come from? Or will all this data continue to lie in fallows?</p>

Besides the above books and religious guides, Fallows wrote patriotic books, including <a href="https://books.google.mw/books?id=d2QUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=copyright#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The American Manual and Patriot’s Handbook</a> (1889). But among all his topics, perhaps the one most current to remember this Fourth of July weekend—as we discuss student loans and the larger role of higher education—is that his great cause in his home state <a href="https://prabook.com/web/samuel.fallows/1097929">was</a> “a college education, tuition free, for every Wisconsin boy or girl who wanted it.”  He organized the first postgraduate distance-education program in the US, and also created the epsilon-alcoholic <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=M_xHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Bishop%27s+Beer%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J7hwGNPZjE&amp;sig=ACfU3U0pIFILUCvSw6-ZbPvWKSHv4cRJ4Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjOqpXcv934AhWXkIkEHceOC8wQ6AF6BAhHEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bishop's%20Beer%22&amp;f=false">“Bishop’s Beer”</a> before Prohibition.</p>

    <title>TR22-094 |  Notes on Monotone Read-k Circuits | 

	Stasys Jukna</title>
    <summary>A monotone Boolean $(\lor,\land)$ circuit $F$ computing a Boolean function $f$ is a read-$k$ circuit if the polynomial produced (purely syntactically) by the arithmetic $(+,\times)$ version of $F$ has the property that for every prime implicant of $f$, the polynomial contains a monomial with the same set of variables, each appearing with degree $\leq k$. Every monotone $(\lor,\land)$ circuit is a read-$k$ circuit for some $k$.


We first show that already read-1 circuits are interesting in the context of dynamic programming:  tropical $(\min,+)$ circuits solving $0/1$ optimization problems have the same power as Boolean read-1 circuits, and that 
 monotone read-1 $(\lor,\land)$ circuits computing homogeneous Boolean functions are not stronger than monotone arithmetic circuits.  Then we show that already read-2 circuits can be exponentially smaller than read-1 circuits. Finally, we show  that so-called (semantically) multilinear DeMorgan $(\lor,\land,\neg)$ circuits computing monotone Boolean functions are not stronger than monotone read-1 circuits.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?-->     <!--http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd-->                 <!-- html,xhtml,-css,NoFonts -->  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Fourier analysis over (not necessarily abelian) groups is a cool proof technique that yields many results of interest to theoretical computer science. Often the goal is to show “mixing” or “pseudo/quasi randomness” of appropriate distributions. This post isn’t about the formal statements or applications or proofs or even the credit of these results; for some of this you can see e.g. the references below, or a survey of mine <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#Xviola-SIGACT19">Vio19</a>]</span>, or a survey <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XMR3584096">Gow17</a>]</span> by Gowers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Instead this post is about an uncanny development of the proofs of some of these results. Whereas the original proofs were somewhat complicated, in some cases involving heavy mathematical machinery, later there emerged proofs that I propose to call <em>norm-al</em> (or normal for simplicity) because they only involve manipulations that can be cast as norm inequalities, such as Cauchy-Schwarz. Normal proofs I view as just a little up in complexity from proofs that are simply opening up definitions. They can involve the latter, or norm inequalities, and they need not be tight. An example of an ab-norm-al proof would be one that involves induction or iterative arguments, or probabilistic/double-counting/pigeon-hole methods. Making this a little more precise seems to require a lot of discussion, and may not even be possible, so let me stop here and move on with the examples of the proofs which became norm-al. They all involve <em>quasirandom groups </em><span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XGowers08">Gow08</a>]</span>, but even non-quasirandom groups mix in a certain sense <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XGowersV-group-mix">GV22</a>]</span> and the proofs there are again norm-al (it’s just that I don’t know of earlier proofs in this case).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The first example concerns the quintessential mixing result in this area: If you’ve got independent distributions <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and if each distribution is uniform over say a constant fraction of the group, then the the product <img alt="XY" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=XY&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (a.k.a. convolution, a.k.a. sample from each and output the product) is close to uniform over the entire group. A norm-al proof appears in <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XMR3584096">Gow17</a>]</span> which also contains pointers to previous proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The second is mixing of <em>three-term</em> progressions. A norml-al proof appears in <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/conf/innovations/BhangaleHR22">BHR22</a>]</span>. From their abstract: “Surprisingly, unlike the proofs of Tao and Peluse, our proof is elementary and only uses basic facts from nonabelian Fourier analysis.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The third is <em>interleaved mixing</em>, see a recent <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/viola/papers/DV-group-mix.pdf">preprint</a> with Derksen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Moreover, in the second and third example the proofs are not only simpler,                                                                                                                                                        they are also more general in that they apply to any quasirandom group whereas previous proofs only applied to prominent special cases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Why is all of this happening? One can only speculate that the reach of norml-al proofs in non-abelian Fourier analysis is still just emerging.</p>

    <title>TR22-093 |  More Verifier Efficient Interactive Protocols For Bounded Space | 

	Joshua Cook</title>
    <summary>Let $\mathbf{TISP}[T, S]$, $\mathbf{BPTISP}[T, S]$, $\mathbf{NTISP}[T, S]$, and $\mathbf{CoNTISP}[T, S]$  be the set of languages recognized by deterministic, randomized, nondeterminsitic, and co-nondeterministic algorithms, respectively, running in time $T$ and space $S$. Let $\mathbf{ITIME}[T_V]$ be the set of languages recognized by an interactive protocol where the verifier runs in time $T_V$. We prove:
$$\mathbf{TISP}[T, S] \cup \mathbf{BPTISP}[T, S] \subseteq \mathbf{ITIME}[\tilde{O}(\log(T) S + n)]$$
$$\mathbf{NTISP}[T, S] \cup \mathbf{CoNTISP}[T, S] \subseteq \mathbf{ITIME}[\tilde{O}(\log(T)^2 S + n)]$$
The prior most verifier time efficient interactive protocol for $\mathbf{TISP}$ uses ideas from Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, which gives 
$$\mathbf{NTISP}[T, S] \subseteq \mathbf{ITIME}[\tilde{O}(\log(T) S^2 + n)].$$</summary>

    <title>TR22-092 |  On correlation bounds against polynomials | 

	Emanuele Viola, 

	Peter Ivanov, 

	Liam Pavlovic</title>
    <summary>We study the fundamental challenge of exhibiting explicit functions that have small correlation with low-degree polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. Our main contributions include:

1. In STOC 2020, CHHLZ introduced a new technique to prove correlation bounds. Using their technique they established new correlation bounds for low-degree polynomials. They conjectured that their technique generalizes to higher degree polynomials as well. We give a counterexample to their conjecture, in fact ruling out weaker parameters and showing what they prove is essentially the best possible. 

2. We advocate an alternative approach for proving correlation bounds with the central “mod functions,” consisting of proving two steps: (I) the polynomials that maximize correlation are symmetric, and (II) symmetric polynomials have small correlation. Contrary to related results in the literature, we conjecture that (I) is true. We argue that this approach is not affected by existing “barrier results.”

3. We prove our conjecture for quadratic polynomials. Specifically, we determine the maximum possible correlation between quadratic polynomials modulo 2 and the functions $(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\to z^{\sum x_{i}}$ for any $z$ on the complex unit circle; and show that it is achieved by symmetric polynomials. To obtain our results we develop a new proof technique: we express correlation in terms of directional derivatives and analyze it by slowly restricting the direction.

4. We make partial progress on the conjecture for cubic polynomials, in particular proving tight correlation bounds for cubic polynomials whose degree-3 part is symmetric.</summary>

    <title>TR22-091 |  Quasirandom groups enjoy interleaved mixing | 

	Emanuele Viola, 

	Harm Derksen</title>
    <summary>Let $G$ be a group such that any non-trivial representation has dimension
at least $d$. Let $X=(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{t})$ and $Y=(Y_{1},Y_{2},\ldots,Y_{t})$
be distributions over $G^{t}$. Suppose that $X$ is independent from
$Y$. We show that for any $g\in G$ we have
\[
\left|\mathbb{P}[X_{1}Y_{1}X_{2}Y_{2}\cdots X_{t}Y_{t}=g]-1/|G|\right|\le\frac{|G|^{2t-1}}{d^{t-1}}\sqrt{\mathbb{E}_{h\in G^{t}}X(h)^{2}}\sqrt{\mathbb{E}_{h\in G^{t}}Y(h)^{2}}.
\]
Our results generalize, improve, and simplify previous works.</summary>

<p><i>
Deep learning models often exhibit <strong>consistent</strong> patterns of errors. These errors tend to correspond to hard subpopulations in the data they are deployed on. How can we go about detecting such hard subpopulations, and moreover doing so at scale? Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">recent paper</a> is motivated by this very aim, and presents a framework for automatic distillation and surfacing of a model’s failure modes.
</i></p>

<p>Despite the success of deep learning models at a wide range of classification tasks, they are prone to failing—often by underperforming on “hard” subpopulations corresponding to inputs that were consistently mislabelled, corrupted, or simply underrepresented in the training set. This problem is exacerbated when, as is often the case in practice, deployment conditions deviate from the training distribution. In these cases, the model may have learned (spurious) correlations on the training set that are not predictive on the distribution it is deployed on.</p>

<p>To make this more concrete, consider the task of predicting age (old vs young) based on the CelebA dataset of celebrity face images. It turns out that in this dataset, young women and old men are overrepresented, and thus a model trained on CelebA is likely to leverage the resulting correlation between age and gender in its predictions. Of course, as this correlation does not hold at large, this model would then struggle on inputs representing old women and young men.</p>

<p><img alt="CelebA-Summary" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/corr-errs/images/celeba_summary.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>

<p>How could we go about identifying these types of model errors? Specifically, for this case, how might we identify that it is the spurious age-gender correlation that is driving these failures?</p>

<p>One option is to manually examine either the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">dataset</a> or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04596">model itself</a> to identify specific failure modes. Such approaches, however, can be quite labor-intensive, and thus are difficult to scale. Alternatively, one can try to automatically identify and intervene on hard training examples, such as by directly <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09044">upweighting inputs</a> that were misclassified early in training or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12317">training a second model</a> to adversarially identify misclassified instances. However, these approaches also do not fully hit the mark. Specifically, they are not designed to elicit simple, human-interpretable patterns that underlie hard subpopulations (even when these exist). Thus, while such methods are automatic (and certainly scalable), they do not necessarily translate into the type of understanding needed to remedy the underlying data problem.</p>

<p>The framework developed in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">recent work</a> intends to bridge this gap between scalability and interpretability. In particular, it enables us to surface subpopulations of hard examples with respect to a given model in a way that is not only automatic, but also naturally suggests an intervention meant to fix them.</p>

<h2 id="capturing-failure-modes-as-latent-space-directions">Capturing Failure Modes as Latent Space Directions</h2>
<p>At a high level, our approach aims to model failure modes as <em>directions</em> within a latent space. In the context of the CelebA example we described above, this would correspond to identifying a (separate) direction for each class (old/young) such that the easier examples (“old man”/”young women”) lie in one direction, and the harder examples (“old women”/”young man”) lie in the opposite one. As a result, each such direction would end up capturing the axis of the specific failure mode (here, gender) that the model struggles with.</p>

<p>But how can we learn such a direction to begin with? The key intuition is that, whenever the pattern of errors we aim to capture corresponds to a global failure mode, such as a spurious correlation, the model will make these errors <em>consistently</em>. In other words, the incorrectly classified inputs will share features. As a result, we can capture the pattern behind these mistakes by training a classifier on the feature embedding, which <em>predicts</em> when the model is likely to make an error on a given input.</p>

<p>More specifically, in our framework we train for each class (using a held-out validation set) a linear support vector machine (SVM) that predicts the errors of the original model. The decision boundary of this SVM then establishes a <em>hyperplane</em> separating the correct from the incorrect examples. Moreover, the vector orthogonal to this decision boundary (the normal vector of the hyperplane) represents the direction of the captured failure mode that we are seeking. Indeed, the more aligned an example is with the identified direction, the harder (or easier) the example was for the original model—this is exactly what we needed!</p>

<p>Of course, to make sure this trained SVM can indeed capture the features shared by the errors, we need a suitable featurization for the inputs. In our (image) context, we use <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf">CLIP</a>, which embeds both vision and language together using contrastive learning. (As we will see below, using this embedding space has the added benefit of enabling us to automatically caption the captured failure modes, too!)</p>

<p><img alt="Summary" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/corr-errs/images/updated_summary_fig.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
Given our original model, for each class (here, ``old"), we train a SVM on a shared vision/language latent space to predict whether the original model would have classified an input correctly. We then extract a direction (in gray) for the captured failure mode, as the vector orthogonal to the corresponding learned hyperplane. Since the original model struggles on ``old female" faces, the SVM learns to use gender to separate the incorrect (shown in red) vs. correct (shown in green) examples.
</div>

<p><strong>Identifying the gender spurious correlation in CelebA</strong>: Let’s return to our example of identifying age for CelebA faces in the presence of a spurious correlation with gender, and apply our framework as described above. The plot below depicts the fraction of test images within each class that are of the minority gender when ordering the images by either their SVM decision value, or by our baseline of using the model’s confidences. We can see that the SVM directions indeed capture the gender-age spurious association, as intended.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<h3 id="interpreting-the-extracted-failure-mode">Interpreting the extracted failure mode</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve distilled the model’s failure modes as directions within the latent space, how can we understand what these failure modes entail exactly?</p>

<p><strong>Most Aligned Examples.</strong> One approach is to simply surface the examples whose normalized embeddings are most aligned (or anti-aligned) with the extracted direction. These are the images with the most positive or negative SVM <em>decision value</em> (which is proportional to the signed distance from the decision boundary). In doing so, we surface the prototypical examples representing the “most correct” and “most incorrect” examples.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Captioning.</strong> We can, however, go one step further by automatically captioning the extracted failure mode, leveraging the fact that the SVM was trained on a shared vision/language embedding space. Recall that CLIP embeds both images <em>and</em> language into the same latent space. Thus, just as we surfaced the most aligned <em>images</em> above, we can surface the most aligned <em>captions</em> (from some pre-specified set of captions) whose normalized text embedding matches the extracted direction. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">paper</a>.</p>

<p>Both techniques are shown below on our running CelebA example. As we can see, images farthest from the SVM decision boundary indeed exemplify the hardest (“old woman”) or the easiest (“old man”) examples. The captions also reflect the corresponding categories.</p>

<p><img alt="CelebA-Examples" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/corr-errs/figures/celeba_most_extreme_examples.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>

<h2 id="man-with-a-fish-discovering-failure-modes-in-the-imagenet-dataset">Man with a Fish: Discovering Failure Modes in the ImageNet Dataset</h2>
<p>In the CelebA example we were considering so far, the dataset contained a <em>known</em>, planted spurious correlation (i.e., gender). How will our framework fare when this is not necessarily the case? To study this, let’s apply our framework to the ImageNet dataset (and see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">paper</a> for more examples).</p>

<p>What does our framework flag? A broad range of interpretable failure modes—from color biases (e.g., the model struggles on red wolves with white winter coats) to reliance on co-occurring objects (e.g., the model more easily classifies the tench fish in the presence of a person).</p>

<div id="bias_examples_widget" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
     Images and captions with the most positive or negative SVM decision values for a given ImageNet class. (Click the thumbnails on the left to explore)
</div>

<p>Are the flagged subpopulations actually challenging for the original model? To check this, we would ideally compare the difference in test accuracy between the “easy” and “hard” subpopulations proposed by our framework. For example, in the above example of the tench fish, we would hope that tenches described by the “easy” caption (“a photo of an orange fish with a person”) have a higher accuracy on held-out examples than those described by the “hard” caption (“a photo of a close-up fish”).</p>

<p>However, we do not have annotations for the sub-groups of ImageNet necessary to execute this measurement directly. Still, as a proxy, we can use the CLIP shared vision/language embedding space to <em>approximate</em> these sub-group accuracies. So, for example, to evaluate the model’s performance on people with orange fish, we simply check its accuracy on the images whose CLIP embeddings are closest (in cosine distance) to the embedded SVM caption “a photo of an orange fish with a person”.</p>

<p>Performing this kind of evaluation for all the 1000 of ImageNet classes, we find that the original model’s accuracy on the images closest to the “hard caption” is consistently (and significantly) lower than those closest to the “easy caption.” In other words, our framework successfully surfaces the patterns of failure modes. Furthermore, as we describe in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">paper</a>, these surfaced patterns guide effective interventions too.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we introduced a framework for automatically identifying and captioning coherent subpopulations that are especially hard, or easy, for a given model to classify. In particular, our framework harnesses (linear) classifiers to distill the model’s failure modes as meaningful directions in the latent space. Our framework was able to surface challenging subpopulations in widely used datasets such as ImageNet: check out our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">paper</a> for even more examples (and datasets)!</p>

<p>Overall, we view our methodology as a first step toward building a toolkit for scalable dataset exploration and debiasing—we believe, however, that there is much more to do. For example, we consider only relatively straightforward data interventions (such as upweighting and filtering). Can we come up with more sophisticated interventions to improve the model’s performance on the identified subpopulations? In particular, given all the recent enormous progress on text-to-image generation, one especially  promising approach to explore here could be to generate new data that is tailored to the model’s weaknesses (for example, by using <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/dall-e-2.pdf">DALL-E 2</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11487.pdf">ImageGen</a>).</p></div>

    <title>The motion of bend lines on smooth surfaces</title>
    <summary>You may have played with a paper yoyo, a strip of paper wrapped around a stick so that when you flick it with your wrist, it extends outward into a long tube. Here’s one, the only example I could find on Wikimedia Commons:</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>You may have played with a paper yoyo, a strip of paper wrapped around a stick so that when you flick it with your wrist, it extends outward into a long tube. Here’s one, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arcade_Paper_Laser,_August_8th_2016.jpeg">the only example I could find on Wikimedia Commons</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Arcade Paper Laser, public domain image by Zhonghua88, 8 August 2016, from Wikimedia Commons" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/paper-yoyo.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/></p>

<p>If you’ve used one, then the way they work is simple and intuitive. But if you know a little bit about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_paper_folding">mathematics of paper folding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developable_surface">developable surfaces</a>, and think about it, it starts to seem a little strange.</p>

<p>Paper can bend or fold, but not stretch. When a flat sheet of paper is bent into a smooth but not flat surface (as it is in all states of the paper yoyo), it bends along straight “bend lines” that extend all the way across the surface, and that are forced to remain straight. You may be familiar with the way that a slice of pizza will droop if you try to hold it flat from its crust, but will remain straight if you bend it lengthwise: the bend lines are holding it in a rigid shape. Or, if you roll a poster into a cylinder, you can wave it around like a light saber, again making it much more rigid than the unrolled poster (at least until you hit it into something hard enough to crumple it).</p>

<p>In the rolled-up state of the paper yoyo, it’s again rolled into a cylinder, with bend lines parallel to the cylinder axis. If we mark some of those bend lines and unroll it flat, it might look something like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Bend lines in a rolled paper yoyo" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/paper-yoyo-rolled.svg" style="width: 100%;"/></p>

<p>But then, what happens when you extend it? The paper cannot stretch from its rectangular shape into a parallelogram. Instead, as it extends, the bend lines continuously rotate on the surface of the paper. Near the point where they attach to the stick, the non-perpendicular bend lines cause the paper to flare out a little from its cylindrical shape, but it is surrounded by more wrapped paper constraining it from flaring very widely, so the bend lines must still stay near their original orientations. Farther along the yoyo, the bend lines can twist to bigger angles:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Bend lines in a rolled paper yoyo" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/paper-yoyo-extended.svg" style="width: 100%;"/></p>

<p>So although the bend lines of a smoothly bent sheet of paper are rigid along their length, they can slide and twist continuously within the sheet, as the sheet flexes continuously while remaining smooth. This twisting motion of bend lines is essential for understanding the seemingly-knotted surface below, two round disks connected by a thin band tied in an overhand knot:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Knotted paper dumbbell shape" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/knotted-dumbbell.svg"/></p>

<p>If you want to unknot it while keeping it smooth rather than crumpling it, you will obviously have to make the disks smaller by rolling them up somehow, perhaps into a cylinder around one of their diameters. But if you do that, you will put a bend line through or near the diameter, which will act like a rigid rod. And if you attach the knotted center band to two rigid rods, of length equal to the diameter of the disks, you definitely cannot untie it. The rods are too long to poke all the way through the knot before getting stuck.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this surface can be untied while keeping it smooth! The trick is that, after you have rolled up one of the disks to make a rigid cylinder, with the tied band at one end, you can twist the roll, so that its bend lines rotate around the disk. As you do, the point where the band is tied will slide from one end of the cylinder to the other. And you can make this sliding motion coincide with the motion of the cylinder through a hole in the tied band, untying it.</p>

<p>This and similar examples are the focus of my third new CCCG preprint, “Locked and unlocked smooth embeddings of surfaces”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12989">arXiv:2206.12989</a>. In the phrasing of the title, the two disks with a tied center band, above, are unlocked: they can be reconfigured to a flat state while remaining smooth. My paper also shows that any compact shape with a continuous shrinking motion into itself, like the polygon below, is unlocked.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Polygon with a continuous shrinking motion" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/generalized-star.svg" style="width: 100%;"/></p>

<p>On the other hand, there exist surfaces that, while topologically equivalent to their flat state, cannot be made flat through a continuous sequence of smooth embeddings. The simplest one that I found consists of a central square mat, rolled up into a cylinder and held into its cylindrical shape by two loops, entangled with each other in a pattern based on the Borromean rings:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Locked shape consisting of a rolled square mat with two entangled loops" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/tied-roll.svg"/></p>

<p>There is actually quite a lot of freedom in the pattern of bend lines of the central square. They can twist until the bend line through the center of the square gets halfway to the corners of the square:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Twisted bend lines in the rolled square mat" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/bent-roll.svg"/></p>

<p>But after that point, the entangled loops block the twisting from going any farther. They cannot be disentangled from each other without being pulled around the rigid central bend line, and they are too short for that to be possible, so the surface is locked.</p>

<p>It’s not clear to me whether all simple polygons are unlocked, or whether it’s possible to make locked polygons without holes. I also don’t have any algorithmic results in this area; it seems likely that testing whether a surface is locked or unlocked is hard, but I don’t know how to prove it.</p>
