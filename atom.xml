anomalies in stock markets; a principal problem in financial economics. Our
modeling of the (detection) problem results in sampling and estimating the
(relative) volume of geodesically non-convex and non-connected spherical
patches that arise by intersecting a non-standard simplex with a sphere. To
sample, we introduce two novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that
exploit the geometry of the problem and employ state-of-the-art continuous
geometric random walks (such as Billiard walk and Hit-and-Run) adapted on
spherical patches. To our knowledge, this is the first geometric formulation
and MCMC-based analysis of the volatility puzzle in stock markets. We have
implemented our algorithms in C++ (along with an R interface) and we illustrate
the power of our approach by performing extensive experiments on real data. Our
analyses provide accurate detection and new insights into the distribution of
portfolios' performance characteristics. Moreover, we use our tools to show
that classical methods for low-volatility anomaly detection in finance form bad
proxies that could lead to misleading or inaccurate results.

    <title>Dispersing Facilities on Planar Segment and Circle Amidst Repulsion</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1652227200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Singireddy:Vishwanath_R=.html">Vishwanath R.

(congruent disks of maximum radius) amidst $n$ demand points (existing
repulsive facility sites) ordered from left to right in the plane so that none
of the existing facility sites are affected (no demand point falls in the
interior of the disks). We study this problem in two restricted settings: (i)
the obnoxious facilities are constrained to be centered on along a
predetermined horizontal line segment $\bar{pq}$, and (ii) the obnoxious
facilities are constrained to lie on the boundary arc of a predetermined disk
$\cal C$. An $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm was given recently to solve
the constrained problem in (i) in time
$O((n+k)\log{\frac{||pq||}{2(k-1)\epsilon}})$, where $\epsilon&gt;0$
\cite{Sing2021}. Here, for the problem in (i), we first propose an exact
polynomial-time algorithm based on a binary search on all candidate radii
computed explicitly. This algorithm runs in
$O((nk)^2\log{(nk)}+(n+k)\log{(nk)})$ time. We then show that using the
parametric search technique of Megiddo \cite{MG1983}; we can solve the problem
exactly in $O((n+k)^2)$ time, which is faster than the latter. Continuing
further, using the improved parametric technique we give an $O(n\log^2 n)$-time
algorithm for $k=2$. We finally show that the above
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm of \cite{Sing2021} can be easily adapted
to solve the circular constrained problem of (ii) with an extra multiplicative
factor of $n$ in the running time.

    <title>Optimal Bounds for Weak Consistent Digital Rays in 2D</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1652227200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Gibson=Lopez:Matt.html">Matt Gibson-Lopez</a>, Serge Zamarripa <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03450">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Representation of Euclidean objects in a digital space has been a focus of
research for over 30 years. Digital line segments are particularly important as
other digital objects depend on their definition (e.g., digital convex objects
or digital star-shaped objects). It may be desirable for the digital line
segment systems to satisfy some nice properties that their Euclidean
counterparts also satisfy. The system is a consistent digital line segment
system (CDS) if it satisfies five properties, most notably the subsegment
property (the intersection of any two digital line segments should be
connected) and the prolongation property (any digital line segment should be
able to be extended into a digital line). It is known that any CDS must have
$\Omega(\log n)$ Hausdorff distance to their Euclidean counterparts, where $n$
is the number of grid points on a segment. In fact this lower bound even
applies to consistent digital rays (CDR) where for a fixed $p \in
\mathbb{Z}^2$, we consider the digital segments from $p$ to $q$ for each $q \in
\mathbb{Z}^2$. In this paper, we consider families of weak consistent digital
rays (WCDR) where we maintain four of the CDR properties but exclude the
prolongation property. In this paper, we give a WCDR construction that has
optimal Hausdorff distance to the exact constant. That is, we give a
construction whose Hausdorff distance is 1.5 under the $L_\infty$ metric, and
we show that for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$, it is not possible to have a WCDR with
Hausdorff distance at most $1.5 - \epsilon$.

largest integer such that any set $A$ of $n$ points in general position in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, satisfying $\Delta(A) \leq \alpha n^{1/d}$ for a fixed

$30$ years ago, Valtr proved that $\gamma_2(n)=\Theta(n^{1/3})$. Since then no
further results have been obtained in higher dimensions. Here we continue this
line of research in three dimensions and prove that $ \gamma_3(n)

any $n$-element point set $A\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ in general position,
satisfying $\Delta(A) \leq \alpha n^{1/3}$ for a fixed $\alpha$, a
$\Omega(n^{-1/6})$-factor approximation of the maximum-size convex subset of

<i>Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations, or algorithms: it is about understanding—Bill Thurston.</i></p>
<p>
Peter Weinberger is a computer scientist who is famous for many things—including his <a href="http://spinroot.com/pico/pjw.html">face</a>. His name “Peter” alone stands for “rock or stone”. He did great work at Bell Labs, where he was part of the team that created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a> Programming Language: the others were Alfred Aho and Brian Kernighan. </p>
<p>
I just saw him, after a few years, at Bob <a href="https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/115529253/posts/3992043808">Sedgewick’s</a> retirement event in Princeton. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/10/peters-face/pw/" rel="attachment wp-att-19990"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19990" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pw.jpg?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="252"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> His Face </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter’s face comes up in Bell Lab’s lure:  For some reason, the <a href="http://spinroot.com/pico/pjw.html">portrait</a> of Peter Weinberger has always been our most popular target for picture editing experiments. It started a few years ago when Peter was raised to the rank of department head and was careless enough to leave a portrait of himself floating around. On a goofy Saturday evening at the lab, Rob Pike and I started making photocopies and, to emphasize Peter’s rise in the managerial hierarchy, prepared a chart of the Bell Labs Cabinet with his picture stuck in every available slot. Peter must have realized that the best he could do was not to react at all, if at least he wanted to avoid seeing his face 10 feet high on a watertower. Nevertheless, Peter’s picture appeared and reappeared in the most unlikely places in the lab. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Experiments </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter’s research over the years has been, I believe, an interesting mixture of theory and practice. Early on he did experimental work in deep number theory. For example his paper with Daniel Shanks <a href="http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa21/aa21139.pdf">refuted</a> an open conjecture. This work is an interesting blend of computations and theory. One of the surprises of deep number theory is that shocks abound in the fine structure of number fields. This structure is not always straightforward and often depends on examples and counterexamples. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Crypto </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter also worked with the US government in classified ways. He is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASON_(advisory_group)">Jason’s</a> group. For example you can see some of his work on the evaluation of research directions: </p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/jason/dna.pdf">DNA</a>: one of my favorite.
</li><li> <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/jason/qc.pdf">Quantum</a>.
</li><li> <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/jason/medimag.pdf">Medical Imaging</a>.
</li></ol>
<p>
Other parts of it are classified and <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Renaissance and Google </b></p>
<p/><p>
Renaissance Technologies is an American hedge fund based on Long Island. The firm is regarded as the most successful hedge fund in the world. Weinberger was the chief technology officer at Renaissance until he left for Google in 2003. This exit made sense since Peter seems to love problems in infrastructure and security. Working to solve infrastructure problems at the global scale at Google was clearly a compelling opportunity for him. </p>
<p>
Below is an excerpt from a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514393">talk</a> with Peter and Laurianne Mclaughlin:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19992" style="width: 250px;"><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/10/peters-face/peter-weinberger/" rel="attachment wp-att-19992"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-19992" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pw2.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="240"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-19992">Peter Weinberger, New York City, 2015</p></div>
<p>
<b>Weinberger</b>: I’m a software engineer. I write programs, infrastructure stuff mostly. I’m working on tools for processing various kinds of logs created by internal software. I’m not working on security directly, but a lot of what we do is affected by security and privacy concerns. As a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, most companies now create a lot of logs to verify what code they’re running, and [show] how people work with internal data.</p>
<p>
Also, I spend a lot of time reading code. At Google, you can’t check in code without it being reviewed and approved by a peer, so if you work with productive people, there’s a lot of code to review.</p>
<p>
<b>LM</b>: What are the biggest technology challenges for Google today?</p>
<p>
<b>Weinberger</b>: Scale is the problem. Our business grows rapidly. That means every year, a lot of the technology decisions made a year ago don’t look so good any more. Exponential growth is a very pleasant problem but requires a lot of work.</p>
<p>
<b>LM</b>: What are your technology pet peeves?</p>
<p>
<b>Weinberger</b>: I’m sure I’ve got dozens. Password management. Sometimes people, like auditors, think users should regularly change passwords. I think this just encourages people to use crummy passwords—because either they have to write the passwords down, or they need a sequence of passwords that are very similar.</p>
<p>
One of my other pet peeves here is curious error messages. A lot of them are still awful. They start with the word “abort” but the program continues. We have a lot of legacy software, and you end up with these situations where an error message pops up, but the computer keeps on going. Deep in the software something went wrong, and reports it, but you’re seven levels of abstraction away, and it’s just useless noise.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter is still working on his problems. We wish him well on solving them and on all he is doing.</p></div>

    <title>Near-Optimal Deterministic Vertex-Failure Connectivity Oracles</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1652140800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Long:Yaowei.html">Yaowei Long</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Saranurak:Thatchaphol.html">Thatchaphol Saranurak</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03930">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We revisit the vertex-failure connectivity oracle problem. This is one of the
most basic graph data structure problems under vertex updates, yet its
complexity is still not well-understood. We essentially settle the complexity
of this problem by showing a new data structure whose space, preprocessing
time, update time, and query time are simultaneously optimal up to
sub-polynomial factors assuming popular conjectures. Moreover, the data
structure is deterministic.
</p>
<p>More precisely, for any integer $d_{\star}$, the data structure preprocesses
a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges in $\hat{O}(md_{\star})$ time and
uses $\tilde{O}(\min\{m,nd_{\star}\})$ space. Then, given the vertex set $D$ to
be deleted where $|D|=d\le d_{\star}$, it takes $\hat{O}(d^{2})$ updates time.
Finally, given any vertex pair $(u,v)$, it checks if $u$ and $v$ are connected
in $G\setminus D$ in $O(d)$ time. This improves the previously best
deterministic algorithm by Duan and Pettie (SODA 2017) in both space and update
time by a factor of $d$. It also significantly speeds up the
$\Omega(\min\{mn,n^{\omega}\})$ preprocessing time of all known (even
randomized) algorithms with update time at most $\tilde{O}(d^{5})$.

predictions. While online algorithms augmented with a single prediction have
been extensively studied in recent years, the literature for the multiple
predictions setting is sparse. In this paper, we give a generic algorithmic
framework for online covering problems with multiple predictions that obtains
an online solution that is competitive against the performance of the best
predictor. Our algorithm incorporates the use of predictions in the classic
potential-based analysis of online algorithms. We apply our algorithmic
framework to solve classical problems such as online set cover, (weighted)
caching, and online facility location in the multiple predictions setting. Our
algorithm can also be robustified, i.e., the algorithm can be simultaneously
made competitive against the best prediction and the performance of the best
online algorithm (without prediction).

Search, most empirical evaluations of algorithms have focused on smaller
datasets, typically of 1 million points~\citep{Benchmark}. However, deploying
recent advances in embedding based techniques for search, recommendation and
ranking at scale require ANNS indices at billion, trillion or larger scale.
Barring a few recent papers, there is limited consensus on which algorithms are
effective at this scale vis-\`a-vis their hardware cost.
</p>
<p>This competition compares ANNS algorithms at billion-scale by hardware cost,
accuracy and performance. We set up an open source evaluation framework and
leaderboards for both standardized and specialized hardware. The competition
involves three tracks. The standard hardware track T1 evaluates algorithms on
an Azure VM with limited DRAM, often the bottleneck in serving billion-scale
indices, where the embedding data can be hundreds of GigaBytes in size. It uses
FAISS~\citep{Faiss17} as the baseline. The standard hardware track T2
additional allows inexpensive SSDs in addition to the limited DRAM and uses
DiskANN~\citep{DiskANN19} as the baseline. The specialized hardware track T3
allows any hardware configuration, and again uses FAISS as the baseline.
</p>
<p>We compiled six diverse billion-scale datasets, four newly released for this
competition, that span a variety of modalities, data types, dimensions, deep
learning models, distance functions and sources. The outcome of the competition
was ranked leaderboards of algorithms in each track based on recall at a query
throughput threshold. Additionally, for track T3, separate leaderboards were
created based on recall as well as cost-normalized and power-normalized query
throughput.

    <title>Exact recovery algorithm for Planted Bipartite Graph in Semi-random Graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1652140800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Akash Kumar, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Louis:Anand.html">Anand Louis</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Paul:Rameesh.html">Rameesh Paul</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03727">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The problem of finding the largest induced balanced bipartite subgraph in a
given graph is NP-hard. This problem is closely related to the problem of
finding the smallest Odd Cycle Transversal.
</p>
<p>In this work, we consider the following model of instances: starting with a
set of vertices $V$, a set $S \subseteq V$ of $k$ vertices is chosen and an
arbitrary $d$-regular bipartite graph is added on it; edges between pairs of
vertices in $S \times (V \setminus S)$ and $(V \setminus S) \times (V \setminus
S)$ are added with probability $p$. Since for $d=0$, the problem reduces to
recovering a planted independent set, we don't expect efficient algorithms for
$k=o(\sqrt{n})$. This problem is a generalization of the planted balanced
biclique problem where the bipartite graph induced on $S$ is a complete
bipartite graph; [Lev18] gave an algorithm for recovering $S$ in this problem
when $k=\Omega(\sqrt{n})$.
</p>
<p>Our main result is an efficient algorithm that recovers (w.h.p.) the planted
bipartite graph when $k=\Omega_p(\sqrt{n \log n})$ for a large range of
parameters. Our results also hold for a natural semi-random model of instances,
which involve the presence of a monotone adversary. Our proof shows that a
natural SDP relaxation for the problem is integral by constructing an
appropriate solution to it's dual formulation. Our main technical contribution
is a new approach for constructing the dual solution where we calibrate the
eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix to be the eigenvectors of the dual matrix.
We believe that this approach may have applications to other recovery problems
in semi-random models as well.
</p>
<p>When $k=\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, we give an algorithm for recovering $S$ whose
running time is exponential in the number of small eigenvalues in graph induced
on $S$; this algorithm is based on subspace enumeration techniques due to the
works of [KT07,ABS10,Kol11].

<p>Our main result is an algorithm that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ obtains a
$(3+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(1/\epsilon)$ rounds (of models such as
massively parallel computation, local, and semi-streaming). This is a
culminating point for the rich literature on parallel correlation clustering.
On the one hand, the approximation (almost) matches a natural barrier of 3 for
combinatorial algorithms. On the other hand, the algorithm's round-complexity
is essentially constant.
</p>
<p>To achieve this result, we introduce a simple $O(1/\epsilon)$-round parallel
algorithm. Our main result is to provide an analysis of this algorithm, showing
that it achieves a $(3+\epsilon)$-approximation. Our analysis draws on new
connections to sublinear-time algorithms. Specifically, it builds on the work
of Yoshida, Yamamoto, and Ito [STOC'09] on bounding the "query complexity" of
greedy maximal independent set. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of this method in analyzing the approximation ratio of any algorithm.

    <title>Near-optimal Algorithms for Stochastic Online Bin Packing</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1652140800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Ayyadevara:Nikhil.html">Nikhil Ayyadevara</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Dabas:Rajni.html">Rajni Dabas</a>, Arindam Khan, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sreenivas:K=_V=_N=.html">K. V. N. Sreenivas</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03622">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the online bin packing problem under two stochastic settings. In the
bin packing problem, we are given n items with sizes in (0,1] and the goal is
to pack them into the minimum number of unit-sized bins. First, we study bin
packing under the i.i.d. model, where item sizes are sampled independently and
identically from a distribution in (0,1]. Both the distribution and the total
number of items are unknown. The items arrive one by one and their sizes are
revealed upon their arrival and they must be packed immediately and irrevocably
in bins of size 1. We provide a simple meta-algorithm that takes an offline
$\alpha$-asymptotic approximation algorithm and provides a polynomial-time
$(\alpha + \varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm for online bin packing under the
i.i.d. model, where $\varepsilon$&gt;0 is a small constant. Using the AFPTAS for
offline bin packing, we thus provide a linear time
$(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm for online bin packing under i.i.d.
model, thus settling the problem.
</p>
<p>We then study the random-order model, where an adversary specifies the items,
but the order of arrival of items is drawn uniformly at random from the set of
all permutations of the items. Kenyon's seminal result [SODA'96] showed that
the Best-Fit algorithm has a competitive ratio of at most 3/2 in the
random-order model, and conjectured the ratio to be around 1.15. However, it
has been a long-standing open problem to break the barrier of 3/2 even for
special cases. Recently, Albers et al. [Algorithmica'21] showed an improvement
to 5/4 competitive ratio in the special case when all the item sizes are
greater than 1/3. For this special case, we settle the analysis by showing that
Best-Fit has a competitive ratio of 1. We make further progress by breaking the
barrier of 3/2 for the 3-Partition problem, a notoriously hard special case of
bin packing, where all item sizes lie in (1/4,1/2].

interior point method (IPM) for seconder order cone programming (SOCP), which
is more convenient for warmstarting compared with feasible IPMs. The method
studied bases on the homogeneous and self-dual model and the Monteiro-Zhang
family of searching directions. Its worst case iteration complexity is
$O\left(k^{1/2}\log\left(\epsilon^{-1}\right)\right)$, to reduce the primal
residual, dual residual, and complementarity gap by a factor of $\epsilon$,
where $k$ is the number of cone constraints. The result is the same as the best
known result for feasible IPMs. The condition under which warmstarting improves
the complexity bound is also studied.

no triple of vertices from $S$ lie on a common shortest path in $G$. The
general position achievement/avoidance game is played on a graph $G$ by players
A and B who alternately select vertices of $G$. A selection of a vertex by a
player is a legal move if it has not been selected before and the set of
selected vertices so far forms a general position set of $G$. The player who
picks the last vertex is the winner in the general position achievement game
and is the loser in the avoidance game. In this paper, we prove that the
general position achievement/avoidance games are PSPACE-complete even on graphs
with diameter at most 4. For this, we prove that the \emph{mis\`ere} play of
the classical Node Kayles game is also PSPACE-complete. As a positive result,
we obtain polynomial time algorithms to decide the winning player of the
general position avoidance game in rook's graphs, grids, cylinders, and
lexicographic products with complete second factors.

image, based on a single encoder and three separate generators used to
reconstruct different geometric and semantic representations of the original
and completed scene, all sharing the same latent space. To transfer information
between the geometric and semantic branches of the network, we introduce paths
between them concatenating features at corresponding network layers. Motivated
by the limited amount of training samples from real scenes, an interesting
attribute of our architecture is the capacity to supplement the existing
dataset by generating a new training dataset with high quality, realistic
scenes that even includes occlusion and real noise. We build the new dataset by
sampling the features directly from latent space which generates a pair of
partial volumetric surface and completed volumetric semantic surface. Moreover,
we utilize multiple discriminators to increase the accuracy and realism of the
reconstructions. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on standard
benchmarks for the two most common completion tasks: semantic 3D scene
completion and 3D object completion.

    <title>TR22-070 |  On Solving Sparse Polynomial Factorization Related Problems | 

	Ilya Volkovich, 

	Pranav Bisht</title>
    <summary>In a recent result of Bhargava, Saraf and Volkovich [FOCS’18; JACM’20], the first sparsity bound for constant individual degree polynomials was shown. In particular, it was shown that any factor of a polynomial with at most $s$ terms and individual degree bounded by $d$ can itself have at most $s^{O(d^2\log n)}$ terms. It is conjectured, though, that the "true" sparsity bound should be polynomial (i.e. $s^{poly(d)}$). In this paper we provide supporting evidence for this conjecture by presenting polynomial-time algorithms for several problems that would be implied by a polynomial-size sparsity bound. In particular, we give an efficient (deterministic) identity testing algorithms for $\Sigma^{[2]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\deg_{x_i} \leq d]}$ circuits and testing if a sparse polynomial is an exact power.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We have…I don’t know, I’ve lost count of the number of papers this month. It’s a big bonanza. Sublinear algorithms for edit distance, planar graphs, distributions, bipartite graphs, groups, error correcting codes, Bayesian nets, polynomials…</p>



<p>Let’s proceed with the spread.</p>



<p><strong>Improved Sublinear-Time Edit Distance for Preprocessed Strings</strong> by Karl Bringmann, Alejandro Cassis, Nick Fischer, and Vasileios Nakos (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14137">arXiv</a>). The edit distance between strings is a classic and important problem in algorithms. You might recall that classic \(O(n^2)\) algorithm to compute the edit distance between strings of length \(n\). It has been show that getting a \(O(n^{2-\delta})\) time algorithm is SETH-hard. But what can be done in sublinear time? This paper considers the preprocessed version: suppose we can perform near-linear preprocessing on the strings. We now want to distinguish between edit distance between \(\leq k\) and \(\geq k\cdot n^{o(1)}\). This paper shows that with near-linear preprocessing on strings, one can solve this problem in \(k \cdot n^{o(1)}\) time. </p>



<p><strong>Optimal Closeness Testing of Discrete Distributions Made <s>Complex</s> Simple</strong> by (our own) Clément L. Canonne and Yucheng Sun (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12640">arXiv</a>). Given two distributions \(p, q\) over support \([k]\), the aim is to distinguish between (i) the distributions being equal, and (ii) the total variation distance between \(p, q\) being at least \(\epsilon\). The tester should has a failure probability of at most \(\delta\). A recent work nails down the sample complexity with respect to all parameters. This paper gives a simpler proof of the main result. Earlier proofs used Poissonization tricks and fairly clever arguments about Poisson random variables. This proof is much more transparent, and uses an identity that relates the expectation of a random variable to its characteristic function. A nice feature of this proof is that it works directly with the multinomial distribution, which means a fixed number of samples (rather than choosing the number of samples from a distribution).</p>



<p><strong>Tolerant Bipartiteness Testing in Dense Graphs</strong> by Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, Rahul Raychaudhury, and Sayantan Sen (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12397">arXiv</a>). Testing bipartiteness of dense graphs is about as a classic as it gets. We wish to distinguish a bipartite graph from one that requires \(\varepsilon n^2\) edge removals to make it bipartite. Readers of this blog should know that there is a \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})\)-query property tester for this problem. (Ok, so now you know.) This paper studies the tolerant version of bipartiteness testing. Note that this is equivalent to approximating the maxcut, up to additive error \(\varepsilon n^2\). Classic approximation algorithms show that the latter can be done in \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-6})\) queries and \(\exp(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) time. This paper considers the easier problem of distinguishing whether the distance to bipartiteness is at most \(\varepsilon\) or at least \(2 \varepsilon\). This problem is solved in \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})\) queries and \(\exp(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}))\). </p>



<p><strong>Properly learning monotone functions via local reconstruction</strong> by Jane Lange, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11894">arXiv</a>). Ah yes, monotone functions. An ongoing love (obsession? interest?) for property testing people. This paper studies the problem of proper learning of Boolean valued monotone functions over the Boolean hypercube. Given access to uniform random evaluations of a monotone function \(f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\), we wish to compute a monotone function \(g\) that approximates the original function. Classic results from Fourier analysis show that an approximation  can be learned using \(\exp(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)\) queries. But this approximation function might not be monotone, and only yields improper learning. This paper gives a proper learner that outputs a monotone approximation, in roughly the same query complexity. This result directly gives a constant tolerance monotonicity tester for Boolean functions. The paper uses recent results from distributed algorithms and local computation. It also leads to tolerant testers for monotonicity over posets with small diameter.</p>



<p><strong>Massively Parallel Computation and Sublinear-Time Algorithms for Embedded Planar Graphs</strong> by Jacob Holm and Jakub Tětek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09035">arXiv</a>). Sublinear algorithms for planar graphs is another ongoing love (at least for me). This paper considers a new take of this problem: suppose we have access to a geometric embedding of a planar graph \(G\). Can we get sublinear algorithms for a variety of problems? This paper first shows how to construct a convenient decomposition, called an \(r\)-division, in sublinear time. This division can be used to approximate Lipschitz graph parameters, such as maximum matching sizes, maximum independent set, etc. The paper also shows how to compute an \(r\)-division in the MPC model, which solves many classic graph  problems (connected components, matchings, etc.) in \(O(1)\) rounds. There is a (conditional) lower bound showing that, without an embedding, it is not possible to solve such problems in \(O(1)\) rounds (and sublinear space per processor).</p>



<p><strong>Independence Testing for Bounded Degree Bayesian Network</strong> by Arnab Bhattacharyya, Clément L. Canonne (again, our own), and Joy Qiping Yang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08690">arXiv</a>). Given a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) on the Boolean hypercube \(\{0,1\}^n\), the problem is to determine whether \(\mathcal{P}\) is a product distribution. In general, this problem requires \(\Omega(2^n)\) samples. Suppose \(\mathcal{P}\) has a sparse, “efficient” description. Can we do better? This paper shows that when \(\mathcal{P}\) is generated by a Bayesian network (with bounded indegree), then the independence testing problem can be solved with a \(\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)\) samples. Think of a Bayesian network as a DAG, where each vertex generates a Bernoulli random variable. The variable at a vertex depends only the outcomes at its neighborhood.</p>



<p><strong>Low Degree Testing over the Reals </strong>by Vipul Arora, Arnab Bhattacharyya, Noah Fleming, Esty Kelman, and Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08404">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/051/">ECCC</a>). The problem testing low degree polynomials goes back to the birth of property testing. This paper studies real valued polynomials, in the distribution free setting. Formally, we have query access to a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\). The distance is measured with respect to an unknown distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over the domain. This paper shows that the real low degree testing problem can be solved in \(poly(d\varepsilon^{-1})\) queries (under some reasonableness conditions on the distribution). The approach is go to via the “self-correct and test” approach: try to compute a low degree polynomial that fits some sampled data, and then check how far the self-corrected version is from another sample.</p>



<p><strong>Testing distributional assumptions of learning algorithms</strong> by Ronitt Rubinfeld and Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07196.pdf">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of learning a halfspace over \(\mathbb{R}^n\). If the underlying distribution is Gaussian, then this class can be learned in \(n^{poly(\varepsilon^{-1})}\) samples. If the distribution is arbitrary, no \(2^{o(n)}\) algorithm is known despite much research. This paper introduces the notion of having a <em>tester-learner</em> pair. The tester first checks if the input distribution is “well-behaved” (Gaussian-like). If the tester passes, then we run the learner. Indeed, this perspective goes back to some of the original motivations for property testing (when is testing faster than learning). The intriguing aspect of this problem is that we do not have efficient testers for determining if an input distribution is Gaussian. This paper circumvents that problem by estimating certain moments of the distribution. If these moments agree with the moments of a Gaussian, then the learner is guaranteed to succeed. We get the best of both worlds: if the input distribution is Gaussian, the learning is done correctly. If the learner succeeds, then then output (hypothesis) is guaranteed to be correct, regardless of the input distribution.</p>



<p><strong>Testability in group theory</strong> by Oren Becker, Alexander Lubotzky, and Jonathan Mosheiff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04539">arXiv</a>). This paper is the journal version of a result of the authors, and it gives a group theoretic presentation of a property testing result. Consider the following problem. The input is a pair permutations \((\sigma_1, \sigma_2)\) over \([n]\). The aim is to test whether they commute: \(\sigma_1 \sigma_2 = \sigma_2 \sigma_1\). Another result of the authors gives a tester that makes \(O(\varepsilon^{-1})\) queries. They refer to this problem as “testing the relation” \(XY = YX\). This paper gives a grand generalization of that result, best explained by another example. Consider another relation/property denoted \(\{XZ = ZX, YZ = ZY\}\). This property consists of all triples of permutations \((\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3)\), where \(\sigma_3\) commutes with the other two. A consequence of the main theorem is that this property is not testable with query complexity independent of \(n\). The main result of this paper is a characterization of testable relations, which goes via studying the expansion of an infinite graph associated with the relation.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Positive Semidefiniteness Using Linear Measurements</strong> by Deanna Needell, William Swartworth, and David P. Woodruff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03782">arXiv</a>). The input is a \(d \times d\) real, symmetric matrix \(M\) and we wish to determine if it is positive semidefinite (all eigenvalues are positive). For the testing problem, we reject when the minimum eigenvalue is at most \(-\varepsilon \|M\|_2\). (The paper also considers general Schatten \(p\)-norms.) This paper gives a list of results for non-adaptive vs adaptive, and one-sided vs two-sided testers. There are two access models considered: a single query consists of either a (i) matrix-vector product \(Mx\) or (ii) vector-matrix-vector product \(y^TMx\). Typical models that query entries of the matrix require strong bounds on the entries, which is less reasonable in practical situations. An interesting discovery is that the non-adaptive, one-sided complexity is \(\Theta(\sqrt{d}\varepsilon^{-1})\) while the two-sided bound is independent of \(d\).</p>



<p><strong>Relaxed Locally Decodable and Correctable Codes: Beyond Tensoring</strong> by Gil Cohen and Tal Yankovitz (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/045/">ECCC</a>). Locally decodable and correctable codes are a fundamental object of study in property testing (and TCS in general). Consider a locally correctable code (LCC). Given a string \(x\), the decoder/corrector makes \(q\) queries to \(x\), and outputs a symbol. We can think of the output collectively as a string \(y\). If \(x\) is a codeword, then \(y = x\). Otherwise, \(dist(y,z) \leq \varepsilon\), where \(z\) is some codeword close to \(x\). In the relaxed version, the corrector is allowed to output \(\bot\), denoting that it has discovered corruption. The distance is only measured in the coordinates where the corrector does not output \(\bot\). Thus, the corrector gets a “free pass” if it outputs \(\bot\). But note that when \(x\) is a codeword, the output must be exactly \(x\). This paper gives a Relaxed LCC with query complexity \((\log n)^{O(\log\log\log n)}\), a significant improvement over the previous best \((\log n)^{O(\log\log n)}\). It is know from previous work that the query complexity must be \(\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})\).</p>



<p><strong>Verifying The Unseen: Interactive Proofs for Label-Invariant Distribution Properties</strong> by Tal Herman and Guy Rothblum (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/052/">arXiv</a>). This paper considers the distribution testing problem in the context of interactive proofs. The verifier, who wishes to test a property of a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\), interacts with a prover who knows the distribution. The guarantee required is the standard one for interactive proof systems: in the YES case, an honest prover should be able to convince the verifier. In the NO case, no prover can convince the verifier with high probability. There are two important parameters of interest: the sample complexity of the verifier, and the communication complexity of the messages. It is useful to consider the two extremes. In one extreme, the verifier can simply solve the problem herself, ignoring the prover. This could require \(\Theta(n/\log n)\) queries (for the hardest properties like entropy and support size). Another extreme is for the honest prover to simply send an approximate description of the distribution, which takes \(O(n)\) bits. The prover can just test equality to the prover message, which only takes \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\) queries. This paper shows a 2-round protocol for any (label-invariant) property where both the communication and the sample complexity can be made \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\). This result shows the power of interaction for distribution testing problems.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Since the late 19th century, mathematicians have realized the importance and generality of selection problems: given a collection of sets, select an element in each set, possibly in a “nice” way. Of particular importance in computer science is the scenario where the ground set is a metric space, in which case it is natural to ask for <strong>Lipschitz</strong> selection. In this talk I will describe a far-reaching extension of this classical Lipschitz selection problem to an *online* setting, where sets are streaming to the selector. I will show how Riemannian gradient descent (aka mirror descent) can be used to approach this type of problems. I will illustrate the power of the framework by solving a long-standing problem in online shortest path known as layered graph traversal (introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in 1989).</p>

    <title>TR22-069 |  List-Decoding Random Walk XOR Codes Near the Johnson Bound | 

	Silas Richelson, 

	Sourya Roy</title>
    <summary>In a breakthrough result, Ta-Shma described an explicit construction of an almost optimal binary code (STOC 2017).  Ta-Shma's code has distance $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$ and rate $\Omega\bigl(\varepsilon^{2+o(1)}\bigr)$ and thus it almost achieves the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, except for the $o(1)$ term in the exponent.  The prior best list-decoding algorithm for (a variant of) Ta-Shma's code achieves is due to Alev et al (STOC 2021).  This algorithm makes use of SDP hierarchies, and is able to recover from a $\frac{1-\rho}{2}-$fraction of errors as long as $\rho\geq2^{\log(1/\varepsilon)^{1/6}}$.  In this work we give an improved analysis of a similar list-decoding algorithm.  Our algorithm works for Ta-Shma's original code, and it is able to list-decode almost all the way to the Johnson bound: it can recover from a $\frac{1-\rho}{2}-$fraction of errors as long as $\rho\geq2\sqrt{\varepsilon}$.</summary>

    <title>TR22-068 |  Sketching Approximability of (Weak) Monarchy Predicates | 

	Santhoshini Velusamy, 

	Chi-Ning  Chou, 

	Madhu Sudan, 

	Alexander Golovnev, 

	Amirbehshad Shahrasbi</title>
    <summary>We analyze the sketching approximability of constraint satisfaction problems on Boolean domains, where the constraints are balanced linear threshold functions applied to literals. In particular, we explore the approximability of monarchy-like functions where the value of the function is determined by a weighted combination of the vote of the first variable (the president) and the sum of the votes of all remaining variables. The pure version of this function is when the president can only be overruled by when all remaining variables agree. For every $k \geq 5$, we show that CSPs where the underlying predicate is a pure monarchy function on $k$ variables have no non-trivial sketching approximation algorithm in $o(\sqrt{n})$ space. We also show infinitely many weaker monarchy functions for which CSPs using such constraints are non-trivially approximable by $O(\log(n))$ space sketching algorithms. Moreover, we give the first example of sketching approximable asymmetric Boolean CSPs. Our results work within the framework of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy (FOCS 2021) that characterizes the sketching approximability of all CSPs. Their framework can be applied naturally to get a computer-aided analysis of the approximability of any specific constraint satisfaction problem. The novelty of our work is in using their work to get an analysis that applies to infinitely many problems simultaneously.</summary>

    <title>TR22-067 |  Black-box Identity Testing of Noncommutative Rational Formulas of Inversion Height Two in Deterministic Quasipolynomial-time | 

	Vikraman Arvind, 

	Abhranil Chatterjee, 

	Partha Mukhopadhyay</title>
    <summary>Hrube\v{s} and Wigderson (2015) initiated the complexity-theoretic study of noncommutative formulas with inverse gates. They introduced the Rational Identity Testing (RIT) problem which is to decide whether a noncommutative rational formula computes zero in the free skew field. In the white-box setting, deterministic polynomial-time algorithms are known for this problem following the works of Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Wigderson (2016) and Ivanyos, Qiao, and Subrahmanyam (2018).

A central open problem in this area is to design an efficient deterministic black-box identity testing algorithm for rational formulas. In this paper, we solve this problem for the first nested inverse case. More precisely, we obtain a deterministic quasipolynomial-time black-box RIT algorithm for noncommutative rational formulas of inversion height two via a hitting set construction. Several new technical ideas are involved in the hitting set construction, including key concepts from matrix coefficient realization theory (Vol?i?, 2018) and properties of cyclic division algebra (Lam, 2001). En route to the proof, an important step is to embed the hitting set of Forbes and Shpilka for noncommutative formulas (2013) inside a cyclic division algebra of small index.</summary>

    <title>TR22-066 |  On sketching approximations for symmetric Boolean CSPs | 

	Joanna Boyland, 

	Michael Hwang, 

	Tarun Prasad, 

	Noah Singer, 

	Santhoshini Velusamy</title>
    <summary>A Boolean maximum constraint satisfaction problem, Max-CSP\((f)\), is specified by a predicate \(f:\{-1,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}\). An \(n\)-variable instance of Max-CSP\((f)\) consists of a list of constraints, each of which applies \(f\) to \(k\) distinct literals drawn from the \(n\) variables. For \(k=2\), Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy [CGV20, FOCS 2020] obtained explicit ratios characterizing the \(\sqrt n\)-space streaming approximability of every predicate. For \(k \geq 3\), Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy [CGSV21, arXiv:2102.12351] proved a general dichotomy theorem for \(\sqrt n\)-space sketching algorithms: For every \(f\), there exists \(\alpha(f)\in (0,1]\) such that for every \(\epsilon&gt;0\), Max-CSP\((f)\) is \((\alpha(f)-\epsilon)\)-approximable by an \(O(\log n)\)-space linear sketching algorithm, but \((\alpha(f)+\epsilon)\)-approximation sketching algorithms require \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) space.
     
In this work, we give closed-form expressions for the sketching approximation ratios of multiple families of symmetric Boolean functions. Letting \(\alpha'_k = 2^{-(k-1)} (1-k^{-2})^{(k-1)/2}\), we show that for odd \(k \geq 3\), \(\alpha(k\)AND\()\, = \alpha'_k\), and for even \(k \geq 2\), \(\alpha(k\)AND\()\, = 2\alpha'_{k+1}\). Thus, for every \(k\), \(k\)AND can be \((2-o(1))2^{-k}\)-approximated by \(O(\log n)\)-space sketching algorithms; we contrast this with a lower bound of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, Velingker, and Velusamy [STOC 2022] implying that streaming \((2+\epsilon)\cdot2^{-k}\)-approximations require \(\Omega(n)\) space! We also resolve the ratio for the "at-least-\((k-1)\)-\(1\)'s" function for all even \(k\); the "exactly-\(\frac{k+1}2\)-\(1\)'s" function for odd \(k \in \{3,\ldots,51\}\); and fifteen other functions. We stress here that for general \(f\), the dichotomy theorem in [CGSV21] only implies that \(\alpha(f)\) can be computed to arbitrary precision in \(\textbf{PSPACE}\), and thus closed-form expressions need not have existed a priori. Our analyses involve identifying and exploiting structural "saddle-point" properties of this dichotomy.
    
Separately, for all threshold functions, we give optimal "bias-based" approximation algorithms generalizing [CGV20] while simplifying [CGSV21]. Finally, we investigate the \(\sqrt n\)-space streaming lower bounds in [CGSV21], and show that they are incomplete for \(3\)AND, i.e., they fail to rule out \((\alpha(3\)AND\()-\epsilon)\)-approximations in \(o(\sqrt n)\) space.</summary>

<p>
When Faculty transfer to emeritus status and retain a professional connection with Princeton, they are expected to conduct their future research and University-related activities with the same ethical standards currently expected from all Princeton Faculty. </p>
<p>
Emeritus faculty members may receive such University publications as the Princeton University Bulletin and the Princeton Alumni Weekly, as well as agendas and minutes of University Faculty Meetings. They may attend meetings of the University and departmental faculty upon invitation, but do not have votes at these meetings. Emeritus faculty members continue to receive University identification cards and to have use of the library, the athletic facilities and dining facilities on the same basis as active faculty members. </p>

Later in 1985 he joined the faculty at Princeton as <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/05/03/sedgewick-recognized-contribution-computer-science-education">founding</a> chair of the Department of Computer Science. Two founding positions—pretty neat. His first-year courses in computer science are among the most popular ever offered at Princeton. He also pioneered the practice of replacing large live lectures with on-demand online videos—pretty clever. </p>
<p>
Bob has worked at research institutions outside of Princeton during summers and leaves. Three come to mind: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://idaccr.org/about-us">IDA</a>, the Institute for Defense Analyses, gave him an opportunity to work with the CRAY-1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">supercomputer</a>.
</li><li> <a href="https://www.parc.com">PARC</a>, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, gave him an opportunity to see the personal computer come into existence.
</li><li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Institute_for_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Automation">INRIA</a>, The Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, gave him a chance to work closely with Philippe Flajolet
</li></ul>
<p>
I joined him at IDA a few years later. I had to get a security clearance which is another whole story—see this <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/09/03/open-problems-that-might-be-easy/">post</a> for some fun thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Some More History </b></p>
<p/><p>
Bob and I wrote some papers together: Two were on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration">VLSI</a>. The first on <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1981Lower.pdf">lower</a> bounds on the size of chips that computed something and the second on a language <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1982ALI.pdf">ALI</a> for designing VLSI circuits. </p>
<p>
Another paper was included also Jin-yi Cai and Andy Yao on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/336546">Towards Uncheatable benchmarks</a>. Or see a follow-on <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-35568-9_18.pdf">paper</a>. </p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>So, I’d been planning a fun post for today about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E">DALL-E</a> image-generating AI model, and in particular, a brief new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13807">preprint</a> about DALL-E’s capabilities by <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~davise/">Ernest Davis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Marcus">Gary Marcus</a>, and myself.  We wrote this preprint as a sort of “adversarial collaboration”: Ernie and Gary started out deeply skeptical of DALL-E, while I was impressed bordering on awestruck.  I was pleasantly surprised that we nevertheless managed to produce a text that we all agreed on.</p>



<p>Not for the first time, though, world events have derailed my plans.  The most important part of today’s post is this:</p>



<p><strong>For the next week, I, Scott Aaronson, will personally match all reader donations to <a href="https://fundtexaschoice.org/">Fund Texas Choice</a>—a group that helps women in Texas travel to out-of-state health clinics, for reasons that are neither your business nor mine—up to a total of $5,000.</strong></p>



<p>To show my seriousness, I’ve already donated $1,000.  Just let me know how much you’ve donated in the comments section!</p>



<p>The first reason for this donation drive is that, perhaps like many of you, I stayed up hours last night reading Alito’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21835435-scotus-initial-draft">leaked decision</a> in a state of abject terror.  I saw how the logic of the decision, consistent and impeccable on its own terms, is one by which the Supreme Court’s five theocrats could now proceed to unravel the whole of modernity.  I saw how this court, unchecked by our broken democratic system, can now permanently enshrine the will of a radical minority, perhaps unless and until the United States is plunged into a second Civil War.</p>



<p>Anyway, that’s the first reason for the donation drive.  The second reason is to thank <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>‘s commenters for their … err, consistently generous and thought-provoking contributions.  Let’s take, for example, <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405#comment-1938839">this</a> comment on last week’s admittedly <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405">rather silly post</a>, from an anonymous individual who calls herself “Feminist Bitch,” and who was enraged that it took me <em>a</em> <em>full day</em> to process one of the great political cataclysms of our lifetimes and publicly react to it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>OF COURSE. Not a word about Roe v. Wade being overturned, but we get a pseudo-intellectual rationalist-tier rant about whatever’s bumping around Scott’s mind right now. Women’s most basic reproductive rights are being curtailed AS WE SPEAK and not a peep from Scott, eh? Even though in our state (Texas) there are already laws ON THE BOOKS that will criminalize abortion as soon as the alt-right fascists in our Supreme Court give the go-ahead. If you cared one lick about your female students and colleagues, Scott, you’d be posting about the Supreme Court and helping feminist causes, not posting your “memes.” But we all know Scott doesn’t give a shit about women. He’d rather stand up for creepy nerdbros and their right to harass women than women’s right to control their own fucking bodies. Typical Scott.</p></blockquote>



<p>If you want, you can <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405#comment-1938839">read</a> all of Feminist Bitch’s further thoughts about my failings, with my every attempt to explain and justify myself met with further contempt.  No doubt my well-meaning friends of both sexes would counsel me to ignore her.  Alas, from my <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/the-blog-comment-that-achieved-an-internet-miracle/384539/">infamous ordeal</a> of late 2014, I know that with her every word, Feminist Bitch speaks for thousands, and the knowledge eats at me day and night.</p>



<p>It’s often said that “the right looks for converts, while the left looks only for heretics.”  Has Feminist Bitch ever stopped to think about <em>how</em> our civilization reached its current terrifying predicament—how Trump won in 2016, how the Supreme Court got packed with extremists who represent a mere 25% of the country, how Putin and Erdogan and Orban and Bolsonaro and all the rest consolidated their power?  Does she think it happened because wokeists like herself reached out too much, made too many inroads among fellow citizens who share <em>some</em> but not <em>all</em> of their values?  Would Feminist Bitch say that, if the Democrats want to capitalize on the coming tsunami of outrage about the death of <em>Roe</em> and the shameless lies that enabled it, if they want to sweep to victory in the midterms and enshrine abortion rights into federal law … then their best strategy would be to double down on their condemnations of gross, creepy, smelly, white male nerdbros who all the girls, like, <em>totally hate</em>?</p>



<p>(until, thank God, some of them don’t)</p>



<p>I continue to think that the majority of my readers, of all races and sexes and backgrounds, are reasonable and sane.  I continue to think the majority of you recoil against hatred and dehumanization of <em>anyone</em>—whether that means women seeking abortions, gays, trans folks, or (gasp!) even white male techbros.  In this sad twilight for the United States and for liberal democracy around the world, we the reasonable and sane, we the fans of the Enlightenment, we the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3922">Party of Psychological Complexity</a>, have decades of work cut out for us.  For now I’ll simply say: I don’t hear from you nearly enough in the comments.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-065 |  Streaming and Sketching Complexity of CSPs: A survey | 

	Madhu Sudan</title>
    <summary>In this survey we describe progress over the last decade or so in understanding the complexity of solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) approximately in the streaming and sketching models of computation. After surveying some of the results we give some sketches of the proofs and in particular try to explain why there is a tight dichotomy result for sketching algorithms working in subpolynomial space regime.</summary>

    <title>TR22-064 |  Improved Low-Depth Set-Multilinear Circuit Lower Bounds | 

	Deepanshu Kush, 

	Shubhangi Saraf</title>
    <summary>In this paper, we prove strengthened lower bounds for constant-depth set-multilinear formulas. More precisely, we show that over any field, there is an explicit polynomial $f$ in VNP defined over $n^2$ variables, and of degree $n$, such that any product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formula computing $f$ has size at least $n^{\Omega \left( n^{1/\Delta}/\Delta\right)}$. The hard polynomial $f$ comes from the class of Nisan-Wigderson (NW) design-based polynomials. 

Our lower bounds improve upon the recent work of Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas (STOC 2022), where a lower bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega (\Delta n^{1/\Delta})}$ was shown for the size of product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formulas computing the iterated matrix multiplication (IMM) polynomial of the same degree and over the same number of variables as $f$. Moreover, our lower bounds are novel for any $\Delta\geq 2$.

The precise quantitative expression in our lower bound is interesting also because the lower bounds we obtain are "sharp" in the sense that any asymptotic improvement would imply general set-multilinear circuit lower bounds via depth reduction results. 

In the setting of general set-multilinear formulas, a lower bound of the form $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ was already obtained by Raz (J. ACM 2009) for the more general model of multilinear formulas. The techniques of LST (which extend the techniques of the same authors in (FOCS 2021)) give a different route to set-multilinear formula lower bounds, and allow them to obtain a lower bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega(\log n)}$ for the size of general set-multilinear formulas computing the IMM polynomial. Our proof techniques are another variation on those of LST, and enable us to show an improved lower bound (matching that of Raz) of the form $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$, albeit for the same polynomial $f$ in VNP (the NW polynomial). As observed by LST, if the same $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ size lower bounds for unbounded-depth set-multilinear formulas could be obtained for the IMM polynomial, then using the self-reducibility of IMM and using hardness escalation results, this would imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general algebraic formulas.</summary>

    <title>TR22-063 |  Fast Multivariate Multipoint Evaluation Over All Finite Fields | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	Sumanta Ghosh, 

	Zeyu Guo, 

	Chris Umans, 

	Vishwas Bhargava</title>
    <summary>Multivariate multipoint evaluation is the problem of evaluating a multivariate polynomial, given as a coefficient vector, simultaneously at multiple evaluation points. In this work, we show that there exists a deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over any finite field $\mathbb{F}$ that outputs the evaluations of an $m$-variate polynomial of degree less than $d$ in each variable at $N$ points in time 
\[
(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\cdot poly(m,d,\log|\F|)
\]
for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and all sufficiently large $d\in \mathbb{N}$.

A previous work of Kedlaya and Umans (FOCS 2008, SICOMP 2011) achieved the same time complexity when the number of variables $m$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ and had left the problem of removing this condition as an open problem. A recent work of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra (STOC 2022) answered this question when the underlying field is not too large  and has characteristic less than $d^{o(1)}$. In this work, we remove this constraint on the number of variables over all finite fields, thereby answering the question of Kedlaya and Umans over all finite fields. 

Our algorithm relies on a non-trivial combination of ideas from three seemingly different previously known algorithms for multivariate multipoint evaluation, namely the algorithms of Kedlaya and Umans, that of  Bj\"orklund, Kaski and Williams (IPEC 2017, Algorithmica 2019), and that of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra, together with a result of Bombieri and Vinogradov from analytic number theory about the distribution of primes in an arithmetic progression. 

We also present a second algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation that is completely elementary and in particular, avoids the use of the Bombieri--Vinogradov Theorem. However, it requires a mild assumption that the field size is bounded by an exponential-tower in $d$ of bounded height. More specifically, our second algorithm solves the multivariate multipoint evaluation problem over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ in time 
\[
(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\cdot poly(m,d,\log |\mathbb{F}|)\]
for all $m\in \mathbb{N}$ and all sufficiently large $d\in \mathbb{N}$, provided that the size of the finite field $\mathbb{F}$ is at most $(\exp(\exp(\exp(\cdots (\exp(d)))))$, where the height of this tower of exponentials is fixed.</summary>

    </summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This blog post is a book review of sorts for the following two books:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explain-World-Discovery-Modern-Science/dp/0062346660">To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern Science</a> by Steven Weinberg (2016)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Machine-Irrationality-Created-Science/dp/1631491377/">The Knowledge Machine: How Irrationality Created Modern Science</a> by Michael Strevens (2020).</p>



<p>Both books cover (in different proportions) the history and philosophy of science. By the end of this post, I will also discuss my thoughts. <em>Trigger warning:</em> I will end up comparing science to the blockchain and finding positive aspects of the dreaded “reviewer 2”.</p>



<p>Both books attempt to answer the question of <strong>“why and how did the scientific revolution happen?”</strong>. Strevens describes this conundrum as follows:</p>



<p><em>“[If you were a citizen of ancient Greece], you could enjoy just about every cultural invention that makes life worth living today. You could delight in the poetry of Homer and Sappho, visit the theater to relish Oedipus Rex and other masterpieces of ancient drama… You could live in cities regulated by law and a system of courts shaped by the architects and sculptors who built some of the seven wonders of the world and governed in accordance with political models that have lasted to this day: monarchy, oligarchy, sweet democracy.”</em></p>



<p>The point Strevens makes is that while obviously, a lot has changed in culture and society since 300 BC, the change has not been so drastic as to make life unrecognizably different. In contrast, science and technology have undergone drastic changes in the same period, with most changes occurring in the last few centuries. Weinberg quotes the historian Herbert Butterfield, who claimed that the scientific revolution <em>“outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank of mere episodes.”</em></p>



<p>If you are the type of person who prefers data to quotes from historians, there is no shortage of graphs demonstrating this point, including the following:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DMx0_KjPGixzzYdBleMYRX2Xx_sf0ubgbU04kyluA_vMugVbJhnRnI_I8lY7u8h2qYfHVxjnKltPKG8V94LrNYMGAeUPvV8I-h8JPFL00rC8FCReH0E-aavJsV7gnxpwXSRv43RH0tRF_ES8uA"/></figure>



<p>(The right graph is adapted from Terry Tao’s excellent <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/10/10/the-cosmic-distance-ladder-ver-4-1/">cosmic distance ladder</a> presentation; I was happy to hear Tao is planning to turn it into a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/10/10/climbing-the-cosmic-distance-ladder-book-announcement/">popular science book</a>.)</p>



<p>One distinguishing property of science (compared to activities such as religion, philosophy, art, political thought, sports etc.) is that it simultaneously satisfies the following three properties:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Consensus:</strong> While scientists don’t agree about everything, they generally agree on much, and the scientific literature does seem to converge toward consensus in the long run. Perhaps most importantly, even when scientists disagree on interpreting facts, they agree on what these facts are and agree on the forum where these should be discussed. In contrast, there is much less consensus in other spheres of human activities. Often, there isn’t even a consensus on what forum to hold the debate or even if to hold it at all. As far as I know, there isn’t a <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em> journal of theology where clergypersons of all faiths debate with one another. Indeed, with the polarized media these days, there are fewer and fewer forums where Democrats and Republicans debate with one another.<br/></li><li><strong>Change:</strong> The consensus is not just frozen in time but instead evolves. Scientists today generally agree with one another, but their views have radically changed over time. While, as Strevens notes, in art and religion, millennia-old texts are still very much relevant, in Machine Learning, when I recommend my students “read the classics,” I mean papers written before 2018 <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/><br/></li><li><strong>Correlation with reality:</strong> Science does not merely change but also <em>progresses</em>, in the sense that with time we gain a better understanding of nature. While some radical subjectivists might dispute that external reality exists or that science gets to know more of it, most people who have ever flown in a plane, were administered a vaccine, or read a blog post over the Internet, will agree that science did advance. Science’s path may be a random walk, but that walk is biased towards progress.</li></ul>



<p>Science did not always possess the above properties, and the distinction between science and philosophy was much murkier in the past. Both Strevens and Weinberg trace the birth of modern science to the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. Both books describe the history of science and attempt to answer what changed since ancient times and why.</p>



<p><strong>Strevens: Modern Science as a result of Newton and the “Iron Rule”:</strong></p>



<p>Strevens begins by explaining the philosophies of Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn. I found this part very informative since I have never read a proper philosophy of science book.  (He also describes their fascinating personal histories.)</p>



<p>For Popper, progress in science happens via <em>refutations</em>. At a given point in time, there is a collection of hypotheses H₁,…,Hₖ that are currently consistent with known experiments. Then an experiment happens which refutes some of these, narrowing down the set of potentially feasible theories.</p>



<p>According to Strevens, Popper is an absolutist. Once a theory has been falsified, it’s dead, and all theories that have not been yet falsified will <em>“forever remain … conjectures”</em>. That is, Popper was not a Bayesian and did not assign any likelihood to theories based on how many true predictions they made. The only question was whether they still survive or have been refuted.</p>



<p>Popper is said to have been inspired by Einstein, who was willing to put his theory to the test and said, <em>“if the redshift of spectral lines due to the gravitational potential should not exist, then [my] general theory of relativity will be untenable.” </em> Indeed, a classical story of testing a theory via refutation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_experiment">Eddington’s expedition</a> to check Einstein’s predictions during the 1919 total solar eclipse. Specifically, due to the curvature of space, the effect of the sun’s gravity on the light shining from stars would be double the effect predicted by Newton’s theory. </p>



<p>A priori, the Eddington expedition seems like a textbook Popperian refutation: an experiment is set out to test conflicting predictions of two theories, after which only one of them will survive. However, as Strevens points out, the truth is murkier. The expedition took three measurements: one on the island of Principe, off the coast of West Africa, and two in Brazil. The weather in Principe was cloudy, and the resulting photos were blurry. In Brazil weather was good, but the measurements were taken using two different telescopes that gave conflicting results. Concretely, one of the Brazil telescopes’ measurements conformed with Einstein’s predictions, while the other conformed with the Newtonian theory. Eddington argued that the second Brazil telescope had a systematic error, and hence Einstein’s theory was confirmed. This was accepted by the Royal Society and made big headlines at the time. While Eddington probably <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01172-z">made the best conclusion given the data</a>, Strevens claims that he also had extra-scientific motivations to endorse Einstein’s theory: a desire to unite British and German science after WW-I. Einstein’s response to the experiment was also famously non-Popperian: When asked what he would have done if the investigation had the opposing results, he said, <em>“Then I would feel sorry for the dear Lord. The theory is correct anyway.”</em></p>



<p>Thomas Kuhn famously saw scientific progress as not so much a process of incremental refutation as periodic revolutions and paradigm shifts. A paradigm consists not just of mere factual predictions but also ways of thinking and determining truth. As such, paradigms are internally self-consistent, and one cannot “refute” them as much as step away from them, when they outlive their usefulness and cannot handle “anomalies”. Geo-centrism is a good example. While Strevens doesn’t say this, it is impossible to refute a geocentric point of the world (we can always say that the sun rotates around the earth but just does it in a very complex path). And of course, as Earth-based scientists, making it the center of the universe is a very natural prior assumption. Therefore, Helio-centrism did not arise from refuting geo-centrism but through switching to a different paradigm. </p>



<p>For Popper, scientific theories die in a duel with one another. For Kuhn, they die of old age. As scientists struggle ever more to get useful results out of their current paradigm (maybe fine-tuning it more and more to fit the data), they get the sinking feeling that it’s a dead end, and are ready to accept a new paradigm.  While some of Kuhn’s radical followers believed there is no such thing as scientific progress and all paradigms are equally valid, Strevens says that (at least later in life)  Kuhn did not agree with this view. Thus, for Kuhn, while switching paradigms is not as much a rational deliberation as a “leap of faith,” it typically results in improved understanding and predictive power. </p>



<p>If the Popperian scientist is a refutation machine, according to Kuhn, the vast majority of scientists are confirmation machines. They cannot see beyond the current paradigm, but rather because of their belief in it, they continue to push it forward, accumulating more and more data until its natural demise. Popper thought of scientists as always keeping an open mind and never believing in anything not proven. Kuhn thought that blind faith (and the pleasure of “puzzle-solving”) keeps scientists going in what 99% of the time is a slog to do more experiments and produce more data.</p>



<p>Strevens has his own view on the philosophy of science. In particular, he pinpoints the beginning of the Scientific Revolution to a single person – Isaac Newton. To Strevens, Newton’s theory was so different from what came before because it gives precise predictions without claiming to explain the deeper reasons. Newton gave the equation for gravity without explaining why objects can act on each other at a distance. In his postscript to the Principia, Newton said,</p>



<p> <em>“I have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reasons for these properties of gravity, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena … [has] no place in experimental philosophy. … It is enough that gravity really exists and acts according to the laws that we have set forth and is sufficient to explain all the motions of the heavenly bodies and of our sea.” </em></p>



<p>In other words, Strevens sees Newton as saying, “shut up and calculate,” and indeed believes that Newton would have had no trouble with quantum mechanics’ famous “measurement problem.”  </p>



<p>Strevens sees this as key to modern science: giving up on deeper explanation and focusing only on empirical predictions. He admits scientists take other considerations, including the beauty of theories, into account in their motivations. But he claims that the “rules of engagement” are that all scientific disputes should be settled based on empirical evidence alone and within the domain of the formal scientific literature. He calls this the “Iron Rule of Explanations.” Strevens also sees Newton as science personified, in the sense in which Newton was an archetype of the modern scientific professionalism, formalism, and compartmentalization of thought. While Newton was very interested in both alchemy and biblical studies, unlike prior philosophers, he completely separated those interests from his work on physics. In that, Strevens says, Newton anticipated the modern universities, with its focus on specialization. </p>



<p>“Breaking down silos” is a common slogan these days, but Strevens argues that specialization and compartmentalization were crucial to science’s success. He says that  <em>“whatever is lost through detachment and disregard for the grand view of life is more than recompensed by the narrow, tightly focused beam that searches out the diminutive but telling fact.”</em></p>



<p><strong>Weinberg: Science history through modern eyes</strong></p>



<p>Weinberg’s is a gem of a book. Weinberg does not merely describe the works of ancient scientists, but he redoes their calculations, explaining what they got right, what they got wrong, and whether or not they could have done better with the data available. The book contains 35 technical notes, including everything from reworking Aristarchus’ derivations of the sizes and distances of the sun and the moon, through Descartes’ derivation of the law of refraction, to Newton’s calculations showing that the moon’s motion can be explained by the same gravitational force we see here on earth.</p>



<p>Weinberg places the beginning of the scientific revolution with Copernicus. While the choice of starting point might seem immaterial, this betrays a nearly opposite philosophical stance to Strevens’. While Strevens sees the reduction of science’s goal to empirical predictions as key, Copernicus’ heliocentric theory was actually a <em>step back</em> in terms of predictive power. The theory fitted the data worse than the prior geocentric theory of Ptolemy. Ptolemy introduced <em>epicycles</em> to adjust Aristotle’s clean but wrong geocentric theory to fit the data better. Today we know that epicycles correspond to the Fourier decomposition, and hence with enough of them, one can fit any periodic function. So, Ptolemy’s theory was the quintessential “shut up and calculate” theory: a good fit with observed data, but ugly and with several “fine-tuned” aspects that didn’t have any explanations. This has troubled astronomers for ages. The following words of the 12th-century Muslim scholar Ibn Rushd about Ptolemy’s theory could have been written about quantum mechanics today: <em>“The astronomical science of our days surely offers nothing from which one can derive an existing reality. The model that has been developed in the time in which we live accords with the computations, not with existence.” </em>[A side note is that quantum mechanics is very different from Ptolemy’s theory in the sense that while it does not offer a satisfactory story about reality, it is not “fine-tuned” and has its own sense of beauty, even if seeing this beauty is an “acquired taste”.]</p>



<p>Thus Copernicus’ contribution was not to find a more predictive theory, but rather a more beautiful one. As Weinberg says, this theory <em>“provides a classic example of how a theory can be selected on aesthetic criteria, with no experimental evidence that factors it over other theories… [this is] a recurrent theme in the history of physical science: a simple and beautiful theory that agrees pretty well with observation is often closer to the truth than a complicated ugly theory that agrees better with observation.”</em> [This might be a point to make a side note: while Popper, Kuhn, and (to some extent) Strevens often consider experiments as having discrete or logical outcomes – either true or false – for Weinberg quantities are always continuous or approximate, and every experiment always has a measure of uncertainty.]</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, while Strevens calls Francis Bacon’s extreme-empiricist book “one of the most significant books ever written on scientific inquiry”, Weinberg says that Bacon is one of the individuals “whose importance in the scientific revolution is most overrated” and that “it is not clear to me that anyone’s scientific work was actually changed for the better by Bacon’s writing.”</p>



<p>That is, as far as Weinberg is concerned, the novel parts of Bacon’s writing– the extreme empiricism– are false, and the true parts— plain-old experimentalism— are not novel and were known to scientists before Bacon’s time.</p>



<p>However, both Strevens and Weinberg agree on the significance of Newton. Newton’s innovation was not showing that gravity induces a uniform acceleration on objects. As Weinberg describes, already in 1603 Galileo did experiments showing that an object in free fall undergoes uniform acceleration, and showed that the distance it undergoes under gravity is proportional to the square of the time. Newton’s crucial insight was that the same relation is enough to explain the motion of the moon around the earth. He then saw that the ratio between the gravitational acceleration on earth and the one applied on the moon corresponds to the square of the distance between the two objects, and so (through Kepler’s law and his own invention of calculus) used this relation to explain the motion of all planets around the sun. </p>



<p>This was an astounding achievement. Not because Newton dared use a calculation without understanding the underlying mechanism: that was already done thousands of years before by Ptolemy and many others. Rather the impressive feat was that Newton formulated a simple law that works equally well on falling apples here on earth as well as moving stars in space. By doing this, Newton gave us the reason to hope that there are simple mathematical laws that govern all objects in the universe, and truly initiated modern science.</p>



<p><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong></p>



<p>I enjoyed reading both books and highly recommend them.  Personally, I am more inclined toward Weinberg’s view than Strevens’. I think the history of science is fascinating and can teach us a lot about science even today. The philosophy of science, whether Bacon’s, Popper’s, Kuhn’s, or Strevens’, is nice to know but is of second-order importance. That said, I think Strevens does make an essential point that the scientific “rules of engagement” may well have been key to maintaining the balance between progress and consensus that made science so successful. In particular, he believes that much of science’s success can be explained by its emphasis on formal publications, with their insistence on a “sterile language” and spelling out all details of experiments or calculations, maintained through the peer review process and generations of “reviewers 2”. This might be something to keep in mind in our era, where social media, including blogs, Twitter, and company websites, sometimes replace formal venues as the main medium for conveying scientific results. </p>



<p>My own view is that truth in science is not settled as much by debates as by momentum.  Whether the scientific consensus is X is not determined by some committee of experts, but rather by scientists, and especially students, “voting with their feet”. It is not so much a result of a debate between two distinguished scientists, but a result of a new generation of students abandoning what they think of as dead ends. (This is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_principle">Planck’s Principle</a>, sometimes grimly expressed as “science progresses one funeral at a time”.) For example,  in Computer Science, scores of papers and Ph.D. dissertations would be rendered meaningless if P=NP. This is stronger proof that the consensus is P≠NP than any poll of Turing laureates. </p>



<p>In that sense, science reminds me of the <em>blockchain</em> of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The blockchain is a history of transactions of the form “User A paid X amount to user B”. User B will only be able to use this amount if there is <em>consensus</em> on this history. The blockchain is decentralized, and so several “forks” of it can exist simultaneously, but if users work on a “dead-end fork” that will not end up as part of the consensus history then their work will be for nothing. This motivates users to ensure that they are on the “right side of history” and only work on extensions of the chains that they believe will be part of the future consensus. This also means that we have more assurance of the veracity of an entry in the blockchain the further back it is, since there has been more work done that is built on this entry.</p>



<p>Similarly, scientists can be said to mine natural and artificial reality for scientific credit (not credit in the crass CV-padding or citation-counting way, but in terms of impact on the long-term direction of the field). But they will not get any such credit if their assumptions are eventually invalidated. Hence scientists are incentivized to ensure that they are always on the “right side of history”. They don’t want to work on a “dead-end fork” that will never get “merged” into the future main scientific discourse. <strong>A corollary is that if the truth of a particular proposition P is irrelevant to the way people do science then science will never need to form a consensus on whether P  is true or false. </strong>For example, as long as the choice of interpretation of quantum mechanics remains irrelevant to actual papers, debates between the Many-Worlds, Bohm and other interpretations will continue to take place in “cheap talk” outside the formal literature (whether over beer, in blog comments, or the popular press) and science will not need to form a consensus on which interpretation is correct. In particular, I don’t think science will ever need to form a consensus on whether any view of the philosophy of science, including my own, is the true one.</p>

    <title>TR22-062 |  Superredundancy: A tool for Boolean formula minimization complexity analysis | 

	Paolo Liberatore</title>
    <summary>A superredundant clause is a clause that is redundant in the resolution closure of a formula. The converse concept of superirredundancy ensures membership of the clause in all minimal CNF formulae that are equivalent to the given one. This allows for building formulae where some clauses are fixed when minimizing size. An example are proofs of complexity hardness of the problems of minimal formula size. Others are proofs of size when forgetting variables or revising a formula. Most clauses can be made superirredundant by splitting them over a new variable.</summary>
