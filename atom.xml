    <title>TR20-161 |  Seed Protecting Extractors | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Dean Doron, 

	Shahar Samocha</title>
    <summary>We introduce a new type of seeded extractors we dub seed protecting extractors. Informally, a seeded extractor is seed protecting against a class of functions $C$, mappings seeds to seeds, if the seed $Y$ remains close to uniform even after observing the output $\mathrm{Ext}(X,A(Y))$ for every choice of $A \in C$ (or, more generally, observing the outputs corresponding to several adversaries from $C$).

The results of this paper are structural. We establish what we believe to be surprising relations, in fact, equivalences between seed protecting extractors and each of the well-studied strengthenings of seeded extractors: strong extractors, non-malleable extractors (against permutations), and two-source extractors, where each case is classified by a suitable class $C$. Our work put forth a novel approach for constructing nonmalleable extractors against permutations. Indeed, the existing machinery developed for constructing non-malleable extractors focuses on the output and so it is aimed towards breaking correlations. Instead, our work suggests developing techniques for protecting the seed.</summary>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The inherent difficulty of maintaining stateful environments over long periods of time gave rise to the paradigm of serverless computing, where mostly-stateless components are deployed on demand to handle computation tasks, and are teared down once their task is complete. Serverless architecture could offer the added benefit of improved resistance to targeted denial-of-service attacks. Realizing such protection,<br/>requires that the protocol only uses stateless parties. Perhaps the most famous example of this style of protocols is the Nakamoto consensus protocol used in Bitcoin. We refer to this stateless property as the You-Only-Speak-Once (YOSO) property, and initiate the formal study of it within a new YOSO model. Our model is centered around the notion of roles, which are stateless parties that can only send a single message. Furthermore, we describe several techniques for achieving YOSO MPC; both computational and information theoretic.</p>

a bounded convex polytopal domain and show that this class is equal to the
intersection of two well-known classes: PPAD and PLS. As our main underlying
technical contribution, we show that computing a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point
of a continuously differentiable function over the domain $[0,1]^2$ is PPAD
$\cap$ PLS-complete. This is the first natural problem to be shown complete for
this class. Our results also imply that the class CLS (Continuous Local Search)
- which was defined by Daskalakis and Papadimitriou as a more "natural"
counterpart to PPAD $\cap$ PLS and contains many interesting problems - is
itself equal to PPAD $\cap$ PLS.

    <title>On the Computability of Continuous Maximum Entropy Distributions: Adjoint Orbits of Lie Groups</title>

Vishnoi</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01851">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given a point $A$ in the convex hull of a given adjoint orbit
$\mathcal{O}(F)$ of a compact Lie group $G$, we give a polynomial time
algorithm to compute the probability density supported on $\mathcal{O}(F)$
whose expectation is $A$ and that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence to
the $G$-invariant measure on $\mathcal{O}(F)$. This significantly extends the
recent work of the authors (STOC 2020) who presented such a result for the
manifold of rank $k$-projections which is a specific adjoint orbit of the
unitary group $\mathrm{U}(n)$. Our result relies on the ellipsoid method-based
framework proposed in prior work; however, to apply it to the general setting
of compact Lie groups, we need tools from Lie theory. For instance, properties
of the adjoint representation are used to find the defining equalities of the
minimal affine space containing the convex hull of $\mathcal{O}(F)$, and to
establish a bound on the optimal dual solution. Also, the Harish-Chandra
integral formula is used to obtain an evaluation oracle for the dual objective
function. While the Harish-Chandra integral formula allows us to write certain
integrals over the adjoint orbit of a Lie group as a sum of a small number of
determinants, it is only defined for elements of a chosen Cartan subalgebra of
the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G.$ We show how it can be applied to our
setting with the help of Kostant's convexity theorem. Further, the convex hull
of an adjoint orbit is a type of orbitope, and the orbitopes studied in this
paper are known to be spectrahedral. Thus our main result can be viewed as
extending the maximum entropy framework to a class of spectrahedra.

One method to measure
this for a matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the \emph{numerical
sparsity}, denoted $\mathsf{ns}(A)$, defined as the minimum $k\geq 1$ such that
$\|a\|_1/\|a\|_2 \leq \sqrt{k}$ for every row and every column $a$ of $A$. This
measure of $a$ is smooth and is clearly only smaller than the number of
non-zeros in the row/column $a$. The seminal work of Achlioptas and McSherry
[2007] has put forward the question of approximating an input matrix $A$ by
entrywise sampling. More precisely, the goal is to quickly compute a sparse
matrix $\tilde{A}$ satisfying $\|A - \tilde{A}\|_2 \leq \epsilon \|A\|_2$
(i.e., additive spectral approximation) given an error parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$.
The known schemes sample and rescale a small fraction of entries from $A$. We
propose a scheme that sparsifies an almost-sparse matrix $A$ -- it produces a
matrix $\tilde{A}$ with $O(\epsilon^{-2}\mathsf{ns}(A) \cdot n\ln n)$ non-zero
entries with high probability. We also prove that this upper bound on
$\mathsf{nnz}(\tilde{A})$ is \emph{tight} up to logarithmic factors. Moreover,
our upper bound improves when the spectrum of $A$ decays quickly (roughly
replacing $n$ with the stable rank of $A$). Our scheme can be implemented in
time $O(\mathsf{nnz}(A))$ when $\|A\|_2$ is given. Previously, a similar upper
bound was obtained by Achlioptas et. al [2013] but only for a restricted class
of inputs that does not even include symmetric or covariance matrices. Finally,
we demonstrate two applications of these sampling techniques, to faster
approximate matrix multiplication, and to ridge regression by using sparse
preconditioners.

vertex set into $m$ sets. An independent set $S$ of $G$ is said to fairly
represent the partition if $|S \cap V_i| \geq \frac{1}{2} \cdot |V_i| -1$ for
all $i \in [m]$. It is known that for every cycle and every partition of its
vertex set, there exists an independent set that fairly represents the
partition (Aharoni et al., A Journey through Discrete Math., 2017). We prove
that the problem of finding such an independent set is $\mathsf{PPA}$-complete.
As an application, we show that the problem of finding a monochromatic edge in
a Schrijver graph, given a succinct representation of a coloring that uses
fewer colors than its chromatic number, is $\mathsf{PPA}$-complete as well. The
work is motivated by the computational aspects of the `cycle plus triangles'
problem and of its extensions.

    <title>Search Problems in Trees with Symmetries: near optimal traversal strategies for individualization-refinement algorithms</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1604448000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Anders:Markus.html">Markus Anders</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Schweitzer:Pascal.html">Pascal Schweitzer</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01726">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We define a search problem on trees that closely captures the backtracking
behavior of all current practical graph isomorphism algorithms. Given two trees
with colored leaves, the goal is to find two leaves of matching color, one in
each of the trees. The trees are subject to an invariance property which
promises that for every pair of leaves of equal color there must be a symmetry
(or an isomorphism) that maps one leaf to the other.
</p>
<p>We describe a randomized algorithm with errors for which the number of
visited leaves is quasilinear in the square root of the size of the smaller of
the two trees. For inputs of bounded degree, we develop a Las Vegas algorithm
with a similar running time.
</p>
<p>We prove that these results are optimal up to logarithmic factors. We show a
lower bound for randomized algorithms on inputs of bounded degree that is the
square root of the tree sizes. For inputs of unbounded degree, we show a linear
lower bound for Las Vegas algorithms. For deterministic algorithms we can prove
a linear bound even for inputs of bounded degree. This shows why randomized
algorithms outperform deterministic ones.
</p>
<p>Our results explain why the randomized "breadth-first with intermixed
experimental path" search strategy of the isomorphism tool Traces (Piperno
2008) is often superior to the depth-first search strategy of other tools such
as nauty (McKay 1977) or bliss (Junttila, Kaski 2007). However, our algorithm
also provides a new traversal strategy, which is theoretically near optimal
with better worst case behavior than traversal strategies that have previously
been used.

    <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Darcy Flow through Porous Media using Deep Gaussian Process</title>

Abolfathi <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01647">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A computational method based on the non-linear Gaussian process (GP), known
as deep Gaussian processes (deep GPs) for uncertainty quantification &amp;
propagation in modelling of flow through heterogeneous porous media is
presented. The method is also used for reducing dimensionality of model output
and consequently emulating highly complex relationship between hydrogeological
properties and reduced order fluid velocity field in a tractable manner. Deep
GPs are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations of GPs with multiple,
infinitely wide hidden layers that are very efficient models for deep learning
and modelling of high-dimensional complex systems by tackling the complexity
through several hidden layers connected with non-linear mappings. According to
this approach, the hydrogeological data is modelled as the output of a
multivariate GP whose inputs are governed by another GP such that each single
layer is either a standard GP or the Gaussian process latent variable model. A
variational approximation framework is used so that the posterior distribution
of the model outputs associated to given inputs can be analytically
approximated. In contrast to the other dimensionality reduction, methods that
do not provide any information about the dimensionality of each hidden layer,
the proposed method automatically selects the dimensionality of each hidden
layer and it can be used to propagate uncertainty obtained in each layer across
the hierarchy. Using this, dimensionality of the full input space consists of
both geometrical parameters of modelling domain and stochastic hydrogeological
parameters can be simultaneously reduced without the need for any
simplifications generally being assumed for stochastic modelling of subsurface
flow problems. It allows estimation of the flow statistics with greatly reduced
computational efforts compared to other stochastic approaches such as Monte
Carlo method.

highly efficient learnability estimation: for monotone target functions, the
error of the decision tree hypothesis constructed by these heuristics can be
estimated with polylogarithmically many labeled examples, exponentially smaller
than the number necessary to run these heuristics, and indeed, exponentially
smaller than information-theoretic minimum required to learn a good decision
tree. This adds to a small but growing list of fundamental learning algorithms
that have been shown to be amenable to learnability estimation.

<p>En route to this result, we design and analyze sample-efficient minibatch

achieve the same provable guarantees as the full-batch versions. We further
give "active local" versions of these heuristics: given a test point $x^\star$,
we show how the label $T(x^\star)$ of the decision tree hypothesis $T$ can be
computed with polylogarithmically many labeled examples, exponentially smaller
than the number necessary to learn $T$.

graphs, under the well-studied models of vertex and edge arrivals. In both
models, edges are associated with arbitrary weights that are unknown from the
outset, and are revealed online. Under vertex arrival, vertices arrive online
in a uniformly random order; upon the arrival of a vertex $v$, the weights of
edges from $v$ to all previously arriving vertices are revealed, and the
algorithm decides which of these edges, if any, to include in the matching.
Under edge arrival, edges arrive online in a uniformly random order; upon the
arrival of an edge $e$, its weight is revealed, and the algorithm decides
whether to include it in the matching or not. We provide a $5/12$-competitive
algorithm for vertex arrival, and show it is tight. For edge arrival, we
provide a $1/4$-competitive algorithm. Both results improve upon state of the
art bounds for the corresponding settings. Interestingly, for vertex arrival,
secretary matching in general graphs outperforms secretary matching in
bipartite graphs with 1-sided arrival, where $1/e$ is the best possible
guarantee.

design sequential cache-efficient algorithms in a cache-oblivious fashion.
Ballard et al. pointed out that it is a fundamental open problem to extend the
technique to an arbitrary architecture. Ballard et al. raised another open
question on how to parallelize Strassen's algorithm exactly and efficiently on
an arbitrary number of processors.
</p>
<p>We propose a novel way of partitioning a cache-oblivious algorithm to achieve
perfect strong scaling on an arbitrary number, even a prime number, of
processors within a certain range in a shared-memory setting. Our approach is
Processor-Aware but Cache-Oblivious (PACO). We demonstrate our approach on
several important cache-oblivious algorithms, including LCS, 1D, GAP, classic
rectangular matrix multiplication on a semiring, and Strassen's algorithm. We
discuss how to extend our approach to a distributed-memory architecture, or
even a heterogeneous computing system. Hence, our work may provide a new
perspective on the fundamental open problem of extending the recursive
cache-oblivious technique to an arbitrary architecture. We provide an almost
exact solution to the open problem on parallelizing Strassen. Our approach may
provide a new perspective on extending the recursive cache-oblivious technique
to an arbitrary architecture. All our algorithms demonstrate better scalability
or better overall parallel cache complexities than the best known algorithms.
Preliminary experiments justify our theoretical prediction that the PACO
algorithms can outperform significantly state-of-the-art Processor-Oblivious
(PO) and Processor-Aware (PA) counterparts.

    <title>Robust Algorithms for Online Convex Problems via Primal-Dual</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1604448000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Molinaro:Marco.html">Marco Molinaro</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01435">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Primal-dual methods in online optimization give several of the state-of-the
art results in both of the most common models: adversarial and
stochastic/random order. Here we try to provide a more unified analysis of
primal-dual algorithms to better understand the mechanisms behind this
important method. With this we are able of recover and extend in one goal
several results of the literature.
</p>
<p>In particular, we obtain robust online algorithm for fairly general online
convex problems: we consider the MIXED model where in some of the time steps
the data is stochastic and in the others the data is adversarial. Both the
quantity and location of the adversarial time steps are unknown to the
algorithm. The guarantees of our algorithms interpolate between the (close to)
best guarantees for each of the pure models. In particular, the presence of
adversarial times does not degrade the guarantee relative to the stochastic
part of the instance.
</p>
<p>Concretely, we first consider Online Convex Programming: at each time a
feasible set $V_t$ is revealed, and the algorithm needs to select $v_t \in V_t$
to minimize the total cost $\psi(\sum_t v_t)$, for a convex function $\psi$.
Our robust primal-dual algorithm for this problem on the MIXED model recovers
and extends, for example, a result of Gupta et al. and recent work on
$\ell_p$-norm load balancing by the author. We also consider the problem of
Welfare Maximization with Convex Production Costs: at each time a customer
presents a value $c_t$ and resource consumption vector $a_t$, and the goal is
to fractionally select customers to maximize the profit $\sum_t c_t x_t -
\psi(\sum_t a_t x_t)$. Our robust primal-dual algorithm on the MIXED model
recovers and extends the result of Azar et al.
</p>
<p>Given the ubiquity of primal-dual algorithms we hope the ideas presented here
will be useful in obtaining other robust algorithm in the MIXED or related
models.

main focus will be on Babai's quasi-polynomial time isomorphism test and
subsequent developments that led to the design of isomorphism algorithms with a
quasi-polynomial parameterized running time of the from $n^{\polylog k}$, where
$k$ is a graph parameter such as the maximum degree. A second focus will be the
combinatorial Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I am teaching deep learing this week in Harvard’s CS 182 (Artificial Intelligence) course. As I’m preparing the back-propagation lecture, Preetum Nakkiran told me about <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd">Andrej Karpathy’s awesome micrograd package</a> which implements automatic differentiation for scalar variables in very few lines of code.</p>



<p>I couldn’t resist using this to show how simple back-propagation and stochastic gradient descents are. To make sure we leave nothing “under the hood” we will not import anything from the package but rather only copy paste the few things we need. I hope that the text below is generally accessible to anyone familiar with partial derivatives. See this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eLEIMxlGZfAIYPWZMcBCPDLeVJzBMdYf?usp=sharing">colab notebook</a> for all the code in this tutorial. In particular, aside from libraries for plotting and copy pasting a few dozen lines from Karpathy this code uses absolutely no libraries (no numpy, no pytorch, etc..) and can train (slowly..) neural networks using stochastic gradient descent.  (This <a href="https://deepnote.com/publish/f898cdd4-4815-42ad-ba57-ae0b8b733492">notebook</a> builds the code more incrementally.)</p>



<p><strong>Automatic differentiation</strong> is a mechanism that allows you to write a Python functions such as</p>


<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">def f(x,y): return (x+y)+x**3
</pre>


<p>and enables one to automatically obtain the partial derivatives <img alt="\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial \text{x}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+f%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Ctext%7Bx%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial \text{x}}"/> and <img alt="\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial \text{y}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+f%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Ctext%7By%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial \text{y}}"/>. Numerically we could do this by choosing some small value <img alt="\delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\delta"/> and computing both <img alt="\tfrac{f(x+\delta,y)-f(x,y)}{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bf%28x%2B%5Cdelta%2Cy%29-f%28x%2Cy%29%7D%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{f(x+\delta,y)-f(x,y)}{\delta}"/> and <img alt="\tfrac{f(x,y+\delta)-f(x,y)}{\delta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bf%28x%2Cy%2B%5Cdelta%29-f%28x%2Cy%29%7D%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{f(x,y+\delta)-f(x,y)}{\delta}"/>.<br/>However, if we generalize this approach to <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> variables, we get an algorithm that requires roughly <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> evaluations of <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/>. <em>Back-propagation</em> enables computing <em>all</em> of the partial derivatives at only constant overhead over the cost of a single evaluation of <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/>.</p>



<h2>Back propagation and the chain rule</h2>



<p>Back-propagation is a direct implication of the <strong>multi-variate chain rule</strong>. Let’s illustrate this for the case of two variables. Suppose that <img alt="v,w: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v,w: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}"/> and <img alt="z:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="z:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}"/> are functions, and define</p>



<p><img alt="f(u) = z(v(u),w(u))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28u%29+%3D+z%28v%28u%29%2Cw%28u%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f(u) = z(v(u),w(u))"/>.</p>



<p>That is, we have the following situation:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/KGVphzL.png"/></figure>



<p>where <img alt="f(u)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28u%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f(u)"/> is the value <img alt="z=z(v(u),w(u))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Dz%28v%28u%29%2Cw%28u%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="z=z(v(u),w(u))"/></p>



<p>Then the <strong>chain rule</strong> states that</p>



<p><img alt="\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial u} = ( \tfrac{\partial v}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v} + \tfrac{\partial w}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w} )" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+f%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D+%3D+%28+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D+%2B+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D+%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial u} = ( \tfrac{\partial v}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v} + \tfrac{\partial w}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w} )"/></p>



<p>You can take this on faith, but it also has a simple proof. To see the intuition, note that for small <img alt="\delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\delta"/>, <img alt="v(u+\delta) \approx v(u) + \delta \tfrac{\partial v}{\partial u}(u)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%28u%2B%5Cdelta%29+%5Capprox+v%28u%29+%2B+%5Cdelta+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D%28u%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v(u+\delta) \approx v(u) + \delta \tfrac{\partial v}{\partial u}(u)"/> and <img alt="w(u+\delta) \approx w(u) + \delta \tfrac{\partial w}{\partial u}(u)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%28u%2B%5Cdelta%29+%5Capprox+w%28u%29+%2B+%5Cdelta+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D%28u%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w(u+\delta) \approx w(u) + \delta \tfrac{\partial w}{\partial u}(u)"/>. For small <img alt="\delta_1,\delta_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_1%2C%5Cdelta_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\delta_1,\delta_2"/>, <img alt="z(v+\delta_1,w+\delta_2) \approx z(v,w) + \delta_1 \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v}(z,w) + \delta_2 \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%28v%2B%5Cdelta_1%2Cw%2B%5Cdelta_2%29+%5Capprox+z%28v%2Cw%29+%2B+%5Cdelta_1+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%28z%2Cw%29+%2B+%5Cdelta_2+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="z(v+\delta_1,w+\delta_2) \approx z(v,w) + \delta_1 \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v}(z,w) + \delta_2 \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w}"/>. Hence, if we ignore terms with powers of delta two or higher,</p>



<p><img alt="f(u +\delta)= z(w(u+\delta),v(u+\delta)) \approx f(u) + \delta \tfrac{\partial v}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v} + \delta \tfrac{\partial w}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28u+%2B%5Cdelta%29%3D+z%28w%28u%2B%5Cdelta%29%2Cv%28u%2B%5Cdelta%29%29+%5Capprox+f%28u%29+%2B+%5Cdelta+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D+%2B+%5Cdelta+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f(u +\delta)= z(w(u+\delta),v(u+\delta)) \approx f(u) + \delta \tfrac{\partial v}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v} + \delta \tfrac{\partial w}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w}"/></p>



<p/>



<p>The chain rule generalizes naturally to the case that <img alt="z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="z"/> is a function of more variables than <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/>. Generally, if the value <img alt="f(u)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28u%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f(u)"/> is obtained by first computing some intermediate values <img alt="v_1,\ldots,v_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cv_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v_1,\ldots,v_k"/> from <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> and then computing <img alt="z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="z"/> in some arbitrary way from <img alt="v_1,\ldots,v_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cv_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v_1,\ldots,v_k"/>, then <img alt="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial u} \sum_{i=1}^k \tfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Ek+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+v_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial u} \sum_{i=1}^k \tfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v_i}"/>.</p>



<p>As a corollary, if you already managed to compute the values <img alt="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v_1},\ldots, \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+v_1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+v_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v_1},\ldots, \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial v_k}"/>, and you kept track of the way that <img alt="v_1,\ldots,v_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cv_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v_1,\ldots,v_k"/> were obtained from <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/>, then you can compute <img alt="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial u}"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/35jj2wz.png"/></figure>



<p>This suggests a simple recursive algorithm by which you compute the derivative of the final value <img alt="z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="z"/> with respect to an intermediate value <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w"/> in the computation using recursive calls to compute the values <img alt="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+w%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w'}"/> for all the values <img alt="w'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w'"/> that were directly computed from <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w"/>. Back propagation is this algorithm.</p>

<h2>Implementing automatic differentiation using back propagation in Python</h2>



<p>We now describe how to do this in Python, following Karpathy’s code. The basic class we use is <code>Value</code>. Every member <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> of <code>Value</code> is a container that holds:</p>



<ol><li>The actual scalar (i.e., floating point) value that <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> holds. We call this <code>data</code>.</li><li>The gradient of <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> with respect to some future unknown value <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/> that will use it. We call this <code>grad</code> and it is initialized to zero.</li><li>Pointers to all the values that were used in the computation of <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/>. We call this <code>_prev</code></li><li>The method that adds (using the current value of <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> and other values) the contribution of <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> to the gradient of all its previous values <img alt="v" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v"/> to their gradients. We call this function <code>_backward</code>. Specifically, at the time we call <code>_backward</code> we assume that <code>u.grad</code> already contains <img alt="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial u}"/> where <img alt="z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="z"/> is the final value we are interested in. For every value <img alt="v" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v"/> that was used to compute <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/>, we add to <code>v.grad</code> the quantity <img alt="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial u}{\partial v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+u%7D%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tfrac{\partial z}{\partial u} \cdot \tfrac{\partial u}{\partial v}"/>. For the latter quantity we need to keep track of <em>how</em> <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> was computed from <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b"/>.</li><li>If we call the method <code>backwards</code> (without an underscore) on a variable <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> then this will compute the derivative of <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> with respect to <img alt="v" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v"/> for all values <img alt="v" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v"/> that were used in the computation of <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/>. We do this by applying <code>_backward</code> to <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> and then recursively (just like in DFS) going over the “children” (values used to compute <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/>), calling <code>_backward</code> on each one and keeping track the ones we visited just like the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.</li></ol>



<p>Let’s now describe this in code. We start off with a simple version that only supports addition and multiplication. The constructor for the class is the following:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">class Value:
    """ stores a single scalar value and its gradient """

    def __init__(self, data, _children=()):
        self.data = data
        self.grad = 0
        self._backward = lambda: None
        self._prev = set(_children)
</pre>


<p>which fairly directly matches the description above. This constructor creates a value not using prior ones, which is why the <code>_backward</code> function is empty.<br/>However, we can also create values by adding or multiplying prior ones, by adding the following methods:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">  def __add__(self, other):
        other = other if isinstance(other, Value) else Value(other)
        out = Value(self.data + other.data, (self, other))

        def _backward():
            self.grad += out.grad
            other.grad += out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out

    def __mul__(self, other):
        other = other if isinstance(other, Value) else Value(other)
        out = Value(self.data * other.data, (self, other))

        def _backward():
            self.grad += other.data * out.grad
            other.grad += self.data * out.grad
        out._backward = _backward

        return out
</pre>


<p>That is, if we create <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w"/> by adding the values <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> and <img alt="v" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v"/>, then the <code>_backward</code> function of <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w"/> works by adding <code>w.grad</code> <img alt="= \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="= \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w}"/> to both <code>u.grad</code> and <code>v.grad</code>.<br/>If we <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w"/> is obtain by multiplying <img alt="u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="u"/> and <img alt="v" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v"/> then we add <code>w.grad</code> <img alt="\cdot" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccdot&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\cdot"/> <code>v.data</code> <img alt="= \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w} v" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D+v&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="= \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w} v"/> to <code>u.grad</code> and similarly add <code>w.grad</code> <img alt="\cdot" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccdot&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\cdot"/> <code>u.data</code> <img alt="= \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w} u" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D+u&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="= \tfrac{\partial z}{\partial w} u"/> to <code>v.grad</code>.</p>



<p>The <code>backward</code> function is obtained by setting the gradient of the current value to <img alt="1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="1"/> and then running <code>_backwards</code> on all other values in reverse topological order:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">def backward(self, visited= None): # slightly shorter code to fit in the blog 
    if visited is None:
        visited= set([self])
        self.grad = 1
    self._backward()
    for child in self._prev:
        if not child in visited:
            visited.add(child)
            child.backward(visited)
</pre>


<p>For example, if we run the following code</p>


<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">a = Value(5)
print(a.grad)
def f(x): return (x+2)**2 + x**3
f(a).backward()
print(a.grad)
</pre>


<p>then the values printed will be <code>0</code> and <code>89</code> since the derivative of <img alt="(x+2)^2 + x^3 = x^3 + x^2 + 4x + 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2B2%29%5E2+%2B+x%5E3+%3D+x%5E3+%2B+x%5E2+%2B+4x+%2B+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(x+2)^2 + x^3 = x^3 + x^2 + 4x + 4"/> equals <img alt="3x^2 + 2x +42" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3x%5E2+%2B+2x+%2B42&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="3x^2 + 2x +42"/>.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eLEIMxlGZfAIYPWZMcBCPDLeVJzBMdYf?usp=sharing#scrollTo=0_nveKyfxXQK">notebook</a> you can see that we implement also the power function, and have some “convenience methods” (division etc..).</p>



<h3>Linear regression using back propagation and stochastic gradient descent</h3>



<p>In <em>stochastic gradient descent</em> we are given some data <img alt="(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_1%2Cy_1%29%2C%5Cldots%2C%28x_n%2Cy_n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)"/> and want to find an hypothesis <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="h"/> that minimizes the empirical loss <img alt="L(h) = \tfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n L(h(x_i),y_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%28h%29+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+L%28h%28x_i%29%2Cy_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L(h) = \tfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n L(h(x_i),y_i)"/> where <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L"/> is a <em>loss function</em> mapping two labels <img alt="y, y'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C+y%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="y, y'"/> to a real number. If we let <img alt="L_i(h)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_i%28h%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L_i(h)"/> be the <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="i"/>-th term of this sum, then, identifying <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="h"/> with the parameters (i.e., real numbers) that specify it, stochastic gradient descent is the following algorithm:</p>



<ol><li>Set <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="h"/> to be a random vector.

This is exactly the vector we can obtain using back propagation.</p>



<p>For example, if we want a linear model, we can use <img alt="(a,b)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(a,b)"/> as our parameters and the function will be <img alt="x \mapsto a\cdot + b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cmapsto+a%5Ccdot+%2B+b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="x \mapsto a\cdot + b"/>. We can generate random points <code>X</code>,<code>Y</code> as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/4Do0KI4.png"/></figure>



<p>Now we can define a linear model as follows:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">class Linear:
  def __init__(self):
    self.a,self.b = Value(random.random()),Value(random.random())
  def __call__(self,x): return self.a*x+self.b

  def zero_grad(self):
    self.a.grad, self.b.grad = 0,0
</pre>


<p>And train it directly by using SGD:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">η = 0.03, epochs = 20
for t in range(epochs):
  for x,y in zip(X,Y):
    model.zero_grad()
    loss = (model(x)-y)**2
    loss.backward()
    model.a , model.b = (model.a - η*model.a.grad  , model.b - η*model.b.grad)
</pre>


<p>Which as you can see works very well:</p>

<h2>From linear classifiers to Neural Networks.</h2>



<p>The above was somewhat of an “overkill” for linear models, but the beautify of automatic differentiation is that we can easily use more complex computation.</p>



<p>We can follow <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/blob/master/demo.ipynb">Karpathy’s demo</a> and us the same approach to train a neural network.</p>



<p>We will use a neural network that takes two inputs and has two hidden layers of width 16. A neuron that takes input <img alt="x_1,\ldots,x_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cx_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="x_1,\ldots,x_k"/> will apply the ReLU function (<img alt="max{0,x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=max%7B0%2Cx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="max{0,x}"/>) to <img alt="\sum w_i x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum+w_i+x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\sum w_i x_i"/> where <img alt="w_1,\ldots,w_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cw_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="w_1,\ldots,w_k"/> are its <em>weight</em> parameters. (It’s easy to add support for relu for our <code>Value</code> class. Also we won’t have a bias term in this example.)</p>



<p>The code for this Neural Network is as follows: (when <code>Value() </code>is called without a parameter the value is random number in <img alt="[-1,1]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B-1%2C1%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="[-1,1]"/>)</p>


<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">def Neuron(weights,inputs, relu =True):
  # Evaluate neuron with given weights on given inputs
  v =  sum(weights[i]*x for i,x in enumerate(inputs))
  return v.relu() if relu else v


class Net:
  # Depth 3 fully connected neural net with one two inputs and output
  def __init__(self,  N=16):
    self.layer_1 = [[Value(),Value()] for i in range(N)]
    self.layer_2 = [ [Value() for j in range(N)] for i in range(N)]
    self.output =  [ Value() for i in range(N)]
    self.parameters = [v for L in [self.layer_1,self.layer_2,[self.output]] for w in L for v in w]


  def __call__(self,x):
    layer_1_vals = [Neuron(w,x) for w in self.layer_1]
    layer_2_vals = [Neuron(w,layer_1_vals) for w in self.layer_2]
    return Neuron(self.output,layer_2_vals,relu=False) 
    # the last output does not have the ReLU on top

  def zero_grad(self):
    for p in self.parameters:
      p.grad=0
</pre>


<p>We can train it in the same way as above.<br/>We will follow Karpathy and train it to classify the following points:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/cXv93KU.png"/></figure>



<p>The training code is very similar, with the following differences:</p>



<ul><li>Instead of the square loss, we use the function <img alt="L(y,y')= \max{ 1- y\cdot y', 0 }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%28y%2Cy%27%29%3D+%5Cmax%7B+1-+y%5Ccdot+y%27%2C+0+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L(y,y')= \max{ 1- y\cdot y', 0 }"/> which is <img alt="0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="0"/> if <img alt="y \cdot y' \geq 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%5Ccdot+y%27+%5Cgeq+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="y \cdot y' \geq 1"/>. This makes sense since our data labels will be <img alt="\pm 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\pm 1"/> and we say we classify correctly if we get the same sign. We get zero loss if we classify correctly all samples with a margin of at least <img alt="1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="1"/>.</li><li>Instead of stochastic gradient descent we will do standard gradient descent, using all the datapoints before taking a gradient step. The optimal for neural networks is actually often something in the middle – <em>batch gradient descent</em> where we take a batch of samples and perform the gradient over them.</li></ul>



<p>The resulting code is the following:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">for t in range(epochs):
  loss = sum([(1+ -y*model(x)).relu() for (x,y) in zip(X,Y)])/len(X)
  model.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  for p in model.parameters:
    p.data -= η*p.grad
</pre>


<p>If we use this, we get a decent approximation for this training set (see image below). As Karpathy shows, by adjusting the learning rate and using regularization, one can in fact get 100% accuracy.</p>

Kurt Gödel famously found solutions to Albert Einstein’s equations of general relativity that allow trajectories to loop through time. </p>
<p>
Today, early on Election Day and a usual time for our posts on Gödel, I talk about the trajectory of counting votes after tomorrow’s polls close and time-warp effects that everyone watching the returns will see.</p>
<p>
I am picking up the vein of ethical algorithms in yesterday’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/02/the-night-of-the-ethical-algorithm/">post</a>, but with a different take about ethical modeling in novel situations where reliable training data is unavailable. I believe there is a responsibility for running simulations not just of tomorrow’s <em>election</em>, such as FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">conducts</a>, but also of tomorrow’s <em>count</em> as it may unfold hour by hour and stretch over many following days. </p>
<p>
Gödel also famously believed he had found a logical flaw in the U.S. Constitution that allowed a mechanism for legally instituting a dictatorship, but his argument was never reported. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/12/06/judging-a-book-by-its-coverage/">discussed</a> this at length in 2013, including noting a 2012 <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2010183">paper</a> by Enrique Guerra-Pujol of the University of Central Florida College of Business, who is a frequent reader of this blog. Guerra-Pujol offers a detailed construction of a mechanism based on self-reference applied to the short <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution/article-v.html">Article V</a> on amending the Constitution. This topic has been <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/is-there-a-logical-inconsistency-in-the-constitution.html">addressed</a> <a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/2020/01/pack-the-union-a-proposal-to-admit-new-states-for-the-purpose-of-amending-the-constitution-to-ensure-equal-representation/">several</a> <a href="https://theconversation.com/kurt-godel-from-loopholes-and-dictators-to-the-incompleteness-theorems-72376">times</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/473613-a-contradiction-at-the-heart-of-the-american-system">since</a>, but what stands out to us is a 2019 <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2632/MIREL-19_paper_1.pdf">paper</a> by Valeria Zahoransky and Christoph Benzmüller. This paper attempts to find a proof of Guerra-Pujol’s mechanism by automated logical inference using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_(proof_assistant)">Isabelle</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOL_(proof_assistant)">HOL</a> proof assistant. They found a model that satisfies the argument. </p>
<p/><h2> Election Evolution Over Time </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/unskewing-the-election/">post</a> on Election Day 2016 contrasted the relatively stable time evolution of polls in 2012 with the gyrations of 2016. That post began by defending Nate Silver of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> and his 30% likelihood for Donald Trump against those who had Hillary Clinton over 90%. At the time of our 2012 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-election-outcome/">post</a> on Barack Obama versus Mitt Romney, I had thought Silver’s error bars were too wide, but in 2016 they looked right on the basis of last-minute decision making by impulse that my chess model also registers.</p>
<p>
This year, the polls have been even steadier than in 2012, and undecided voters are found to be scarce. Of course, the pandemic has been the greatest factor in the poll numbers, but my first point is that election forecasting uses only the numbers as primary. The algorithms do not have an input that could take values Covid 19, Covid 23, Covid 17… In a normal election, the polling numbers would seem to point to an easier call than in 2012. Silver has, however, expressed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/im-here-to-remind-you-that-trump-can-still-win/">caution</a> in explaining why his odds stay just short of 90% for Joe Biden as I write at midnight. My first point of further disquiet begins with a simple fact:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The models have been trained on data from past elections. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
A major difference on our flight path to Election Day is the upsurge in early voting and turnout overall. Texas reports that it has already registered more early votes than total votes cast in 2016. We are not saying this difference has been overlooked—of course, models are being adjusted for it every hour. What we are doubting is the existence of a basis for making those adjustments with high confidence. Before we discuss the major issue of the flight path <em>after</em> the polls close, let me insert an analogy from my current chess work.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> My Own Ethical Interpolation </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My statistical chess model is trained on millions of moves from games at the hours-long pace of standard in-person chess. The pandemic has led to chess moving online where fast time controls are the norm. For instance, the hallowed US Championships were just held in a format of three games per day at a pace of 25 minutes for the whole game plus 5 seconds for each move played, which equates to G/30 (game in 30 minutes) under a simplification used also <a href="http://universalrating.com/about-us.php">here</a>. The Online Olympiad held in August by the International Chess Federation (FIDE) gave only 15 minutes plus 5 seconds per move, equating to G/20. I have been asked for input on games at paces all the way down to 1-minute “Bullet” chess. </p>
<p>
My solid estimates of how less time affects skill come from the annual FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Championships, which are contested at equivalents of G/25 and G/5, respectively, by hundreds of elite male and female players. For time controls in-between I face twin problems of scant data from in-person chess—basically none for player below master level—and online chess having evident contamination from cheating, as I discussed in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/07/the-doomsday-argument-in-chess/">post</a> last June. Hence I <em>interpolate</em> to determine model settings for other time controls. </p>
<p>
This <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/chess/RatingTimeCurves.jpg">diagram</a> shows internal evidence supporting the orange curve obtained via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken's_delta-squared_process">Aitken extrapolation</a>, in that inverse polynomial curves based on other reasoning converge to it. The curve has been supported by recent field tests, including a restricted invitational tournament recently run by Chess.com at G/3 and a large junior league in Britain at G/15 equivalent. Still, the <em>ethical</em> status is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The pandemic has injected me into online fast chess ahead of the year-long timeframe that would be needed to clean the available large data and rebuild my model directly for all the gamut of different time controls. <p/>
</li><li>
So it is ethical for me to give my best estimates, as supported by field tests and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/15/predicting-chess-and-horses/">cross-checks</a> in my model, but with caveat of their being “an extrapolation of an interpolation.” <p/>
</li><li>
But in principle there are more-reliable ways to do the modeling.
</li></ol>
<p>
My second point is that this year’s election models are in similar boats: The pandemic forces their cantilevered use in new situations. As with chess the data needed for direct training may not be available. As we’ve said in the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/02/the-night-of-the-ethical-algorithm/">post</a>, this year’s election <em>task</em> may be “Ethics-Hard.” Now we come to my third and main point about responsibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Night of Waves and Blue/Red Shifts </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The new dimension of time is the order in which all the following categories of votes will be counted, in the states that variously allow them:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Early votes cast in-person, such as my wife and I did on the first possible <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/government-and-politics/nearly-15-000-turn-out-on-first-day-of-early-voting-in-erie-county/article_f35cc7f0-153b-11eb-bbd6-43fce059203c.html">day</a> in New York. <p/>
</li><li>
Early votes sent by mail. <p/>
</li><li>
In-person votes on Election Day. <p/>
</li><li>
Regular votes by mail in states that vote that way. <p/>
</li><li>
Absentee ballots, which are the only non-Tuesday option in some states.
</li></ol>
<p>
This is approximately the order in which votes will be counted, again with state-by-state differences, which especially may lead to votes in category 2 being counted later. The issue is that the Democratic and Republican shares are expected to vary greatly across the categories, enough to cause large shifts in the perceived leader over real time. </p>
<p>
Geoffrey Skelley of FiveThirtyEight has an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-pennsylvanias-vote-count-could-change-after-election-night/">article</a> showing how a 5-point win for Biden in Pennsylvania might still present as a <b>16-point</b> lead for President Trump on Election Night, when all in-person votes are counted but only some of the votes by mail. Here are the article’s key graphics, the left one showing actual proportions from Pennsylvania’s June primary.</p>

<p>
Other states that allow early tallying of early votes may show an initial Biden lead before a red-shift toward Trump on Election Night, with more of Biden’s vote share remaining to be counted. Still others are less clear. FiveThirtyEight on Saturday posted a useful state-by-state <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-results-timing/">guide</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Why Important to Model the Count? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Awareness of the time-shifts is important not only for perception but also for the timing of legal challenges that are expected to arise. For instance, there is a continued specter of <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/01/texas-drive-thru-votes-harris-county/">invalidating</a> 127,000 early votes already cast by a novel drive-up system in Harris County Texas; despite its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/02/us/trump-vs-biden/a-federal-judge-denies-a-bid-to-throw-out-more-than-127000-votes-in-texas-the-republicans-who-sued-have-already-appealed">rejection</a> by a district judge today, it has been appealed higher. There is expectation of legal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/us/politics/election-day-ballot-counting.html">battles</a> nationwide over procedures that have been altered by measures to cope with the pandemic.</p>
<p>
Public perception, however, is the most immediate concern. President Trump <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that's by our laws">stated</a> in a flagged Tweet that we “must have final total on November 3rd” and followed up by saying, “…instead of counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate, and I don’t believe that’s by our laws.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a formal <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20a66_new_m6io.pdf#page=6">opinion</a> that states “want to avoid the chaos and suspicions of impropriety that can ensue if thousands of absentee ballots flow in after Election Day and potentially flip the results of an election.” Note his phrase “flip the results”—a sure sign that perception is reality.</p>
<p>
Of course many outlets besides FiveThirtyEight are aware of the new election-reporting physics and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/27/upshot/election-results-timing.html">have</a> <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/10/30/what-to-watch-for-on-election-night-2020/">published</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/26/timing-election-results/">their</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-we-know-who-is-elected-president-on-election-night-a-guide-to-possible-delays-11596629410">own</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/politics/red-blue-mirage-election-results/index.html">guides</a>. They are adjusting their election-night projection models accordingly. Our main question goes further in terms of responsibility:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Has anyone been running simulations of how Election Night vote-counting may unfold? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We believe such simulations are just as important as the ones they have run of a timeless election. Showing them is not only important to inform the many who will be watching, it would be a vaccine against pressure that exploits unexpected perception. </p>
<p>
Yet it must be acknowledged that there is neither hard data nor sure knowledge of county-level vote-tallying policies and schedules on which to train such simulations. Nor may there be as many cross-checks as my chess interpolation situation. </p>
<p>
This may be another “Ethics-Hard” problem. But it is one already involved in adjusting the projection models that definitely are being deployed. Aside from the many novel and vital modeling problems from the pandemic, it may be the most important one of our near future. And we are thinking of this less than 48 hours—now less than 24 hours—before the first polls close.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
How do you think Election Night results will unfold, apart from your estimate of the time-independent “ground truth” of the electorate’s intentions?</p>

<p>Lily, my 7-year-old, asked me to share the above on my blog.  She says it depicts the US Army luring Trump out of the White House with a hamburger, in order to lock the front door once he’s out—what she proposes should happen if Trump refuses to acknowledge a loss.</p>



<p>If you haven’t yet voted, especially if you live in a contested state, <strong>please do so tomorrow</strong>.  Best wishes to us all!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Nov. 3):</span></strong> Even if it comes 4-5 years late, <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/224-key-trumps-appeal/">this 8-minute podcast by Sam Harris</a> gives perhaps the sharpest solution ever articulated to the mystery of how tens of millions of Americans could enthusiastically support an obvious fraud, liar, incompetent, and threat to civilization.  Briefly, it’s not <em>despite</em> his immense failings but <em>because of</em> them—because by flaunting his failings he absolves his supporters for their own, even while the other side serves those same supporters relentless moral condemnation and scorn.  I <em>think</em> I had known this—I even said something similar as the tagline of this blog (“The Far Right is destroying the world, and the Far Left thinks it’s my fault!”).  But Sam Harris expresses it as only he can.  If this analysis is right—and I feel virtually certain it is—then it bodes well that Biden, unlike Hillary Clinton, isn’t seen as especially sanctimonious or judgmental.  Biden’s own gaffes and failings probably help him.</p></div>

    <title>Constant width from involutes of pseudotriangles</title>
    <summary>In his online collection of fun stuff, Jeff Edmonds recently posted a method of constructing curves of constant width by spinning a pencil on a flat surface, with a varying axis, and tracking the movement of its ends. It is pretty similar to the classical method of crossed lines described by Martin Gardner in The Unexpected Hanging, in which one constructs an arrangement of lines in the plane, sorts them in circular order by slope, and builds a curve out of circular arcs centered at the crossing points of consecutive lines in this sorted order. However, it grows the curve at both ends simultaneously, rather than only at one end, and chooses the lines dynamically rather than in advance. Regardless, the result is the same: a piecewise-circular constant-width curve.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In his <a href="https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~jeff/courses/fun/">online collection of fun stuff</a>, Jeff Edmonds recently posted <a href="https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~jeff/courses/fun/Equal_Distance.docx">a method of constructing curves of constant width</a> by spinning a pencil on a flat surface, with a varying axis, and tracking the movement of its ends. It is pretty similar to the classical method of crossed lines described by Martin Gardner in <em>The Unexpected Hanging</em>, in which one constructs an arrangement of lines in the plane, sorts them in circular order by slope, and builds a curve out of circular arcs centered at the crossing points of consecutive lines in this sorted order. However, it grows the curve at both ends simultaneously, rather than only at one end, and chooses the lines dynamically rather than in advance. Regardless, the result is the same: a piecewise-circular constant-width curve.</p>

<p>This got me wondering how we might go about constructing curves of constant width that are not piecewise-circular. Instead of a finite set of lines, we could use a continuous family of lines, one of each slope, but that’s a little difficult to visualize. Instead, there’s a simpler method that works more like Jeff’s spinning pencil, which Robinson (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1112/blms/16.3.264">“Smooth curves of constant width and transnormality”, <em>Bull. LMS</em> 1984</a>) attributes to Euler (<a href="https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/euler-works/513/">“De curvis triangularibus”, 1778</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Draw a closed curve in the plane that has only one tangent line of each slope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rotate a “long enough” tangent line segment of some fixed length around this curve without sliding it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trace the paths of the endpoints of the line segment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first step may already seem a little confusing. Don’t curves usually have at least two tangent lines of each slope, their support lines from opposite sides? Well, yes, for convex curves. But for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudotriangle">pseudotriangle</a>, a curve whose boundary is concave everywhere except at three extreme points, there might only be one tangent line of each slope. A standard example of such a curve is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_curve">deltoid</a>, and the following animation stolen from the <a href="https://mathcurve.com/courbes2d.gb/deltoid/deltoid.shtml">mathcurve.com page on deltoids</a> shows a tangent line segment (black) rotating around a deltoid (blue) and tracing out a curve of constant width (red).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Animation of a tangent line segment rolling around a deltoid, with its endpoints tracing out a curve of constant width, from https://mathcurve.com/courbes2d.gb/deltoid/deltoid.shtml" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/involute-deltoid.gif"/></p>

<p>The traced curve is always perpendicular to the rotating line segment, so locally at least this segment behaves like the width of the curve in each given direction. And since we don’t change the length of the segment while it rotates, the width stays constant. The same deltoid, the same curve of constant width, and two positions of its tangent line segment can also be seen in the illustration below from a 1954 mathematics paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2307215">“Rotors within rotors” by Michael Goldberg in the <em>Amer. Math. Monthly</em></a>. I’ve overlaid a red Reuleaux triangle to show that, like <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/08/30/linkage.html">so</a> <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/07/05/shape-wankel-rotor.html">many</a> <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/06/30/linkage.html">other</a> <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/06/24/la-maddalena-non-reuleaux.html">curvy</a> <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/04/17/mythical-reuleaux-manhole.html">triangles</a>, this is not a Reuleaux triangle, even though it has constant width. Although its corners are drawn to look kind of pointy, they should actually be smooth, and the rest of the curve bulges farther out from its sides than a Reuleaux triangle would.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="The involute of deltoid, as depicted by Goldberg in &quot;Rotors within rotors&quot;, with an overlaid Reuleaux triangle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/rotors-within-rotors.png"/></p>

<p>More formally, this process of rotating and tracing tangent line segments produces a curve called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute">involute</a> of the deltoid. An involute of a curve is more typically described as what you get when you fix one end of a length of string at a point on the curve, wrap it tightly around the curve, and then unwrap it while keeping it taut, tracing a curve with the other end of the string as you do. The two ends of the rotating tangent line segment can both be thought of as being formed in the same way from two strings, with one of them unwrapping the deltoid from one direction while the other wraps it back up in the other direction. In the deltoid example the segment was the same length as the sides of the deltoid, which were all equal, but it also works with unequal sides or longer segments, as long as the rotating segment is long enough to reach all three cusps.</p>

<p>You might worry whether the segment always comes back to its starting position after each rotation, and this does require a little care in the initial choice of length and placement of the line segment. If the length of the rotating segment and eventual width of the traced curve are \(w\), the pseudotriangle sides have lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), and the segment starts with \(x\) units of extra length extending past the cusp prior to side \(a\) in its rotation, then it will have \(w-a-x\) units of extra length at the next cusp, \(w-b-(w-a-x)=x+a-b\) units at the third cusp, and \(w-c-(x+a-b)=w-x-a+b-c\) units at the last cusp. To make a curve of constant width we need the amount of extra length at the start and end to be equal, which happens when we set this length to be \(x=(w-a+b-c)/2\).</p>

<p>If the pseudotriangle that the tangent segment rotates around includes a line segment, there will be a discontinuity in its rotating movement as the axis of rotation shifts from one end of the segment to the other, much like the changes of axis described by Edmonds, but the same process still works.  If the pseudotriangle has a point where its slope changes discontinuously (for instance, if it is a polygon rather than a smooth curve), then the rotating segment will rotate around this point, with its ends tracing circular arcs, as it continuously moves between the same slopes; this can happen either at the three convex points of the pseudotriangle or along the concave curves between them. In particular, if your pseudotriangle is actually an equilateral triangle and the rotating segment has the same length as its sides, you get a Reuleaux triangle.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to form closed curves with only one tangent line of each slope that are not pseudotriangles. An example is the standard pentagram (whose involute is the Reuleaux pentagon), or a cuspy and irregular pentagram like the one below (whose involute is another curve of constant width without circular arcs). The same process works for these, with a slightly more complicated calculation of how to place a rotating segment of a given length for a given starting curve, involving alternating sums of side lengths.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A curved five-point star with one tangent line in each direction" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/cuspy-star.svg"/></p>

<p>What happens when the rotating line segment is too short, so that it doesn’t reach one or more of the cusps? I’m not sure in general, but for the deltoid the result can be the same deltoid (for which the rotating line segment is one possibility for Goldberg’s “rotor within a rotor”, although the rotor he describes is larger) or another similar but smaller deltoid inside it. See the mathcurve link for details.</p>

    <title>TR20-160 |  Non-adaptive vs Adaptive Queries in the Dense Graph Testing Model | 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Avi Wigderson</title>
    <summary>We study the relation between the query complexity of adaptive and non-adaptive testers in the dense graph model. 
It has been known for a couple of decades that the query complexity of non-adaptive testers is at most quadratic in the query complexity of adaptive testers. 
We show that this general result is essentially tight; that is, there exist graph properties for which any non-adaptive tester must have query complexity that is almost quadratic in the query complexity of the best general (i.e., adaptive) tester. 

More generally, for every $q:\N\to\N$ such that $q(n)\leq{\sqrt n}$ and constant $c\in[1,2]$, we show a graph property that is testable in $\Theta(q(n))$ queries, but its non-adaptive query complexity is $\Theta(q(n)^c)$, omitting $\poly(\log n)$ factors and ignoring the effect of the proximity parameter $\epsilon$. Furthermore, the upper bounds hold for one-sided error testers,
and are at most quadratic in $1/\epsilon$. 

These results are obtained through the use of general reductions that transport properties of ordered structured (like bit strings) to those of unordered structures (like unlabeled graphs). 
The main features of these reductions are query-efficiency and preservation of distance to the properties.
This method was initiated in our prior work ({\em ECCC}, TR20-149), and we significantly extend it here.</summary>

    <title>TR20-159 |  Relating existing powerful proof systems for QBF | 

	Leroy Chew</title>
    <summary>We advance the theory of QBF proof systems by showing the first simulation of the universal checking format QRAT by a theory-friendly system. We show that the sequent system G fully p-simulates QRAT, including the Extended Universal Reduction (EUR) rule which was recently used to show QRAT does not have strategy extraction. Because EUR heavily uses resolution paths our technique also brings resolution path dependency and sequent systems closer together. 
	While we do not recommend G for practical applications this work can potentially show what features are needed for a new QBF checking format stronger than QRAT.</summary>

<p>
Today we will talk about making algorithms ethical.</p>
<p>
Tuesday is the 2020 US national election for President, for Congress, and for state and local offices. Every four years we have a national election, and we cannot imagine a better motivation for making sure that algorithms are ethical. </p>
<p>
The word “algorithm” appears 157 times in their book. Two words used hand-in-hand with it are “data” (132 times) and “model” (103 times), both spread through all of the book’s 232 pages. Models of electorates, trained on data from past elections, inform the algorithms used by news agencies to make election-night projections. These carry more responsibilities than election-eve forecasts. There have been infamous mistakes, most notably the premature calls of Florida both ways in the 2000 election. </p>
<p>
We believe that Tuesday’s election in our novel pandemic situation requires attention to ethics from first principles. We will discuss why this is important. What it means to be ethical here? And how one can make an algorithm ethical? </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Issue </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Algorithms have been around forever. Euclid devised his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">gcd</a> algorithm in 300 BCE. In the first half of the last century, the central issue was how to define that an algorithm is <b>effective</b>. This led to showing that some problems are <em>uncomputable</em>, so that algorithms for them are impossible.</p>
<p>
In the second half, the emphasis shifted to whether algorithms are <b>efficient</b>. This led to classifying problems as <em>feasible</em> or (contingently) <em>hard</em>. Although many algorithms for feasible problems have been improved in ways that redouble the effect of faster and cheaper hardware, the study of complexity classes such as <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> has given reasons why algorithms for hard problems may never be improvable.</p>
<p>
The new territory, that of Kearns and Roth, is whether algorithms are <b>ethical</b>. Current ones that they and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction">others</a> have critqued as unethical accompany models for the likes of mortgages, small-business loans, parole decisions, and college admissions. The training data for these models often bakes in past biases. Besides problems of racial and gender bias and concerns of societal values, the raw fact is that past biases cause the models to miss the mark for today’s applications. For algorithms with such direct application to society, ethical design is critical. </p>
<p>
But this requirement is further reaching that one might initially imagine, so that as with computability and complexity, the factors can be ingrained in the <em>problems</em>. </p>
<p>
Consider a simple problem: We given a collection of pairs of numbers <img alt="{(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{(x,y)}"/>. We are to predict whether this number pair has the property </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x + y \ge 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%2B+y+%5Cge+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x + y \ge 0. "/></p>
<p>This is pretty easy if we can use both <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{y}"/>. But imagine a world where <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/> is allowed to be viewed but <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{y}"/> is secret. Perhaps the law requires that we cannot use <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{y}"/>—it is illegal. Now we might do as poorly as <img alt="{50\%}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B50%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{50\%}"/>. Suppose that the data consists of </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (1,-1), (1,1), (2,-2), (2,2) \dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%281%2C-1%29%2C+%281%2C1%29%2C+%282%2C-2%29%2C+%282%2C2%29+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  (1,-1), (1,1), (2,-2), (2,2) \dots "/></p>
<p>Then seeing only <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/> gives no advantage, while giving both is perfect. Thus what in these simplified terms counts as an ethical algorithm is a poor predictor, whereas an unethical one is perfect. </p>
<p>
The blurb for the Kearns-Roth book says that they “…explain how we can better embed human principles into machine code—without halting the advance of data-driven scientific exploration.” While we agree their approach is vital, we suspect that as with complexity there will be indelibly ethically hard tasks. We wonder whether election modeling has already become one of them. </p>
<p>
Ken and I have two separate takes on this. We will do the first and then the other in a second post.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Red/Blue Leakage, Bias, and Ethics </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One question on everyone’s minds is whether we will see a repeat of the forecasting misses from 2016. Let us remind that our own Election Day 2016 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/unskewing-the-election/">post</a> started by defending Nate Silver of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> for giving Donald Trump as much as a 30% chance to defeat Hillary Clinton. He had been attacked by representatives of many news and opinion agencies whose models had Clinton well over 90%. </p>
<p>
We wonder whether these models were affected by the kind of biases highlighted in the book by Kearns and Roth. We must say right away that we are neither alleging conscious biases nor questioning the desire for prediction accuracy. One issue in ethical modeling (for parole, loans, admissions) is the divergence between algorithm outcomes that are most <em>predictive</em> versus those that are best for society. Here we agree that accurate prediction—and accurate projections as results come in after the polls close—is paramount. However, the algorithms used for the latter projections (which were not at fault in 2016 but have been wrong previously) may be even more subject to what we as computer scientists with crypto background see as a “leakage” issue.</p>
<p>
Here is the point. Ideally, models using polling data and algorithms reading the Election Night returns should read the numbers as if they did not have ‘R’ and ‘D’ attached to them. Their own workings should be invariant under transformations that interchange Joe Biden and Donald Trump, or whoever are opposed in a local race. However, a crucial element in the projection models in particular is knowledge of voting geography. They must use data on the general voting preferences of regions where much of the vote is still extant. Thus they cannot avoid intimate knowledge of who is ‘R’ and who is ‘D.’ There is no double-blind or zero-knowledge approach to the subjects being projected.</p>
<p>
There is also the question of error bars. A main point of our 2016 post (and of Silver’s analysis) was the high uncertainty factor that could be read from how the Clinton-Trump race unfolded. Underestimating uncertainty causes overconfidence in models. This can result from “groupthink” of the kind we perceive in newsrooms of many of the same outlets that are doing the projections. The algorithms ought to be isolated from opinions of those in the organization, but again there is reason from the last election to wonder about leakage.</p>
<p>
Unlike cases addressed by Kearns and Roth, we do not see a solution to suggest. As in our simple <img alt="{x+y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x+y}"/> example, prior knowledge of the data in full may be needed for prediction. This may just be an “Ethics-Hard” problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
The word “election” does <i>not</i> appear in Kearns and Roth’s book.  What further application of their standpoint to elections would you make?</p>
<p>Ken sees a larger question of ethical modeling decisions given the unprecedented circumstances of the current election.  This comes not from spatial geography distorted by the pandemic but rather from the dimension of time injected by massive early voting and late counting of many mailed ballots.  He will address this next.</p></font></font></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A global pandemic, apocalyptic fires, and the possible descent of the US into violent anarchy three days from now can do strange things to the soul.</p>



<p>Bertrand Russell—and if he’d done nothing else in his long life, I’d love him forever for it—once wrote that “in adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide, from which, however, I was restrained by the desire to know more mathematics.”  This summer, unable to bear the bleakness of 2020, I obsessively read up on the celebrated proof of the unsolvability of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">Continuum Hypothesis</a> (CH) from the standard foundation of mathematics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms</a> of set theory.  (In this post, I’ll typically refer to “ZFC,” which means Zermelo-Fraenkel plus the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom of Choice</a>.)</p>



<p>For those tuning in from home, the Continuum Hypothesis was formulated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>, shortly after his epochal discovery that there are different orders of infinity: so for example, the infinity of real numbers (denoted C for continuum, or \( 2^{\aleph_0} \)) is strictly greater than the infinity of integers (denoted ℵ<sub>0</sub>, or “Aleph-zero”).  CH is simply the statement that there’s no infinity <em>intermediate</em> between ℵ<sub>0</sub> and C: that anything greater than the first is at least the second.  Cantor tried in vain for decades to prove or disprove CH; the quest is believed to have contributed to his mental breakdown.  When David Hilbert presented his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems">famous list</a> of 23 unsolved math problems in 1900, CH was at the very top.</p>



<p>Halfway between Hilbert’s speech and today, the question of CH was finally “answered,” with the solution earning the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal">Fields Medal</a> that’s ever been awarded for work in set theory and logic.  But unlike with any previous yes-or-no question in the history of mathematics, the answer was that there provably <em>is</em> no answer from the accepted axioms of set theory!  You can either have intermediate infinities or not; neither possibility can create a contradiction.  And if you <em>do</em> have intermediate infinities, it’s up to you how many: 1, 5, 17, ∞, etc.</p>



<p>The easier half, the consistency of CH with set theory, was proved by incompleteness dude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a> in 1940; the harder half, the consistency of not(CH), by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cohen">Paul Cohen</a> in 1963.  Cohen’s work introduced the method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)">forcing</a>, which was so fruitful in proving set-theoretic questions unsolvable that it quickly took over the whole subject of set theory.  Learning Gödel and Cohen’s proofs had been a dream of mine since teenagerhood, but one I constantly put off.</p>



<p>This time around I started with <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.rmjm/1181070010">Cohen’s retrospective essay</a>, as well as Timothy Chow’s <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/sci.math.research/c/pQdPHJYML0E/m/ZrvqIxpd1sIJ?pli=1">Forcing for Dummies</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1320">A Beginner’s Guide to Forcing</a>.  I worked through Cohen’s own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Continuum-Hypothesis-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486469212">Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis</a>, and Ken Kunen’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Independence-Studies-Foundations-Mathematics/dp/0444868399">Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs</a>, and <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/scott67.pdf">Dana Scott’s 1967 paper</a> reformulating Cohen’s proof.  I emailed questions to Timothy Chow, who was ridiculously generous with his time.  When Tim and I couldn’t answer something, we tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Solovay">Bob Solovay</a> (one of the world’s great set theorists, who later worked in computational complexity and quantum computing), or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Blass">Andreas Blass</a> or <a href="http://karagila.org/">Asaf Karagila</a>.  At some point mathematician and friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kuperberg">Greg Kuperberg</a> joined my quest for understanding.  I thank all of them, but needless to say take sole responsibility for all the errors that surely remain in these posts.</p>



<p>On the one hand, the proof of the independence of CH would seem to stand with general relativity, the wheel, and the chocolate bar as a triumph of the human intellect.  It represents a culmination of Cantor’s quest to know the basic rules of infinity—all the more amazing if the answer turns out to be that, in some sense, we <em>can’t</em> know them.</p>



<p>On the other hand, perhaps no other scientific discovery of equally broad interest remains so sparsely popularized, not even (say) quantum field theory or the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem.  I found barely any attempts to explain how forcing works to non-set-theorists, let alone to non-mathematicians.  One notable exception was Timothy Chow’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1320">Beginner’s Guide to Forcing</a>, mentioned earlier—but Chow himself, near the beginning of his essay, calls forcing an “open exposition problem,” and admits that he hasn’t solved it.  My modest goal, in this post and the following ones, is to make a further advance on the exposition problem.</p>



<p>OK, but why a doofus computer scientist like me?  Why not, y’know, an actual expert?  I won’t put forward my ignorance as a qualification, although I <em>have</em> often found that the better I learn a topic, the more completely I forget what initially confused me, and so the less able I become to explain things to beginners.</p>



<p>Still, there is <em>one</em> thing I know well that turns out to be intimately related to Cohen’s forcing method, and that made me feel like I had a small “in” for this subject.  This is the construction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine">oracles</a> in computational complexity theory.  In CS, we like to construct hypothetical universes where P=NP or P≠NP, or P≠BQP, or the polynomial hierarchy is infinite, etc.  To do so, we, by fiat, insert a new function—an <em>oracle</em>—into the universe of computational problems, carefully chosen to make the desired statement hold.  Often the oracle needs to satisfy an infinite list of conditions, so we handle them one by one, taking care that when we satisfy a new condition we don’t invalidate the previous conditions.</p>



<p>All this, I kept reading, is <em>profoundly</em> analogous to what the set theorists do when they create a mathematical universe where the Axiom of Choice is true but CH is false, or vice versa, or any of a thousand more exotic possibilities.  They insert new sets into their models of set theory, sets that are carefully constructed to “force” infinite lists of conditions to hold.  In fact, some of the exact same people—such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Solovay">Solovay</a>—who helped pioneer forcing in the 1960s, later went on to pioneer oracles in computational complexity.  We’ll say more about this connection in a future post.</p>



<p><strong>How Could It Be?</strong></p>



<p>How do you study a well-defined math problem, and return the answer that, as far as the accepted axioms of math can say, there <em>is</em> no answer?  I mean: even supposing it’s <em>true</em> that there’s no answer, how do you <em>prove</em> such a thing?</p>



<p>Arguably, not even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem</a> achieved such a feat.  Recall, the Incompleteness Theorem says loosely that, for every formal system F that could possibly serve as a useful foundation for mathematics, there exist statements even of elementary arithmetic that are true but unprovable in F—and Con(F), a statement that encodes F’s own consistency, is an example of one.  But the very statement that Con(F) is unprovable is equivalent to Con(F)’s being <em>true</em> (since an inconsistent system could prove anything, including Con(F)).  In other words, if the Incompleteness Theorem as applied to F holds any interest, then that’s only because F <em>is, in fact</em>,<em> consistent</em>; it’s just that resources beyond F are needed to prove this.</p>



<p>Yes, there’s a “self-hating theory,” F+Not(Con(F)), which believes in its own inconsistency.  And yes, by Gödel, this self-hating theory is <em>consistent</em> if F itself is.  This means that it has a <strong>model</strong>—involving “nonstandard integers,” formal artifacts that effectively promise a proof of F’s inconsistency without ever actually delivering it.  We’ll have much, <em>much</em> more to say about models later on, but for now, they’re just collections of objects, along with relationships between the objects, that satisfy all the axioms of a theory (thus, a model of the axioms of group theory is simply … any group!).</p>



<p>In any case, though, the self-hating theory F+Not(Con(F)) can’t be <em>arithmetically sound</em>: I mean, just look at it!  It’s either unsound because F is consistent, or else it’s unsound because F is inconsistent.  In general, this is one of the most fundamental points in logic: <strong>consistency does not imply soundness</strong>.  If I believe that the moon is made of cheese, that might be <em>consistent</em> with all my other beliefs about the moon (for example, that Neil Armstrong ate delicious chunks of it), but that doesn’t mean my belief is <em>true</em>.  Like the classic conspiracy theorist, who thinks that any apparent evidence against their hypothesis was planted by George Soros or the CIA, I might simply believe a self-consistent collection of absurdities.  Consistency is purely a syntactic condition—it just means that I can never prove both a statement and its opposite—but soundness goes further, asserting that whatever I can prove is actually the case, a <em>relationship</em> between what’s inside my head and what’s outside it.</p>



<p>So again, assuming we had any business using F in the first place, the Incompleteness Theorem gives us two <em>consistent</em> ways to extend F (by adding Con(F) or by adding Not(Con(F))), but only one <em>sound</em> way (by adding Con(F)).  But the independence of CH from the ZFC axioms of set theory is of a fundamentally different kind.  It will give us models of ZFC+CH, and models of ZFC+Not(CH), that are <em>both</em> at least somewhat plausible as “sketches of mathematical reality”—and that both even have defenders.  The question of which is right, or whether it’s possible to decide at all, will be punted to the future: to the discovery (or not) of some intuitively compelling foundation for mathematics that, as Gödel hoped, answers the question by going beyond ZFC.</p>



<p><strong>Four Levels to Unpack</strong></p>



<p>While experts might consider this too obvious to spell out, Gödel’s and Cohen’s analyses of CH aren’t so much about infinity, as they are about our ability to <em>reason </em>about infinity using finite sequences of symbols.  The game is about building self-contained mathematical universes to order—universes where all the accepted axioms about infinite sets hold true, and yet that, in some cases, seem to mock what those axioms were supposed to <em>mean</em>, by containing vastly fewer objects than the mathematical universe was “meant” to have.</p>



<p>In understanding these proofs, the central hurdle, I think, is that there are at least four different “levels of description” that need to be kept in mind simultaneously.</p>



<p>At the first level, Gödel’s and Cohen’s proofs, like all mathematical proofs, are finite sequences of symbols.  Not only that, they’re proofs that can be formalized in elementary arithmetic (!).  In other words, even though they’re <em>about</em> the axioms of set theory, they don’t themselves <em>require</em> those axioms.  Again, this is possible because, at the end of the day, Gödel’s and Cohen’s proofs won’t be talking about infinite sets, but “only” about finite sequences of symbols that make statements about infinite sets.</p>



<p>At the second level, the proofs are making an “unbounded” but perfectly clear claim.  They’re claiming that, if someone showed you a proof of either CH or Not(CH), from the ZFC axioms of set theory, then no matter how long the proof or what its details, you could convert it into a proof that <em>ZFC itself</em> was inconsistent.  In symbols, they’re proving the “relative consistency statements”</p>



<p>Con(ZFC) ⇒ Con(ZFC+CH),<br/>Con(ZFC) ⇒ Con(ZFC+Not(CH)),</p>



<p>and they’re proving these as theorems of <em>elementary arithmetic</em>.  (Note that there’s no hope of proving Con(ZF+CH) or Con(ZFC+Not(CH)) <em>outright</em> within ZFC, since by Gödel, ZFC can’t even prove its own consistency.)</p>



<p>This translation is completely explicit; the independence proofs even yield <em>algorithms</em> to convert proofs of inconsistencies in ZFC+CH or ZFC+Not(CH), supposing that they existed, into proofs of inconsistencies in ZFC itself.</p>



<p>Having said that, as Cohen himself often pointed out, thinking about the independence proofs in terms of algorithms to manipulate sequences of symbols is hopeless: to have any chance of understanding these proofs, let alone coming up with them, at some point you need to think about what the symbols <em>refer</em> to.</p>



<p>This brings us to the third level: the symbols refer to <em>models of set theory</em>, which could also be called “mathematical universes.”  Crucially, we always can and often will take these models to be only <em>countably</em> infinite: that is, to contain an infinity of sets, but “merely” ℵ<sub>0</sub> of them, the infinity of integers or of finite strings, and no more.</p>



<p>The fourth level of description is from within the models themselves: each model imagines itself to have an <em>uncountable</em> infinity of sets.  As far as the model’s concerned, it comprises the entire mathematical universe, even though “looking in from outside,” we can see that that’s not true.  In particular, each model of ZFC <em>thinks</em> it has uncountably many sets, many themselves of uncountable cardinality, even if “from the outside” the model is countable.</p>



<p>Say what?  The models are <em>mistaken</em> about something as basic as their own size, about how many sets they have?  Yes.  The models will be like <em>The Matrix</em> (the movie, not the mathematical object), or <em>The Truman Show</em>.  They’re self-contained little universes whose inhabitants can never discover that they’re living a lie—that they’re missing sets that we, from the outside, know to exist.  The poor denizens of the Matrix will never even be able to learn that their universe—what<em> </em>they mistakenly think of as <em>the</em> universe—is secretly countable!  And no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_(The_Matrix)">Morpheus</a> will ever arrive to enlighten them, although—and this is crucial to Cohen’s proof in particular—the inhabitants will be able to reason more-or-less intelligibly about what would happen if a Morpheus <em>did</em> arrive.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem">Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem</a>, from the early 1920s, says that <em>any</em> countable list of first-order axioms that has any model at all (i.e., that’s consistent), must have a model with at most countably many elements.  And ZFC is a countable list of first-order axioms, so Löwenheim-Skolem applies to it—even though ZFC implies the existence of an uncountable infinity of sets!  Before taking the plunge, we’ll need to not merely grudgingly accept but love and internalize this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skolem%27s_paradox">“paradox,”</a> because pretty much the entire proof of the independence of CH is built on top of it.</p>



<p>Incidentally, once we realize that it’s possible to build self-consistent yet “fake” mathematical universes, we can ask the question that, incredibly, the <em>Matrix</em> movies never ask.  Namely, how do we know that our own, larger universe isn’t similarly a lie?  The answer is that we don’t!  As an example—I hope you’re sitting down for this—even though Cantor proved that there are uncountably many real numbers, that only means there are uncountably many reals <em>for us</em>.  We can’t rule out the possibly that God, looking down on our universe, would see countably many reals.</p>



<p><strong>Cantor’s Proof Revisited</strong></p>



<p>To back up: the whole story of CH starts, of course, with Cantor’s epochal discovery of the different orders of infinity, that for example, there are more subsets of positive integers (or equivalently real numbers, or equivalently infinite binary sequences) than there are positive integers.  The devout Cantor thought his discovery illuminated the nature of God; it’s never been entirely obvious to me that he was wrong.</p>



<p>Recall how Cantor’s proof works: we suppose by contradiction that we have an enumeration of all infinite binary sequences: for example,</p>



<p>s(0) = <strong>0</strong>0000000…<br/>s(1) = 0<strong>1</strong>010101…<br/>s(2) = 11<strong>0</strong>01010….<br/>s(3) = 100<strong>0</strong>0000….</p>



<p>We then produce a new infinite binary sequence that’s not on the list, by going down the diagonal and flipping each bit, which in the example above would produce 1011…</p>



<p>But look more carefully.  What Cantor really shows is only that, <em>within our mathematical universe</em>, there can’t be an enumeration of all the reals of our universe.  For if there were, we could use it to define a new real that was in the universe but not in the enumeration.  The proof doesn’t rule out the possibility that <em>God</em> could enumerate the reals of our universe!  It only shows that, if so, there would need to be additional, heavenly reals that were missing from even God’s enumeration (for example, the one produced by diagonalizing against <em>that</em> enumeration).</p>



<p>Which reals could possibly be “missing” from our universe?  Every real you can name—42, π, √e, even uncomputable reals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant">Chaitin’s Ω</a>—has to be there, right?  Yes, and there’s the rub: <em>every real you can name</em>.  Each name is a finite string of symbols, so whatever your naming system, you can only ever name countably many reals, leaving 100% of the reals nameless.</p>



<p>Or did you think of only the <em>rationals</em> or <em>algebraic numbers</em> as forming a countable dust of discrete points, with numbers like π and e filling in the solid “continuum” between them?  If so, then I hope you’re sitting down for this: <em>every real number you’ve ever heard of</em> belongs to the countable dust!  The entire concept of “the continuum” is only needed for reals that don’t have names and never will.</p>



<p><strong>From ℵ<sub>0</sub> Feet</strong></p>



<p>Gödel and Cohen’s achievement was to show that, without creating any contradictions in set theory, we can adjust size of this elusive “continuum,” put more reals into it or fewer.  How does one even start to begin to prove such a statement?</p>



<p>From a distance of ℵ<sub>0</sub> feet, Gödel proves the consistency of CH by building minimalist mathematical universes: one where “the only sets that exist, are the ones <em>required</em> to exist by the ZFC axioms.”  (These universes can, however, differ from each other in how “tall” they are: that is, in how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number">ordinals</a> they have, and hence how many sets overall.  More about that in a future post!)  Gödel proves that, <em>if</em> the axioms of set theory are consistent—that is, if they describe any universes at all—then they also describe these minimalist universes.  He then proves that, in any of these minimalist universes, from the standpoint of someone <em>within</em> that universe, there are exactly ℵ<sub>1</sub> real numbers, and hence CH holds.</p>



<p>At an equally stratospheric level, Cohen proves the consistency of not(CH) by building … well, <em>non</em>-minimalist mathematical universes!  A simple way is to start with Gödel’s minimalist universe—or rather, an even more minimalist universe than his, one that’s been cut down to have only countably many sets—and then to stick in a bunch of <em>new real numbers</em> that weren’t in that universe before.  We choose the new real numbers to ensure two things: first, we still have a model of ZFC, and second, that we make CH false.  The details of how to do that will, of course, concern us later.</p>



<p><strong>My Biggest Confusion</strong></p>



<p>In subsequent posts, I’ll say more about the character of the ZFC axioms and how one builds models of them to order.  Just as a teaser, though, to conclude this post I’d like to clear up a fundamental misconception I had about this subject, from roughly the age of 16 until a couple months ago.</p>



<p>I thought: the way Gödel proves the consistency of CH, must be by examining all the sets in his minimalist universe, and checking that each one has either at most ℵ<sub>0</sub> elements or else at least C of them.  Likewise, the way Cohen proves the consistency of not(CH), must be by “forcing in” some extra sets, which have more than ℵ<sub>0</sub> elements but fewer than C elements.</p>



<p>Except, it turns out that’s not how it works.  Firstly, to prove CH in his universe, Gödel is not going to check each set to make sure it doesn’t have intermediate cardinality; instead, he’s simply going to count all the reals to make sure that there are only ℵ<sub>1</sub> of them—where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number#Aleph-one">ℵ<sub>1</sub></a> is the next infinite cardinality after ℵ<sub>0</sub>.  This will imply that C=ℵ<sub>1</sub>, which is another way to state CH.</p>



<p>More importantly, to build a universe where CH is false, Cohen is going to start with a universe where C=ℵ<sub>1</sub>, like Gödel’s universe, and then <em>add in more reals:</em> say, ℵ<sub>2</sub> of them.  The ℵ<sub>1</sub> “original” reals will then supply our set of intermediate cardinality between the ℵ<sub>0</sub> integers and the ℵ<sub>2</sub> “new” reals.</p>



<p>Looking back, the core of my confusion was this.  I had thought: I can visualize what ℵ<sub>0</sub> means; that’s just the infinity of integers.  I can <em>also</em> visualize what \( C=2^{\aleph_0} \) means; that’s the infinity of points on a line.  Those, therefore, are the two bedrocks of clarity in this discussion.  By contrast, I <em>can’t</em> visualize a set of intermediate cardinality between ℵ<sub>0</sub> and C.  The intermediate infinity, being weird and ghostlike, is the one that shouldn’t exist unless we deliberately “force” it to.</p>



<p>Turns out I had things backwards.  For starters, I <em>can’t</em> visualize the uncountable infinity of real numbers.  I might <em>think</em> I’m visualizing the real line—it’s solid, it’s black, it’s got little points everywhere—but how can I be sure that I’m not merely visualizing the ℵ<sub>0</sub> rationals, or (say) the computable or definable reals, which include all the ones that arise in ordinary math?</p>



<p>The continuum C is <em>not at all</em> the bedrock of clarity that I’d thought it was.  Unlike its junior partner ℵ<sub>0</sub>, the continuum is adjustable, changeable—and we <em>will</em> change it when we build different models of ZFC.  What’s (relatively) more “fixed” in this game is something that I, like many non-experts, had always given short shrift to: Cantor’s sequence of Alephs ℵ<sub>0</sub>, ℵ<sub>1</sub>, ℵ<sub>2</sub>, etc.</p>



<p>Cantor, who was a very great man, didn’t merely discover that C&gt;ℵ<sub>0</sub>; he also discovered that the infinite cardinalities form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order">well-ordered</a> sequence, with no infinite descending chains.  Thus, after ℵ<sub>0</sub>,  there’s a next greater infinity that we call ℵ<sub>1</sub>; after ℵ<sub>1</sub> comes  ℵ<sub>2</sub>; after the entire infinite sequence ℵ<sub>0</sub>,ℵ<sub>1</sub>,ℵ<sub>2</sub>,ℵ<sub>3</sub>,… comes ℵ<sub>ω</sub>; after ℵ<sub>ω</sub> comes ℵ<sub>ω+1</sub>; and so on.  These infinities will always be there in any universe of set theory, and always in the same order.</p>



<p>Our job, as engineers of the mathematical universe, will include pegging the continuum C to one of the Alephs.  If we stick in a bare minimum of reals, we’ll get C=ℵ<sub>1</sub>, if we stick in more we can get C=ℵ<sub>2</sub> or C=ℵ<sub>3</sub>, etc.  We can’t make C equal to ℵ<sub>0</sub>—that’s Cantor’s Theorem—and we <em>also</em> can’t make C equal to ℵ<sub>ω</sub>, by an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nig%27s_theorem_(set_theory)">theorem of König</a> that we’ll discuss later (yes, this is an umlaut-heavy field).  But it will turn out that we can make C equal to just about any other Aleph: in particular, to any infinity other than ℵ<sub>0</sub> that’s not the supremum of a countable list of smaller infinities.</p>



<p>In some sense, this is the whole journey that we need to undertake in this subject: from seeing the cardinality of the continuum as a metaphysical mystery, which we might contemplate by staring really hard at a black line on white paper, to seeing the cardinality of the continuum <em>as an engineering problem</em>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned!  Next installment coming after the civilizational Singularity in three days, assuming there’s still power and Internet and food and so forth.</p>



<p>Oh, and happy Halloween.  Ghostly sets of intermediate cardinality … spoooooky!</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>With election on my mind, and constantly looking at polls and predictions, I thought I would look a little more into how election models are made. (<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not an expert statistician / pollster and this is based on me trying to read their methodological description as well as looking into results of simulations in Python. However, there is a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GaoBn71PwIk_uAisNWzp2Naqev9JHW0I?usp=sharing">colab notebook</a> so you can try this on your own!)</p>



<p>If polls were 100% accurate, then we would not need election models – we will know that the person polling at more than 50% in a given state will win, and we can just sum up the electoral votes. However, polls have various sources of errors:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Statistical sample error</strong> –  this is simply the deviation between the fraction of people that would say “I will vote for X” at time T in the population, and the empirical fraction reported by the poll based on their sample. As battleground states get polled frequently with large samples, this error is likely to be negligible.</li><li><strong>Sampling bias</strong> – this is the bias incurred by the fact that we cannot actually sample a random subset of the population and get them to answer our questions – the probability that people will pick up their phone may be correlated with their vote. Pollsters hope that these correlations all disappear once you condition on certain demographic variables (race, education, etc..) and so try to ensure the sample is balanced according to these metrics. I believe this was part of the reason that polls were off in 2016, since they didn’t explicitly adjust for levels of education (which were not strongly correlated with party before) and ended up under-representing white voters without college degrees.</li><li><strong>Lying responses or “shy” voters</strong> – Some people suggest that voters lie to pollsters because their choice is considered “socially undesirable”. There is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-supporters-arent-shy-but-polls-could-still-be-missing-some-of-them/">not much support</a> that this is a statistically significant effect. In particular <a href="https://morningconsult.com/form/shy-trump-2020/">one study</a> showed there was no statistically significant difference between responders’ responses in online and live calling. Also in  2016 polls equally under-estimated the votes for Trump and Republican senators (which presumably didn’t have the same “social stigma” to them).</li><li><strong>Turnout estimates</strong> – Estimating the probability that a person supporting candidate X will actually show up to vote (or mail it in) is a bit of a dark art, and account for the gap in polls representing registered voters (which make no such estimates) and polls representing likely voters (which do). Since traditionally the Republican electorate is older and more well off, they tend to vote more reliably and hence likely voter estimates are typically better for republicans. The effect seems not to be very strong this year. Turnout might be particularly hard to predict this year, though it seems likely to be historically high.</li><li><strong>Voters changing their mind</strong> –  The poll is done at a given point in time and does not necessarily reflect voters views in election day. For example in 2016 it seems that many undecided voters broke for Trump. In this cycle the effect might be less pronounced since there are few undecided voters and “election day” is smoothed over a 2-4 week period due to early and mail-in voting.</li></ol>



<p>To a first approximation, a poll-based election model does the following:<br/><br/>1. Aggregates polls into national and state-wise predictions </p>



<p>2. Computes a probability distribution over the correlated error vectors (i.e. the vector <img alt="\vec{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Be%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\vec{e}"/>  with coordinate for each jurisdiction containing the deviation from the prediction)</p>



<p>3. Samples from the probability distribution over vectors to obtain probabilities over outcomes.</p>



<p>From a skim of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/">538’s methodology</a> it seems that they do the following:</p>



<ol><li>Aggregate polls (weighing by quality, timeliness, adjusting for house effects, etc..). Earlier in the election cycle they also mix in “fundamentals” such as state of the economy etc.. though their weight decreases with time.</li><li>Estimate magnitude of national error (i.e., sample a value <img alt="E \in \mathbb{R}_+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D_%2B&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="E \in \mathbb{R}_+"/> according to some distribution that reflects the amount of national uncertainty.</li><li>(This is where I may be understanding wrong.) Sample a vector <img alt="\vec{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Be%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\vec{e}"/> whose entries sum up to <img alt="E" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="E"/> according to a correlated distribution, where the correlations between states depends on demographic, location, and other  factors. For each particular choice of $E$, because the sum is fixed, if a state has $E+X$ bias then on average the other states will need to compensate for this $-X$ bias, and hence this can create <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/24/reverse-engineering-the-problematic-tail-behavior-of-the-fivethirtyeight-presidential-election-forecast/">negative correlations</a> between states. (It is not clear that negative correlations are unreasonable – one could imagine policies that are deeply popular with population A and deeply unpopular with population B)</li></ol>



<p>From a skim of the <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president/how-this-works">Economist’s methodology</a> it seems that they do the following:</p>



<ol><li>They start again with some estimate on the national popular vote, based on polls and fundamentals, and then assume it is distributed according to some probability distribution to account for errors.</li><li>They then compute some prior on “partisan lean” (difference between state and national popular vote) for each state. If we knew the popular vote and partisan lean perfectly then we would know the result. Again like good Bayesians they assume that the lean is distributed according to some probability distribution.</li><li>They update the prior based on state polls and other information</li><li>They sample from an error distribution <img alt="\vec{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Be%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\vec{e}"/> according to some explicit pairwise correlation matrix that has only non-negative entries (and hence you don’t get negative correlations in their model).</li></ol>



<p>So, given all of the above, how much do these models differ? Perhaps surprisingy, the answer is “not by much”.  To understand how they differ, I plotted for both models the following: </p>



<ol><li>The histogram of Biden’s popular vote margin</li><li>The probability of Biden to win conditioned on a particular margin</li></ol>



<p>Much of the methodological difference, including the issue of pairwise correlations, should manifest in 2, but eyeballing it, they don’t seem to differ that much. It seems that conditioned on a particular margin, both models give Biden similar probability to win. (In particular both models think that 3% margin is about 50/50, while 4% margin gives Biden about 80/20 chance). The main difference is actually in the first part of estimating the popular vote margin – 538 is more “conservative” and has fatter tails.</p>

<p>If you want to check my data, see if I have a bug, or try your own analysis, you can use this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GaoBn71PwIk_uAisNWzp2Naqev9JHW0I?usp=sharing">colab notebook</a>.</p>



<h2>“Make your own needle”</h2>



<p>Another applications for such models is to help us adjust the priors as new information comes in. For example, it’s possible that Florida, North Carolina and Texas will report results early. If Biden loses one of these states, should we adjust our estimate of win probability significantly? It turns out that the answer depends on by how much he loses.</p>



<p>The following graphs show the updated win probability conditioned on a particular margin in a state. We see that winning or losing Florida, North Carolina, and Texas on their own doesn’t make much difference to the probability – it’s all about the margin. In contrast, losing Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes will make a significant difference to Biden’s chances.</p>

<p>(The non monotonicity is simply a side effect of having a finite number of simulation runs and would disappear in the limit.)</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In May 2016, after Donald Trump was elected as the republican nominee for president, I wrote the following blog post. I ended up not publishing it – this has always been a technical blog (and also more of a group blog, at the time).  While the damage of a Donald Trump presidency was hypothetical at the time, it is now very real and in a second term the stakes are only higher. I once again hope American readers of this blog would do what they can to support Joe Biden.<br/></p>



<p>Note: this is not an invitation for a debate on who to vote for in the comments. At this point, if you are educated and following the news (as I imagine all readers of this blog are) then if you are not already convinced that Donald Trump is a danger to this country and the world, nothing I will say will change your mind. Similarly, nothing you will say will change mine. Hence this is just a call for those readers who already support Joe Biden to make sure they vote and think of how they can help with their money or time in other ways.</p>



<h2>I’m with Her</h2>



<p><strong>Boaz Barak / May 3, 2016</strong><br/><br/>The republican electorate, in their infinite wisdom, have just (essentially) finalized the election of Donald Trump as their nominee for the position of the president of the United States.</p>



<p>While I have my political views, I don’t consider myself a very political person, and have not (as far as I remember) ever written about politics in this blog. However, extreme times call for extreme measures. It is tempting to be fatalist or cynical about this process, and believe that whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is elected doesn’t make much of a difference. Some people believe that the presidency shapes the person more than the other way around, and others feel that all politicians are anyway corrupt or that Hillary is not much better than trump since she voted for the Iraq war and gave paid speeches for Wall Street firms. I think the last two presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama demonstrated that the identity of the president makes a huge difference. All evidence points out that with Trump this difference will be entirely in the negative direction.</p>



<p>While his chances might not be great, this is not a bet I’m comfortable taking. I plan to support Hillary Clinton as much as I can, and hope that other American readers of this blog will do the same</p></div>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: I will present a new approach to randomized lower bounds, particularly in the setting where we wish to give a fine-grained analysis of randomized algorithms that achieve small bias. The approach is as follows: instead of considering ordinary randomized algorithms which give an output in <img alt="\{0,1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\{0,1\}"/> and may err, we switch models to look at “forecasting” randomized algorithms which output a confidence in <img alt="[0,1]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="[0,1]"/> for whether they think the answer is 1. When scored by a proper scoring rule, the performance of the best forecasting algorithm is closely related to the bias of the best (ordinary) randomized algorithm, but is more amenable to analysis. <br/>As an application, I’ll present a new minimax theorem for randomized algorithms, which can be viewed as a strengthening of Yao’s minimax theorem. Yao’s minimax theorem guarantees the existence of a hard distribution for a function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/> such that solving <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/> against this distribution (to a desired error level) is as hard as solving <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/> in the worst case (to that same error level). However, the hard distribution provided by Yao’s theorem depends on the chosen error level. Our minimax theorem removes this dependence, giving a distribution which certifies the hardness of <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/> against all bias levels at once. In recent work, we used this minimax theorem to give a tight composition theorem for randomized query complexity. <br/><br/>Based on joint work with Eric Blais.</p></div>

    <title>2020 Fall Jobs Post</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">My annual fall jobs posts, giving advice to PhDs looking for faculty positions, were getting repetitive. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/10/2019-fall-jobs-post.html">last year's post</a> for the usual stuff and feel free to post opportunities in the comments on this post. This year let's talk about what's changed.<div><br/></div><div>First something you might have missed--the latest <a href="https://cra.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2019-Taulbee-Survey.pdf">Taulbee Survey</a> shows a small drop in the number of new undergraduate CS majors in 2019 after years of massive growth. Is it a simple blip or have we hit the saturation point? We may never know because of the change you definitely didn't miss seeing.</div><div><br/></div><div>So let's talk about the effect of COVID. We're seeing a large drop in new international students who are having a hard time getting visas or just avoiding the US like the plague (literally). Not sure those numbers will fully come back given other alternatives and a changing international relationship particularly with China. Many undergrads have delayed college and some may never attend. </div><div><br/></div><div>On the other hand, COVID has accelerated digitizing the economy, from videoconferencing to in-home entertainment and games to remote access to work environments. The post-COVID economy could create even a larger demand for computer scientists. </div><div><br/></div><div>Many universities curtailed hiring last year worried and may do so in the spring given the uncertain budget situation due to the virus. Others continue to hire in computing, some to make up for last year. I just can't make a prediction for the upcoming year but I wouldn't rush to the job market if you have the option to wait. Last year the CRA reinstated the <a href="https://cifellows2020.org/">CIFellows</a>, postdocs to help those in a tight job market, and may do so again next year. The CRA will also repeat its <a href="https://cra.org/cras-cv-database-initiative-turns-two/">CV database</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>Late spring interviews in 2020 went virtual and will likely go virtual again in 2021. Nevertheless take the zoom meetings seriously. Make sure your interview talk is still a discussion--answer questions people give in the chat. Still do your research to have strong conversations with everyone you talk to, especially the non-theorists. And still dress nicely, at least from the waist up. Putting on a sports coat is not a bad idea. </div><div><div><br/></div><div>Though most places continue to focus on data science/ML, cybersecurity and to some degree quantum, Rutgers is <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/about/employment/details/tenure-track-assistant-professor-position-2">specifically looking</a> for a hire in computational complexity. Don't see that everyday. </div></div></div>
