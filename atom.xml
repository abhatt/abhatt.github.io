Registration is <em>not</em> required to attend the interactive talk, and the link will be posted on the website the day prior to the talk; however, by registering in the form, you will receive a reminder, along with the link.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: In this talk I’ll show how to revise the classical hardness-vs-randomness framework, so that it can work in a non-black-box fashion. Specifically, we will construct derandomization algorithms that don’t rely on classical PRGs, and instead “extract pseudorandomness” from the given input on which we want to simulate the probabilistic machine.</p>
<p>Using a non-black-box approach allows us to deduce stronger conclusions (or alternatively rely on weaker hypotheses), compared to classical approaches. In one instantiation of the new framework, we reveal a close connection between the promiseBPP = promiseP conjecture and a new type of uniform lower bounds. In another instantiation, we simulate probabilistic algorithms with essentially no observable runtime overhead, under plausible hypotheses.</p>
<p>Based on a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/080/">joint work</a> with <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~lijieche/">Lijie Chen</a>.</p></blockquote></div>

    <title>REU programs in general, and two at Univ of MD this summer.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>REU stands for Research Experience for Undergraduates. </p><p>REU programs are funded by the NSF. The NSF website of REU programs is <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp">here</a>. </p><p>Univ if MD at College Park dept of Comp Sci is running two REU programs this summer:</p><p>I (William Gasarch) am running  REU-CAAR (Combinatorics and AI Applied to Real problems) whose theme is applying theory to practice. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/">here</a>.</p><p> Jacquelyn Michaelis and Mihai Pop are running REU-BRIDGe (Bioinformatics Research In Data science for Genomics) which, as you can probably tell from the name, is in bio-comp. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cbcb.umd.edu/summer-internships">here</a>.</p><p>Most REU programs have the following: </p><p>1) There is an admissions period where many people apply (I had around 200 applicants last year) of which only about 10 get in. Some have money for a few extra students. This year both REU-CAAR and REU-BRIDGe have applications due March 22; however, in the past I have admitted students before then, so students who apply March 21 may be at a severe disadvantage. </p><p>2) Students apply from across the United states and these programs are competitive, so good to apply to several that you would definitely goto. Students ask me how many- I'll say 10 though temper that with only applying to those you REALLY would goto, and if there are MORE THAN 10 that look awesome, you could apply to more. </p><p>3) Students stay in the dorms (the last two years some programs cancelled, and some were virtual- mine was virtual) and get stipend of $6000, and a meal card. The program is 10 weeks.</p><p>4) Students work on projects in teams of 2-5. Some programs have the students pick what projects they would be happy to work on when they apply (mine does that) while others assign projects once students arrive (REU-BRIDGe will do that). The later makes sense if the program is very focused so the projects do not differ that much. </p><p>5) These programs are excellent for giving ugrads a chance to do research (NSF wants at least half of the students to come from non-research schools) and a sense of what grad school is like. So I recommend students thinking of grad school, or just want to do research, to apply to these programs. </p><p>6) Some students get papers out of the research. In these cases the research usually continues after the program is over. </p><p>7) It is healthy for a student to go to an REU program that is at a DIFFERENT school then where they are an ugrad for broadening. There may be mitigating circumstances where this is not possible. </p><p><br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Yesterday, Bocconi’s Rector signed the decree that created the new Computing Sciences department. This is only the ninth department to be created in our 120 year old university, and the first, I believe, in a couple of decades. It is the first department with an engineering and science mission (the other eight department are, in random order, Accounting, Marketing, Finance, Economics, Managements, Social Sciences, Law, and Decision Sciences).</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, we were joined by <a href="https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/team/francesca-buffa">Francesca Buffa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_M%C3%A9zard">Marc Mezard</a>. </p>



<p>Francesca, a computational biologist formerly at Oxford medical school, is now the fourth out of four computer science tenured faculty in our new department to have an active ERC grant.</p>



<p>Marc’s work has spanned theoretical physics, information theory and computation, including his collaboration with Giorgio Parisi’s Nobel Prize winning work, and he has been most recently the president of the Ecole National Superieure in Paris. When we asked for letters for his tenure case, one of the reviewers wrote, more or less in so many words, “you would be lucky to have Marc in your university, though it’s very unlikely that he will accept your offer”. At that point Marc had already accepted.</p>

    <title>TR22-032 |  Incompressiblity and Next-Block Pseudoentropy | 

	Noam Mazor, 

	Iftach Haitner, 

	Jad Silbak</title>
    <summary>A distribution is k-incompressible, Yao [FOCS ’82], if no efficient compression scheme compresses it to less than k bits. While being a natural measure, its relation to other computational analogs of entropy such as pseudoentropy, Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [SICOMP 99], and to other cryptographic hardness assumptions, was unclear.

We advance towards a better understating of this notion, showing that a k-incompressible distribution has (k?2) bits of next-block pseudoentropy, a refinement of pseudoentropy introduced by Haitner, Reingold, and Vadhan [SICOMP ’13]. We deduce that a samplable distribution X that is (H(X) + 2)-incompressible, implies the existence of one-way functions.</summary>

    <title>ONBRA: Rigorous Estimation of the Temporal Betweenness Centrality in Temporal Networks</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1646179200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Santoro:Diego.html">Diego Santoro</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sarpe:Ilie.html">Ilie Sarpe</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00653">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In network analysis, the betweenness centrality of a node informally captures
the fraction of shortest paths visiting that node. The computation of the
betweenness centrality measure is a fundamental task in the analysis of modern
networks, enabling the identification of the most central nodes in such
networks. Additionally to being massive, modern networks also contain
information about the time at which their events occur. Such networks are often
called temporal networks. The temporal information makes the study of the
betweenness centrality in temporal networks (i.e., temporal betweenness
centrality) much more challenging than in static networks (i.e., networks
without temporal information). Moreover, the exact computation of the temporal
betweenness centrality is often impractical on even moderately-sized networks,
given its extremely high computational cost. A natural approach to reduce such
computational cost is to obtain high-quality estimates of the exact values of
the temporal betweenness centrality. In this work we present ONBRA, the first
sampling-based approximation algorithm for estimating the temporal betweenness
centrality values of the nodes in a temporal network, providing rigorous
probabilistic guarantees on the quality of its output. ONBRA is able to compute
the estimates of the temporal betweenness centrality values under two different
optimality criteria for the shortest paths of the temporal network. In
addition, ONBRA outputs high-quality estimates with sharp theoretical
guarantees leveraging on the \emph{empirical Bernstein bound}, an advanced
concentration inequality. Finally, our experimental evaluation shows that ONBRA
significantly reduces the computational resources required by the exact
computation of the temporal betweenness centrality on several real world
networks, while reporting high-quality estimates with rigorous guarantees.

vertices onto a given set of n points inside a simple polygon. The goal of the
problem is that the cycle must be embedded without bends and does not intersect
itself and the polygon. This problem is a special case of the problem of
finding a (s, X, t) - path inside a simple polygon with the minimum number of
bends and intersections. The complexity of the problem is examined in this
paper is open, but it has been proved that similar problems are NP-complete. We
have presented a metaheuristic algorithm based on a genetic algorithm for
straight-line embedding of a cycle with the minimum numbers of intersections,
onto a given set of points inside the general simple polygons. The efficiency
of the proposed genetic algorithm is due to the definition of the mutation
operation, which removes it if there is an intersection between the embedded
edges of the cycle. The experimental results show that the results of the
version of the algorithm that uses this mutation operation are much more
efficient than the version that uses only the usual two-points mutation
operation.

trusted and untrusted predictions. In Unit Profit Knapsack, the items have unit
profit, and it is easy to find an optimal solution offline: Pack as many of the
smallest items as possible into the knapsack. For Online Unit Profit Knapsack,
the competitive ratio is unbounded. In contrast, previous work on online
algorithms with untrusted predictions generally studied problems where an
online algorithm with a constant competitive ratio is known. The prediction,
possibly obtained from a machine learning source, that our algorithm uses is
the average size of those smallest items that fit in the knapsack. For the
prediction error in this hard online problem, we use the ratio
$r=\frac{a}{\hat{a}}$ where $a$ is the actual value for this average size and
$\hat{a}$ is the prediction. The algorithm presented achieves a competitive
ratio of $\frac{1}{2r}$ for $r\geq 1$ and $\frac{r}{2}$ for $r\leq 1$. Using an
adversary technique, we show that this is optimal in some sense, giving a
trade-off in the competitive ratio attainable for different values of $r$. Note
that the result for accurate advice, $r=1$, is only $\frac{1}{2}$, but we show
that no algorithm knowing the value $a$ can achieve a competitive ratio better
than $\frac{e-1}{e}\approx 0.6321$ and present an algorithm with a matching
upper bound. We also show that this latter algorithm attains a competitive
ratio of $r\frac{e-1}{e}$ for $r \leq 1$ and $\frac{e-r}{e}$ for $1 \leq r &lt;
e$, and no algorithm can be better for both $r&lt;1$ and $1\leq r&lt;e$.

functions $F(x)=\mathbb{E}_i f_i(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that modifying
the exponential mechanism by adding an $\ell_2^2$ regularizer to $F(x)$ and
sampling from $\pi(x)\propto \exp(-k(F(x)+\mu\|x\|_2^2/2))$ recovers both the
known optimal empirical risk and population loss under $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP.
Furthermore, we show how to implement this mechanism using $\widetilde{O}(n
\min(d, n))$ queries to $f_i(x)$ for the DP-SCO where $n$ is the number of
samples/users and $d$ is the ambient dimension. We also give a (nearly)

<p>Our results utilize the following tools that are of independent interest: (1)
We prove Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) of the exponential mechanism if
the loss function is strongly convex and the perturbation is Lipschitz. Our
privacy bound is \emph{optimal} as it includes the privacy of Gaussian
mechanism as a special case and is proved using the isoperimetric inequality
for strongly log-concave measures. (2) We show how to sample from
$\exp(-F(x)-\mu \|x\|^2_2/2)$ for $G$-Lipschitz $F$ with $\eta$ error in total
variation (TV) distance using $\widetilde{O}((G^2/\mu) \log^2(d/\eta))$
unbiased queries to $F(x)$. This is the first sampler whose query complexity
has \emph{polylogarithmic dependence} on both dimension $d$ and accuracy
$\eta$.

    <title>Ordered Submodularity and its Applications to Diversifying Recommendations</title>

influence maximization to sensor placement to content recommendation, is to
select the optimal group of $k$ items from a larger set. Submodularity has been
very effective in allowing approximation algorithms for such subset selection
problems. However, in several applications, we are interested not only in the
elements of a set, but also the order in which they appear, breaking the
assumption that all selected items receive equal consideration. One such
category of applications involves the presentation of search results, product
recommendations, news articles, and other content, due to the well-documented
phenomenon that humans pay greater attention to higher-ranked items. As a
result, optimization in content presentation for diversity, user coverage,
calibration, or other objectives more accurately represents a sequence
selection problem, to which traditional submodularity approximation results no
longer apply. Although extensions of submodularity to sequences have been
proposed, none is designed to model settings where items contribute based on
their position in a ranked list, and hence they are not able to express these
types of optimization problems. In this paper, we aim to address this modeling
gap.
</p>
<p>Here, we propose a new formalism of ordered submodularity that captures these
ordering problems in content presentation, and more generally a category of
optimization problems over ranked sequences in which different list positions
contribute differently to the objective function. We analyze the natural
ordered analogue of the greedy algorithm and show that it provides a
$2$-approximation. We also show that this bound is tight, establishing that our
new framework is conceptually and quantitatively distinct from previous
formalisms of set and sequence submodularity.

low-degree bounded polynomial on the Boolean hypercube has an influential
variable. This conjecture, if true, would imply that the acceptance probability
of every $d$-query quantum algorithm can be well-approximated almost everywhere
(i.e., on almost all inputs) by a $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-query classical algorithm.
We prove a special case of the conjecture: in every completely bounded
degree-$d$ block-multilinear form with constant variance, there always exists a
variable with influence at least $1/\mathrm{poly}(d)$. In a certain sense, such
polynomials characterize the acceptance probability of quantum query
algorithms, as shown by Arunachalam, Bri\"et and Palazuelos (SICOMP '19). As a
corollary we obtain efficient classical almost-everywhere simulation for a
particular class of quantum algorithms that includes for instance $k$-fold
Forrelation. Our main technical result relies on connections to free
probability theory.

locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. For a universe size
of $k$ and with $n$ users, our $\varepsilon$-LDP algorithm has communication
cost $\lceil\log_2k\rceil$ bits in the private coin setting and
$\varepsilon\log_2 e + O(1)$ in the public coin setting, and has computation
cost $O(n + k\exp(\varepsilon) \log k)$ for the server to approximately
reconstruct the frequency histogram, while achieving the state-of-the-art
privacy-utility tradeoff. In many parameter settings used in practice this is a
significant improvement over the $ O(n+k^2)$ computation cost that is achieved
by the recent PI-RAPPOR algorithm (Feldman and Talwar; 2021). Our empirical
evaluation shows a speedup of over 50x over PI-RAPPOR while using approximately
75x less memory for practically relevant parameter settings. In addition, the
running time of our algorithm is within an order of magnitude of
HadamardResponse (Acharya, Sun, and Zhang; 2019) and RecursiveHadamardResponse
(Chen, Kairouz, and Ozgur; 2020) which have significantly worse reconstruction
error. The error of our algorithm essentially matches that of the
communication- and time-inefficient but utility-optimal SubsetSelection (SS)
algorithm (Ye and Barg; 2017). Our new algorithm is based on using Projective
Planes over a finite field to define a small collection of sets that are close
to being pairwise independent and a dynamic programming algorithm for
approximate histogram reconstruction on the server side. We also give an
extension of PGR, which we call HybridProjectiveGeometryResponse, that allows
trading off computation time with utility smoothly.

$S_2$ if they are permutations of each other. Given a text $T$ of size $N$ and
a string $S \in \Sigma^*$, the problem of \emph{Jumbled Pattern Matching} (JPM)
is to determine all substrings in $T$ jumbled matching $S$. In classical
computing, a widespread conjecture is that JPM requires
$\Omega(N^{2-\epsilon})$ preprocessing time and space for $O(1)$ query time, or
$\Omega(N^{1-\delta})$ query time in the online version, with $\epsilon, \delta

$O(\sqrt{N})$ time.

<p><img alt="" src="https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/news/theory_at_the_institute_and_beyond-february_2022.png" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 328px; height: 219px;"/>It has been only a few months since the last time this column appeared. Yet there is so much to write about that it feels like a year has passed. For one area in particular, a decade’s worth of developments seems to have emerged in a few months’ time. I am talking of course about the phenomenal developments on error-correcting codes that we witnessed in the past few months.</p>



<p><strong>Error-correcting codes</strong><br/>
	Error-correcting codes encode a message into a longer codeword so that the original message can be recovered even if many of the bits of the codeword are corrupted. Clearly, there is a trade-off between the amount of redundancy introduced by the error-correcting code and the number of errors it can recover from. A gold standard for error-correcting codes is being “constant rate, constant distance,” also referred to as being “asymptotically good.” An asymptotically good code can recover from a constant fraction of bit errors in the codeword, and the codeword is only a constant factor longer than the original message.</p>



<p>Error-correcting codes can be described using a family of “parity checks,” where a parity check on a subset \(S\) of bits is a constraint that there are an even number of \(1\)s within the subset \(S\). A codeword is then a sequence of bits that satisfy all of the parity check constraints. In a low-density parity check (LDPC) code, there is a family of parity checks on constantly many bits each, that together define the code.</p>



<p>Introduced by Gallager in 1960, LDPC codes are central objects in both the theory and the practice of error correction. In 1996, Sipser and Spielman showed how to use expander graphs to construct LDPCs with constant distance and constant rate. Their construction is a thing of beauty. Pick an expander graph and associate one bit on each edge of the graph. For each vertex of the expander graph, the parity of the sum of bits on its edges is even. This construction also admits linear time encoding and decoding algorithms for the same.</p>



<p><strong>Asymptotically good locally testable codes and quantum LDPCs</strong><br/>
	A locally testable code is one that admits a highly efficient procedure to detect the presence of errors. More precisely, it admits a testing procedure that queries a small number of randomly selected bits in the codeword, and will reject a corrupted codeword with, say, 1% of errors with constant probability. The gold standard would be a constant-query locally testable code, where the testing procedure queries only a constantly many (say, 100) bits of the corrupted codeword.</p>



<p>Locally testable codes have been central to many of the developments in complexity theory for close to three decades now. Linearity testing, aka locally testing the Hadamard code, is still the prime example for property testing and lies at the gateway to the world of probabilistically checkable proofs.</p>



<p>Intuitively for a code to be locally testable, it needs to admit a large number of constant-size parity checks. In other words, locally testability seemingly necessitates the code to have a lot of redundancy. In fact, the classic examples of locally testable codes, such as Hadamard codes or Reed-Muller codes, have codewords that are superpolynomially larger than the message.</p>



<p>Irit Dinur’s ingenious proof of the PCP theorem yielded as a by-product the first locally testable codes where the codewords were only slightly superlinear in size. It was then that one would dare to ask: can locally testability be achieved for “free”? That is, can one have the best of all worlds: a constant-rate, constant-distance code that also admits a constant-query local-tester?</p>



<p>This long-standing open question always seemed out of reach until late last year, when it was resolved affirmatively by two independent groups of researchers simultaneously!</p>



<span id="more-627"/>



<p/>



<p>Irit Dinur, Shai Evra, Ron Livne, Alexander Lubotzky, and Shahar Mozes start their journey with the idea that analogous to how Sipser and Spielman use expander graphs to construct codes, one could potentially use high-dimensional expanders to construct codes that are also locally testable. Starting with this idea, they undertake a long and intensive journey through a terrain of Ramanujan complexes, Bruhat-Tits buildings, <em>p</em>-adic uniformization, and other advanced mathematics to eventually land on an elementary and elegant <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04808" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construction</u></a> (see Irit Dinur’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjc6GCRFnpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>talk</u></a> on this work in the <em>Breakthroughs</em> talk series).</p>



<p>In an independent work, Pavel Panteleev and Gleb Kalachev not only <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03654?context=quant-ph" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construct</u></a> asymptotically good locally testable codes, but also resolve yet another long-standing open question! They exhibit a construction of asymptotically good quantum LDPCs. Regular readers of this column might recall that we earlier <u><a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/theory-institute-and-beyond-january-2021" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">featured</a></u> a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03921" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breakthrough</u></a> by Hastings, Haah, and O’Donnell, who constructed quantum LDPCs on \(n\) qubits with distance \(n^{3/5}\), significantly beating \(\sqrt{n}\) for the first time. Panteleev and Kalachev essentially achieve the holy grail in this context — quantum LDPCs on \(n\) qubits with constant rate and distance \(\Omega(n)\).</p>



<p>It is uncanny how often a question that has remained open for years gets resolved by independent sets of researchers simultaneously. At first, one might remark that these results were really in the air. Yet on a closer look, one can only wonder how the authors masterfully pulled these results out of thin air.</p>



<p>These works are a treasure trove of ideas that are elementary, elegant, and ingenious. To leave you with a taste of things that lie inside, let me briefly describe a new combinatorial object, the “left-right Cayley complex,” that seems to underlie both these works. We are all familiar with Cayley graphs — objects studied for more than a hundred years. These are graphs where the vertices are elements of a group, and edges are of the form \((g,ag)\) — corresponding to left multiplication by a fixed set of group elements \(a\) called generators.</p>



<p>A left-right Cayley complex is a higher-dimensional object that has vertices, edges, and squares (\(4\)-tuples). The vertices are still elements of a group, and the squares are of the form \(\{g, ag, gb, agb\}\), corresponding to left and right multiplication of a group element \(g\) by generators \(a,b\). This simple and easily constructed combinatorial object (left-right Cayley complex) plays a central role in both these code constructions. Yet this object seems to have eluded study in more than a century of work on Cayley graphs.</p>



<p><strong>Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity</strong><br/>
	Reed-Muller codes are among the oldest of error-correcting codes and are probably the simplest to describe. Reed-Muller codewords of degree \(d\) are just the truth tables of degree \(d\) polynomials over the finite field \({0,1}\). Yet almost 70 years after their discovery, there are still fundamental questions about Reed-Muller codes that remain open.</p>



<p>Given the noise characteristics of a channel, Shannon’s theory establishes the fundamental upper bound on the rate of communication possible. An error-correcting code is said to “achieve capacity” if the rate of communication (aka, the number of message bits per codeword bit) matches Shannon’s upper bound.</p>



<p>A fundamental question on Reed-Muller codes is whether they do achieve capacity for a broad family of channels. In 2016, a beautiful <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7862912" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>work</u></a> by Shrinivas Kudekar, Santhosh Kumar, Marco Mondelli, Henry D. Pfister, Eren Şaşoğlu, and Rüdiger Urbanke showed that indeed, Reed-Muller codes do achieve capacity for erasure channels, namely channels that only erase bits instead of corrupting bits. Using one of the most ingenious applications of Boolean function analysis, they show a very general result that any code with a certain family of symmetries achieves capacity against erasures.</p>



<p>In a remarkable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14631" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breakthrough</u></a>, Galen Reeves and Henry D. Pfister show that Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity even against the broad family of binary memoryless channels. In particular, they achieve capacity for the most classic channel, namely the binary symmetric channel (BSC), where each bit is flipped with a fixed probability \(\epsilon\).</p>



<p><strong>An algorithmic surprise</strong><br/>
	Given a graph with weights on the edges, the best-known algorithm to compute shortest paths between all pairs of vertices takes \(O(n^3)\) time. In fact, it is hypothesized that the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem requires \(n^{3-o(1)}\) time, and this hypothesis is the starting point for a web of reductions in fine-grained complexity.</p>



<p>Now consider the problem of computing max-flow values between every pair of vertices in the graph, also known as the all-pairs max-flow (APMF) problem. It would seem that the APMF problem must be harder than APSP — after all, shortest paths are arguably much simpler to compute than maximum flows.</p>



<p>Yet, a phenomenal new result by Amir Abboud, Robert Krauthgamer, Jason Li, Debmalya Panigrahi, Thatchaphol Saranurak, and Ohad Trabelsi shatters this intuition. In particular, they exhibit a nearly quadratic-time algorithm for APMF!</p>



<p>Perhaps the first hint that max-flow values are arguably simpler objects than shortest paths lies in Gomory-Hu trees. In 1961, Gomory and Hu showed that the max-flow values between every pair of vertices in a graph can be succinctly represented using a weighted tree. More precisely, the Gomory-Hu tree is a weighted tree that one can construct for any given graph so that the maximum flow between every pair of vertices in the graph is equal to the same quantity on the Gomory-Hu tree.</p>



<p>Six decades after its introduction, this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04958" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>work</u></a> produces the first near-quadratic-time algorithm to compute the Gomory-Hu tree. Moreover, this work also shows that one can compute Gomory-Hu trees in unweighted graphs by using polylogarithmically many max-flow computations.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-031 |  Transparency Beyond VNP in the Monotone Setting | 

	Prerona Chatterjee, 

	Kshitij Gajjar, 

	Anamay Tengse</title>
    <summary>Recently Hrubes and Yehudayoff (2021) showed a connection between the monotone algebraic circuit complexity of \emph{transparent} polynomials and a geometric complexity measure of their Newton polytope. They then used this connection to prove lower bounds against monotone VP (mVP). We extend their work by showing that their technique can be used to prove lower bounds against classes that are seemingly more powerful than monotone VNP (mVNP).
	
In the process, we define a natural monotone analogue of VPSPACE --- a well-studied class in the non-monotone setting (Poizat (2008), Koiran Perifel (2009), Malod (2011), Mahajan Rao (2013) --- and prove an exponential separation between the computational powers of this class and mVNP. 
	
To show this separation, we define a new polynomial family with an interesting combinatorial structure which we use heavily in our lower bound. Both the polynomial and the combinatorial nature of our proof might be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>TR22-029 |  Quantum Tanner codes | 

	Anthony Leverrier, 

	Gilles Zémor</title>
    <summary>Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes.

In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a $c^3$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.</summary>

<i>Age is strictly a case of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter—Jack Benny</i></p>
<p>
Jennifer Chayes, Francine Berman, Susan Dumais, Deborah Estrin, James Hendler, Michael Jordan, Butler Lampson, Valerie Taylor are the members of a <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2022/february/75th-anniversary">special committee</a>. This committee is charged with helping organize the 75th anniversary of the ACM. The ACM was founded on September 15, 1947; hence the 75 year celebration. During 2022 special events are planned, leading up to a memorable day in June of panels on topics central to the future of computing. The committee has members from both universities and companies: </p>
<ul>
<li> Jennifer Chayes (Chair), University of California, Berkeley
</li><li> Francine Berman, University of Massachusetts Amherst
</li><li> Susan Dumais, Microsoft Research
</li><li> Deborah Estrin, Cornell University
</li><li> James Hendler, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
</li><li> Michael Jordan, University of California, Berkeley
</li><li> Butler Lampson, Microsoft Corporation and MIT
</li><li> Valerie Taylor, Argonne National Laboratory and CMD-IT
</li></ul>
<p>
In random order:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/02/26/acm-celebrating-75-years/all-11/" rel="attachment wp-att-19692"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19692" height="215" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/all.png?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> 75 Years </b></p>
<p/><p>
I am 75 years old too. I do not have a committee for special events—maybe I should. I do recall what computers were in the beginning and what they have become now. I can only imagine what they might become in the next 75 years. I am thus quite interested in what the committee will do and how it might help celebrate the 75th anniversary. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
I started doing some research into the history of computers. I had the idea to look at old magazines that were monthly publications on all aspects of computers. Especially ones that were important in the early days: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datamation">Datamation</a> is one and another was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">Byte</a>. The later opened in 1975 and closed in 2013. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/02/26/acm-celebrating-75-years/teeth/" rel="attachment wp-att-19694"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19694" height="225" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/teeth.png?resize=225%2C225&amp;ssl=1" width="225"/></a></p>
<p>
As of 2022, the domain for Byte redirects to an unrelated website selling <a href="https://www.byteme.com/pages/why-byte">teeth aligners</a>. That says something, no?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I just spent an hour giving Lily, my 9-year-old, a crash course on geopolitics, including WWII, the Cold War, the formation of NATO, Article 5, nuclear deterrence, economic sanctions, the breakup of the USSR, Ukraine, the Baltic Republics, and the prospects now for WWIII. Her comment at the end was that from now on she’s going to refer to Putin as “Poopin,” in the hope that that shames him into changing course.</p>

    <title>I will be on instagram/If you have two reals in a box- Answer (Guest Post by David Marcus)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I will be on instragram:</p><p>We,  Prof. Mohammad Hajiaghayi and Prof. William Gasarch plan to have an Instagram Live at @mhajiaghayi this SAT FEB 26, 1:30PM EDT (in English).</p><p> We talk about our lives as well as blogging, research, and how to inspire young minds. Please join if you can.</p><p>#PvsNP #blogging #youngminds #instagram</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>This is the answer to the problem posted in the last post which was a guest post by David Marcus. This post is also a guest post by him. </p><p>We restate the problem:</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>PICK THE LARGEST NUMBER:</p><p>There are two distinct reals in a box (how do they fit! aren't reals infinite!). They are called the first and second number. </p><p>You want to pick the larger one. You can pick one of the numbers at random and look at it</p><p>before deciding which one you want. </p><p>Is there a strategy that will win with probability &gt; 1/2.</p><p>CLARIFICATIONS:</p><p>1) We do not want a strategy that does well on average or in the long run. Even if the games is played just once, we want the probability of winning to be &gt; 1/2.</p><p>2) It must have prob of winning &gt; 1/2 for EVERY pair of reals.</p><p>3) Here is an example of a strategy that does NOT work: Pick the first number with prob 1/2. If its positive then keep it, else dump it. If the numbers are{1,2} this only works half the time.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>There is a strategy. In fact, we give two.</p><p><br/></p><p>STRATEGY ONE</p><p>Before looking at any number, pick a number x on your own from the reals according to a distribution with full support (every open interval has prob greater than 0). Then pick a number from the box (prob 1/2-1/2), which we call y. If x&lt;y then keep y. If y\le x then take the other number.</p><p>If x is between the two numbers, then the strategy works. If not then the strategy does not hurt, so the prob in that case is 1/2. Hence you do better than 1/2. </p><p>STRATEGY TWO</p><p>Let f: R--&gt; (0,1) be strictly increasing. Pick a number from the box, call it y. Keep it with prob f(y).</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR22-028 |  The plane test is a local tester for  Multiplicity Codes | 

	Dan Karliner, 

	Amnon Ta-Shma, 

	Roie Salama</title>
    <summary>Multiplicity codes are a generalization of RS and RM codes where for each evaluation point we output the evaluation of a low-degree polynomial  and all of its directional derivatives up  to order $s$. Multi-variate multiplicity codes are locally decodable with the natural local decoding algorithm that reads values on a random line and corrects to the closest uni-variate multiplicity code. However, it was not known whether multiplicity codes are locally testable, and this question has been posed since the introduction of these codes with no progress up to date. In fact, it has been also open whether multiplicity codes can be characterized by local constraints, i.e., if there exists a subset $B$ such that $c$ is in the code iff $c \cdot z=0$ for any $z\in B$, and,
every $z \in B$ has small Hamming weight, i.e., few non-zero symbols.

We begin by giving a simple example showing the line test does not give local characterization when $d&gt;q$. Surprisingly, 
we then show the plane test is a local characterization when $s&lt;q$ and $d&lt;qs-1$ for prime $q$. 
In addition, we show the $k$-dimensional test is a local tester for multiplicity codes, when $s &lt; q$ and $k$ is at least $\lceil \frac{d+1}{q-1} \rceil$.
Combining the two results, we show that the plane test is a local tester for multiplicity codes, with constant rejection probability for constant $s$.

Our technique is new. We represent the given input as a possibly very high-degree polynomial,  and we show that for some choice of plane,  the restriction of the polynomial to the plane is a high-degree bi-variate polynomial. The argument has to work modulo the appropriate kernels, and for that we use Grobner theory, the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz theorem and its generalization to multiplicities. Even given that, the argument is delicate and requires choosing a non-standard monomial order for the argument to work.</summary>

    <title>TR22-027 |  New Near-Linear Time Decodable Codes Closer to the GV Bound | 

	Dean Doron, 

	Guy Blanc</title>
    <summary>We construct a family of binary codes of relative distance $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ and rate $\varepsilon^{2} \cdot 2^{-\log^{\alpha}(1/\varepsilon)}$ for $\alpha \approx \frac{1}{2}$ that are decodable, probabilistically, in near linear time. This improves upon the rate of the state-of-the-art near-linear time decoding near the GV bound due to Jeronimo, Srivastava, and Tulsiani, who gave a randomized decoding of Ta-Shma codes with $\alpha \approx \frac{5}{6}$ [T17,JST21].
Each code in our family can be constructed in probabilistic polynomial time, or deterministic polynomial time given sufficiently good explicit $3$-uniform hypergraphs. 
     
Our construction is based on a new graph-based bias amplification method. While previous works start with some base code of relative distance $\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0$ for $\varepsilon_0 \gg \varepsilon$ and amplify the distance to $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ by walking on an expander, or on a carefully tailored product of expanders, we walk over very sparse, highly mixing, hypergraphs. 
Study of such hypergraphs further offers an avenue toward achieving rate $\widetilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^2)$.
For our unique- and list-decoding algorithms, we employ the framework developed in [JST21].</summary>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1493428796539772937">Twitter quiz</a> asked “what is a powerful concept from your field that, if more people understood it, their lives would be better?” Unambiguously, the answer from my field is statistical significance. Significance testing is a confusing, obscure statistical practice. It is hard to explain and usually impossible to justify. But papers can only be published if they are “statistically significant.” Here, I’ll explain in as plain terms as I can what statistical significance means in almost every published scientific study. I’ll do this without ever defining a p-value, as p-values have nothing to do with the way significance testing is used. Instead, significance testing amounts to hand wavy arguments about precision and variability. Laying it out this way shows why the authority granted to significance testing is so suspect and unearned.</p>

<p>Let’s suppose we’re trying to evaluate the benefit of some intervention. We test the intervention on a bunch of individuals and compute the average benefit which we call the effect size. The effect size could be the number of years of life a person gains with some cancer treatment or the amount of money gained with an investment strategy.</p>

<p>Since the effect size is the <em>average</em> of all the individuals in a study some individuals will have received less benefit than average and some more than average. Combining this varied benefit with the reality that experiments are always noisy and complicated, it may very well be that even if we measure a positive benefit on average, the intervention may actually be mostly harmful to the general population.</p>

<p>Think about the hypothetical situation where on half the population the benefit is equal to 1 and on the other half it’s negative 1. In this case, the average benefit is zero. If we collected a random set of people and computed the average effect size, we’d see a positive effect size about half of the time. In other words, if your experiment was “flip a coin ten times,” you’ll see 5 or more heads about half of the times you run this experiment.</p>

<p>The experimenter’s goal is to distinguish whether the benefit is large, small, or if the intervention is actually harmful. What the paradigm of statistical significance aims to do is to find a way to determine if an intervention is “mostly good.” It goes forth like this: using statistics, you estimate the standard error (SE) of the measured effect size. Roughly speaking, the standard error measures how spread out the effect size is over a population. When the standard error is small, everyone in the population experiences the same effect from a treatment. When the standard error is large, even if the effect size is positive, some may experience negative effects and some positive.</p>

<p>If the measured effect size is greater than twice the standard error, you declare that you have discovered your intervention is statistically significant at the “p&lt;0.05” level. If the effect size is bigger than 2.6 times the standard error you declare statistical significance at the
“p&lt;0.01” level. If effect size is even bigger than three times the standard error you declare statistical significance at the “p&lt;0.003” level! Wow! There’s a Nobel Prize in your future. But if the effect size is only 1.9 times bigger than the standard error, you unfortunately have not found a statistically significant result and have to throw all your work in the trash. Unless, of course, you are an economist. In this case, you are allowed the special “p&lt;0.1” level, which occurs when the effect size is 1.7 times the standard error.</p>

<p>The following figure, adapted from a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/TAH_Sci/status/1490701257769734145">Thomas House</a>, nicely illustrates the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="Only one of these droids is signficant" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/significant.png" width="100%"/></p>

<p>Here, there are four hypothetical distributions of benefit. All but (a) are “statistically significant.” The interventions we are always striving for are ones with clear benefit, like (d) in the bottom right. Interventions like this do exist: In the Pfizer trial, the effect size was 12 times larger than the standard error. Vaccines work! But most interventions are not vaccines (or parachutes for that matter).</p>

<p>The other panels show why statistical significance alone is so problematic. Figures (a) and (b) are nearly indistinguishable plots, but one is significant and the other is not. Moreover, statistical significance also misses the forest for the trees. You can have a miniscule effect size and still have a significant effect. Do we always prefer the (c) to the (a)? Is a meager, but mostly positive benefit necessarily better than a treatment potentially of large benefit to some but harmful to others necessarily? Wouldn’t it be in our interest to understand this spread of outcomes so we could isolate the group of individuals who benefit from the treatment?</p>

<p>The fact that a mere factor of 1.5 separates the difference between “not publishable” and “undoubtedly real” is deeply concerning. And every statistician knows how estimates of standard error can be <em>very</em> sensitive. Simple approximations can make the standard error appear 1.4 times smaller, which is enough to transform an insignificant result into a significant one. This is what is commonly known as “data dredging” or “p-hacking”: trying to find the appropriate set of assumptions under which your experiment has small standard error and is hence statistically significant.</p>

<p>The precise definitions of standard error and p-value don’t illuminate the situation. Since p-values lead you to pedantry and quibbling about tiny effects, their actual definition, which is complicated and hard to even explain to other statisticians, just confuses people and doesn’t fix science. Most practicing scientists would be better off not knowing what a p-value is.</p>

<p>And a lot of the other fixes also don’t help. For example, the <a href="https://clincalc.com/Stats/FragilityIndex.aspx">fragility index</a> is often used in medicine to describe how many “non-events” have to become events for the significance to vanish. But this is just a way to conflate sample size and p-values, and isn’t getting away from the core problem that statistical significance testing is a mass waste of time.</p>

<p>I am by no means the first person to complain about the absurdity of significance testing. Some examples from the last 50 years include <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.200.7648&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Meehl</a> (1978), <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1803924">Leamer</a> (1983), <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/270939">Freedman</a> (1991), <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/308/6924/283">Altman</a> (1994), <a href="http://www.principlesofeconometrics.com/poe5/writing/kennedy.pdf">Kennedy</a> (2002), <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Ioannidis</a> (2005), <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/Instruments_of_Development.pdf">Deaton</a> (2009), <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/186351/cult_of_statistical_significance">Ziliak and McCloskey</a> (2008), and <a href="https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/asa_pvalues.pdf">Gelman</a> (2016). The significance testing framework is barely 100 years old. And people have been rightfully attacking it for nearly as long. Why do we remain so stuck?</p>

<p>The aforementioned list of grumpy people have a deeper criticism of contemporary science beyond significance testing, and this critique is one I hope to take up in future blogs. When can we trust scientific consensus and what structures and methods are necessary to build such consensus? One of the core questions is that of experimental validity. Statistical validity is a small part of the big picture that establishes the trustworthiness of a study. The study must be <em>construct valid</em>, measuring the right quantities. It must be <em>internally valid</em>, avoiding bias and confounding. And it must be <em>externally valid</em>, generalizable to other contexts. The next few blogs will try to unpack some thoughts on validity, and why validity and design remain the most pressing challenges in contemporary scientific inquiry.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-026 |  Trading Time and Space in Catalytic Branching Programs | 

	Ian Mertz, 

	James  Cook</title>
    <summary>An $m$-catalytic branching program (Girard, Koucky, McKenzie 2015) is a set of $m$ distinct branching programs for $f$ which are permitted to share internal (i.e. non-source non-sink) nodes. While originally introduced as a non-uniform analogue to catalytic space, this also gives a natural notion of amortized non-uniform space complexity for $f$, namely the smallest value $|G|/m$ for an $m$-catalytic branching program $G$ for $f$ (Potechin 2017).

Potechin (2017) showed that every function $f$ has amortized size $O(n)$, witnessed by an $m$-catalytic branching program where $m = 2^{2^n-1}$. We recreate this result by defining a catalytic algorithm for evaluating polynomials using a large amount of space but $O(n)$ time. This allows us to balance this with previously known algorithms which are efficient with respect to space at the cost of time (Cook, Mertz 2020, 2021). We show that for any $\epsilon \geq 2n^{-1}$, every function $f$ has an $m$-catalytic branching program of size $O_\epsilon(mn)$, where $m = 2^{2^{\epsilon n}}$. We similarly recreate an improved result due to Robere and Zuiddam (2021), and show that for $d \leq n$ and $\epsilon \geq 2d^{-1}$, the same result holds for $m = 2^{n \choose \leq \epsilon d}$ as long as $f$ is a degree-$d$ polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_2$. We also show that for certain classes of functions, $m$ can be reduced to $2^{poly(n)}$ while still maintaining linear or quasi-linear amortized size.

In the other direction, we bound the necessary length, and by extension the amortized size, of any permutation branching program for an arbitrary function between $3n$ and $4n-4$.</summary>

    <title>TR22-025 |  Efficient Low-Space Simulations From the Failure of the Weak Pigeonhole Principle | 

	Oliver Korten</title>
    <summary>A recurring challenge in the theory of pseudorandomness and circuit complexity is the explicit construction of ``incompressible strings,'' i.e. finite objects which lack a specific type of structure or simplicity. In most cases, there is an associated NP search problem which we call the ``compression problem,'' where we are given a candidate object and must either find a compressed/structured representation of it or determine that none exist. For a particular notion of compressibility, a natural question is whether an efficient algorithm for the compression problem would aide us in the construction of incompressible objects. Consider the following two instances of this question:

(1) Does an efficient algorithm for circuit minimization imply efficient constructions of hard truth tables?

(2) Does an efficient algorithm for factoring integers imply efficient constructions of large prime numbers?
 
In this work, we connect these kinds of questions to the long-standing challenge of proving space/time tradeoffs for Turing machines, and proving stronger separations between the RAM and 1-tape computation models. In particular, one of our main theorems shows that modest space/time tradeoffs for deterministic exponential time, or separations between basic Turing machine memory models, would imply a positive answer to both (1) and (2). 
These results apply to a more general class of explicit construction problems, where we have some efficient compression scheme that encodes $n$-bit strings using $&lt;n$ bits, and we aim to construct an $n$-bit string which cannot be recovered from its encoding.</summary>
