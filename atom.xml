    <title>TR22-046 |  Automating OBDD proofs is NP-hard | 

	Artur Riazanov, 

	Dmitry Itsykson</title>
    <summary>We prove that the proof system OBDD(and, weakening) is not automatable unless P = NP. The proof is based upon the celebrated result of Atserias and Muller [FOCS 2019] about the hardness of automatability for resolution. The heart of the proof is lifting with a multi-output indexing gadget from resolution block-width to dag-like multiparty number-in-hand communication protocol size with $o(n)$ parties, where $n$ is the number of variables in the non-lifted formula. A similar lifting theorem for protocols with $n + 1$ participants was proved by Göös et. el. [STOC 2020] to establish the hardness of automatability result for Cutting Planes.</summary>

    <title>TR22-041 |  Boolean functions with small approximate spectral norm | 

	Hamed Hatami, 

	TsunMing Cheung, 

	Rosie Zhao, 

	Itai Zilberstein</title>
    <summary>The sum of the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients of a function $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is called the spectral norm of $f$.    Green and Sanders' quantitative version of  Cohen's idempotent theorem states that if the spectral norm of $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{0,1\}$ is at most $M$, then the support of $f$ belongs to the ring of sets generated by at most $\ell(M)$ cosets,  where $\ell(M)$ is a constant that only depends on $M$.
    
    We prove that the above statement can be generalized to approximate spectral norms if and only if the support of $f$ and its complement satisfy a certain arithmetic connectivity condition. In particular, our theorem provides a new proof of the quantitative Cohen's theorem for $\mathbb{F}_2^n$.</summary>

    <title>TR22-045 |  Relaxed Locally Decodable and Correctable Codes: Beyond Tensoring | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Tal Yankovitz</title>
    <summary>In their highly influential paper, Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (STOC 2004) introduced the notion of a relaxed locally decodable code (RLDC). Similarly to a locally decodable code (Katz-Trevisan; STOC 2000), the former admits access to any desired message symbol with only a few queries to a possibly corrupted codeword. An RLDC, however, is allowed to abort when identifying corruption. The natural analog to locally correctable codes, dubbed relaxed locally correctable codes (RLCC), was introduced by Gur, Ramnarayan and Rothblum (ITCS 2018) who constructed asymptotically-good length-$n$ RLCC and RLDC with $(\log{n})^{O(\log\log{n})}$ queries.

In this work we construct asymptotically-good RLDC and RLCC with an improved query complexity of $(\log{n})^{O(\log\log\log{n})}$. To achieve this, we devise a mechanism--an alternative to the tensor product--that squares the length of a given code. Compared to the tensor product that was used by Gur et al. and by many other constructions, our mechanism is significantly more efficient in terms of rate deterioration, allowing us to obtain our improved construction.</summary>

<p><strong>Why do we care about average-case fine-grained hardness?</strong></p>



<p>(i) We hope to explain why we are struggling to find faster algorithms for problems in P such as DNA sequencing even for some random large datasets.</p>



<p>(ii) Average-case hard problems in P is useful to cryptography. For example, constructing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function">one-way functions</a> (i.e., functions that are easy to compute but hard to invert) based on worst-case complexity assumptions such as NP <img alt="\not\subseteq" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnot%5Csubseteq&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> BPP has been a long-standing open question. In this context, “easy” means polynomial-time computable. If we consider “easy” to be computable in time like <img alt="O(n^{100})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B100%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> instead, then a natural alternative question is whether we can construct such one-way functions based on worst-case fine-grained complexity assumptions. Another example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">proof of work</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48071-4_10">[DN92]</a>. When a miner tries to mine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a>, the miner is asked to solve a random puzzle, that is average-case hard but still tractable, and then the miner needs to prove they have indeed solved the puzzle through efficient protocols. An interesting and more recent follow-up is proof of useful work <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/203.pdf">[BRSV17b]</a>, which proposes that instead of wasting computing power on a random puzzle that comes from nowhere, we can first reduce a computational task of practical interest to multiple random puzzles and then ask the miner to solve those puzzles.</p>



<p>The most common approach for proving average-case fine-grained hardness is arguably worst-case to average-case reduction, i.e., reducing an arbitrary instance to a number of random instances of which the distribution is polynomial-time sampable. Before I give concrete examples, I want to describe a general recipe for designing such worst-case to average-case reductions. (Some reader might notice that the step 3 of the recipe is same as the argument for proving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_self-reducibility#Permanent_of_a_matrix">computing permanent is self-reducible</a> <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/New-Directions-In-Testing-Lipton/fb2eba4d69bdab34c2d240380d4370be2feeacb9">[L91]</a>, which essentially uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_decodable_code#The_Reed%E2%80%93Muller_code">local decoding for Reed-Muller codes</a>.)</p>

(This step can be replaced by decoding algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed-Solomon codes</a> to handle larger errors of average-case solver.)</li><li>(The above steps already show that evaluating <img alt="f_{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="d+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> uniformly random inputs is as hard as solving <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for worst-case input.) If we want to show <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> itself is average-case fine-grained hard, it suffices to give a reduction from computing <img alt="f_{L}(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7BL%7D%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="x\in\mathbf{F}_{p}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin%5Cmathbf%7BF%7D_%7Bp%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> back to solving <img alt="L" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</li></ol>



<p>Notice that the above general recipe reduces a worst-case instance to <img alt="d+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> random instances at the step 3, and thus, we want <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be small (like <img alt="n^{o(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) such that it does not blow up the total runtime significantly. Typically, the step 4 would also blow up the runtime, and sometimes it depends on <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. For all the problems (or the techniques) in this series, I will explicitly quantify the runtime blow-up in the step 4 (if there is any) and explain how small we want <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be (if the blow-up depends on <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>).</p>



<p>Now let us go through a concrete example. Consider one of the flagship problems in fine-grained complexity — orthogonal vector problem (OV): Given <img alt="X=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D%5C%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="Y=\{y_1,\dots,y_n\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%3D%5C%7By_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cy_n%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where each <img alt="x_i,y_i\in\{0,1\}^{d'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i%2Cy_i%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="d'\in\omega(\log n)\cap n^{o(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%27%5Cin%5Comega%28%5Clog+n%29%5Ccap+n%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, decide if there are <img alt="x_i,y_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i%2Cy_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that <img alt="\langle x_i,y_j\rangle=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x_i%2Cy_j%5Crangle%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. It is known OV has no <img alt="O(n^{2-\varepsilon})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B2-%5Cvarepsilon%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-time algorithm for any constant <img alt="\varepsilon&gt;0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarepsilon%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> assuming strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential-time hypothesis</a> (SETH) <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-27836-8_101">[W05]</a>, and there is a generalization of OV called <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-OV that has no <img alt="O(n^{k-\varepsilon})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7Bk-%5Cvarepsilon%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-time algorithm under the same assumption <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3300150.3300158">[W18]</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Polynomial evaluation.</strong> Given an OV instance <img alt="X,Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2CY&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with <img alt="d'=n^{o(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%27%3Dn%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we construct a degree-<img alt="2d'" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2d%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> polynomial <img alt="f_{\textrm{OV}}(X,Y):=\sum_{i,j\in[n]}\prod_{t\in[d']}(1-x_{i,t}y_{i,t})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Ctextrm%7BOV%7D%7D%28X%2CY%29%3A%3D%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%5Cin%5Bn%5D%7D%5Cprod_%7Bt%5Cin%5Bd%27%5D%7D%281-x_%7Bi%2Ct%7Dy_%7Bi%2Ct%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> over <img alt="\mathbf{F}_{p}^{2nd'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BF%7D_%7Bp%7D%5E%7B2nd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="p&gt;n^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3En%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="x_{i,t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bi%2Ct%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> denotes the <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-th coordinate of <img alt="x_i\in X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i%5Cin+X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Observe that <img alt="f_{\textrm{OV}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Ctextrm%7BOV%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> simply enumerates all the pairs of vectors and counts the number of orthogonal pairs for the OV instance, and obviously counting is at least as hard as decision. Using the aforementioned general recipe, it follows immediately that evaluating <img alt="f_{\textrm{OV}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Ctextrm%7BOV%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> requires <img alt="O(n^{2-o(1)})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B2-o%281%29%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> time for average case assuming randomized version of SETH. This result was shown in <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/202.pdf">[BRSV17a]</a>, and analogously, they constructed a polynomial for <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-OV, which implies an average-case time hierarchy assuming randomized SETH.</p>



<p>However, the polynomial evaluation problem is algebraic. Next, let us consider a natural combinatorial problem — counting <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-cliques in an <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-vertices graph (for simplicity, think of <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as a large constant). This problem has worst-case complexity <img alt="n^{\Theta(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B%5CTheta%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> assuming ETH <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82508832.pdf">[CHKX06]</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Counting <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-cliques.</strong> It was first shown in <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/R2/gc.pdf">[GR18]</a> that there is an <img alt="\widetilde{O}(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-time reduction from counting <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-cliques in any graph to counting <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-cliques with error probability <img alt="&lt;\frac{1}{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in some polynomial-time sampable random graph. The proof also follows our general recipe. First, we construct a degree-<img alt="\binom{t}{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbinom%7Bt%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> polynomial <img alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}(X):=\sum_{\textrm{size-}t\, T\subseteq [n]}\prod_{i&lt;j\in T} X_{i,j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D%28X%29%3A%3D%5Csum_%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bsize-%7Dt%5C%2C+T%5Csubseteq+%5Bn%5D%7D%5Cprod_%7Bi%3Cj%5Cin+T%7D+X_%7Bi%2Cj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> over <img alt="\mathbf{F}_{p}^{n^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BF%7D_%7Bp%7D%5E%7Bn%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="p&gt;n^t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3En%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the adjacency matrix. Observe that <img alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> counts <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-cliques by enumerating each size-<img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> subset of vertices and checking whether it is a <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-clique. It remains to work out the step 4 of the general recipe. This was done by a gadget reduction, that runs in <img alt="\widetilde{O}(p^{t^2}n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28p%5E%7Bt%5E2%7Dn%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> time, from evaluating <img alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on <img alt="Y\in\mathbf{F}_{p}^{n^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%5Cin%5Cmathbf%7BF%7D_%7Bp%7D%5E%7Bn%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to counting <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-cliques in an <img alt="\widetilde{O}(p^{t^2}n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28p%5E%7Bt%5E2%7Dn%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-vertices graph <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/R2/gc.pdf">[GR18]</a>.</p>



<p>Although this gadget reduction is nice, I will not explain it here, because later works <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08247">[BBB19,</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06591">DLW20]</a> show that if the polynomial constructed at the step 2 has certain structure, then there is a general technique to reduce evaluating this polynomial back to the original problem (at the cost of requiring smaller error probability of average-case solver), which I will discuss in the <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2021/07/30/average-case-fine-grained-hardness-part-ii/">next post</a>. Finally, let me point out an issue in the previous paragraph — <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is too large for the gadget reduction to be useful! We need <img alt="p&gt;n^t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3En%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (note <img alt="n^t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a trivial upper bound of the number of <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-cliques) such that <img alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> indeed outputs the number of <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-cliques, but the gadget reduction takes <img alt="\widetilde{O}(p^{t^2}n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28p%5E%7Bt%5E2%7Dn%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> time, and moreover, we do not know how to find a prime <img alt="&gt;n^t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3En%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in <img alt="\widetilde{O}(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> time. This issue was handled in <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/R2/gc.pdf">[GR18]</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a>. Specifically, we choose <img alt="O(t\log n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28t%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> many distinct primes <img alt="p_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>‘s upper bounded by <img alt="O(t\log n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28t%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> whose product is <img alt="&gt;n^t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3En%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (the existence of such primes follows from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem">asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers</a>). Then, we apply the whole reduction described so far to evaluating <img alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}(X)\mod p_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D%28X%29%5Cmod+p_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for each <img alt="p_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and then use Chinese remainder theorem to recover <img alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}(X)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D%28X%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. (We can use Chinese remaindering with errors <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/18.850672">[GRS99]</a> to handle larger error probability.)</p>



<p>Hopefully, the above examples give you a flavor of worst-case to average-case reductions for fine-grained hard problems. As promised, in the <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2021/07/30/average-case-fine-grained-hardness-part-ii/">next post</a>, I will continue to discuss the new technique in  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08247">[BBB19,</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06591">DLW20]</a>, which automatizes the step 4 of the general recipe by requiring more structural properties for the polynomial constructed in the step 2 of the general recipe.</p>

for beyond worst-case analysis of algorithms with tunable parameters. An
important open problem is the design of efficient data-driven algorithms for
algorithm families with more than one parameter. In this work we provide
algorithms for efficient (output-polynomial) multidimensional parameter tuning,
i.e. for families with a small constant number of parameters, for three very
different combinatorial problems -- linkage-based clustering, dynamic
programming for sequence alignment, and auction design for two-part tariff
schemes. We extend the single-parameter clustering algorithm of Balcan et al.
2020 <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1907.00533">arXiv:1907.00533</a> to multiple parameters and to the sequence alignment
problem by proposing an execution graph which compactly represents all the
states the algorithm could attain for all possible parameter values. A key
problem-specific challenge is to efficiently compute how the partition of the
parameter space (into regions with unique algorithmic states) changes with a
single algorithmic step. We give algorithms which improve on the runtime of
previously best known results for linkage-based clustering, sequence alignment
and two-part tariff pricing.

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Kobi Bodek, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Feldman:Moran.html">Moran Feldman</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03412">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Motivated by practical applications, recent works have considered
maximization of sums of a submodular function $g$ and a linear function $\ell$.
Almost all such works, to date, studied only the special case of this problem
in which $g$ is also guaranteed to be monotone. Therefore, in this paper we
systematically study the simplest version of this problem in which $g$ is
allowed to be non-monotone, namely the unconstrained variant, which we term
Regularized Unconstrained Submodular Maximization (RegularizedUSM).
</p>
<p>Our main algorithmic result is the first non-trivial guarantee for general
RegularizedUSM. For the special case of RegularizedUSM in which the linear
function $\ell$ is non-positive, we prove two inapproximability results,
showing that the algorithmic result implied for this case by previous works is
not far from optimal. Finally, we reanalyze the known Double Greedy algorithm
to obtain improved guarantees for the special case of RegularizedUSM in which
the linear function $\ell$ is non-negative; and we complement these guarantees
by showing that it is not possible to obtain (1/2, 1)-approximation for this
case (despite intuitive arguments suggesting that this approximation guarantee
is natural).

    <title>Speeding Up Sparsification using Inner Product Search Data Structures</title>

structures to improve various sparsification problems involving an iterative
process. We also provide insights and characterization for different iterative
process, and answer that when should we use which data structures in what type
of problem. We obtain improved running time for the following problems.
</p>
<p>* For constructing linear-sized spectral sparsifier (Batson, Spielman and
Srivastava, 2012), all the existing deterministic algorithms require
$\Omega(d^4)$ time. In this work, we provide the first deterministic algorithm
that breaks that barrier which runs in $O(d^{\omega+1})$ time, where $\omega$
is the exponent of matrix multiplication.
</p>
<p>* For one-sided Kadison-Singer-typed discrepancy problem, we give fast
algorithms for both small and large number of iterations.
</p>
<p>* For experimental design problem, we speed up a key swapping process.
</p>
<p>In the heart of our work is the design of a variety of different inner
product search data structures that have efficient initialization, query and
update time, compatible to dimensionality reduction and robust against adaptive
adversary.

    <title>Faster Pattern Matching under Edit Distance</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1649548800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Charalampopoulos:Panagiotis.html">Panagiotis Charalampopoulos</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kociumaka:Tomasz.html">Tomasz Kociumaka</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wellnitz:Philip.html">Philip Wellnitz</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03087">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the approximate pattern matching problem under the edit distance.
Given a text $T$ of length $n$, a pattern $P$ of length $m$, and a threshold
$k$, the task is to find the starting positions of all substrings of $T$ that
can be transformed to $P$ with at most $k$ edits. More than 20 years ago, Cole
and Hariharan [SODA'98, J. Comput.'02] gave an $\mathcal{O}(n+k^4 \cdot n/
m)$-time algorithm for this classic problem, and this runtime has not been
improved since.
</p>
<p>Here, we present an algorithm that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(n+k^{3.5}
\sqrt{\log m \log k} \cdot n/m)$, thus breaking through this long-standing
barrier. In the case where $n^{1/4+\varepsilon} \leq k \leq
n^{2/5-\varepsilon}$ for some arbitrarily small positive constant
$\varepsilon$, our algorithm improves over the state-of-the-art by polynomial
factors: it is polynomially faster than both the algorithm of Cole and
Hariharan and the classic $\mathcal{O}(kn)$-time algorithm of Landau and
Vishkin [STOC'86, J. Algorithms'89].
</p>
<p>We observe that the bottleneck case of the alternative $\mathcal{O}(n+k^4
\cdot n/m)$-time algorithm of Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz
[FOCS'20] is when the text and the pattern are (almost) periodic. Our new
algorithm reduces this case to a new dynamic problem (Dynamic Puzzle Matching),
which we solve by building on tools developed by Tiskin [SODA'10,
Algorithmica'15] for the so-called seaweed monoid of permutation matrices. Our
algorithm relies only on a small set of primitive operations on strings and
thus also applies to the fully-compressed setting (where text and pattern are
given as straight-line programs) and to the dynamic setting (where we maintain
a collection of strings under creation, splitting, and concatenation),
improving over the state of the art.

    <title>Approximation Algorithms and Hardness for $n$-Pairs Shortest Paths and All-Nodes Shortest Cycles</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1649548800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Mina Dalirooyfard, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jin:Ce.html">Ce Jin</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Williams:Virginia_Vassilevska.html">Virginia Vassilevska Williams</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wein:Nicole.html">Nicole Wein</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03076">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the approximability of two related problems: $n$-Pairs Shortest
Paths ($n$-PSP), where the goal is to find a shortest path between $O(n)$
prespecified pairs, and All Node Shortest Cycles (ANSC), where the goal is to
find the shortest cycle passing through each node. Approximate $n$-PSP has been
previously studied, mostly in the context of distance oracles. ANSC has also
been studied previously, but only in terms of exact algorithms, rather than
approximation.
</p>
<p>We provide a thorough study of the approximability of $n$-PSP and ANSC,
providing a wide array of algorithms and conditional lower bounds that trade
off between running time and approximation ratio. Our conditional hardness
results are based on well-established and believable fine-grained hypotheses.
</p>
<p>A highlight of our conditional lower bounds results is that under the
$(k,3)$-Hyperclique Hypothesis for any integer $k\ge 4$, there is no algorithm
for unweighted undirected $n$-PSP with approximation ratio better than $3-6/k$
that runs in $O(n^{k/(k-2)-\epsilon})$ time. This is the first known lower
bound with approximation ratio higher than 2 for any distance problem except
for the $ST$-Diameter problem, but unlike in $n$-PSP, the number of vertex
pairs one considers in $ST$-Diameter is much larger than the running time lower
bounds.
</p>
<p>A highlight of our algorithmic results is that one can solve both $n$-PSP and
ANSC in $\tilde O(m+ n^{3/2+\epsilon})$ time with approximation factor
$2+\epsilon$ (and additive error that is function of $\epsilon$), for any
constant $\epsilon&gt;0$. For $n$-PSP, our conditional lower bounds imply that
this approximation ratio is nearly optimal for any subquadratic-time
combinatorial algorithm. We further extend these algorithms for $n$-PSP and
ANSC to obtain a time/accuracy trade-off that includes near-linear time
algorithms.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Thirty years ago, I was in the middle of the second semester of my third year of undergrad, and one of the courses that I was enrolled in was on information theory. I was majoring in computer science, a major that had just been established at Sapienza University when I signed up for it in 1989, <s>organized by a computer science department that had also just been established in 1989</s>. A computer science department was established in 1991.</p>



<p>The new Sapienza computer science department was founded mostly by faculty from the Sapienza mathematics department, plus a number of people that came from other places to help start it. Among the latter, Renato Capocelli had moved to Rome from the University of Salerno, where he had been department chair of computer science.</p>



<p>Capocelli worked on combinatorics and information theory. In the early 90s, he had also become interested in the then-new area of zero-knowledge proofs.</p>



<p>Capocelli taught the information-theory course that I was attending, and it was a very different experience from the classes I had attended up to that point. To get the new major started, several professors were teaching classes outside their area, sticking close to their notes. Those teaching mathematical classes, were experts but were not deviating from the definition-theorem-proof script. Capocelli had an infectious passion for his subject, took his time to make us gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts of information theory, was full of examples and anecdotes, and  always emphasized the high-level idea of the proofs.</p>



<p>I subsequently met several other charismatic and inspiring computer scientists and mathematicians, though Capocelli had a very different personality from most of them. He was like an earlier generation of Southern Italian intellectuals, who could be passionate about their subject in a peculiarly non-nerdy way, loving it the way one may love food, people, nature, or a full life in general.</p>



<p>On April 8, 1992, Renato Capocelli <a href="https://www.di.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/dipartimento/capocelli.pdf">died suddenly and unexpectedly</a>, though his memory lives on in the many people he inspired. The Computer Science department of the University of Salerno was named after him for a period of time.</p></div>

The three major efficiency measures of these primitives are: seed length, number of calls to the one-way function, and adaptivity of these calls. Although a long and successful line of research studied these primitives, their optimal efficiency is not yet fully understood: there are gaps between the known upper bound and the known lower bound for black-box constructions.

Interstingly, the first construction of PRGs by H ?astad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [SICOMP ’99], and the UOWHFs construction by Rompel [STOC ’90] shared a similar structure. Since then, there was an improvement in the efficiency of both constructions: The state of the art construction of PRGs by Haitner, Reingold, and Vadhan [STOC ’10] uses $O(n^4)$ bits of random seed and $O(n^3)$ non-adaptive calls to the one-way function, or alternatively, seed of size $O(n^3)$ with $O(n^3)$ adaptive calls (Vadhan and Zheng [STOC ’12]). Constructing a UOWHF with similar parameters is still an open question. Currently, the best UOWHF construction by Haitner, Holenstein, Reingold, Vadhan, and Wee [Eurocrypt ’10] uses $O(n^{13})$ adaptive calls with a key of size $O(n^5)$.

In this work we give the first non-adaptive construction of UOWHFs from arbitrary one-way functions. Our construction uses $O(n^9)$ calls to the one-way function, and key of length $O(n^{10})$. By the result of Applebaum, Ishai, and Kushilevitz [FOCS ’04], the above implies the existence of UOWHFs in NC0, given the existence of one-way functions in NC1. We also show that the PRG construction of Haitner et al., with small modifications, yields a relaxed notion of UOWHFs. In order to analyze this construction, we introduce the notion of next-bit unreachable entropy, which replaces the next-bit pseudoentropy notion, used in the PRG construction above.</summary>

</p><p><b> A Current Blog </b></p>
<p/><p>
A blog is <b>current</b> provided its last post refers to stuff that happen in late 2021 or 2022. Lewis has a current blog and this one is also current. I like a current one—some blogs are very incurrent indeed. </p>
<p>

    <title>Masks</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Illinois Tech removed the last of their mandatory masking restrictions yesterday. Chicago had zero Covid deaths. Yet I still get messages like this in my twitter feed.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I don't care who you are. If I see you without a mask indoors when infections are rampant and there are many still at risk, I will see you as ignorant of science, narcissistic, and uncaring of the vulnerable around you. I will truly see you unmasked for what you are.</p>— Bill Comeau 🇨🇦🇺🇦 (@Billius27) <a href="https://twitter.com/Billius27/status/1510714029072912390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p/><p>The science is unequivocal for vaccines, which do a good job preventing infection and a strong job saving lives. I just got my second booster on Sunday.</p><p>Masks give you some protection but nothing like the vaccines. It's impossible to completely remove the risk of Covid so people need to make their own choices and tradeoffs. If you are vaccinated your chance of serious illness is tiny, whether or not your wear a mask. And mask wearing is not cost-free.</p><p>I just don't like wearing masks. Wearing a mask bends my ears and is mildly painful. People can't always understand me when I talk through a mask, and they can't read my facial expressions. People and computers don't recognize me in a mask. Masks fog up my glasses. I can't exercise with a mask, it gets wet with sweat and hard to breath. You can't eat or drink wearing a mask.</p><p>Now everyone has their own tolerance and I respect that. I'll wear a mask if someone asks nicely or if it is required, like on public transit and many theaters. If I have a meeting with someone wearing a mask, I'll ask if they would like me to put mine on. In most cases they remove theirs.</p><p>On the other hand, the Chicago Symphony concert I planned to attend tonight was cancelled because the conductor, Riccardo Muti, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/4/4/23010828/riccardo-muti-tests-positive-for-covid-chicago-symphony-orchestra-concert-canceled">tested positive for Covid</a> (with minor symptoms). For my own selfish reasons, I wish he had worn a mask.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d637be8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+1/resize/840x560!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fe9_J_DxUKtnWan4c8MigVZf8vBM%3D%2F0x0%3A4000x2668%2F4000x2668%2Ffilters%3Afocal%282000x1334%3A2001x1335%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F19129683%2FCSO190509_160f_Riccardo_Muti_and_Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra_May_2019.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d637be8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+1/resize/840x560!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fe9_J_DxUKtnWan4c8MigVZf8vBM%3D%2F0x0%3A4000x2668%2F4000x2668%2Ffilters%3Afocal%282000x1334%3A2001x1335%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F19129683%2FCSO190509_160f_Riccardo_Muti_and_Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra_May_2019.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><br/><p><br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>After my <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2021/07/28/chess-com-55-1000/">previous post, </a>a reader (who amazingly has a nearly identical playing routine) pointed me to it.  It’s great!  Much better than chess.com.</p>



<p>“<em>No ads, no subscriptions; but open-source and passion.</em>“</p>



<p>“<em>Are some features reserved to Patrons? No, because Lichess is entirely free, forever, and for everyone. That’s a promise.</em>“</p>



<p>It doesn’t get better than that, in this world; and that’s why I love computers and the community surrounding them.</p>



<p>Another good news is that I got tired of 5 | 5!  The games are just too slow, and my chess isn’t even worth this much of my time.  I am now playing 3 | 2.  It’s fun the adrenaline kick I get with every match.  Also I got much stricter with my routine, and I don’t lose more than once a day.</p>

    <title>TR22-048 |  On the Range Avoidance Problem for Circuits | 

	Hanlin Ren, 

	Rahul Santhanam, 

	Zhikun Wang</title>
    <summary>We consider the range avoidance problem (called Avoid): given the description of a circuit $C:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^\ell$ (where $\ell &gt; n$), find a string $y\in\{0, 1\}^\ell$ that is not in the range of $C$. This problem is complete for the class APEPP that corresponds to explicit constructions of objects whose existence follows from the probabilistic method (Korten, FOCS 2021). 
    
Motivated by applications in explicit constructions and complexity theory, we initiate the study of the range avoidance problem for weak circuit classes, and obtain the following results:
    
    
1. Generalising Williams's connections between circuit-analysis algorithms and circuit lower bounds (J. ACM 2014), we present a framework for solving C-Avoid in $FP^{NP}$ using circuit-analysis data structures for C, for "typical" multi-output circuit classes C. As an application, we present a non-trivial $FP^{NP}$ range avoidance algorithm for De Morgan formulas.
An important technical ingredient is a construction of rectangular PCPs of proximity, building on the rectangular PCPs by Bhangale, Harsha, Paradise, and Tal (FOCS 2020).
        
2. Using the above framework, we show that circuit lower bounds for $E^{NP}$ are equivalent to circuit-analysis algorithms with $E^{NP}$ preprocessing. This is the first equivalence result regarding circuit lower bounds for $E^{NP}$. Our equivalences have the additional advantages that they work in both infinitely-often and almost-everywhere settings, and that they also hold for larger (e.g., subexponential) size bounds.

3. Complementing the above results, we show that in some settings, solving C-Avoid would imply breakthrough lower bounds, even for very weak circuit classes C. In particular, an algorithm for $AC^0$-Avoid with polynomial stretch (i.e., $\ell = poly(n)$) implies lower bounds against $NC^1$, and an algorithm for $NC^0_4$-Avoid with very small stretch (i.e., $\ell = n + n^{o(1)}$) implies lower bounds against $NC^1$ and branching programs.

4. We show that Avoid is in FNP if and only if there is a propositional proof system that breaks every non-uniform proof complexity generator. This result connects the study of range avoidance with fundamental questions in proof complexity.</summary>

    <title>TR22-047 |  Linear Hashing with $\ell_\infty$ guarantees and two-sided Kakeya bounds | 

	Manik Dhar, 

	Zeev Dvir</title>
    <summary>We show that a randomly chosen linear map over a finite field gives a good hash function in the $\ell_\infty$ sense.  More concretely, consider a set $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^n$ and a randomly chosen linear map $L :  \mathbb{F}_q^n \to  \mathbb{F}_q^t$ with $q^t$ taken to be sufficiently smaller than $|S|$. Let $U_S$ denote a random variable distributed uniformly on $S$. Our main theorem shows that, with high probability over the choice of $L$, the random variable  $L(U_S)$ is close to uniform in the $\ell_\infty$ norm.  In other words, every element in the range $\mathbb{F}_q^t$ has about the same number of elements in $S$ mapped to it. This complements the widely-used Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) which proves the analog statement under the statistical, or $\ell_1$, distance  (for a richer class of functions) as well as prior work on the expected largest 'bucket size' in linear hash functions  [ADMPT99].  Our proof leverages a connection between linear hashing and the finite field Kakeya problem and extends some of the tools developed in this area, in particular the polynomial method.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">In <a href="https://francisbach.com/von-neumann-entropy/">last month blog post</a>, I presented the von Neumann entropy. It is defined as a spectral function on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices, and leads to a Bregman divergence called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_relative_entropy">von Neumann relative entropy</a> (or matrix Kullback Leibler divergence), with interesting convexity properties and applications in optimization (mirror descent, or smoothing) and probability (concentration inequalities for matrices). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This month, I will show how the relative entropy relates to usual notions of information theory when applied to specific covariance matrices or covariance operators, with potential applications to all areas where entropy plays a role, and with a simple use of quantum information theory. This post is based on a recent preprint: see all details in [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>], as well as the conclusion section below for several avenues for future work.</p>



<h2>Von Neumann relative entropy between covariance matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider some set \(\mathcal{X}\), with a probability distribution \(p\). We assume given a feature map \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\), from \(\mathcal{X}\) to a \(d\)-dimensional vector space. This naturally defines a (non-centered) <em>covariance matri</em>x $$ \Sigma_{p} = \int_{\mathcal{X}} \varphi(x) \varphi(x)^\top dp(x), $$ which is a \(d \times d\) symmetric PSD matrix. We will assume throughout this post that the set \(\mathcal{X}\) is compact and that the Euclidean norm of \(\varphi\) is bounded on \(\mathcal{X}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given two distributions \(p\) and \(q\), and their associated covariance matrices \(\Sigma_p\) and \(\Sigma_q\), we can compute their von Neumann relative entropy as: $$ D( \Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) = {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma_p ( \log \Sigma_p \, – \log \Sigma_q) \big] – {\rm tr}\big[  \Sigma_p \big] +  {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma_q \big] .$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We immediately get that \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\) is always non-negative, and zero if and only if \(\Sigma_p = \Sigma_q\). This property, that makes it a potentially interesting measure of dissimilarity, is shared among all Bregman divergences on covariance matrices, and has been extensively used in data science (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume10/kulis09a/kulis09a.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/060649021">3</a>]). What makes the von Neumann entropy special?</p>



<p class="justify-text">One important property is that it is jointly convex in \(p\) and \(q\), but this is also shared by other divergences [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>, Appendix A.4]. What really makes the von Neumann entropy special is its explicit link with with information theory.</p>



<h2>Finite sets with orthonormal embeddings</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let’s start with the simplest situation. If \(\mathcal{X}\) is finite with \(d\) elements, and we have an orthonormal embedding, that is, for all \(x,y \in \mathcal{X}\), \(\varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y) = 1_{x = y}\), then, after a transformation by a rotation matrix, we can assume that each \(\varphi(x)\) is one element of the canonical basis, and all covariance matrices are diagonal (without the rotation, we would have that all covariance matrices are jointly diagonalizable), and for probability distributions \(p\) and \(q\), using the same notation for their probability mass functions, we have: $$D( \Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)  = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = D(p \|q ), $$ which is exactly the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leilbler</a> (KL) divergence between the two distributions \(p\) and \(q\) [4].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Can we push this further beyond finite sets and finite-dimensional feature maps, and obtain a link with classical notions from information theory?</p>



<p class="justify-text">A first remark is the invariance by rotation within the feature space (that is, if we replace \(\varphi(x)\) by \(R \varphi(x)\), where \(R\) is an \(d \times d\) orthogonal matrix, the von Neumann entropy does not change), so that it depends only on the dot-product \(k(x,y) = \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\), which is the traditional kernel function. As will see, this opens us the entire area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel machines</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A second remark is that we can go infinite-dimensional, and replace \(\mathbb{R}^d\) by any Hilbert space. This complicates a bit the exposition, and I refer to [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for more formal definitions. In this post, I will shamelessly go infinite-dimensional by using matrices with infinite dimensions when needed.</p>



<h2>Lower-bound on Shannon relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We first upper-bound \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\) by joint convexity of the von Neumann relative entropy (see <a href="https://francisbach.com/von-neumann-entropy/">last post</a>) and Jensen’s inequality: $$ D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) =  D \Big( \int_{\mathcal{X}}\varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top dp(x) \Big\| \int_{\mathcal{X}} \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top dp(x) \Big)$$ $$\ \ \,  \leqslant  \int_{\mathcal{X}} D \Big( \varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top \Big\| \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top \Big) dp(x).$$ The two matrices  \( \varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top\) and \(\frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top \) are proportional to each other, and have \(\varphi(x)\) as the only eigenvector with a potentially non zero eigenvalue, so that we have $$ D \Big( \varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top \Big\| \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top \Big) =  \| \varphi(x) \|^2  \bigg[ \log \Big( \frac{dp}{dq}(x) \Big)  \ – 1 +  \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \bigg].$$ Integrating with respect to \(p\) leads to cancellations: $$  D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \leqslant \int_{\mathcal{X}}\| \varphi(x) \|^2  \log \Big( \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \Big) dp(x) \tag{1}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">If we assume a unit norm bound on all features, that is, \(\| \varphi(x)\| \leqslant 1\) for all \(x \in \mathcal{X}\), we get  $$  D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \leqslant  \int_{\mathcal{X}} \log \Big( \frac{ dp}{dq}(x) \Big) dp(x) = D(p\|q), $$ and thus we have found a lower bound on the regular Shannon relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From relative entropy to entropy. </strong>We can also define a new notion of entropy by considering the relative entropy with respect to the uniform distribution on \(\mathcal{X}\), which we denote \(\tau\). That is, defining \(\Sigma\) the covariance matrix for the uniform distribution, we consider $$ H(\Sigma_p) = \ – D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma),$$ which is thus greater than (with a unit norm bound on all features) $$- \int_{\mathcal{X}}   \log \big( \frac{d p}{d \tau}(x)\big) dp(x),$$ which is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_entropy">differential entropy</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We now look at a few simple examples, and present further properties later (such as a well-defined bound in the other direction). We consider only one-dimensional examples, but the theory extends to all dimensions and all kernels. In particular, finite large sets such as \(\{-1,1\}^d\) can be considered (see [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>]).</p>



<h2>Polynomials and moments</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider \(\mathcal{X} = [-1,1]\) and \(\varphi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{r+1}\) spanning all degree \(r\) polynomials, with \(k(x,y) = \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\). For these examples, \(\Sigma_p\) is composed of all classical moments of order up to \(2r\). </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Regular polynomial kernel. </strong>Following traditional kernel methods, we can first consider \(\displaystyle k(x,y) = \frac{1}{2^r} ( 1 + xy)^r\), which corresponds to $$\varphi(x)_j =  \frac{1}{2^{r/2}} {{ r \choose j}\!\!}^{1/2} x^j,$$ for \(j \in \{0,\dots,r\}\). We also have \(\sup_{ x\in \mathcal{X} } k(x,x) = 1\), which allows for the Shannon relative entropy upper-bound. Let us consider two distributions \(p\) and \(q\) on \([-1,1]\), and understand if letting \(r\) go to infinity leads to a good estimation of the Shannon relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, we consider the distribution \(p\) with density \(\frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{1-x^2}\) (this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta distribution</a>  affinely rescaled to \([-1,1]\) instead of \([0,1]\)), plotted below, and \(q\) the uniform distribution, with density \(1/2\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6964" height="181" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/density.png" width="290"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">All moments are available in closed form (see end of post), and the Shannon relative entropy is equal to \(D(p\|q) = \int_{-1}^1 \! \frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{1-x^2} \log \frac{4}{\pi} \sqrt{1-x^2} dx \approx 0.0484\). We can then compute for various values of \(r\), \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\), which is plotted below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6937" height="269" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/reg_pol_kernel-2.png" width="289"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We should hope that the approximation improves as we use more monomials, but this is not the case. As common in kernel methods, the standard polynomial kernel does not have a good behavior. This is partly due to the fact that \(k(x,x) = \big( \frac{1+x^2}{2} \big)^r\) is far from uniform on \([-1,1]\).</p>



<p>Let’s now consider a better polynomial kernel.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Christofell-Darboux kernels. </strong>Other polynomial bases could be used as well beyond \(1, X, \dots, X^r\), in particular any basis of polynomials with increasing degrees \(P_0, \dots, P_r\) can be used, in particular polynomials that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal</a> with respect to a probability distribution on \([-1,1]\), with $$ \varphi(x)_j = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_r}} P_j(x) \mbox{ and } k(x,y) = \frac{1}{\alpha_r} \sum_{j=0}^r P_j(x) P_j(y),$$ where \(\alpha_r\) is here to ensure that \(k(x,x) \leqslant 1\) on \([-1,1]\). The kernel function \(k(x,y)\) has then itself a simple expression through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel%E2%80%93Darboux_formula">Christoffel–Darboux formula</a>, as $$ k(x,y) \propto   \frac{P_r(x)P_{r+1}(y)-P_r(y)P_{r+1}(x)}{x-y},$$ with an explicit proportionality constant. For more details on these kernels and their application to data analysis, see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01845137v3/document">5</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, for <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">Chebyshev polynomials</a>, which are orthonormal with respect to the probability measure with density \(\big(\pi \sqrt{1-x^2}\big)^{-1}\) on \([-1,1]\), we have \(P_0 = 1\), \(P_1 =  \sqrt{2} X\), and \(P_2 = \sqrt{2}( 2X^2 – 1) \), and more generally, for \(k&gt;0\), \(P_k(\cos \theta) = \sqrt{2}\cos k\theta\). One can then check that for \(x = \cos \theta\) and \(y = \cos \eta\), we have $$k(x,y) = \frac{1}{2} \Big( \frac{ \sin ( 2r+1)( \theta-\eta)/2}{\sin ( \theta-\eta)/2} + \frac{ \sin ( 2r+1)( \theta+\eta)/2}{\sin ( \theta+\eta)/2}  \Big).$$ Moreover, we can check that $$ \sup_{x \in \, [-1,1]} k(x,x) = 2r+1, $$ leading to \(\alpha_r = 2r+1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"> </p>



<p class="justify-text">As shown below, after computing (still in closed form, see end of the post) \(\Sigma_p\) and \(\Sigma_q\), we can plot the relative entropy, and compare it to the true one. This leads to an improved estimation.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6936" height="273" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cheb_pol_kernel-2.png" width="293"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This is better, but still not quite there, and we get in fact convergence to exactly one half of the true relative entropy. The motivated reader will check that the limit of \(k(x,x)\) when \(r \) tends to infinity is \(1/2\) for all \(x \in (-1,1)\), and \(1\), for \(x \in \{-1,1\}\) (that is, the upper-bound of \(1\) is valid, but it is almost surely equal to \(1/2\)). This is where we lose the factor of \(1/2\) in Eq. (1) above.</p>



<p class="justify-text">One key overall insight is that the span of the feature space is not the only important aspect in the approximation, and that some rescalings are better than others (more on this below when optimize with respect to the chosen basis). Given that we end up estimating entropies from moments, it would be clearly interesting to compare with other ways of estimating entropies from moments, such as using asymptotic expansions based on Edgeworth expansions [8].</p>



<h2>Fourier series and translation-invariant kernels</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We still consider \(\mathcal{X} = [-1,1]\). For a \(2\)-periodic function \(q: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\), such that \(q(0) = 1\), with Fourier series \(\hat{q}: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{C}\), we can consider $$k(x,y) = q(x-y) = \sum_{\omega \in \mathcal{Z}} \hat{q}(\omega) e^{i\pi \omega(x-y)}.$$ We can for example take $$q(x) = \frac{\sin ( 2r+1) \pi x/2}{(2r+1)\sin \pi x/2} $$ which corresponds to \(\hat{q}(\omega) = \frac{1}{2r+1} 1_{|\omega| \leqslant r}\), and having $$ \varphi(x)_\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2r+1}} e^{ i\pi \omega x } $$ for \(\omega \in \{-r-1,\dots,r+1\}\) (we consider complex-valued features for simplicity). We refer to this kernel as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_kernel">Dirichlet kernel</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Link with eigenvalues of Toeplitz matrices.</strong> For the specific choice of the Dirichlet kernel, the element of the covariance matrix indexed by \(\omega\) and \(\omega’\) has value \(\int_{-1}^1 e^{i\pi (\omega-\omega’)} dp(x)\), which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_function_(probability_theory)">characteristic function</a> of \(p\) evaluated at \(\pi(\omega-\omega’)\). One consequence is that \(\Sigma_p\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix">Toeplitz matrix</a> with constant values across all diagonals. It is then well-known that as \(m\) goes to infinity, the eigenvalues of \(\Sigma_p\) are tending in distribution to \(p\) (see [<a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~gray/CIT006-journal.pdf">10</a>]), which provides another proof of good estimation of the entropy in this very particular case.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that we could also consider an infinite-dimensional kernel \(q(x) =\Big( 1+ \frac{\sin^2 \pi x/2}{\sinh^2 \sigma}\Big)^{-1}\) which corresponds to \( \hat{q}(\omega) \propto e^{-2\sigma |\omega|}\), where the link with Toeplitz matrices does not apply. See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Increasing number of frequencies. </strong>We can then plot the estimation of the same relative entropy as for polynomial kernels, as the number of frequency grows (we can still get the Fourier moments in closed form, see end of post).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6944" height="283" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dirichlet_kernel-1.png" width="305"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We now see that as the dimension of the feature space grows, we get a perfect estimation of the relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">This estimation is provably from below, but how far is it? How big \(r\) needs to be? </p>



<h2>Upper-bound trough quantum information theory</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to find a lower-bound \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\), we cannot rely on Jensen’s inequality, as it is in the wrong direction (this happens a lot!). But here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information">quantum information theory</a> can come to the rescue. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Using the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) associated to the uniform distribution \(\tau\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), we consider the PSD matrices \(D(y)\), indexed by \(y \in \mathcal{X}\), equal to $$D(y) = \Sigma^{-1/2} \varphi(y) \varphi(y)^\top \Sigma^{-1/2},$$ for which we have $$\int_{\mathcal{X}} D(y) d\tau(y) =\Sigma^{-1/2} \Big( \int_{\mathcal{X}}  \varphi(y) \varphi(y)^\top d\tau(y)\Big)\Sigma^{-1/2} =   I. $$ We can now consider, in quantum information theory terms, that each \(D(y)\) corresponds to a measurement that can be applied to a density operator, and that we look at measures obtained from \(p\), as \(\tilde{p}(y) = {\rm tr } ( D(y) \Sigma_p)\), and from \(q\) as \(\tilde{q}(y) = {\rm tr } ( D(y) \Sigma_q)\). This is a proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_operation">quantum operation</a> because the matrices \(D(y)\) are PSD and sum to identity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The monotonicity of the von Neumann entropy with respect to quantum operations [9] applies, and we immediately get $$D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \geqslant \int_{\mathcal{X}} \tilde{p}(y) \log \frac{ \tilde{p}(y)}{\tilde{q}(y)} d\tau(y).$$ The lower-bound can be seen as the Shannon relative entropy \(D( \tilde{p} \| \tilde{q} )\) between the distributions with density \(\tilde{p}\) and \(\tilde{q}\) with respect to \(\tau\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">These densities have direct relationships with \(p\) and \(q\). Indeed,  we have $$\tilde{p}(y) = {\rm tr } ( D(y) \Sigma_p) = \int_{\mathcal{X}} \big( \varphi(x)^\top \Sigma^{-1/2} \varphi(y) \big)^2 dp(x).$$ Denoting $$h(x,y) = \big( \varphi(x)^\top \Sigma_\tau^{-1/2} \varphi(y) \big)^2,$$ we have \(\int_{\mathcal{X}} h(x,y) d\tau(x) = \| \varphi(y)\|^2\) for all \(y \in \mathcal{X}\), and thus, when the features have unit norms, we can consider \(h\) as a smoothing kernel, and thus \(\tilde{p}\) and \(\tilde{q}\) as smoothed versions of \(p\) and \(q\). Thus, overall we have: $$D(\tilde{p} \| \tilde{q}) \leqslant D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)  \leqslant D(p\|q),$$ and we have sandwitched the kernel relative entropy by Shannon relative entropies.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then characterize the error made in estimating the relative entropy by measuring how the smoothing kernel \(h(x,y)\) differs from a Dirac. In  [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>, Section 4.2], I show how, for metric spaces, the difference between \(D(\tilde{p} \| \tilde{q})\) and \(D({p} \|{q}) \), and thus between \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\) and \(D(\tilde{p} \| \tilde{q})\), is upperbounded by an explicit function of \(p\) and \(q\), times $$ \sup_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} h(x,y) d(x,y)^2 d\tau(y),$$ which is indeed small when \(h(x,y)\) is closed to a Dirac.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the Dirichlet kernel presented above, we can show that $$h(x,y) = \frac{1}{4r+2} \bigg( \frac{\sin ( 2r+1) \pi (x-y)/2}{\sin \pi (x-y)/2}\bigg)^2,$$ and that the quantity above characterizing convergence scales as \(1 / (2r+1)\), thus providing an explicit convergence rate. As an illustration, we plot the smoothing kernel at \(y=0\), that is, \(h(x,0)\) in regular scale (left) and log-scale (right), for the Dirichlet kernel above (for which we have unit norm features) for various values of \(r\). We see how it converges to a Dirac as \(r\) grows.</p>

<h2>Estimation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Above, we have relied on finite-dimensional feature maps and explicit expectations under \(p\) and \(q\). This is clearly not scalable to generic situations and potentially infinite-dimensional feature spaces. But we can rely here on 30 years of progress in kernel methods.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For simplicity here, we will only estimate the von Neumann entropy \({\rm tr}\big[ \Sigma_p \log \Sigma_p \big]\) from \(n\) independent and identically distributed samples. The natural estimator is \({\rm tr}\big[ \hat{\Sigma}_p \log \hat{\Sigma} _p \big]\), where \(\hat{\Sigma}_p\) and \(\hat{\Sigma}_q\) are empirical covariance matrices (the averages of \(\varphi(x_i) \varphi(x_i)^\top\) over all data points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to compute it efficiently, we can use the usual kernel trick, exactly as used within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_principal_component_analysis">kernel principal component analysis</a>, and if \(K\) is the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix associated with the \(n\) data points, then the eigenvalues of \(\frac{1}{n} K\) and \(\hat{\Sigma}_p\) are the same, and thus $$  {\rm tr}\big[ \hat{\Sigma}_p \log \hat{\Sigma} _p \big] =  {\rm tr}\big[ \big(\frac{1}{n}K  \big)\log \big( \frac{1}{n} K \big)  \big].$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">In terms of statistical analysis, we refer to [1] where it is shown that the difference between the estimate and the true value is of order \(C / \sqrt{n}\), with an explicit constant \(C\), for a wide range of kernels. Surprisingly, there is no need to add any form of regularization.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Entropy estimation. </strong>Together with the approximation result presented above, by letting \(r\) go to infinity for the Dirichlet kernel, we get an estimator of the regular Shannon entropy which is not that bad (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02141">7</a>] for an optimal one).</p>



<h2>Learning representations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As mentioned above for polynomials, a key question is how to choose a feature map \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\). Given that we have a lower-bound on the relative entropy, it is tempting to try to <em>maximize</em> this lower bound, subject to \(\forall x \in \mathcal{X}\), \(\| \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\|^2 \leqslant 1\). The magic is that this is a tractable optimization problem (concave maximization with convex constraints) in the kernel function \((x,y) \mapsto \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\). This is not an obvious result (in fact, I first tried to prove that the von Neumann relative entropy was convex in the kernel, while it is in fact concave). See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for the concavity proofs and simple optimization algorithms.</p>



<h2>Duality and log-partition functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given that our kernel notions of relative entropies are lower bounds on the regular notions, by the traditional convex duality results between maximum entropy and log-partition functions (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/DownloadSummary/MAL-001">11</a>]), we should obtain upper-bounds on log-partition functions. This is exactly what we can get, we simply provide the gist here and refer to [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for further details. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Given a probability distribution \(q\) on \(\mathcal{X}\) and a function \(f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\), the log-partition function is defined as $$a(f) = \log \bigg( \int_{\mathcal{X}} e^{f(x)} dq(x)\bigg) \tag{2}.$$ It plays a crucial role in probabilistic and statistical inference, and obtaining upper-bounds is instrumental in deriving approximate inference algorithms [11]. A classical convex duality result shows a link with the Shannon relative entropy, as we can express \(a(f)\) as $$a(f) = \sup_{ p\  {\rm probability} \ {\rm measure}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x) \ – D( p \| q).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Assuming that all features have unit norm, we have \(D(p \|q) \geqslant D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\), and thus $$ a(f) \leqslant \sup_{ p \ {\rm probability} \ {\rm measure}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x)\  – D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q),$$ which is itself smaller than the supremum over all signed measures with unit mass (thus removing the non-negativity constraint). Therefore, $$ a(f) \leqslant \sup_{ p \ {\rm measure}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x)\  – D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \tag{3},$$ which can be made computationally tractable in a number of cases.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I tried to exhibit a new link between kernels and information theory, which mostly relies on the convexity properties of von Neumann entropy and a bit of quantum analysis. Clearly, the practical relevance of this link remains to be established, but it opens tractable information theory tools to all types of data on which positive kernels can be defined (essentially all of them), with many potential avenues for future work.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Multivariate modelling.</strong> Regular entropies and relative entropies are used extensively in data science, such as for variational inference, but also to characterize various forms of statistical dependences between random variable. It turns out that the new kernel notions allow for this as well, connecting with a classical line of work within kernel methods [<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bach02a/bach02a.pdf">12</a>, <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/sriperumbudur10a/sriperumbudur10a.pdf">13</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Other divergences.</strong> I have focused primarily on the link with Shannon relative entropies, but most of the results extend to all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence">\(f\)-divergences</a>. For example, we can get kernel-based lower bounds on the square <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellinger_distance">Hellinger distance</a>, or the \(\chi^2\)-divergences.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kernel sum-of-squares with a probabilistic twist.</strong> As a final note, there is a link between the new notions of kernel entropies with global optimization with <a href="https://francisbach.com/finding-global-minima-with-kernel-approximations/">kernel sum-of-squares</a> [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11978">14</a>]. Indeed, in Eq. (2), if we add a temperature parameter \(\varepsilon\) and define $$a_\varepsilon(f) =\varepsilon  \log \bigg( \int_{\mathcal{X}} e^{f(x) / \varepsilon} dq(x) \bigg), $$ then when \(\varepsilon\) tends to zero, \(a_\varepsilon(f) \) tends to \(\sup_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\). The lower bound from Eq. (3) then becomes $$\sup_{ p \ {\rm measure}}  \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x) \ – \varepsilon D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q),$$ which exactly tends to the sum-of-squares relaxation for the optimization problem. Given that for global optimization, smoothness can be leveraged to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we can imagine something similar for log-partition functions and entropies.</p>

    <title>TR22-044 |  An Optimal Algorithm for Certifying Monotone Functions | 

	Meghal Gupta, 

	Naren Manoj</title>
    <summary>Given query access to a monotone function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ with certificate complexity $C(f)$ and an input $x^{\star}$, we design an algorithm that outputs a size-$C(f)$ subset of $x^{\star}$ certifying the value of $f(x^{\star})$. Our algorithm makes $O(C(f) \cdot \log n)$ queries to $f$, which matches the information-theoretic lower bound for this problem and resolves the concrete open question posed in the STOC '22 paper of Blanc, Koch, Lange, and Tan [BKLT22].

We extend this result to an algorithm that finds a size-$2C(f)$ certificate for a real-valued monotone function with $O(C(f) \cdot \log n)$ queries. We also complement our algorithms with a hardness result, in which we show that finding the shortest possible certificate in $x^{\star}$ may require $\Omega\left(\binom{n}{C(f)}\right)$ queries in the worst case.</summary>

    <title>Dissection into rectangles and tensor rank</title>
    <summary>It’s easy to cut a Greek cross into pieces that can be reassembled into a rectangle:</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It’s easy to cut a Greek cross into pieces that can be reassembled into a rectangle:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Dissection of a Grek cross to a 4x5 rectangle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/cross2rect.svg" width="60%"/></p>

<p>Here’s another example. The three yellow rectangles below have dimensions <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(2^{2/3}\times 1\),</span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(2^{1/3}\times 2^{1/3}\),</span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">and \(1\times 2^{2/3}\).</span> (The order of multiplication matters here!) Put them together, and you get the blue stealth aircraft shape. Can you cut this shape into pieces and reassemble them into a single rectangle?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Union of three irrational rectangles" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/trirect.svg" width="80%"/></p>

<p>The answer is yes; any polygon can be cut and reassembled into a rectangle, or into any other polygon of the same area. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace%E2%80%93Bolyai%E2%80%93Gerwien_theorem">Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem</a>. But the Greek cross dissection above uses only axis-parallel cuts and translation of the pieces. To get a single rectangle from the stealth shape, you’re going to need a more general class of operations that cut it at odd angles and rotate the pieces. It’s impossible to make a rectangle from this shape using only axis-parallel cuts and translation. And even for the Greek cross, although you can make a rectangle as shown, it’s impossible to make a square using only axis-parallel cuts and translation.</p>

<p>To see why, we need to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_invariant">Dehn invariant</a>. As usually defined, this is a value that can be determined for any three-dimensional polyhedron. It’s called an invariant because it stays unchanged when you cut up the polyhedron into polyhedral parts and reassemble the pieces into something else, allowing odd-angled cuts and rotations. In order for one polyhedron to have a dissection into another, they must both have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant. This can be used to show, for instance, that you cannot dissect a regular tetrahedron into a cube. But as several authors have described, a version of the same method also applies to axis-parallel dissections of orthogonal <span style="white-space: nowrap;">polygons.<sup id="fnref:s"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/04/03/dissection-into-rectangles.html#fn:s" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:b"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/04/03/dissection-into-rectangles.html#fn:b" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></span></p>

<p>To evaluate the Dehn invariant of an orthogonal polygon, the first step is to represent the polygon in Cartesian coordinates, and to find a <em>rational basis</em> for its coordinates, a system of numbers such that every coordinate has a unique representation as a linear combination of basis elements with rational-number coefficients. This is just a basis, in the usual meaning of the word from linear algebra, when we interpret the real numbers as being a vector space over the rational numbers. In the example of the stealth shape, we can use the same basis for both the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(x\)- and</span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(y\)-coordinates,</span> the set of numbers <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\{1,2^{1/3},2^{2/3}\}\).</span> The choice of basis is arbitrary (as long as it can represent all coordinates, without any redundancy) and will affect the rest of the calculation but not the conclusions we draw from it. If we’re comparing two shapes, we can use a common basis that can represent the coordinates from both; it won’t hurt if some of the basis elements are only used for one of the two shapes. So for instance, if the Greek cross is made out of unit squares, the square we’d like to dissect it into has side length \(\sqrt5\) and we can use the basis \(\{1,\sqrt 5\}\) to compare the cross to the square.</p>

<p>Next, we decompose the given shape into rectangles through its vertices (like the yellow rectangles that we’ve already used to decompose the stealth shape). Express the width and height of each rectangle as a rational combination of basis elements; in our example, each rectangle is just a product of two basis elements, but sometimes more complex combinations might be required. If we multiply the expression for the width of a rectangle by the expression for the height of a rectangle, we get an expression for the area of the whole rectangle as a sum of terms \(a\cdot b_x\cdot b_y\) where \(a\) is a rational number and \(b_x\) and \(b_y\) are <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(x\)-basis</span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(y\)-basis</span> elements, respectively. Adding these expressions for every rectangle in the decomposition gives a similar expression for the area of the whole shape. Since we’re separating out the terms for each product of basis elements, it’s convenient to write it out as a matrix. For the Greek cross and same-area square, with the basis \(\{1,\sqrt 5\}\) for both <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(x\) and \(y\),</span> we get the matrices</p>

\[\begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \qquad\text{and}\qquad
\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix},\]

<p>respectively. For the stealth shape, with the basis \(\{1,2^{1/3},2^{2/3}\}\) for both <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(x\) and \(y\),</span> we get the matrix</p>

\[\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]

<p>That’s the Dehn invariant! Because the Greek cross and square have different invariants, they cannot be dissected into each other (for this restricted axis-parallel translation-only form of dissection). But what about the dissection of the stealth shape into a single rectangle? How can we apply this analysis when there are infinitely many possible rectangles to try?</p>

<p>Here it’s convenient to move from the notion of bases and matrices to a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate-free">coordinate-free</a> formulation of the same thing using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_(intrinsic_definition)">abstract tensors</a>. When we’re expressing the area of an \(x\times y\) rectangle as a product of rational linear combinations of basis elements, what we’re really doing is constructing the element \(x\otimes y\) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product">tensor product</a> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\mathbb{R}\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{R}\).</span> Then when we add the expressions arising from the decomposition into rectangles, to form a matrix describing the whole shape, this is just addition of these elements within the tensor product. The subscript \(\mathbb{Q}\) in the tensor notation corresponds to the fact that we’re interpreting real numbers as forming a vector space over the field \(\mathbb{Q}\) of rational numbers. (Some sources use a subscript \(\mathbb{Z}\) but this is not an important difference here.)</p>

<p>One thing we know about matrices is that they have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)">rank</a>, the dimension of the vector space generated by their rows or columns. But tensors also have a notion of rank. The rank of a tensor is the minimum number of terms needed to express it as a sum of products</p>

\[x_1\otimes y_1+x_2\otimes y_2+\cdots,\]

<p>where the \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) can be any elements of the spaces that are being tensored together (they are not required to be basis elements). For tensor products of three or more spaces, the rank is still defined in the same way, but it can get very tricky to calculate. This is a big part about why the time bounds for fast matrix multiplication are still so mysterious: they involve tensors of order three. But for the order-two tensor space \(\mathbb{R}\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{R}\), we’re saved by linear algebra: the rank of a tensor of order two is just the rank of a matrix representing it, for any basis over the appropriate field <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(here \(\mathbb{Q}\)).</span></p>

<p>Suppose that we could dissect a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">polygon \(P\),</span> using axis-parallel cuts and translations, into a collection of \(k\) rectangles. Then the sum of the tensor expressions for those rectangles would be an expression of the Dehn invariant <span style="white-space: nowrap;">of \(P\),</span> as a sum of \(k\) products. Therefore, the rank of the Dehn invariant of \(P\) would have to be at <span style="white-space: nowrap;">most \(k\).</span> But for our stealth shape, we know the rank: we have expressed its Dehn invariant as a matrix of rank three. Therefore, to dissect it into rectangles, we need at least three rectangles.</p>

<p>Another use of the polyhedral Dehn invariant, besides dissection of one shape into another, involves tiling. Any polyhedron that tiles space must have Dehn invariant zero, and any polyhedron with Dehn invariant zero can be dissected into a different polyhedron that tiles space. For the axis-parallel polygonal Dehn invariant we’re looking at here, things don’t work out quite so neatly. The Greek cross can tile, but has nonzero Dehn invariant. More, any axis-parallel polygon can be cut into multiple rectangles, and these can tile space aperiodically by grouping them into rows of the same type of rectangle.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Aperiodic tiling by three irrational rectangles" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/trirect-row-tiling.svg" width="65%"/></p>

<p>So the Dehn invariant cannot be used to prove that such a thing is impossible, because it is always possible. If we could rotate pieces, we could also form these three rectangles into a single-piece axis-parallel hexagon that can tile the plane:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Periodic tiling by a hexagon formed from three irrational rectangles" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/trirect-flip-tiling.svg" width="80%"/></p>

<p>But this is not possible without rotation. Every periodic tiling of the plane has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_domain">fundamental region</a> in the shape of an axis-parallel hexagon, like the hexagons in this periodic tiling.  If one or more copies of a polygon could be cut up by axis-parallel cuts and reassembled by translations to form a single polygon that can tile the plane periodically, it would also be possible to dissect copies of the polygon (possibly a larger number of copies of it) into an axis-parallel hexagon. But these hexagons have a Dehn invariant with rank at most two (they can be cut into two rectangles), while any number of copies of our stealth shape combine to have rank three (making more copies just multiplies the matrix by a scalar). Because the Dehn invariants have different ranks, no dissection is possible.</p>

<p>This same rank analysis can also be applied to the more familiar polyhedral form of the Dehn invariant. For that form, a polyhedron whose Dehn invariant has high rank cannot be dissected into another polyhedron with fewer edges than the rank.</p>

<p>A brief summary: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17207">In the paper, A proof of the Kahn-Kalai conjecture,</a> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jinyoungpark">Jinyoung Park</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~huypham/">Huy Tuan Pham</a> proved the 2006 expectation threshold conjecture posed by Jeff Kahn and me. The proof is wonderful. Congratulations Jinyoung and Huy Tuan!</p>
<p>The 2006 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0603218">expectation threshold conjecture</a> gives a justification for a naive way to estimate the threshold probability of a random graph property. Suppose that you are asked about the critical probability for a random graph in G(n,p) for having a perfect matching (or a Hamiltonian cycle). You compute the expected number of perfect matchings and realize that when p is C/n this expected number equals 1/2. (For Hamiltonian cycles it will be C’/n.) Of course, if the expectation is one half, the probability for a perfect matching can still be very low; indeed, in this case, an isolated vertex is quite likely but when there is no isolated vertices the expected number of perfect matchings is rather large. Our 2006 conjecture boldly asserts that the gap between the value given by such a naive computation and the true threshold value is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. Jeff and I tried hard to find a counterexample but instead we managed to find more general and stronger forms of the conjecture that we could not disprove.</p>
<p>Two years ago Keith Frankston, Jeff Kahn, Bhargav Narayanan, and Jinyoung Park proved a weak form of the conjecture which was proposed in a 2010 paper by Michel Talagrand. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/30/amazing-keith-frankston-jeff-kahn-bhargav-narayanan-jinyoung-park-thresholds-versus-fractional-expectation-thresholds/">this post</a>.) Indeed, the expectation threshold conjecture had some connections with a 1995 paper of Michel Talagrand entitled <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-0348-9090-8_25">Are all sets of positive measure essentially convex?</a> In a 2010 STOC paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.6973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Are Many Small Sets Explicitly Small?</a> Michel formulated a whole array of interesting conjectures and commented that he feels that these conjectures are related to the expectation threshold conjecture to which he offered a weaker fractional version. This weak version suffices for various applications of the original conjecture. Keith, Jeff, Bhargav, and Jinyoung’s work built on the breakthrough work of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang on the Erdős-Rado ‘sunflower’ conjecture. </p>
<p>Proving the full expectation threshold conjecture looked like a  difficult task. The only path that people saw was to try to relate Talagrand’s fractional expectation threshold with our expectation threshold. (Indeed Talagrand also conjectured that they only differ by a multiplicative constant factor. This looked if true very difficult to prove.)  However this is not the path taken by Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham and they found a direct simple argument! Jinyoung and Huy Tuan also used their method to settle one of the central conjectures (Conj 5.7) from <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.6973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Talagrand’s paper</a> and this will be presented in a forthcoming paper.</p>
<p>The <em>logn</em> gap in our conjecture looked rather narrow but now that it was proved we can ask for conditions that will guarantee a smaller gap. For example, when is the gap only a constant?</p>
<p>Here is a nice IAS video on Jinyoung Park’s path to math.</p>

    <title>TR22-043 |  Polynomial Bounds On Parallel Repetition For All 3-Player Games With Binary Inputs | 

	Kunal Mittal, 

	Wei Zhan, 

	Uma Girish, 

	Ran Raz</title>
    <summary>We prove that for every 3-player (3-prover) game $\mathcal G$ with value less than one, whose query distribution has the support $\mathcal S = \{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\}$ of hamming weight one vectors, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ decays polynomially fast to zero; that is, there is a constant $c = c(\mathcal  G)&gt;0$ such that the value of the game $\mathcal  G^{\otimes n}$ is at most $n^{-c}$.
	
Following the recent work of Girish, Holmgren, Mittal, Raz and Zhan (STOC 2022), our result is the missing piece that implies a similar bound for a much more general class of multiplayer games: For $\textbf{every}$ 3-player game $\mathcal G$ over $\textit{binary questions}$ and $\textit{arbitrary answer lengths}$, with value less than 1, there is a constant $c = c(\mathcal G)&gt;0$ such that the value of the game $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ is at most $n^{-c}$.
	
Our proof technique is new and requires many new ideas. For example, we make use of the Level-$k$ inequalities from Boolean Fourier Analysis, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been explored in this context prior to our work.</summary>

<p>
Mr. Apollinax might have made a good escort for Lofa Polir, had she lived a hundred years ago. The titular character of a <a href="https://interestingliterature.com/2017/09/a-short-analysis-of-t-s-eliots-mr-apollinax/">poem</a> written circa 1915 by Thomas Eliot was based on Bertrand Russell, whose 1901 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox">paradox</a> revealed a gaping inconsistency in set theory as it was then known. Russell spent much of the intervening years trying to repair the gap via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory#History">type theory</a>.</p>
<p>
Today we present a recently-discovered inconsistency in the type theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a> programming language, which forced a feature-chopping <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/dropped-features/type-projection.html">revision</a> in its new version <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2021/05/14/scala3-is-here.html">3.0</a>. Then, in a worldwide exclusive, we reveal a new theorem by Polir that explains why such inconsistencies are <em>inevitable</em>.</p>
<p>
Ernst Zermelo had already noticed the paradox in 1899 but brushed it off because his axiom system already evaded it. It is possible that Georg Cantor knew it in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BtZM33PzV9UC&amp;pg=PA923&amp;lpg=PA923&amp;dq=Cantor+letter+to+Dedekind+and+Hilbert+about+inconsistency&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hE28iI4IT4&amp;sig=ACfU3U2CMPDUFBheRaXGQcIMFngE-Iytdg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1j-7ej_T2AhXJY98KHd7WDuUQ6AF6BAgOEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Cantor letter to Dedekind and Hilbert about inconsistency&amp;f=false">letters</a> in 1897 to Richard Dedekind and David Hilbert. I could call this a continuation of a theme we’ve often addressed about discoveries not being named for their first discoverers, but I will not, for this reason: The discover<b>ee</b> was Gottlob Frege, who immediately recognized that the treatise on set theory he was about to publish had been devastated by the paradox. And the person he heard that from, in June 1902, was Russell—not any of his own compatriots.</p>
<p>
The poem comes with an epigram from a Greek text by Lucian satirically praising the painter Zeuxis of Herakleia: “Ω τῆς καινότητος. Ἡράκλεις, τῆς παραδοξολογίας. εὐμήχανος ἄνθρωπος.”  The reference <a href="https://genius.com/annotations/3603099/standalone_embed">translation</a> Eliot had to hand goes: “Such novelty! Heavens, what paradoxes! How inventive he is!”  I believe, however, that Eliot intended a more-particulate reading: “Oh for his innovation! Hercules, his paradoxology! Sweet machine man!”  That goes better with the poem <a href="https://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/content/mr-apollinax">text</a> and with aspects of Russell that were visible to Eliot at the time.  We’ll only talk about the <i>paradoxology</i>.  Russell was well aware that other monsters besides his own were lurking, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene-Rosser_paradox">ones</a> that emerged in the US.  What if patching paradoxes is just the way of progress?  Let’s see this play out in the Scala programming language.</p>
<p/><h2> The Inconsistency </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The root of the inconsistency is allowing <em>projection</em> of an <em>abstract</em> type. Let’s explain the former concept with concrete types first. A standard way to represent trees and other graphs is by having a nested node class, for instance:</p>
<p><code><br/>
class BinaryTree[A &lt;: Comparable[A]] {</code></p>
<p>   class Node(var left: Node, var item: A, var right: Node)</p>
<p>   private var root: Node = null<br/>
   //etc.<br/>
}<br/>
</p>
<p>
A key wrinkle of Scala is that if you have two different trees <font size="+1"><tt>T1</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>T2</tt></font>, then <font size="+1"><tt>T1.Node</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>T2.Node</tt></font> are separate types. This notion of <em>path-dependent types</em> enables the compiler to catch bugs where you might try to connect a node on one tree as a child of a node in the other tree. If there were just one <font size="+1"><tt>BinaryTree.Node</tt></font> type, as is standard in Java for instance, then you could easily make this kind of bug and the compiler would not bat an eye.</p>
<p>
If you really do want to combine nodes from two different trees, however, you can do so via code using the projection type <font size="+1"><tt>BinaryTree#Node</tt></font>. The hash sign # makes this defined to be the <i>supertype</i> of nodes of all possible binary trees. </p>
<p>
The <font size="+1"><tt>[A &lt;: Comparable[A]]</tt></font> part means that the tree can hold any type <font size="+1"><tt>A</tt></font> of data that extends a <font size="+1"><tt>trait</tt></font> called <font size="+1"><tt>Comparable</tt></font>, whose function is to mandate having a comparison function for <font size="+1"><tt>A</tt></font> so that the tree can be kept sorted. The symbol <font size="+1"><tt>&gt;:</tt></font> written the other way means supertype rather than subtype.</p>
<p>
We could try to make our binary tree class more versatile by making it more abstract. By itself it could be a <font size="+1"><tt>trait</tt></font> so as to allow deferred implementations. It could try to define a more general notion of <font size="+1"><tt>Node</tt></font> that might relate more directly to stored data, for instance strings or numbers. This is not to say such abstractions are necessarily well-motivated, but the point is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Scala compiler defines what is workable. <p/>
</li><li>
Its notion of workability is based on mathematical type theory. <p/>
</li><li>
Lots of abstract constructions are made workable to encourage creativity.
</li></ul>
<p>
Workability is not supposed to lead to type errors, however. That is the unsoundness allowed in versions 2.x of Scala.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Code </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
If you have a lot of time—time to read the longest <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2013/11/15/the-graph-of-math/">post</a> ever on this blog—then you can draw some motivation for the unsound code. That post shows how to represent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann-Bernays-Godel_set_theory">NBG</a> version of set theory, due to John von Neuman, Paul Bernays, and Kurt Gödel, as an infinite graph. At the top of the graph are nodes representing the class of all sets and various other expansive types, which are symbolized by <font size="+1"><tt>V</tt></font> in the post. At the bottom is a node for the null set identified with <font size="+1"><tt>O</tt></font>. We can think of them as representing “zones” for possible supertypes and subtypes of some types of interest, such as string and number. </p>
<p>
Aside from some abstract manipulation of types, the following code does nothing except compose two versions of the identity function, applied to a <font size="+1"><tt>String</tt></font>. As you are welcome to try yourself, it compiles in Scala 2.x. But before you try to run it, you can ask yourself: exactly what number would the string “Hello World!” become?</p>
<p>
<code><br/>
/** File "Unsound.scala", mod by KWR from the last example in<br/>
    <a href="https://lptk.github.io/programming/2019/09/13/type-projection.html" rel="nofollow">https://lptk.github.io/programming/2019/09/13/type-projection.html</a><br/>
 */<br/>
object Unsound extends App {</code></p>
<p>   trait VZone { type Node &gt;: String }<br/>
   trait OZone { type Node &lt;: Double }</p>
<p>   def liftup[A &lt;: VZone]: String =&gt; A#Node<br/>
      = (x =&gt; x)<br/>
   def godown[A &lt;: OZone]: A#Node =&gt; Double<br/>
      = (x =&gt; x)</p>
<p>   def hole[A &lt;: VZone with OZone]: String =&gt; Double<br/>
      = (x =&gt; godown[A](liftup[A](x)))</p>
<p>   println(hole("Hello World!"))<br/>
}<br/>
</p>
<p>
The point remains, however, that this program is accepted as a “theorem” in the logical theory underlying the Scala 2.x type system. That theory is thereby unsound.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Lofa Polir’s Theorem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A point we have been at pains to make is that this kind of happening is far from rare. Systems are proven secure and then break all the time. Creating more ways to write correct programs has created new ways to have bugs, even as the frequency of old kinds of bugs is reduced. As with the Earth’s ozone hole, the situation is not worsening but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
Dr. Polir’s new theorem not only explains why but also argues that we should be neither surprised nor dismayed by this state of affairs. It can be given the following intuitive statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> There is a sound theory <b>A.F.</b> that can be represented as a complexity-bounded limit of inconsistent theories, but not as an effective limit of consistent theories. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The soundness is with respect to the standard model of arithmetic and includes every statement of arithmetic proved in set theory. The clever new idea in her proof is the manner of the proof itself: it formalizes and self-applies a criterion of <em>feasible correctness in the limit</em> for a sequence of incorrect proofs. </p>
<p>
The upshot is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The most productive and feasible way to do mathematics is to design inconsistent theories and fix them incrementally, rather than to demand global correctness from the get-go. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Before Dr. Polir types up her paper, she has a request for readers of this blog: What should the initials <b>A.F.</b> of her theory stand for? The name “Arithmetical Foundations” is both hackneyed and taken. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What do you think Lofa’s <b>A.F.</b> stands for? </p>

<i>If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent.—Alan Turing</i></p>
<p>
Jack Dongarra has just won the 2021 <a href="https://amturing.acm.org">Turing Award</a>. Congrats to him. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/31/the-2021-turing-award/jd/" rel="attachment wp-att-19835"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19835" height="168" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/jd.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" width="300"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Dongarra is a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Tennessee. He has connections to the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to Rice University, and in England to the University of Manchester—Turing’s academic home.  The nub of ACM’s <a href="https://awards.acm.org/about/2021-turing">article</a> says the following, with <i>linear algebra</i> emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dongarra’s major contribution was in creating open-source software libraries and standards which employ linear algebra as an intermediate language that can be used by a wide variety of applications. These libraries have been written for single processors, parallel computers, multicore nodes, and multiple GPUs per node. Dongarra’s libraries also introduced many important innovations including autotuning, mixed precision arithmetic, and batch computations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Dongarra’s doctoral advisor was Cleve Moler decades ago in 1980.  I always think we should thank our advisors—having been one myself.  But they continued on parallel tracks in the 1980s.  Moler had invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB">MATLAB</a> in the 1970s, but with the advent of IBM PCs in the 1980s, realized their promise for bringing advanced numerical computations into wide use.  Moler and John Little and Steve Bangert co-founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathWorks">MathWorks</a> in 1984 to market their rewrite of MATLAB in C.  Dongarra went on to co-write a host of mathematical tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms">BLAS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK">LAPACK</a> (which succeeded his work with Moler and others on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EISPACK">EISPACK</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK">LINPACK</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatically_Tuned_Linear_Algebra_Software">ATLAS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPCG_benchmark">HPCG</a>, and much more.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Why The Turing Award? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Dongarra received the Turing for his software—code that has had significant impact in many areas of computational science from data analytics, healthcare, renewable energy, weather prediction, genomics, and economics, to name a few. His work was over four decades of writing code that can solve linear systems. Such systems occur in just about all of engineering and science. They challenge us because we constantly wish to solve bigger and more difficult systems. And we are able to solve bigger systems because computers continue to get faster—able to do more operations per second. </p>
<p>
However, the challenge was and is that while computers get faster every year, <em>how</em> they get faster remains involved. They cannot just compute faster but how they get faster continues to be complex. If a computer just got faster every year, then Dongarra would <b>not</b> have been able to win a Turing award. That how they get faster is more complex, more involved, that made his Turing award possible. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Why So Hard? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are some of the challenges that Dongarra had to fight, and continues to fight?  We can build off the following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021183914/http://www.csbruce.com/~csbruce/quotes/craig-cut.html">quip</a> by the Canadian software developer Craig Bruce:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s hardware that makes a machine fast. It’s software that makes a fast machine slow.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
And in 1980 we could add: what could make an IBM PC fast?</p>
<p>
The goal of Dongarra’s software was to run fast on the current hardware systems. The challenge over the decades is simple:  As hardware systems were improved in performance they did not simply get faster. They needed to change how they worked in order to get faster.  The systems changed from single processors, to parallel computers, multicore nodes, and multiple GPUs per node. These changes made the ability to exploit the potential performance harder and harder. </p>
<p>
Let’s assume, for example, that the hardware could not go 100X faster but could execute 100 operations at the same time. Then provided we can exploit this parallelism we can make the hardware seem to be 100 times faster. But if we cannot exploit this, we are in trouble. This is the key issue that Dongarra faced. This challenge is exactly what made his work so difficult and important.</p>
<p/><h2>The Test of Time</h2><p/>
<p>
The solutions found by Dongarra and his co-workers were definitive enough, and the core of linear algebra in LINPACK pure enough, that it could yield a salient benchmark of hardware power.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK benchmark suite</a> won <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/22/business/technology-measuring-how-fast-computers-really-are.html">agreement</a> by the early 1990s as giving the definitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500">measure</a> of hardware power.  A decade ago, they began <a href="https://news.utk.edu/2013/07/10/professor-jack-dongarra-announces-supercomputer-benchmark/">updating</a> it to involve HPCG.</p>
<p>
Thus it is not enough to say that this work has stood the test of time: it <b>is</b> the test of time.  And this is carrying into the future.  A high LINPACK score in 2013 was an early <a href="https://newatlas.com/d-wave-quantum-computer-supercomputer-ranking/27476/">indicator</a> of the power achievable by D-Wave’s quantum adiabatic hardware.  An <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/value-of-quantum-computing-benchmarks">article</a> last month titled “The Race to Quantum Advantage Depends on Benchmarking” includes LINPACK as a contender.  There is recent work toward a more-tailored <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/presentations/202007_GoogleQuantum_LinLin_handout.pdf">quantum LINPACK</a> benchmark.</p>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Some interesting milestones about the Turing awards are:  The first recipient of the award, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, an American computer scientist who wrote the compiler for the ALGOL computer programming language. The first woman to win the prize was Frances Allen, in 2006, for her work in compiler optimization, which contributed to the development of parallel execution in multiprocessing. The youngest recipient was Donald Knuth, who was 36 when he received the award in 1974 for his work on algorithms and computer programming. The oldest recipient was Alfred Aho, who was 79 when he received the award in 2020 for his work on algorithms and the theory of programming language implementation.  I knew all the above winners pretty well. Rich DeMillo and I wrote a paper with Perlis in <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">1979</a>.  </p>
<p>
Turing himself was also a pioneer in AI, of course.  He thought about how computers could reason, how they could think.  What directions will the Turing Awards take in the future—and will they reflect this side of Turing’s vision more?</p></div>

    <title>TR22-042 |  Matrix Polynomial Factorization via Higman Linearization | 

	Vikraman Arvind, 

	Pushkar Joglekar</title>
    <summary>In continuation to our recent work on noncommutative
 polynomial factorization, we consider the factorization problem for
 matrices of polynomials and show the following results.
\begin{itemize}  
\item Given as input a full rank $d\times d$ matrix $M$ whose entries
  $M_{ij}$ are polynomials in the free noncommutative ring
  $\mathbb{F}_q\langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$, where each $M_{ij}$ is given by a
  noncommutative arithmetic formula of size at most $s$, we give a
  randomized algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $d,s, n$ and
  $\log_2q$ that computes a factorization of $M$ as a matrix product
  $M=M_1M_2\cdots M_r$, where each $d\times d$ matrix factor $M_i$ is
  irreducible (in a well-defined sense) and the entries of each $M_i$
  are polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_q \langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ that are output
  as algebraic branching programs. We also obtain a deterministic
  algorithm for the problem that runs in $poly(d,n,s,q)$.
\item A special case is the efficient factorization of matrices whose
  entries are univariate polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[x]$. When $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite
  field the above result applies. When $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of rationals
  we obtain a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the problem.
  \end{itemize}</summary>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Reproducibility is vital to ensuring scientific conclusions are reliable, but failures of reproducibility have been a major issue in nearly all scientific areas of study in recent decades. A key issue underlying the reproducibility crisis is the explosion of methods for data generation, screening, testing, and analysis, where, crucially, only the combinations producing the most significant results are reported. Such practices (also known as p-hacking, data dredging, and researcher degrees of freedom) can lead to erroneous findings that appear to be significant, but that don’t hold up when other researchers attempt to replicate them.</p>
<p>In this talk, we introduce a new notion of reproducibility for randomized algorithms. This notion ensures that with high probability, an algorithm returns exactly the same output when run with two samples from the same distribution. Despite the exceedingly strong demand of reproducibility, there are efficient reproducible algorithms for several fundamental problems in statistics and learning. We show that any statistical query algorithm can be made reproducible with a modest increase in sample complexity, and we use this to construct reproducible algorithms for finding approximate heavy-hitters and medians. Using these ideas, we give the first reproducible algorithm for learning halfspaces via a reproducible weak learner and a reproducible boosting algorithm. We initiate the study of lower bounds and inherent tradeoffs for reproducible algorithms, giving nearly tight sample complexity upper and lower bounds for reproducible versus non-reproducible SQ algorithms. Finally, we discuss connections to other well-studied notions of algorithmic stability, such as differential privacy.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>by <a href="https://meyn.ece.ufl.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sean Meyn</a> (University of Florida) and <a href="http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gergely Neu</a> (Pompeu Fabra University)</p>



<p>One theoretical foundation of reinforcement learning is optimal control, usually rooted in the Markovian variety known as Markov decision processes (MDPs). The MDP model consists of a state process, an action (or input) process, and a one-step reward that is a function of state and action. The goal is to obtain a policy (function from states to actions) that is optimal in some predefined sense. Chris Watkins introduced the Q-function in the 1980s as part of a methodology for reinforcement learning. Given its importance for over three decades, it is not surprising that the question of the true meaning of <em>Q</em> was a hot topic for discussion during the Simons Institute’s Fall 2020 program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/rl20" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Theory of Reinforcement Learning</a>.</p>



<p>This short note focuses on interactions at the start of the program, and research directions inspired in part by these interactions. To start with, <em>who is Q</em>? Was this code for one of Watkins’ friends at Cambridge? The question was posed early on, which led to an online investigation. The mystery was shattered through a response from Chris: we now know that the letter <em>Q</em> stands for <em>quality</em>, not Quinlyn or Quincy. To discuss further questions and potential answers requires some technicalities.</p>



<p>The discounted-cost optimality criterion is a favorite metric for performance in computer science and operations research, and is the setting of the original Q-function formulation. The definition requires a state process <span class="math inline">\(\{X_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span> and an action (or input) process <span class="math inline">\(\{A_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span>, evolving on respective spaces (which are assumed discrete in this note). There is a controlled transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that describes dynamics: <span class="math inline">\(X_{k+1}\)</span> is distributed according to <span class="math inline">\(P(\cdot|x,a)\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_k=x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_k=a\)</span>, for any action sequence that is adapted to the state sequence.</p>



<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> denoting the discount factor, the Q-function is the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation <span class="math inline">\(T^*Q = Q\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> is the Bellman operator: <span class="math display">\[\left(T^*Q\right)(x,a) = r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\]</span> This must hold for each state-action pair <span class="math inline">\((x,a)\)</span>, with the maximum over all possible actions. This is a version of the dynamic programming (DP) equation that has been with us for about seven decades.</p>



<p>The magic of Q-learning, which is based on this DP equation, is that the maximum appears within an expectation. This makes possible the application of Monte Carlo methods to obtain an approximate solution based solely on observations of the actual system to be controlled, or through simulations.</p>



<p>One core idea of modern reinforcement learning (RL) is to find approximate solutions of the DP equation within a function class (e.g., neural networks, as popularized by the deep Q-learning approach of Mnih et al., 2015). While success stories are well-known, useful theory is scarce: we don’t know if a solution exists to an approximate DP equation except in very special settings, and we don’t know if a good approximation will lead to good performance for the resulting policy. We don’t even know if the recursive algorithms that define Q-learning will be stable — estimates may diverge to infinity.</p>



<p>There are many ways to read these negative results, and indeed many articles have been written around this subject. Our own reading is probably among the most radical: without understanding the issues around the existence of solutions to these DP equation approximations or their interpretation, we should search for alternative approximations of dynamic programming suitable for application in RL.</p>



<p>These concerns were raised at Sean Meyn’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUaFu3WzW7o" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">boot camp lecture</a>, where he called on listeners to revisit an alternate foundation of optimal control: the linear programming (LP) approach introduced by Manne (1960) and further developed by Denardo (1970) and d’Epenoux (1963). The message was greeted with enthusiasm from some attendees, including Gergely Neu, who responded, “You have blown my mind!” He had been working on his own formulation of this idea, which became logistic Q-learning (more on this below).</p>



<span id="more-636"/>



<p>The least-squares approach that is central to most traditional RL algorithms (such as DQN) is replaced by an LP, so that we move from <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> approximation. There is ample motivation for this point of view:</p>



<ul><li>
		<p>Lyapunov theory and the theory of inverse dynamic programming provide firm motivation: a good approximation of the DP equation in an <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> sense implies strict bounds on closed-loop performance of the resulting policy. You can learn more about this theory in standard RL texts, and Meyn’s new RL monograph to appear this year.</p>
	</li><li>
		<p>The LP approach reframes the DP approximation as a numerical optimization problem rather than a root-finding problem. Existence of a solution is guaranteed under minimal assumptions, even when working with a restricted set of candidate solutions.</p>
	</li></ul>



<p>Despite these advantages, LP-based approaches were left out of the mainstream RL tool kit until recently. One reason may be a glaring gap in the framework: the classical LPs are phrased in terms of state-value functions and not Q-functions! This means it was not obvious how to bring in Monte Carlo methods for algorithm design.</p>



<p>In 2020, we independently discovered the following LP that can be used to cast Q-learning as a constrained optimization problem — the so-called DPLP: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned} \mbox{minimize } \qquad &amp; \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_{a} Q(X,a)\right] \\ \mbox{subject to } \qquad &amp; Q(x,a) \ge r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> Without any constraints on the function class, the optimizer is the solution to the DP equation. The constraints amount to the DP inequality <span class="math inline">\(Q \ge T^* Q\)</span>, which tells us only <em>negative</em> deviations should be penalized! This is to be contrasted with the commonly used squared Bellman error criterion that penalizes deviations of both signs. In seeking an approximation within a function class <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, it is not at all difficult to ensure a feasible solution exists, even when there is no theory to ensure that an approximate Bellman optimality operator has a fixed point.</p>



<p>There are a variety of possible ways of turning <span> this</span> insight into practical algorithms. One path (taken by Bas-Serrano et al., 2021) is to replace the hard constraint in the LP with a smooth upper bound on the expected constraint violations, resulting in the following unconstrained minimization problem: <span class="math display">\[%  \mbox{minimize } \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}[\max_a Q(X,a)] + \frac 1\eta \log 
% \mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}[e^{\eta(r(X,A) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|X,A)}[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)] – Q(X,A))}].
\mbox{minimize} \;\;\;\;\;\;\,\, \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_a Q(X,a)\right] + \frac 1\eta \log 
\mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}\left[e^{\eta((T^*Q)(X,A) – Q(X,A))}\right].\]</span> Bas-Serrano et al. (2021) dubbed the above objective function the “logistic Bellman error” and have shown that it enjoys several favorable properties that make it an ideal objective for stochastic optimization. Interactions at the Simons Institute led to the development of another related algorithmic framework called “convex Q-learning,” in which the hard constraints in the LP are replaced with a different continuous approximation (Lu et al., 2021).</p>



<p>It is straightforward to derive practical algorithms from both approaches by replacing the expectations with sample averages. This approach led to good empirical performance, along with the beginnings of theory for convergence and performance bounds.</p>



<p>The LP approach had been simmering in the background over the prior decade: de Farias and Van Roy (2003) proposed an LP approach for approximate dynamic programming, and Mehta and Meyn (2009) contains foundations for convex Q-learning, including a variant of the DPLP for deterministic systems in continuous time.</p>



<p>The new techniques bring challenges that must be overcome before these LP-based approaches can take on the world. One is that these optimization problems can be very poorly conditioned. Another is that the approximation may greatly underestimate the true Q-function when using a poor choice of function class for approximation. We remain optimistic: just like the RL community has successfully developed numerical recipes for addressing the much more severe issue of nonexistence of fixed points to the approximate Bellman operators, we believe that similar know-how can be developed for LP-based methods if theorists and practitioners join forces. Now that we understand where Q comes from, let us decide together where it will go next!</p>



<p><em>Acknowledgment</em>. The authors owe a great debt to the Simons Institute for providing inspiration and interactions throughout the fall program. In particular, our joint work (Lu et al., 2021) was in large part an outcome of discussions at the meeting. The LP approach is one theme of the new textbook (Meyn, 2022), and the impact of the program is seen throughout the book.</p>

Keith Kirkpatrick is the author of an interesting CACM <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/4/259392-still-waiting-for-self-driving-cars/fulltext">article</a> on self-driving cars. It is titled “Still Waiting For Self-Driving Cars” and appears in the news section of this month’s issue. </p>
<p>
Today we discuss why it has been so difficult to get self-driving cars started.</p>
<p>
Kirkpatrick’s article starts:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Over the past decade, technology and automotive pundits have predicted the “imminent” arrival of fully autonomous vehicles that can drive on public roads without any active monitoring or input from a human driver. Elon Musk has predicted his company Tesla would deliver fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2021, but he made similar predictions in 2020, 2019, and 2017. Each prediction has fallen flat, largely due to real-world safety concerns, particularly related to how self-driving cars perform in adverse conditions or situations.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> An Issue </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
As printed in the current CACM issue, his article says the following on page 13:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A potential intermediate solution currently being tested in Germany is to utilize remote drivers to control vehicles. Vay, a Berlin-based startup, has been testing a fleet of remote-controlled electric vehicles in that city and plans to roll out a mobility service in Europe and potentially the U.S. this year. The service will allow customers to order a remote-controlled car and have it drive them to their desired destination; on arrival, they get out if the vehicle and leave it to a human teledriver miles away to either park the vehicle or steer it to the next client. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I claim this shows the issue that we have with automatic driving systems. There is a typo in the above paragraph. A typo that shows what we are up against in the attempt to make automatic driving systems. </p>
<p>
<b>DO YOU SEE IT?</b></p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/cacmifoftypo/" rel="attachment wp-att-19792"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19792" height="36" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CACMifoftypo.jpg?resize=253%2C36&amp;ssl=1" width="253"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
We claim that a typo like this in a CACM article is part of the reason it is so hard to make self-driving cars. Do you agree? Or is the typo not critical? While we’re at it, does the title of this post have a typo?  Read on…</p>
<p>
Ken contributes a more difficult example of this kind, one he used while addressing the same issue of AI advances in his department’s Freshman Seminar. It relates to a later section in Kirkpatrick’s article, where he discusses the issue of</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …testing to ensure vehicle navigation systems understand the complex social interactions that often occur between oncoming and adjacent drivers, or drivers and pedestrians. Generally, if a pedestrian is about to cross or is crossing a street, the driver and pedestrian will make eye contact, and will use nonverbal cues to indicate the direction and speed of their movement. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Over to Ken:</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ken’s Example </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is the relevant portion of the White House <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia">transcript</a> of Barack Obama’s July 2012 campaign speech in Roanoke, Virginia—the one with the notorious phrase “you didn’t build that”:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/youdidntbuildthat/" rel="attachment wp-att-19798"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19798" height="229" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/YouDidntBuildThat.jpg?resize=363%2C229&amp;ssl=1" width="363"/></a></p>
<p>
The question we could submit to Google—whose own automated-driving efforts have had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/personaltech/google-says-its-not-the-driverless-cars-fault-its-other-drivers.html">difficulties</a> with interpreting rules—is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What does the word “that” in “you didn’t build that” refer to? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
By rules of linguistic derivation, the answer seems clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The word “that” refers to the most recent noun, which is “business.” <p/>
</li><li>
The dashes ‘- -‘ connect two parts that refer to each other. <p/>
</li><li>
The word cannot anyway refer to “roads and bridges” because that is plural whereas “that” is singular, like “business.” <p/>
</li><li>
(The preceding point is not a self-contradiction because in quotes, “roads and bridges” is a phrase—singular.)
</li></ul>
<p>
Now please take a minute-plus to listen to the actual delivery of this part of the speech (you may need to click back from 0:00:08 to 0:00:00 to get the start):</p>
<p/><center><br/>
<br/>
</center><p/>
<p/><p><br/>
First, the transcript is missing a word: Obama actually said “<em>that</em>—you didn’t build <em>that</em>.” Perhaps having a rhetorically emphasized <em>that</em> right after “business” makes the semantic designation even clearer? But then notice that the part “if you’ve got a business” was delivered in a quick and parenthetical manner inside the full phrase “Somebody invested in roads and bridges … you didn’t build that.” </p>
<p>
The interpretation that the “that” refers to <em>infrastructure</em> is supported by the speech’s immediate segue to the Internet, sandwiched around “somebody else made that happen.” Going out to sources, Obama was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/an-unoriginal-obama-quote-taken-out-of-context/2012/07/20/gJQAdG7hyW_blog.html">channeling</a> a point already notoriously made by Elizabeth Warren in a 2011 <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-agenda/elizabeth-warrens-quote-reihan-salam/">speech</a>. But without going out to sources—something we cannot expect an AI to do in the moment—there is Obama’s next sentence (also included in the speech clip):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Whether Obama intended to say that people did not build their businesses can still be argued, but that’s not the real point. My first point is that AIs based on current art for ascribing meanings not only would make that ascription, but <em>should</em> do so for overall consistency. And the second, larger, point at the end of my <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse199/InternetAndData199np.pdf">slides</a>, where I get to hard AI problems, is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We base our confidence in developing AI systems on Alan Turing’s principle that whatever the human mind can resolve, a computer can be programmed to apprehend and execute. But what if important data, on fine scales, concern matters that our human minds cannot resolve? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
CACM puts in a bubble Kirkpatrick’s quoting another expert that “it will take years and massive compute power to train self-driving systems to understand the nonverbal cues that pass between drivers and pedestrians.”  We believe the task and need of getting cars to <em>self-derive</em> meanings is greater still.  </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Do these issues say anything about the difficulty of getting code right? We think so, but what do you think?</p>
<p/><p><br/>
[some word changes; I seem unable to fix the endpoints of my clip on the C-SPAN website.]</p></font></font></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>The 2022 STOC Test of Time Award</strong> recognizes papers published in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. This is the second year of this annual award. There are three awards, targeting the STOC conferences 10, 20, and 30 years prior to the year in which the award is given. While there is a preference for papers in the target years (and nominations from those years are encouraged), in each of these award categories it is also possible to nominate STOC conference papers published up to four conferences earlier than the targeted conference. Thus, the 2022 STOC Test of Time Awards will be for papers presented at the STOC conferences in 2008-2012, 1998-2002, and 1988-1992. The awards, which will be presented at STOC 2022, include a prize of US $500 per author as well as complimentary registration for all authors who attend the conference at which the award is given.</p>



<h2>Nomination Procedure</h2>



<p>Nominations should be sent to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>stoc22.tot.award@gmail.com</strong></a><strong> </strong>with a subject line of <strong>“STOC Test of Time Award” </strong>no later than <strong>April 30, 2022</strong>. Nominations should contain an explanation of the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. A nomination may be accompanied by up to three additional endorsement letters, which may be sent by the endorsers directly to the same email address with the same subject line. Self-nominations are disallowed. </p>



<h2>Selection</h2>



<p>The winners will be selected by a committee appointed by the SIGACT Executive Committee. For 2022 the selection committee consists of Toniann Pitassi (Columbia), Satish Rao (Berkeley), Salil Vadhan (Harvard, chair), Avi Wigderson (Institute for Advanced Study). </p>



<p>In selecting the Test of Time Award winners, the Committee will pay particular attention to long-term impact. This impact can come in many forms, including but not limited to:</p>



<ol><li>Opening up a new area of research</li><li>Introducing new techniques</li><li>Solving a problem of lasting importance</li><li>Stimulating advances in other areas of computer science or in other disciplines.</li></ol>



<p>The committee expects to select exactly one paper for each award. However, when circumstances justify it, up to three may be selected. The committee may consider papers that were not explicitly nominated and gather additional input from experts, but formal nominations are extremely helpful in the committee’s deliberations and strongly encouraged.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  In the Pandora’s Box problem, the algorithm is provided with a number of boxes with unknown (stochastic) rewards contained inside them. The algorithm can open any box at some cost, discover the reward inside, and based on these observations can choose one box and keep the reward contained in it. Given the distributions from which the rewards are drawn, the algorithm must determine an order in which to open the boxes as well as when to stop and accept the best reward found so far. In general, an optimal algorithm may make both decisions adaptively based on instantiations observed previously. The Pandora’s Box problem and its extensions capture many kinds of optimization problems with stochastic input where the algorithm can obtain instantiations of input random variables at some cost. Previous work on these problems assumes that different random variables in the input are distributed independently. As such it does not capture many real-world settings. In this work, we provide the first algorithms for Pandora’s Box-type problems with correlations. In the independent setting, optimal algorithms are non-adaptive and based on the notion of the Gittins index. These techniques fail to extend to the correlated case. We assume that the algorithm has access to samples drawn from the joint distribution on input and provide solutions that require few samples; are computationally efficient; and guarantee approximate optimality. <br/>This is joint work with Evangelia Gergatsouli, Yifeng Teng, Christos Tzamos, and Ruimin Zhang and appeared in FOCS’20.</p>

    <title>TR22-040 |  Should decisions in QCDCL follow prefix order? | 

	Benjamin Böhm, 

	Tomáš Peitl, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff</title>
    <summary>Quantified conflict-driven clause learning (QCDCL) is one of the main solving approaches for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). One of the differences between QCDCL and propositional CDCL is that QCDCL typically follows the prefix order of the QBF for making decisions.
We investigate an alternative model for QCDCL solving where decisions can be made in arbitrary order. The resulting system QCDCL-ANY is still sound and terminating, but does not necessarily allow to always learn asserting clauses or cubes. To address this potential drawback, we additionally introduce two subsystems that guarantee to always learn asserting clauses (QCDCL-UNI-ANY) and asserting cubes (QCDCL-EXI-ANY), respectively.
We model all four approaches by formal proof systems and show that QCDCL-UNI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on false formulas, whereas QCDCL-EXI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on true QBFs. Technically, this involves constructing specific QBF families and showing lower and upper bounds in the respective proof systems.
We complement our theoretical study with some initial experiments that confirm our theoretical findings.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A few days ago I received by mail Imre Bárány’s new book <em>Combinatorial Convexity</em>. The book presents Helly-type theorems and other results in convexity with combinatorial flavour. The choice of material and the choice of proofs is terrific and it is an ideal book for a course for graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  Congratulations, Imre!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/ulect-77/">AMS page</a> gives the following description</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>This book is about the combinatorial properties of convex sets, families of convex sets in finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, and finite points sets related to convexity. This area is classic, with theorems of Helly, Carathéodory, and Radon that go back more than a hundred years. At the same time, it is a modern and active field of research with recent results like Tverberg’s theorem, the colourful versions of Helly and Carathéodory, and the <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-3">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-4">p</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-5">,</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-6">q</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-7">)</span></span></span></span> theorem of Alon and Kleitman. As the title indicates, the topic is convexity and geometry, and is close to discrete mathematics. The questions considered are frequently of a combinatorial nature, and the proofs use ideas from geometry and are often combined with graph and hypergraph theory. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The book is intended for students (graduate and undergraduate alike), but postdocs and research mathematicians will also find it useful. It can be used as a textbook with short chapters, each suitable for a one- or two-hour lecture. Not much background is needed: basic linear algebra and elements of (hyper)graph theory as well as some mathematical maturity should suffice.</em></span></p></blockquote>
