    <title>The Quantum Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Buhrman:Harry.html">Harry Buhrman</a>, Subhasree Patro, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Speelman:Florian.html">Florian Speelman</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05686">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The strong exponential-time hypothesis (SETH) is a commonly used conjecture
in the field of complexity theory. It states that CNF formulas cannot be
analyzed for satisfiability with a speedup over exhaustive search. This
hypothesis and its variants gave rise to a fruitful field of research,
fine-grained complexity, obtaining (mostly tight) lower bounds for many
problems in P whose unconditional lower bounds are hard to find. In this work,
we introduce a framework of Quantum Strong Exponential-Time Hypotheses, as
quantum analogues to SETH.
</p>
<p>Using the QSETH framework, we are able to translate quantum query lower
bounds on black-box problems to conditional quantum time lower bounds for many
problems in BQP. As an example, we illustrate the use of the QSETH by providing
a conditional quantum time lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1.5})$ for the Edit
Distance problem. We also show that the $n^2$ SETH-based lower bound for a
recent scheme for Proofs of Useful Work, based on the Orthogonal Vectors
problem holds for quantum computation assuming QSETH, maintaining a quadratic
gap between verifier and prover.

    <title>Enumerative Data Compression with Non-Uniquely Decodable Codes</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1573689600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>M. Oğuzhan Külekci, Yasin Öztürk, Elif Altunok, Can Altıniğne <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05676">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Non-uniquely decodable codes can be defined as the codes that cannot be
uniquely decoded without additional disambiguation information. These are
mainly the class of non-prefix-free codes, where a codeword can be a prefix of
other(s), and thus, the codeword boundary information is essential for correct
decoding. Although the codeword bit stream consumes significantly less space
when compared to prefix--free codes, the additional disambiguation information
makes it difficult to catch the performance of prefix-free codes in total.
Previous studies considered compression with non-prefix-free codes by
integrating rank/select dictionaries or wavelet trees to mark the code-word
boundaries. In this study we focus on another dimension with a block--wise
enumeration scheme that improves the compression ratios of the previous studies
significantly. Experiments conducted on a known corpus showed that the proposed
scheme successfully represents a source within its entropy, even performing
better than the Huffman and arithmetic coding in some cases. The non-uniquely
decodable codes also provides an intrinsic security feature due to lack of
unique-decodability. We investigate this dimension as an opportunity to provide
compressed data security without (or with less) encryption, and discuss various
possible practical advantages supported by such codes.

for sampling in high dimension. Specifically, we introduce symmetric and strong
self-concordance. These properties imply that the corresponding Dikin walk
mixes in $\tilde{O}(n\bar{\nu})$ steps from a warm start in a convex body in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ using a strongly self-concordant barrier with symmetric
self-concordance parameter $\bar{\nu}$. For many natural barriers, $\bar{\nu}$
is roughly bounded by $\nu$, the standard self-concordance parameter. We show
that this property and strong self-concordance hold for the Lee-Sidford
barrier. As a consequence, we obtain the first walk to mix in
$\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ steps for an arbitrary polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Strong
self-concordance for other barriers leads to an interesting (and unexpected)
connection --- for the universal and entropic barriers, it is implied by the
KLS conjecture.

including last-mile deliveries, surveillance and monitoring, and wireless
networks. This paper aims to design UAV trajectories that simultaneously
perform multiple tasks. We aim to design UAV trajectories that minimize package
delivery time, and at the same time provide uniform coverage over a
neighborhood area which is needed for applications such as network coverage or
surveillance. We first consider multi-task UAVs for a simplified scenario where
the neighborhood area is a circular region with the post office located at its
center and the houses are assumed to be uniformly distributed on the circle
boundary. We propose a trajectory process such that if according to which the
drones move, a uniform coverage can be achieved while the delivery efficiency
is still preserved. We then consider a more practical scenario in which the
delivery destinations are arbitrarily distributed in an arbitrarily-shaped
region. We also do not assume any restrictions on the package arrivals. We show
that simultaneous uniform coverage and efficient package delivery is possible
for such realistic scenarios. This is shown using both rigorous analyses as
well as simulations.

decreasing importance, as imposed by an appropriate ranking function. Our main
contribution is a framework for ranked enumeration over a class of Dynamic
Programming problems that generalizes seemingly different problems that to date
had been studied in isolation. To this end, we study and extend classic
algorithms that find the k-shortest paths in a weighted graph. For full
conjunctive queries, including cyclic ones, our approach is asymptotically
optimal in terms of (1) time to return the top result, (2) delay between
results, and (3) time until all results are returned in order. These optimality
properties were derived for a complexity measure that has been widely used in
the context of worst-case optimal join algorithms, but which abstracts away
factors that only depend on query size and a polylogarithmic cost factor in
input size. By performing a more detailed cost analysis, we are able to uncover
a previously unknown tradeoff between two incomparable enumeration approaches:
one has lower complexity when the number of returned results is small, the
other when it is large. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically the
superiority of our techniques to batch algorithms that produce the full result
and then sort it. Interestingly, our technique is not only faster for returning
the first few results, but even when all results are produced.

From this scheme we
derive a framework for dynamically rounding fractional matchings against
\emph{adaptive adversaries}. Plugging in known dynamic fractional matching
algorithms into our framework, we obtain numerous randomized dynamic matching
algorithms which work against adaptive adversaries (the first such algorithms,
as all previous randomized algorithms for this problem assumed an
\emph{oblivious} adversary). In particular, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, our
framework yields $(2+\epsilon)$-approximate algorithms with constant update
time or polylog worst-case update time, as well as $(2-\delta)$-approximate
algorithms in bipartite graphs with arbitrarily-small polynomial update time,
with all these algorithms' guarantees holding against adaptive adversaries. All
these results achieve \emph{polynomially} better update time to approximation
tradeoffs than previously known to be achievable against adaptive adversaries.

($\mathcal{C}$-ADS), a variant of DFAS where we want to remove at most $k$ arcs

fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k$. So far no polynomial kernels for
this problem were known. Our main result is a kernel for Funnel-Arc Deletion

algorithms have shown that dimension reduction methods such as PCA treat data
from different sensitive groups unfairly. In particular, by aggregating data of
different groups, the reconstruction error of the learned subspace becomes
biased towards some populations that might hurt or benefit those groups
inherently, leading to an unfair representation. On the other hand, alleviating
the bias to protect sensitive groups in learning the optimal projection, would
lead to a higher reconstruction error overall. This introduces a trade-off
between sensitive groups' sacrifices and benefits, and the overall
reconstruction error. In this paper, in pursuit of achieving fairness criteria
in PCA, we introduce a more efficient notion of Pareto fairness, cast the
Pareto fair dimensionality reduction as a multi-objective optimization problem,
and propose an adaptive gradient-based algorithm to solve it. Using the notion
of Pareto optimality, we can guarantee that the solution of our proposed
algorithm belongs to the Pareto frontier for all groups, which achieves the
optimal trade-off between those aforementioned conflicting objectives. This
framework can be efficiently generalized to multiple group sensitive features,
as well. We provide convergence analysis of our algorithm for both convex and
non-convex objectives and show its efficacy through empirical studies on
different datasets, in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithm.

<p>Please make sure you reserve a spot for your group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: In the <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-cut problem, we are given an edge-weighted graph and want to find the least-weight set of edges whose deletion breaks the graph into <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> connected components. Algorithms due to Karger-Stein and Thorup showed how to find such a minimum <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-cut in time approximately <img alt="O(n^{2k-2})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B2k-2%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(n^{2k-2})"/>. The best lower bounds come from conjectures about the solvability of the <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-clique problem and a reduction from <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-clique to <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-cut, and show that solving <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/>-cut is likely to require time <img alt="\Omega(n^k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28n%5Ek%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\Omega(n^k)"/>.

    <title>TR19-161 |  Hardness of Learning DNFs using Halfspaces | 

	Suprovat Ghoshal, 

	Rishi Saket</title>
    <summary>The problem of learning $t$-term DNF formulas (for $t = O(1)$) has been studied extensively in the PAC model since its introduction by Valiant (STOC 1984). A $t$-term DNF can be efficiently learnt using a $t$-term DNF only if $t = 1$ i.e., when it is an AND, while even weakly learning a $2$-term DNF using a constant term DNF was shown to be NP-hard by Khot and Saket (FOCS 2008). On the other hand, Feldman et al. (FOCS 2009) showed the hardness of weakly learning a noisy AND using a halfspace -- the latter being a generalization of an AND, while Khot and Saket (STOC 2008) showed that an intersection of two halfspaces is hard to weakly learn using any function of constantly many halfspaces. The question of whether a $2$-term DNF is efficiently learnable using $2$ or constantly many halfspaces remained open.
	In this work we answer this question in the negative by showing the hardness of weakly learning a $2$-term DNF as well as a noisy AND using any function of a constant number of halfspaces. In particular we prove the following. 
	For any constants $\nu, \zeta &gt; 0$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$, given a distribution over point-value pairs $\{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}$, it is NP-hard to decide whether,
YES Case. There is a $2$-term DNF that classifies all the points of the distribution, and an AND that classifies at least $1-\zeta$ fraction of the points correctly.
NO Case. Any boolean function depending on at most $\ell$ halfspaces classifies at most $1/2 + \nu$ fraction of the points of the distribution correctly.
	Our result generalizes and strengthens the previous best results mentioned above on the hardness of learning a $2$-term DNF, learning an intersection of two halfspaces, and learning a noisy AND.</summary>

(I was actually asked many of the questions below.) I also recommend <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">Lipton and Regan’s post on the Google paper.</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">While much of the post will be familiar let me mention right away a new critique of the Google supremacy claim: One of the central claims in the Google experiment – that the fidelity (quality) of a complex circuit is very close to the product of the fidelity of its basic components –  qubit and gates, seems very improbable and this may shed serious doubts on the validity of the experiment and on its conclusions.</span></p>
<p>Before we start, a few links: For the amazing news on the threshold of random discrete structures, see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/30/amazing-keith-frankston-jeff-kahn-bhargav-narayanan-jinyoung-park-thresholds-versus-fractional-expectation-thresholds/">this post</a>.  Here is my <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">first post</a> on Google matter. Let me recommend the paper <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201910/rnoti-p1618.pdf">From Operator Algebras to Complexity Theory and Back</a> by Thomas Vidick. It is about a problem by Boris Tsirelson (related to various deep mathematics) and about connections to quantum computation. And just fresh on the arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03748">Quantum speedups need structure</a> by Nathan Keller, Ohad Klein, resolving the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture. Congrats to Nathan and Ohad!</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">And now, lets start.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So what is quantum supremacy? And what other things do we need to know in order to understand the claims regarding quantum computers?</span></p>
<p><strong>Quantum supremacy</strong>  is the ability of quantum computers to demonstrate computations that classical computers cannot demonstrate. (Or that it is very very hard for classical computers  to demonstrate.)</p>
<p><strong>Quantum error correcting codes</strong> are certain quantum gadgets that a quantum computer needs to create that will be used as building blocks for larger quantum computers.</p>
<p><strong>A sampling task</strong> is  a task where the computer (quantum or classic) produces samples from a certain probability distribution <strong>D</strong>. Each sample is 0-1 vector of length n.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/john_martinis-300x256.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18579" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/john_martinis-300x256.jpg?w=640"/></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>John Martinis</strong></span></p>
<h2>Google</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What did the Google team do?</span></p>
<p>The Google team produced a sample of a few millions 0-1 vectors of length 53 which is based on a certain “ideal” probability distribution <strong>D</strong>. They made two crucial claims regarding their sample</p>
<p>A) The statistical test for how close their sample is to the ideal distribution <strong>D</strong> will give a result above t=1/10,000</p>
<p>B) Producing a sample with similar statistical property will require 10,000 years on a supercomputer.</p>
<p>The probability distribution <strong>D</strong> depends on a quantum computation process (or by the technical jargon, a <strong>quantum circuit</strong>) denoted later by C.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the meaning of the statistical statement in part A)?</span></p>
<p>Google’s quantum computers (like any other current quantum computers) are very “noisy” so what the computer is producing are not samples from <strong>D</strong> but rather a noisy version which could roughly be described as follows: a fraction <em>t</em> of the samples are from <strong>D</strong> and a fraction <em>(1-t)</em> of the samples are from a uniform distribution. The statistical test allows to estimate the value of <em>t</em> which is referred to as the fidelity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Could they directly verify claims A) and B) ?</span></p>
<p>No, it was only possible to give indirect evidence for both these claims.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the logic of Google’s quantum supremacy argument?</span></p>
<p>For claim A) regarding the success of the statistical test on the sample they have two arguments:</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/gsformula.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18590" height="44" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/gsformula.png?w=300&amp;h=44" width="300"/></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Analysis based on the fidelity of the components of the quantum computer – qubits and gates (see formula (77) above),</li>
<li>Experiments that support the analysis in the regime where they can be tested by a classical computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the paper  the fidelity of entire circuits agrees perfectly with the prediction of the simple mathematical formula (77) with deviation under 10-20 percents. There are several reported experiments in the classically tractable regime including on simplified circuits (that are easier to simulate on classical computers) to support the assumption that the prediction given by formula (77) for the fidelity applies to the 53-qubit circuit in the supremacy regime.</p>
<p>For claim B) For the classical difficulty they rely on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extrapolation from the running time of a specific algorithm that they use.</li>
<li>Computational complexity support for the assertion that the task they consider is asymptotically difficult.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What are the weak points in this logic?</span></p>
<p>A main weakness (which is crucial in my mind) of the experiment is that the experimental support from the regime where the experiments can be tested by a classical computer is too sparse. Much more could have been done and should have been done.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/supremacy-figure.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18586" height="277" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/supremacy-figure.png?w=300&amp;h=277" width="300"/></a></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In my opinion, a major weakness of the Google experiment is that the support from experiments in the classically tractable regime (blue in the picture) is much too sparse and is unconvincing.</span></p>
<p>Another weakness is that the arguments for classical difficulty were mainly based on the performance of a specific algorithm.</p>
<p>Sources: The link to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5">Google paper in </a><em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5">Nature.</a> </em>A <a href="https://youtu.be/FklMpRiTeTA">videotaped lecture</a> by John Martinis at Caltech.</p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is your assessment of the Google claims, Gil?</span></p>
<p>I think that the claims are incorrect. Specifically, I find the evidence for  the claim “the statistical test applied to the 53-qubit  sample will give a result above 1/10,000 too weak and I expect that this claim and other related claims in the paper will not stand after a closer scrutiny and further experiments in the classically tractable regime. I also doubt the perfect proximity between predictions based on the 1- and 2- qubit fidelity and the circuit fidelity.</p>
<p>The Google experiment represents a very large leap in several aspects of human ability to control noisy quantum systems and accepting their claims  requires very careful evaluation of the experiments and, of course, successful replications.</p>
<h2>The “most amazing thing” – is it real?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you want to tell us more about Formula (77)?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/77.png"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-18615 aligncenter" height="222" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/77.png?w=300&amp;h=222" width="300"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Formula (77)</span></p>
<p>Yes, thank you. Here again is Formula (77) and its explanation in the paper. The fact that the fidelity of entire circuits agrees with the prediction of the simple mathematical Formula (77) is “most amazing” <a href="https://youtu.be/FklMpRiTeTA?t=2455">according to John Martinis (videotaped lecture at Caltech).</a>  Indeed the deviation according to the paper is at most 10-20 percents.  This perfect agreement can be seen in various other parts of the paper. The authors’ interpretation of this finding is that it validates the digital error model and shows that there are no new mechanisms for errors.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/77-explained.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-18641" height="400" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/77-explained.png?w=640&amp;h=400" width="640"/></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">John explains the significance of Formula (77) at Caltech. Amazing big surprises are often false.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And what do you think about it, Gil</span></p>
<p>I completely agree that this is most amazing and, as a matter of fact, there are reasons to consider the  predictions based on Formula (77) as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>too good to be true</strong></span> even if qubit and gates fidelity account for all the errors in the system. The issue is that Formula (77) itself is very sensitive to noise. The formula estimates the fidelity as the product of hundreds of contributions from individual qubits and gates. Fairly small errors in estimating the individual terms can have large accumulative effect, well beyond the 10%-20% margin.</p>
<p>Anyway, this matter deserves further study.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why?</span></p>
<p>Because this is considered by the authors as a major discovery and while looking skeptically at the Google papers this appears to be an orthogonal “miracle” to the main supremacy claim.</p>
<h2>How to proceed</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Let’s go back to your overall assessment. What could change your mind, Gil?</span></p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>A) An independent verification of the statistical tests outcomes for the experiments in the regime where the Google team classically computed the probabilities. This looks to me like a crucial step in a verification of such an important experiment.</p>
<p>A more difficult verification that I’d also regard as necessary at a later stage would be to independently check the probability distributions for the circuits given by the Google computation.</p>
<h3>Further analysis and crucial improvements</h3>
<p>B) Experiments with the quantum computers giving sufficiently many samples to understand the noisy probability distribution for circuits in the 10-25 qubit range.  See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">my first post</a>, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4372#comment-1822400" rel="nofollow ugc">this comment by Ryan O’Donnell</a>, and this <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317#comment-1819915">earlier one</a>.  We need to understand the noisy probability distribution produced by the Google quantum computer, the actual fidelity, and the quality of the statistical tests used by the Google team.</p>
<h3>Replications</h3>
<p>C) Experiments in the 10-30 qubit range on the IBM (and other) quantum computers.  It is quite possible that experimenting of this kind with random quantum circuits was already carried out.</p>
<p>D) Since improved classical algorithms were found by the IBM team (but analyzing the 53 qubits samples still seems practically beyond reach).   Google can produce samples for 41-49 qubits for which IBM (or others) can compute the probabilities quickly and test Google’s prediction for the fidelity.</p>
<h3>Follow-ups</h3>
<p>E) Success in demonstrating distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes and other quantum error-correcting codes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So what precisely will convince you and what is the time-schedule that you expect for matters to be clarified?</span></p>
<p>A successful and convincing combination of<strong> three or more</strong> from A), B), C), D) or E) will go a long way to convince me. The verification part A) is important, and I don’t expect problems there, I expect that the Google claims will be verified and I consider it as very important that the data will be public and that various groups will verify the claims. This may take several months and certainly it should take less than a year.</p>
<p>At present, I expect parts B)-D) will not support Google’s supremacy claims. So outcomes of experiments in the next couple of years both by the Google group and by other groups will be crucial. One direction that I <em>do not</em> regard, at present, as useful for strengthening the quantum supremacy claims is increasing the number of qubits of the quantum computer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is required for the (easy) verification stage?</span></p>
<p>(1) Right now the raw samples of Google’s sampling experiments are public. There are altogether 300 files with samples.</p>
<p>(2) For every circuit that they experiment, the Google team also plans to upload  the 2^n probabilities that they obtained by the Feynman-Schrodinger algorithm.  This will  allow verifying their statistical tests, making subsequent analysis, and for other researchers to test other algorithms for computing the same probabilities.</p>
<p>(3) A convenient form of the data from (2) is a file that will give for every experiment the probabilities that the Google team computed for the samples. (For a large <em>n</em> those are much smaller files.)</p>
<p>(4) For each of the 300 experiments the estimated fidelity that formula (77) gave and the contribution of each qubit and gate to the RHS of (77).</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you plan to take part yourself?</span></p>
<p>I plan to get involved myself with the “easy” verification and analysis of the “raw data” once it will become available. I do expect that the statistical tests will agree with the assertions in the Google paper, and at the same time, as I said,  I think it is important that this and other aspects of the experiments will be double checked and triple checked. This basic data already allows interesting analysis and indeed Google’s supplementary paper describes such analysis (that the Google people kindly pointed me to) on how the data fits the theory and on their statistical tests. See Figures S32-S36, table V and associated materials around pages 37-40.</p>
<h2>IBM</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What did the IBM rebuttal paper show?</span></p>
<p>Recall that the Google claim is based on two assertions:</p>
<p>A) The statistical test applied to the sample will give a result above 1/10,000</p>
<p>B) that producing a sample with similar statistical property will require 10,000 years on a supercomputer.</p>
<p>The IBM team described a different algorithm (on an even stronger current supercomputer) that would take only 2.5 days rather than 10,000 years.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can the 2.5 days be further reduced?</span></p>
<p>As far as I can see the IBM claim is about a full computation of all the 2^53 probabilities. It is reasonable to think that producing a sample (or even a complete list of 2^53 probabilities) with fidelity t reduces the classical effort linearly with t. (This is the claim about the specific algorithm used by the Google team.) If this holds for the IBM algorithm then the 2.5 days will go down to less than a minute. (This will still be a notable “quantum speed up” in terms of the number of operations.) I don’t have an opinion as to whether  we should expect considerably better than IBM’s classical algorithms for computing the exact probabilities.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But lack of enthusiasm and skepticism of researchers from IBM about the Google paper appears to go beyond this particular point of the 2.5 computing days. Do you think that the objection by IBM people is motivated by fierce competition or envy?</span></p>
<p>No, I tend to think that there is a genuine interest by researchers who question the Google paper to understand the scientific matter, and carefully, critically and skeptically examine  Google’s claims. Maybe Google’s claims might seem to some other researchers who are working on quantum computers with superconducting qubits as remote from their own experimental experience, and this may give a strong reason for skepticism. It is also possible that in time people in IBM and elsewhere will change their mind and will become  more enthusiastic about the Google results.</p>
<p>IBM <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09534">paper</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy/">blog post</a> responding to Google’s announcement.</p>
<h2>Noise</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tell us a little more about noise</span></p>
<p>Here is a nice toy model (which I think is quite realistic) to understand what the noise is.  Suppose that you ran a circuit C on your quantum computer with n qubits and the ideal probability distribution is <img alt="D_C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_C"/>. The fidelity <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="t"/> noisy version of <img alt="D_C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_C"/> will be <img alt="N_C(x)=t D_C(x) + (1-t)S_C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_C%28x%29%3Dt+D_C%28x%29+%2B+%281-t%29S_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N_C(x)=t D_C(x) + (1-t)S_C"/>. And here <img alt="S_C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S_C"/> is the average (or weighted average) of values of <img alt="D_C(y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C%28y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_C(y)"/> where y is a vector in the neighborhood of x.</p>
<p>Here is a concrete version: We look at the expected value of <img alt="D_C(y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C%28y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_C(y)"/> where y is a new vector and <img alt="y_i=x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i%3Dx_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="y_i=x_i"/> with probability <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p"/> <img alt="y_i=(1-x_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i%3D%281-x_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="y_i=(1-x_i)"/> with probability <img alt="(1-p)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281-p%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(1-p)"/> <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>independently</strong></span>. We choose <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p"/> so that <img alt="p^n=t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5En%3Dt&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p^n=t"/>. There are cases where positive correlation of errors for 2-qubit gates lead to correlated errors. (This is especially relevant in the context of quantum error correction.) To add this effect to the toy noise model replace the  word <span style="color: #008000;">independently</span> by “<span style="color: #008000;">positively correlated</span>“.</p>
<h2>Your argument, Gil</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why do you think that quantum supremacy is not possible at all?</span></p>
<p>The gist of my argument against the possibility of achieving quantum supremacy by Noisy intermediate scale quantum computers is quite simple: “<em>NISQ</em> <em>devices can’t outperform classical computers, for the simple reason that they <span style="color: #ff0000;">are</span> primitive classical computers.” </em></p>
<p>(Note the similarity to Scott Aaronson’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342">critique</a> on a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1557-9">paper</a> published by <em>Nature</em> claiming implementation of a Shor-like algorithm on a classical device called “p-bits”.  Scott offered a very quick debunking: “ ‘<em>p-bit’ devices can’t scalably outperform classical computers, for the simple reason that they <span style="color: #ff0000;">are</span> classical computers.)</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If Google’s claim are correct – does it falsify your argument?</span></p>
<p>Yes! I predict that probability distributions described (robustly) by a noisy quantum circuit represent a polynomial time algorithm in terms of the description of the circuit. And by a polynomial time algorithm I assume small degree and modest constants. The Google claim, if true, appears to falsify this prediction. (And for this you do not need quantum supremacy in the strongest form of the term.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But is there no way that Google’s huge (or at least large) computational advantage coexists with what you say?</span></p>
<p>There is an issue that I myself am not completely sure about regarding the possibility of chaotic behavior of quantum computers. Here is the classical analog: If you have <em>n</em> bits of memory inside a (classical) computer of <em>m</em> bits and ask about the complexity of the evolution on the <em>n</em> bits which may be chaotic. Of course, we cannot expect that this chaotic computer can lead to a computation that requires thousands of years in a super computer. But can it lead to a robust computation which is superpolynomial  in <em>n</em> (but polynomial in <em>m</em>)?</p>
<p>I don’t know the general answer but, in any case, I don’t think that it changes the situation here. If the Google claims  stand, I would regard it as a very strong argument against my theory. (Even if the noisy distributions themselves are not robust.) In any case, the question if the samples in the experiments represent robust distributions or are chaotic could and should be tested. (I discussed it in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/03/noisy-quantum-circuits-how-do-we-know-that-we-have-robust-experimental-outcomes-at-all-and-do-we-care/">this post</a>.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If Google’s claims do not stand, will it confirm or give a strong support to your position that quantum supremacy and quantum error correction are impossible?</span></p>
<p>Failure of the Google claim will mainly support the position that quantum supremacy and quantum error correction require substantial improvement of the quality of qubit and gates. It would give a noteworthy support to my position (and probably would draw some attention to it) but I would not regard it as a decisive support. Let me mention that various specific predictions that I made can be tested in the Google, IBM and other systems.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">OK, so why <em>do you think</em> that the quality of qubits and gates <em>cannot</em> be improved?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, this is the crucial point. One argument (that I already mentioned) for thinking that there is a barrier for the quality of gates and qubits is computational theoretic. Computationally speaking NISQ devices are primitive classical computing devices and this gives a strong reason to think that it will not be possible to reduce the error rate to the level allowing computational supremacy. But there is an additional argument: for a wide range of lower levels of noise, reducing the noise will have the effect of making the system more chaotic. So the first argument tells us that there is a small range of error-rates that we can hope to  achieve and the second argument tells us that for a large range  of lower error-rates all we gain is chaos!</span></p>

<h2>Correlated errors and quantum error correction</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">People mainly refer to your conjectures about correlated errors.</span></p>
<p>Yes, this reflects my work between 2005-2013 (and was a central issue in <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/perpetual-motion-of-the-21st-century/">my debate</a> <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/quantum-supremacy-or-classical-control/">with Aram Harrow</a>) and I think it is an important part of the overall picture. But this issue is different than my argument against quantum computers which represents my work between 2014-2019.  I think that my earlier work on error correlation is a key (or a starting point) to the question: What do we learn from failure of quantum computers on general properties of quantum noise. Indeed there are various consequences; some of them are fairly intuitive; some of them are counter-intuitive, and some of them are both. The basic intuition is that once your computation really makes use of a large portion of the Hilbert space, so will the error!</p>
<p>The major challenge is to put this intuition into formal mathematical terms and to relate it to the mathematics and physics of quantum physics.</p>
<p>I made a similar idea in  a comment to Dave Bacon in 2006 when I wrote “I believe that you may be able to approximate a rank-one matrix up to a rank-one error. I do not believe that you will be able to approximate an arbitrary matrix up to a rank one matrix.” to which Dave replied “I will never look at rank one matrices the same <img alt="&#x1F609;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;"/>”. Dave Bacon is among the authors of the new Google paper.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the connection between the ability to achieve quantum supremacy and the ability to achieve quantum error-correction?</span></p>
<p>One of the main claims in my recent works is that quantum supremacy is an easier task compared to creating good quality error-correcting codes. For the attempted experiments by Google, we see  a clear demonstration that achieving good quality quantum error correction is harder than demonstrating quantum supremacy. Low fidelity circuits that Google claims to achieve are far from sufficient for quantum error-correction. The other claim in my argument is that quantum supremacy cannot be achieved without quantum error correction (and, in particular, not at all in the NISQ regime) and this claim is, of course, challenged by the Google claims.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You claim that without quantum error correction to start with we cannot reach quantum supremacy. But maybe John Martinis’ experimental methods have some seeds of quantum error correction inside them?</span></p>
<p>Maybe <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/>  See this 2017 cartoon from <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/10/16/if-quantum-computers-are-not-possible-why-are-classical-computers-possible/">this post</a>.</p>

<p>(Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/h6p_ZeMqGIU">nice overview video from 2014 about my stance and earlier work</a>.)</p>
<h2>The Google experiment: concerns and attacks</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Beside the critique on experimental evidence that could be tested did you find some concrete issues with the Google experiment?</span></p>
<p>Perhaps even too many <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> . In the first post and comments I raised quite a few objections. Some of them are relevant and some of them turned out to be irrelevant or incorrect. Anyway, here, taken from my first post, are some of my concerns and attempted attacks on the Google experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not enough experiments with full histograms; not enough experiments in the regime where they can be directly tested</li>
<li>Classical supremacy argument is overstated and is based on the performance of a specific algorithm</li>
<li>Error correlation may falsify the Google noise model</li>
<li>Low degree Fourier coefficients may fool the statistical test</li>
<li>(Motivated by <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317#comment-1819915">a comment</a> by Ryan.) It is easier to optimize toward the new statistical test “linear cross-ratio entropy” compared to the old logarithmic one.</li>
<li>“System calibration” may reflect an optimization towards the specific required circuit.</li>
<li>The interpolation argument is unjustified (because of the calibration issue).</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We talked about items 1 and 2 what about 3-5. In particular, are correlated errors relevant to the Google experiment?</span></p>
<p>No! (As far as I can see.) Correlated errors mean that in the smoothing the flipped coordinates are positively correlated.  But for the random circuit and the (Porter Thomas) distribution <img alt="D_C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_C"/>  this makes no difference!</p>
<p>As for item 4., it turns out (and this was essentially known by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03176">work of Gao and Duan</a>) that in the case of random circuits (unlike the case of Boson Sampling) there is no low degree coefficients to fool the statistical test.</p>
<p>As for item 5., the answer is “nice observation, but so what?” (Let me note that the supplementary paper of the Google team compares and analyzes the linear and logarithmic statistical measures.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What about the calibration? You got a little overworked about it, no?</span></p>
<p>In almost every scientific experiment there could be concerns that there will be some sort of biased data selection toward the hoped-for result.</p>
<p>Based on the description of the calibration method I got the impression that part of the calibration/verification process (“system calibration”) was carried out towards the experimental outcome for a specific circuit, and that this does not improve the fidelity as the authors thought but rather mistakenly tweaked the experimental outcomes toward a specific probability distribution. This type of calibration would be a major (yet innocent) flaw in the experiment. However, this possibility was excluded by a clear assertion of the researchers regarding the nature of the calibration process, and also by a more careful reading of the paper itself by Peter Shor and Greg Kuperberg. I certainly was, for a short while, way overconfident about this theory.</p>
<p>One nice (and totally familiar) observation is that a blind experiment can largely eliminate the concern of biased data selection.</p>
<h2>So how do you feel, Gil?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">When did you hear about the Google claim?</span></p>
<p>There were certainly some reasons to think that Google’s quantum supremacy was coming for example a quanta magazine article by Kevin Hartnett entitled <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-supremacy-is-coming-heres-what-you-should-know-20190718/">Quantum Supremacy Is Coming: Here’s What You Should Know</a> and another article about Neven’s double exponential law. Also Scott Aaronson gave some hints about it.</p>
<p>On September 18, I met Thomas Vidick in a very nice conference of the Israeli and US academies on the future of computer science (it was mentioned in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/04/computer-science-and-its-impact-on-our-future/">this post</a>, links to all videos will be added here, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo5avBdlLk">Naftali Tishby’s lecture</a> is especially recommended.) Thomas told me about the new expected Google paper.</p>
<p>When I introduced Thomas to <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/09/03/the-prisonner-dilemma-sympathy-and-yaaris-challenge/">Menachem Yaari</a> (who was the president of the Israeli Academy), describing the former as a young superstar in quantum computation, Menachem’s reaction was: “but you do not believe in quantum computers.” I replied that I believe it is a fascinating intellectual area, and that perhaps I am even wrong about them being infeasible. Thomas said: “our area needs more people like Gil.” (!)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What about Scott?</span></p>
<p>Scott and I have been on friendly terms for many years and share a lot of interests and values. We are deeply divided regarding quantum computers and, naturally, I think that I am right and that Scott is wrong. In the context of the Google paper Scott’s references to me and my stance were <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4312#comment-1819487">peculiar</a> and even a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4312#comment-1819821">little hostile</a> which was especially strange since at that time I did not have access to the paper and Scott was the referee of the paper.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gil, how do you vision a situation where you are proven wrong?</span></p>
<p>If my theory of quantum computation being derailed by noise inherent in quantum gates is proven wrong, then physicists will say that I am a mathematician and mathematicians will say that I am a combinatorialist.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and how do you vision  a situation where you are proven right?</span><span id="more-18435"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If my theory of quantum computation being derailed by noise inherent in quantum gates is  proven successful, then physicists will say that I am a mathematician and mathematicians will say that I am a combinatorialist. <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And what would you say if your theory  prevails?</span></p>
<p>Where I <em>have seen further</em> than others, it is because I stood on Peter Shor’s shoulders and looked at the opposite direction. <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>
<h2>Topological</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One last thing, Gil. Nick Read just</span> <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4400#comment-1823614">commented</a> <span style="color: #0000ff;">that experimental evidence is gradually pointing towards you being false on the matter of topological quantum qubits.</span></p>
<p>Nick is a great guy and topological quantum computing is a great topic. The general situation is quite simple and it applies to topological quantum computing like any other form of quantum computing. The way I see it,  gradual experimental progress will hit a barrier and non-gradual experimental progress will be falsified.</p>
<p>(See this 2014 <a href="https://youtu.be/L5gSZsezhoQ">videotaped lecture of mine on topological quantum computing,</a> and also Section 3.5 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">The argument against quantum computers.</a>)</p>

<h2>Appendix: The probability distribution and the statistical tests</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Let’s have an Appendix question. Can you try to briefly describe the probability distribution and the statistical test used in the Google paper?</span></p>
<p>Let me try. We start with a probability distribution described by the density function <img alt="z e^{-z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+e%5E%7B-z%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="z e^{-z}"/> supported on <img alt="\mathbb R_+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R_%2B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb R_+"/>. Now we consider our set <em>X</em> of <em>0-1</em> vectors of length <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>We draw a random probability distribution <img alt="p(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p(x)"/> on <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="X"/>. <img alt="p(x)=q(x)/2^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29%3Dq%28x%29%2F2%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p(x)=q(x)/2^n"/> and the value of <img alt="q(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="q(x)"/> is drawn at random from the probability distribution <img alt="z e^{-z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+e%5E%7B-z%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="z e^{-z}"/>.  (A very slight normalization may still be needed.) A probability distribution of this kind on <img alt="\{0,1\}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\{0,1\}^n"/> is called a Porter-Thomas distribution.</p>
<p>A random quantum circuit <img alt="C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="C"/> leads to a (deterministic) probability distribution <img alt="D_C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_C"/> of this kind. A classical computer can compute the probabilities based on the description of the quantum circuits but this becomes increasingly hard with <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/>. A quantum computer can easily sample  <img alt="x \in \{0,1\}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x \in \{0,1\}^n"/> according to <img alt="D_C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_C"/>.</p>
<p>We are given <img alt="t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="t"/> samples <img alt="x_1,\dots, x_t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cdots%2C+x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_1,\dots, x_t"/> that our noisy quantum computer drew.</p>
<p>Our research hypothesis is that the samples are drawn from <img alt="\rho D_C +(1-\rho)U" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho+D_C+%2B%281-%5Crho%29U&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho D_C +(1-\rho)U"/> where <img alt="U" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="U"/> is a uniform distribution. <img alt="\rho" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho"/> is called the fidelity. The null hypothesis is that the samples were drawn uniformly at random. (There is also a finer description of the noisy distribution with a Gaussian low order term depending on <img alt="C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="C"/>. (This can be seen already from the noise toy model above but I will not discuss it here.)</p>
<p>The main test used in the Google paper is an estimator for <img alt="\rho" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho"/>:</p>
<p><img alt="\frac {2^n}{t} \sum_{i=1}^t D_C(x_i) -1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac+%7B2%5En%7D%7Bt%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Et+D_C%28x_i%29+-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\frac {2^n}{t} \sum_{i=1}^t D_C(x_i) -1"/>.</p>
<p>They also considered a logarithmic version.</p>
<p>The samples in the experiment (at least when <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> is large) are too sparse to identify the probability distribution on <img alt="\{0,1\}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\{0,1\}^n"/>. (This was one of my concerns that was also endorsed by Ryan.) But once you compute the probability distribution <img alt="D_C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_C"/> you can study statistically the set of probabilities that you obtained for your sample. The Google paper offers some interesting statistical studies and in particular a statistical comparison between the set of values <img alt="\{D_C(x_i):i=1,\dots,t\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BD_C%28x_i%29%3Ai%3D1%2C%5Cdots%2Ct%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\{D_C(x_i):i=1,\dots,t\}"/>.</p></div>

    <title>Allston :  Students Should Speak Up</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I have had (as is pretty usual for me) some number of lunches with students this semester, and many of them asked me about the Computer Science move to Allston.  A lot of times, these questions are concerns:  what food will we have there, how frequently will buses run, what sort of space will there be for students to hang out/study etc., what all will be over there?<br/><br/>These are good questions.  I don't know the answers, I think a lot is still being worked out or decided.  I realize that's not a great response. <br/><br/>I've started encouraging students to start asking these questions, more directly, to the powers that be.  Specifically, I've suggested to the small number of undergrads I've been lunching with that they should start sending e-mails to the powers that be, asking whatever questions they have, and expressing their concerns.  If you have questions, or wishes, regarding the food, safety, transportation, etc. at the new Allston building, you should ask or let your desires be known.  And, I'll be frank here, you should not (just) let the faculty know -- we're at best an indirect channel to the powers, and they may listen to all of you more than they listen to us.  Contact the powers directly.<br/><br/>(Graduate students too.)<br/><br/>It might be more impactful if students organize to make their questions and/or wishes known.  Or not.  That's up to you really.  But if you want Allston to be successful from where you stand, now is a pretty good time to get involved, before we all start over there next fall.  For Allston to be the academic home you want, you may have to speak up. <br/><br/>I realize undergrads might not know who are the powers that be that they should contact.  So I'll provide a starting list:<br/><br/>Frank Doyle, Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences<br/>Claudine Gay, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences<br/>Alan Garber, Provost<br/>Rakesh Khurana, Dean of Harvard College<br/>Amanda Claybaugh, Dean of Undergraduate Education<br/><br/>And finally, yes, of course it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_That_Be_(Angel)">Buffy (well, Angel) reference</a>. <br/><br/></div>

    <title>Fully-Dynamic Space-Efficient Dictionaries and Filters with Constant Number of Memory Accesses</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1573603200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Ioana O. Bercea, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/e/Even:Guy.html">Guy Even</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05060">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A fully-dynamic dictionary is a data structure for maintaining sets that
supports insertions, deletions and membership queries. A filter approximates
membership queries with a one-sided error. We present two designs:
</p>
<p>1. The first space-efficient fully-dynamic dictionary that maintains both
sets and random multisets and supports queries, insertions, and deletions with
a constant number of memory accesses in the worst case with high probability.
The comparable dictionary of Arbitman, Naor, and Segev [FOCS 2010] works only
for sets.
</p>
<p>2. By a reduction from our dictionary for random multisets, we obtain a
space-efficient fully-dynamic filter that supports queries, insertions, and
deletions with a constant number of memory accesses in the worst case with high
probability (as long as the false positive probability is $2^{-O(w)}$, where
$w$ denotes the word length). This is the first in-memory space-efficient
fully-dynamic filter design that provably achieves these properties.
</p>
<p>We also present an application of the techniques used to design our
dictionary to the static Retrieval Problem.

through the paradigm of finding diverse collections of $r$ solutions of size at
most $k$ each, which has recently been introduced to the field of parameterized
complexity [Baste et al., 2019]. This paradigm is aimed at addressing the loss
of important side information which typically occurs during the abstraction
process which models real-world problems as computational problems. We use two
measures for the diversity of such a collection: the sum of all pairwise
Hamming distances, and the minimum pairwise Hamming distance. We show that both
problems are FPT in $k + r$ for both diversity measures. A key ingredient in
our algorithms is a (problem independent) network flow formulation that, given
a set of `base' solutions, computes a maximally diverse collection of
solutions. We believe that this could be of independent interest.

case on directed graphs is solvable in polynomial time. In this paper, we show
that the problem is NP-hard in the general case. In addition, some upper bounds

    <title>Sumcheck-based delegation of quantum computing to rational server</title>

to delegate quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a way that the
integrity of the server is efficiently verified by the client. Recently, a new
model of delegated quantum computing has been proposed, namely, rational
delegated quantum computing. In this model, after the client interacts with the
server, the client pays a reward to the server. The rational server sends
messages that maximize the expected value of the reward. It is known that the
classical client can delegate universal quantum computing to the rational
quantum server in one round. In this paper, we propose novel one-round rational
delegated quantum computing protocols by generalizing the classical rational
sumcheck protocol. The construction of the previous rational protocols depends
on gate sets, while our sumcheck technique can be easily realized with any
local gate set. Furthermore, as with the previous protocols, our reward
function satisfies natural requirements. We also discuss the reward gap. Simply
speaking, the reward gap is a minimum loss on the expected value of the
server's reward incurred by the server's behavior that makes the client accept
an incorrect answer. Although our sumcheck-based protocols have only
exponentially small reward gaps as with the previous protocols, we show that a
constant reward gap can be achieved if two non-communicating but entangled
rational servers are allowed. We also discuss that a single rational server is
sufficient under the (widely-believed) assumption that the learning-with-errors
problem is hard for polynomial-time quantum computing. Apart from these
results, we show, under a certain condition, the equivalence between $rational$
and $ordinary$ delegated quantum computing protocols. Based on this
equivalence, we give a reward-gap amplification method.

classic vertex-arrival model of Karp, Vazirani and Vazirani. Finding an
algorithm better than the straightforward greedy strategy remained a major open
question for a long time until a recent negative result by Gamlath et al.
(forthcoming FOCS 2019), who showed that no online algorithm has a competitive
ratio better than $0.5$ in the worst case.
</p>
<p>In this work, we consider the bipartite matching problem with edge arrivals
in the stochastic framework. We find an online algorithm that on average is
$0.506$-competitive. We give a supplementary upper bound of $\frac{2}{3}$ and
also obtain along the way an interesting auxiliary result that if the initial
instance has a $2$-regular stochastic subgraph, then a natural prune &amp; greedy
algorithm matches at least $0.532$-fraction of all vertices.

guarantees, that are robust to adversarial (test time) perturbations. While
there has been an proliferation of recent work on this topic due to its
connections to test time robustness of deep networks, there is limited
theoretical understanding of several basic questions like (i) when and how can
one design provably robust learning algorithms? (ii) what is the price of
achieving robustness to adversarial examples in a computationally efficient
manner?
</p>
<p>The main contribution of this work is to exhibit a strong connection between
achieving robustness to adversarial examples, and a rich class of polynomial
optimization problems, thereby making progress on the above questions. In
particular, we leverage this connection to (a) design computationally efficient
robust algorithms with provable guarantees for a large class of hypothesis,
namely linear classifiers and degree-2 polynomial threshold functions (PTFs),
(b) give a precise characterization of the price of achieving robustness in a
computationally efficient manner for these classes, (c) design efficient
algorithms to certify robustness and generate adversarial attacks in a
principled manner for 2-layer neural networks. We empirically demonstrate the
effectiveness of these attacks on real data.

    <title>Prediction of Bottleneck Points for Manipulation Planning in Cluttered Environment using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network</title>

Kalaichelvi</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04676">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Latest research in industrial robotics is aimed at making human robot
collaboration possible seamlessly. For this purpose, industrial robots are
expected to work on the fly in unstructured and cluttered environments and
hence the subject of perception driven motion planning plays a vital role.
Sampling based motion planners are proven to be the most effective for such
high dimensional planning problems with real time constraints. Unluckily random
stochastic samplers suffer from the phenomenon of 'narrow passages' or
bottleneck regions which need targeted sampling to improve their convergence
rate. Also identifying these bottleneck regions in a diverse set of planning
problems is a challenge. In this paper an attempt has been made to address
these two problems by designing an intelligent 'bottleneck guided' heuristic
for a Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) planner which is based on
relevant context extracted from the planning scenario using a 3D Convolutional
Neural Network and it is also proven that the proposed technique generalises to
unseen problem instances. This paper benchmarks the technique (bottleneck
guided RRT*) against a 10% Goal biased RRT star planner, shows significant
improvement in planning time and memory requirement and uses ABB 1410
industrial manipulator as a platform for implantation and validation of the
results.

commonplace in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols. In PoS, peers are chosen
randomly with probability proportional to the amount of stake that they
possess. This paper presents an approach that relates PoS peer selection to
Roulette-wheel selection, which is frequently used in genetic and evolutionary
algorithms or complex network modelling. In particular, we introduce the use of
stochastic acceptance algorithm [6] for fast peer selection. The roulette-wheel
selection algorithm [6] achieves O(1) complexity based on stochastic
acceptance, whereas searching based algorithms may take O(N ) or O(logN )
complexity in a network of N peers.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Just like I did <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3964">last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3508">the year before</a>, I’m putting up a post to let y’all know about opportunities in our growing <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~qic/">Quantum Information Center</a> at UT Austin.</p>



<p>I’m proud to report that we’re building something pretty good here.  This fall <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/shyamshankar/">Shyam Shankar</a> joined our Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) faculty to do experimental superconducting qubits, while (as I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4233">blogged</a> in the summer) the quantum complexity theorist <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~jswright/">John Wright</a> will join me on the CS faculty in Fall 2020.  Meanwhile, <a href="https://sites.google.com/utexas.edu/potter/home">Drew Potter</a>, an expert on topological qubits, rejoined our physics faculty after a brief leave.  Our weekly quantum information group meeting now regularly attracts around 30 participants—from the turnout, you wouldn’t know it’s not MIT or Caltech or Waterloo.  My own group now has five postdocs and six PhD students—as well as some amazing undergrads striving to meet the bar set by <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3880">Ewin Tang</a>.  Course offerings in quantum information currently include Brian La Cour’s <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/3138-quantum-computing?Itemid=1971">Freshman Research Initiative</a>, my own undergrad <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3943">Intro to Quantum Information Science</a> honors class, and graduate classes on quantum complexity theory, experimental realizations of QC, and topological matter (with more to come).  We’ll also be starting an undergraduate Quantum Information Science concentration next fall.</p>



<p>So without further ado:</p>



<p>(1) If you’re interested in pursuing a PhD focused on quantum computing and information (and/or classical theoretical computer science) at UT Austin: please apply!  If you want to work with me or John Wright on quantum algorithms and complexity, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate/prospective-students/apply">apply to CS</a> (I can also supervise physics students in rare cases).  Also apply to CS, of course, if you want to work with our other CS theory faculty: David Zuckerman, Dana Moshkovitz, Adam Klivans, Anna Gal, Eric Price, Brent Waters, Vijaya Ramachandran, or Greg Plaxton.  If you want to work with Drew Potter on nonabelian anyons or suchlike, or with <a href="https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~macdgrp/">Allan MacDonald</a>, <a href="http://order.ph.utexas.edu/people/Reichl.htm">Linda Reichl</a>, <a href="https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/liopticsut/home">Elaine Li</a>, or others on many-body quantum theory, <a href="https://ph.utexas.edu/prospective-graduate-students/admissions">apply to physics</a>.  If you want to work with Shyam Shankar on superconducting qubits, <a href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/graduate/admissions">apply to ECE</a>.  Note that the deadline for CS and physics is <strong>December 1</strong>, while the deadline for ECE is <strong>December 15</strong>.</p>



<p>You don’t need to ask me whether I’m on the lookout for great students: I always am!  If you say on your application that you want to work with me, I’ll be sure to see it.  Emailing individual faculty members is not how it works and won’t help.  Admissions are extremely competitive, so I strongly encourage you to apply broadly to maximize your options.</p>



<p>(2) If you’re interested in a postdoc in my group, I’ll have approximately two openings starting in Fall 2020.  To apply, just send me an email by <strong>January 1, 2020</strong> with the following info:<br/>– Your CV<br/>– 2 or 3 of your best papers (links or PDF attachments)<br/>– The names of two recommenders (who should email me their letters separately)</p>



<p>(3) If you’re on the faculty job market in quantum computing and information—well, please give me a heads-up if you’re potentially interested in Austin!  Our CS, physics, and ECE departments are all open to considering additional candidates in quantum information, both junior and senior.  I can’t take credit for this—it surely has to do with developments beyond my control, both at UT and beyond—but I’m happy to relay that, in the three years since I arrived in Texas, the appetite for strengthening UT’s presence in quantum information has undergone jaw-dropping growth at every level of the university.</p>



<p>Also, Austin-Bergstrom International Airport now has direct flights to London, Frankfurt, and (soon) Amsterdam and Paris.</p>

    <title>TR19-160 |  Tractable Unordered 3-CNF Games | 

	Md Lutfar Rahman, 

	Thomas Watson</title>
    <summary>The classic TQBF problem can be viewed as a game in which two players alternate turns assigning truth values to a CNF formula's variables in a prescribed order, and the winner is determined by whether the CNF gets satisfied. The complexity of deciding which player has a winning strategy in this game is well-understood: it is NL-complete for 2-CNFs and PSPACE-complete for 3-CNFs.

We continue the study of the unordered variant of this game, in which each turn consists of picking any remaining variable and assigning it a truth value. The complexity of deciding who can win on a given CNF is less well-understood; prior work by the authors showed it is in L for 2-CNFs and PSPACE-complete for 5-CNFs. We conjecture it may be efficiently solvable on 3-CNFs, and we make progress in this direction by proving the problem is in P, indeed in L, for 3-CNFs with a certain restriction, namely that each width-3 clause has at least one variable that appears in no other clause. Another (incomparable) restriction of this problem was previously shown to be tractable by Kutz.</summary>

    <title>TR19-159 |  SETH-hardness of Coding Problems | 

	Noah Stephens-Davidowitz, 

	Vinod Vaikuntanathan</title>
    <summary>We show that assuming the strong exponential-time hypothesis (SETH), there are no non-trivial algorithms for the nearest codeword problem (NCP), the minimum distance problem (MDP), or the nearest codeword problem with preprocessing (NCPP) on linear codes over any finite field. More precisely, we show that there are no NCP, MDP, or NCPP algorithms running in time $q^{(1-\epsilon)n}$ for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ for codes with $q^n$ codewords. (In the case of NCPP, we assume non-uniform SETH.)

We also show that there are no sub-exponential-time algorithms for $\gamma$-approximate versions of these problems for some constant $\gamma &gt; 1$, under different versions of the exponential-time hypothesis.</summary>

    <title>TR19-158 |  Sorting Can Exponentially Speed Up Pure Dynamic Programming | 

	Stasys Jukna, 

	Hannes Seiwert</title>
    <summary>Many discrete minimization problems, including various versions of the shortest path problem, can be efficiently solved by dynamic programming (DP) algorithms that are ``pure'' in that they only perform basic operations, as $\min$, $\max$, $+$, but no conditional branchings via if-then-else in their recursion equations. It is known that any pure $(\min,+)$ DP algorithm solving the minimum weight spanning tree problem on undirected $n$-vertex graphs must perform at least $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ operations. We show  that this problem \emph{can} be solved by a pure  $(\min,\max,+)$ DP algorithm performing only $O(n^3)$ operations. The algorithm is essentially a $(\min,\max)$ algorithm: addition operations are only used to output the final values. The presence of both $\min$ and $\max$ operations means that now DP algorithms can sort: this explains the title of the paper.</summary>

Andrew Granville writes brilliant papers that explain hard results in number theory. He also proves hard results in number theory. </p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I use the famous Goldbach conjecture to discuss a third rail: how to identify which results “should be” true even though they have been too hard to prove.</p>
<p>
Granville has just recently published a graphic novel, <i>Prime Suspects: The Anatomy of Integers and Permutations</i>, with his sister Jennifer Granville and illustrator Robert Lewis. It features constables named Green and Tao, a detective Jack von Neumann, and students named Emmy Germain and Sergei Langer among other allusions to real (and complex) mathematicians. It grew out of a 2009 musical <a href="https://dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/PDF/MSIProgram.pdf">play</a> that premiered at IAS. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/11/goldbach-a-curious-conjecture/graphic/" rel="attachment wp-att-16380"><img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-16380" height="300" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/graphic.jpg?w=240&amp;h=300" width="240"/></a></p>
<p>
The driver of the plot is a deep connection between the frequency of primes below a number <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and that of permutations in <img alt="{S_N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_N}"/> that are “prime” in the sense of having only one cycle. Substituting <img alt="{\log(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\log(x)}"/> for <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> and vice-versa tends to create correspondences of known results in number theory vis-à-vis permutation group theory. See this MAA <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/prime-suspects-the-anatomy-of-integers-and-permutations">review</a>. Going beyond the known theorems described in the novel, we wonder how far such heuristic sleuthing methods can go on long-unsolved cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Goldbach Reminder </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The statement we know as the (Strong) Goldbach Conjecture is that every even number <img alt="{n \ge 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cge+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n \ge 4}"/> can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. It was made in 1742 by Christian Goldbach. He wrote to Leonhard Euler:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Every integer that can be written as the sum of two primes can also be written as the sum of as many primes as desired, until all terms are <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Well, that is not what we call Goldbach’s conjecture. He and many others at the time considered <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> to be a prime number. What he’s getting at can be seen from this snippet of his letter:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/11/goldbach-a-curious-conjecture/goldbachsnippet/" rel="attachment wp-att-16388"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16388" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/goldbachsnippet.png?w=300"/></a></p>
<p>
Above his sums, Goldbach put an asterisk * to the note in the margin, in which he asserts his conjecture:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Wait—that is not the Goldbach conjecture either. It is the “Weak” one and was apparently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7748">proved</a> in 2013 by Harald Helfgott. We discussed this in a 2014 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/is-this-a-proof-2/">post</a> whose larger theme we are continuing here. It also proves the first conjecture, but not the strong conjecture.</p>
<p>
But what Goldbach seems to be driving at with his drawing of sums is having one of the “primes” be <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. Then the strong conjecture is needed. Euler pointed this out in his reply to Goldbach’s letter. But Euler, who was a <a href="https://luthscitech.org/saintly-scientists/">saint</a> in many ways, charitably reminded Goldbach of a communication earlier that year when Goldbach had observed that his first conjecture followed from the strong statement. Euler went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “That every even number should be a sum of two primes I hold to be a completely certain theorem, irrespective of my not being able to prove it.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Ken has translated this a little differently from Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture#Origins">article</a> and its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030616020619/http://claymath.org/Popular_Lectures/U_Texas/Riemann_1.pdf">source</a>, reading into Euler’s words the stance of truth shining apart from proof. How one can justify this stance is what we want to discuss.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Curious Conjecture </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The conjecture is curious on several fronts. For one it is usually said to be “obviously correct.” It has been checked to about <img alt="{10^{18}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%5E%7B18%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{10^{18}}"/> or so by computation. There are many open conjectures in number theory that are likely to be true. But few are claimed to be “true” with such a strong bias. Many other conjectures are likely to be true, but none as likely as the Goldbach. </p>
<p>
In 1975, Hugh Montgomery and Robert Vaughan proved that the Goldbach is true for most even numbers. That is that the number of possible even numbers <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> less than some <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> are not sums of two primes grows like <img alt="{o(N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{o(N)}"/>. Thus if one picks a random even number <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> it is likely to be the sum of two primes. Here the “likely” is a mathematical certainty.</p>
<p>
How do we “know” that it is likely to be true? One source is the method of prime models. Primes are quite mysterious and hard to understand. So there are heuristic models that suggest we think of the primes as “random”. Of course this is silly, since the primes are a deterministic fixed sequence of numbers. But the hope is that the following is true. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If <img alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Gamma}"/> is a statement about the primes that is with high probability in the random model, then it is true. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Of course this is nonsense. </p>
<p>
But it is interesting nonsense. Harald Cramér has a model that is simple. Granville add some refinements to this model <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.facm/1229618748">here</a> and <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/chance_news/for_chance_news/Riemann/cramer.pdf">here</a>. More recently William Banks and Kevin Ford and Terence Tao have a new model for the primes <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08613.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>
These models are useful for making and thinking about number theory conjectures. Perhaps one day they will be able to really be used to determine truth. They are certainly good heuristics to have when studying the prime numbers. We are jealous. In complexity theory it would be wonderful to have anything like these models. Perhaps <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Model Example </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Cramér’s model is simple to state. Imagine that the primes <img alt="{\cal P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+P%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal P}"/> are replaced by a random set <img alt="{\cal R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+R%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal R}"/> by placing <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> in with probability <img alt="{1/\ln n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F%5Cln+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1/\ln n}"/>. And we make these choices independently. The Fermat numbers are those 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  2^{2^{n}} + 1. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5E%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D+%2B+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  2^{2^{n}} + 1. "/></p>
<p>The first of these 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  3, 5, 17, 257, 65537 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%2C+5%2C+17%2C+257%2C+65537+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  3, 5, 17, 257, 65537 "/></p>
<p>are prime. Fermat thought this continued but it is not true. Euler showed that the next is not a prime 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  641 \times 6,700,417. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++641+%5Ctimes+6%2C700%2C417.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  641 \times 6,700,417. "/></p>
<p>An interesting problem is are there any more prime Fermat numbers? Many believe that there are no more, or art most there are a finite number in total. Let’s look at using the model to understand the Fermat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fermat_number&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4">numbers</a>: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\ln F_{n}} = \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\log_{2}\left(2^{2^{n}}+1 \right)} = \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n}  = \frac{2}{\ln 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cln+F_%7Bn%7D%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cln+2%7D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Clog_%7B2%7D%5Cleft%282%5E%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D%2B1+%5Cright%29%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cln+2%7D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+2%5E%7B-n%7D++%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Cln+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\ln F_{n}} = \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\log_{2}\left(2^{2^{n}}+1 \right)} = \frac{1}{\ln 2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^{-n}  = \frac{2}{\ln 2}"/>. </p>
<p>Therefore, the total expected number of Fermat primes is at most finite. Of course this is assuming the model is predictive. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Proved? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our friends at Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture">say</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> As with many famous conjectures in mathematics, there are a number of purported proofs of the Goldbach conjecture, none of which are accepted by the mathematical community. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Try a Google search yourself for “Goldbach conjecture proved”. The top hits include several “proofs” that the conjecture is true. The proofs are all short and simple. All are believed to be wrong. I find it interesting that the proofs, in many cases, use a random like argument in there “proofs”. The trouble is that the above models are only heuristics. So the proofs seem to be incomplete. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Can we imagine getting heuristic models for complexity theory? For quantum algorithms perhaps. What would such heuristic models even look like? We wonder.</p></font></font></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I often give two versions of an exam and TELL THE STUDENTS I am doing this so that they don't even try to cheat. I've even had two different classes take the midterm at the same time, same room, every other seat, so the person next to you is in a different course. And I TELL THE STUDENTS that I am doing this.  A colleague of mine says I shouldn't TELL THE STUDENTS. Here are our arguments<br/>
<br/>
1) Don't tell: students cheat a lot and this is a way to catch them.<br/>
<br/>
2) Tell:  Dealing with cheating distracts from our mission of teaching so best to be preventative so it does not happen. Less noble- tell them so that you don't have to deal with the cheating issue.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard of the following case at a diff school some years ago and want your take on it:<br/>
there was one question on the midterm that was different on the two exams- the prof changed the key number, but they were the same question really. The prof was in a hurry for some reason and <i>FORGOT TO TELL THE STUDENTS</i>. You can probably guess what happened next, but not what happened after that<br/>
<br/>
One of the students exams had the solution to THE OTHER PROBLEM on it. Clearly cheating. When called in the student said:<br/>
<br/>
<i>Since you didn't tell us that they were different exams the cheating claim is unfair!</i><br/>
<i><br/>
</i> They DID admit their guilt, but they DID NOT have any contrition.<br/>
<br/>
 Options for what penalty to go for:<br/>
<br/>
1) A 0 on the exam itself<br/>
<br/>
2) An F in the course<br/>
<br/>
3) A notation on the transcript indicating Failed-because-cheated. I don't know what that notation was at the schol the story took place, but at UMCP its XF. (Side Note- not clear if someone outside of UMCP looks at a transcript and sees an XF they'll know what the means. But the F part makes it look bad.)<br/>
<br/>
4) Expulsion from school. (This might not be the profs call- this may depend on if its a first offense.)<br/>
<br/>
The lack of contrition bothers me, though the prof who told me the story said that the student may have said it out of shock- the first thing that came into their mind. I asked the prof how the student was doing in the class and the prof said, CORRECTLY, that that is irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
SO- what penalty would you go for?<br/>
<br/>
The professor went for XF. The student, at the hearing, once again said<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Since you didn't tell us that they were different exams the cheating claim is unfair!</i><br/>
<br/>
The professor told me that he thinks the student was trying to claim it was entrapment, though he had a hard time expressing this coherently. If the student had been a coherent thinker, he probably wouldn't have needed to cheat.<br/>
<br/>
He got the equivalent of an XF. <br/>
<br/>
But here is my real question: Should we TELL THE STUDENTS that they are different exams (I think yes) or<br/>
should we NOT tell them so can catch them?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <title>TR19-157 |  How QBF Expansion Makes Strategy Extraction Hard | 

	Judith Clymo, 

	Leroy Chew</title>
    <summary>In this paper we show that the QBF proof checking format QRAT (Quantified Resolution Asymmetric Tautologies) by Heule, Biere and Seidl cannot have polynomial-time strategy extraction unless P=PSPACE. In our proof, the crucial property that makes strategy extraction PSPACE-hard for this proof format is universal expansion, even expansion on a single variable. 

While expansion reasoning used in other QBF calculi can admit polynomial time strategy extraction, we find this is conditional on a property studied in proof complexity theory. We show that strategy extraction on expansion based systems can only happen when the underlying propositional calculus has the property of feasible interpolation.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Ten weeks into my move to Italy I am feeling more and more settled. I even eventually got a Milan bus card, which proves that if you really believe in yourself you can achieve anything. I held a midterm for my theoretical computer science undergraduate class, and there were zero students asking for special accommodations and zero students complaining to me about their grade.</p>
<p>According to our national tradition, I like to complain, but Bocconi is really not giving me much to work with.</p>
<p>But enough about me, let’s talk about you. I am going to assume that you want to come to Milan, because, really, why not? Here are some ways in which this can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You are a high school senior and you would like to study computer science in college, but you like math as well</b>: next academic year, Bocconi is starting a new <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/bachelor+of+science/mathematical+and+computing+sciences+for+artificial+intelligence">undergraduate program on math and CS</a>
</li>
<li><strong>You are an undergraduate or masters student applying to PhD programs and you would like to work with me</strong>: next academic year, Bocconi is starting a new <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+statistics+and+computer+science">PhD program on statistics and computer science</a></li>
<li><strong>You are a theory PhD student and you are looking for what to do next summer</strong>: I would be interested in hosting graduate students for part of next summer, especially during the month of July. Ask your advisor to contact me if this is something that you would be interested in</li>
<li><strong>You are a graduating theory PhD student and you are looking for a postdoc next year</strong>: I will have one or two openings for postdocs next year. The call for applications will be up soon. The tax-free salary will be very competitive and Bocconi has exceptionally well-functioning processes to get non-Italian-speakers settled in, help them do the immigration paperwork, look for housing, finding English-speaking primary care physicians, etc.</li>

<li><strong>You are (or might be tempted to be) on the job market for a faculty position</strong>: in light of all the new initiatives on computing, and the current staff of one computer science professor, Bocconi would like to hire at all levels, preferably at the levels of Associate Professor or Full Professor, in computer science, especially in theory and in AI. Salaries are very competitive, they are essentially tax-free for six years for people who have not lived in Italy in the past two years, all teaching is in English, and the university makes it very easy for foreigners to settle in.</li>
<li><strong>You are a professor and your sabbatical is coming up, or you arranged your teaching to have a semester without teaching to do some traveling</strong>: contact me if you are interested in visiting for any length of time.
</li></ul>
<p>I am in Baltimore for FOCS through Tuesday morning if you want to talk to me in person.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This morning a humanities teacher named Richard Horan, having read my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/google-quantum-computer-sycamore.html">NYT op-ed on quantum supremacy</a>, emailed me the following question about it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Is this pursuit [of scalable quantum computation] just an arms race? A race to see who can achieve it first? To what end? Will this achievement yield advances in medical science and human quality of life, or will it threaten us even more than we are threatened presently by our technologies? You seem rather sanguine about its possible development and uses. But how close does the hand on that doomsday clock move to midnight once we “can harness an exponential number of amplitudes for computation”?</p></blockquote>



<p>I thought this question might possibly be of some broader interest, so here’s my response (with some light edits).</p>



<p>Dear Richard,</p>



<p>A radio interviewer asked me a similar question a couple weeks ago—whether there’s an ethical dimension to quantum computing research.  I replied that there’s an ethical dimension to everything that humans do.</p>



<p>A quantum computer is not like a nuclear weapon: it’s not going to directly kill anybody (unless the dilution refrigerator falls on them or something?).  It’s true that a full, scalable QC, if and when it’s achieved, will give a temporary advantage to people who want to break certain cryptographic codes.  The morality of that, of course, could strongly depend on whether the codebreakers are working for the “good guys” (like the Allies during WWII) or the “bad guys” (like, perhaps, Trump or Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping).</p>



<p>But in any case, there’s already a push to switch to new cryptographic codes that already exist and that we think are quantum-resistant.  An actual scalable QC on the horizon would of course massively accelerate that push.  And once people make the switch, we expect that security on the Internet will be more-or-less back where it started.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the big upside potential from QCs is that they’ll provide an unprecedented ability to simulate physics and chemistry at the molecular level.  That could at least <em>potentially</em> help with designing new medicines, as well as new batteries and solar cells and carbon capture technologies—all things that the world desperately needs right now.</p>



<p>Also, the theory developed around QC has already led to many new and profound insights about physics and computation.  Some of us regard that as an inherent good, in the same way that art and music and literature are.</p>



<p>Now, one could argue that the climate crisis, or various other crises that our civilization faces, are so desperate that instead of working to build QCs, we should all just abandon our normal work and directly confront the crises, as (for example) Greta Thunberg is doing.  On some days I share that position.  But of course, were the position upheld, it would have implications not just for quantum computing researchers but for almost everyone on earth—including humanities teachers like yourself.</p>



<p>Best,<br/>Scott</p></div>
