    <title>Algebraic Global Gadgetry for Surjective Constraint Satisfaction</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Chen:Hubie.html">Hubie Chen</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11307">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) on a finite relational structure B
is to decide, given a set of constraints on variables where the relations come
from B, whether or not there is a assignment to the variables satisfying all of
the constraints; the surjective CSP is the variant where one decides the
existence of a surjective satisfying assignment onto the universe of B.
</p>
<p>We present an algebraic framework for proving hardness results on surjective
CSPs; essentially, this framework computes global gadgetry that permits one to
present a reduction from a classical CSP to a surjective CSP. We show how to
derive a number of hardness results for surjective CSP in this framework,
including the hardness of surjective CSP on the reflexive 4-cycle and on the
no-rainbow 3-coloring relation. Our framework thus allows us to unify these
hardness results, and reveal common structure among them; we believe that our
hardness proof for the reflexive 4-cycle is more succinct than the original. In
our view, the framework also makes very transparent a way in which classical
CSPs can be reduced to surjective CSPs.

sensing matrices (where $M &lt; N$) guarantees efficient reconstruction of sparse
vectors. A matrix has the $(s,\delta)$-$\mathsf{RIP}$ property if behaves as a
$\delta$-approximate isometry on $s$-sparse vectors. It is well known that an
$M\times N$ matrix with i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(0,1/M)$ entries is
$(s,\delta)$-$\mathsf{RIP}$ with high probability as long as $s\lesssim
\delta^2 M/\log N$. On the other hand, most prior works aiming to
deterministically construct $(s,\delta)$-$\mathsf{RIP}$ matrices have failed
when $s \gg \sqrt{M}$. An alternative way to find an RIP matrix could be to
draw a random gaussian matrix and certify that it is indeed RIP. However, there
is evidence that this certification task is computationally hard when $s \gg
\sqrt{M}$, both in the worst case and the average case.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we investigate the exact average-case time complexity of
certifying the RIP property for $M\times N$ matrices with i.i.d.
$\mathcal{N}(0,1/M)$ entries, in the "possible but hard" regime $\sqrt{M} \ll
s\lesssim M/\log N$, assuming that $M$ scales proportional to $N$. Based on
analysis of the low-degree likelihood ratio, we give rigorous evidence that
subexponential runtime $N^{\tilde\Omega(s^2/N)}$ is required, demonstrating a
smooth tradeoff between the maximum tolerated sparsity and the required
computational power. The lower bound is essentially tight, matching the runtime
of an existing algorithm due to Koiran and Zouzias. Our hardness result allows
$\delta$ to take any constant value in $(0,1)$, which captures the relevant
regime for compressed sensing. This improves upon the existing average-case
hardness result of Wang, Berthet, and Plan, which is limited to $\delta =
o(1)$.

options and have the potential to alleviate traffic congestion. These
attractive services are challenging from different perspectives. One major
challenge in such systems is to find suitable ride-sharing matchings between
drivers and passengers with respect to the system objective and constraints,
and to provide optimal pickup and drop-off sequence to the drivers. In this
paper, we develop an efficient dynamic tree algorithm to find the optimal
pickup and drop-off sequence. The algorithm finds an initial solution to the
problem, keeps track of previously explored feasible solutions, and reduces the
solution search space when considering new requests. In addition, an efficient
pre-processing procedure to select candidate passenger requests is proposed,
which further improves the algorithm performance. Numerical experiments are
conducted on a real size network to illustrate the efficiency of our algorithm.
Sensitivity analysis suggests that small vehicle capacities and loose excess
travel time constraints do not guarantee overall savings in vehicle kilometer
traveled.

to process a given rooted tree $T$ so as to support efficient subsequent

solution is provided. We indicate the first efficient solution to the static LA
problem that works directly, without resorting to reductions or

    <title>Optimal Lower Bounds for Matching and Vertex Cover in Dynamic Graph Streams</title>

communication complexity of approximate Maximum Matching and Minimum Vertex
Cover with deletions. In our model, Alice holds a set of edges and sends a
single message to Bob. Bob holds a set of edge deletions, which form a subset
of Alice's edges, and needs to report a large matching or a small vertex cover
in the graph spanned by the edges that are not deleted. Our results imply
optimal space lower bounds for insertion-deletion streaming algorithms for
Maximum Matching and Minimum Vertex Cover.
</p>
<p>Previously, Assadi et al. [SODA 2016] gave an optimal space lower bound for
insertion-deletion streaming algorithms for Maximum Matching via the
simultaneous model of communication. Our lower bound is simpler and stronger in
several aspects: The lower bound of Assadi et al. only holds for algorithms
that (1) are able to process streams that contain a triple exponential number
of deletions in $n$, the number of vertices of the input graph; (2) are able to
process multi-graphs; and (3) never output edges that do not exist in the input
graph when the randomized algorithm errs. In contrast, our lower bound even
holds for algorithms that (1) rely on short ($O(n^2)$-length) input streams;
(2) are only able to process simple graphs; and (3) may output non-existing
edges when the algorithm errs.

location problem for multi-commodity flow (LoMuF for short). Given commodities
to be sent from their resources, LoMuF aims at locating their targets so that
the multi-commodity flow is optimized in some sense. LoMuF is a combination of
two fundamental problems, namely, the facility location problem and the network
flow problem. We study the hardness and algorithmic issues of the problem in
various settings. The findings lie in three aspects. First, a series of
NP-hardness and APX-hardness results are obtained, uncovering the inherent
difficulty in solving this problem. Second, we propose an approximation
algorithm for general undirected networks and an exact algorithm for undirected
trees, which naturally induce efficient approximation algorithms on directed
networks. Third, we observe separations between directed networks and
undirected ones, indicating that imposing direction on edges makes the problem
strictly harder. These results show the richness of the problem and pave the
way to further studies.

diversity of moving objects are ubiquitous in research and industry. Similarity
search of a large collection of trajectories is indispensable for turning these
datasets into knowledge. Current methods for similarity search of trajectories
are inefficient in terms of search time and memory when applied to massive
datasets. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a scalable
similarity search for Fr\'echet distance on trajectories, which we call
trajectory-indexing succinct trit-array trie (tSTAT). tSTAT achieves time and
memory efficiency by leveraging locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for Fr\'echet
distance and a trie data structure. We also present two novel techniques of
node reduction and a space-efficient representation for tries, which enable to
dramatically enhance a memory efficiency of tries. We experimentally test tSTAT
on its ability to retrieve similar trajectories for a query from large
collections of trajectories and show that tSTAT performs superiorly with
respect to search time and memory efficiency.

fields of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ are sufficient to derandomize polynomial
identity testing over fields of characteristic $p$. In this setting, existing
work on hardness-randomness tradeoffs for polynomial identity testing requires
either the characteristic to be sufficiently large or the notion of hardness to
be stronger than the standard syntactic notion of hardness used in algebraic
complexity. Our results make no restriction on the characteristic of the field
and use standard notions of hardness.
</p>
<p>We do this by combining the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with a white-box
procedure to take $p$-th roots of circuits computing a $p$-th power over fields
of characteristic $p$. When the number of variables appearing in the circuit is
bounded by some constant, this procedure turns out to be efficient, which
allows us to bypass difficulties related to factoring circuits in
characteristic $p$.
</p>
<p>We also combine the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with recent
"bootstrapping" results in polynomial identity testing to show that a
sufficiently-hard family of explicit constant-variate polynomials yields a
near-complete derandomization of polynomial identity testing. This result holds
over fields of both zero and positive characteristic and complements a recent
work of Guo, Kumar, Saptharishi, and Solomon, who obtained a slightly stronger
statement over fields of characteristic zero.

    <title>Online Coloring and a New Type of Adversary for Online Graph Problems</title>

The new
adversary is parameterized by a single integer $\kappa$, which upper bounds the
number of connected components that the adversary can use at any time during
the presentation of the online graph $G$. We call this adversary "$\kappa$
components bounded", or $\kappa$-CB for short. On one hand, this adversary is
restricted compared to the classical adversary because of the $\kappa$-CB
constraint. On the other hand, we seek competitive ratios parameterized only by
$\kappa$ with no dependence on the input length $n$, thereby giving the new
adversary power to use arbitrarily large inputs.
</p>
<p>We study online coloring under the $\kappa$-CB adversary. We obtain finer
analysis of the existing algorithms $FirstFit$ and $CBIP$ by computing their
competitive ratios on trees and bipartite graphs under the new adversary.
Surprisingly, $FirstFit$ outperforms $CBIP$ on trees. When it comes to
bipartite graphs $FirstFit$ is no longer competitive under the new adversary,
while $CBIP$ uses at most $2\kappa$ colors. We also study several well known
classes of graphs, such as $3$-colorable, $C_k$-free, $d$-inductive, planar,
and bounded treewidth, with respect to online coloring under the $\kappa$-CB
adversary. We demonstrate that the extra adversarial power of unbounded input
length outweighs the restriction on the number of connected components leading
to non existence of competitive algorithms for these classes.

    <title>Complexity Analysis Of Next-Generation VVC Encoding and Decoding</title>

(VVC), provides a superior compression efficiency, its computational complexity
dramatically increases. This paper thoroughly analyzes this complexity for both
encoder and decoder of VVC Test Model 6, by quantifying the complexity
break-down for each coding tool and measuring the complexity and memory
requirements for VVC encoding/decoding. These extensive analyses are performed
for six video sequences of 720p, 1080p, and 2160p, under Low-Delay (LD),
Random-Access (RA), and All-Intra (AI) conditions (a total of 320
encoding/decoding). Results indicate that the VVC encoder and decoder are 5x
and 1.5x more complex compared to HEVC in LD, and 31x and 1.8x in AI,
respectively. Detailed analysis of coding tools reveals that in LD on average,
motion estimation tools with 53%, transformation and quantization with 22%, and
entropy coding with 7% dominate the encoding complexity. In decoding, loop
filters with 30%, motion compensation with 20%, and entropy decoding with 16%,
are the most complex modules. Moreover, the required memory bandwidth for VVC
encoding/decoding are measured through memory profiling, which are 30x and 3x
of HEVC. The reported results and insights are a guide for future research and
implementations of energy-efficient VVC encoder/decoder.

    <title>New Approximation Algorithms for Maximum Asymmetric Traveling Salesman and Shortest Superstring</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1590278400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Paluch:Katarzyna.html">Katarzyna Paluch</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10800">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the maximum asymmetric traveling salesman problem (Max ATSP) we are given
a complete directed graph with nonnegative weights on the edges and we wish to
compute a traveling salesman tour of maximum weight. In this paper we give a
fast combinatorial $\frac{7}{10}$-approximation algorithm for Max ATSP. It is
based on techniques of {\em eliminating} and {\em diluting} problematic
subgraphs with the aid of {\it half-edges} and a method of edge coloring. (A
{\it half-edge} of edge $(u,v)$ is informally speaking "either a head or a tail
of $(u,v)$".) A novel technique of {\em diluting} a problematic subgraph $S$
consists in a seeming reduction of its weight, which allows its better
handling.
</p>
<p>The current best approximation algorithms for Max ATSP, achieving the
approximation guarantee of $\frac 23$, are due to Kaplan, Lewenstein, Shafrir,
Sviridenko (2003) and Elbassioni, Paluch, van Zuylen (2012). Using a result by
Mucha, which states that an $\alpha$-approximation algorithm for Max ATSP
implies a $(2+\frac{11(1-\alpha)}{9-2\alpha})$-approximation algorithm for the
shortest superstring problem (SSP), we obtain also a $(2 \frac{33}{76} \approx
2,434)$-approximation algorithm for SSP, beating the previously best known
(having an approximation factor equal to $2 \frac{11}{23} \approx 2,4782$.)

    <title>Distributed Verifiers in PCP</title>

with a powerful (but untrusted) prover. Distributed verifier proof systems are
a new family of proof models that involve a network of verifier nodes
communicating with a single independent prover that has access to the complete
network structure of the verifiers. The prover is tasked with convincing all
verifiers of some global property of the network graph. In addition, each
individual verifier may be given some input string they will be required to
verify during the course of computation. Verifier nodes are allowed to exchange
messaged with nodes a constant distance away, and accept / reject the input
after some computation.
</p>
<p>Because individual nodes are limited to a local view, communication with the
prover is potentially necessary to prove global properties about the network
graph of nodes, which only the prover has access to. In this system of models,
the entire model accepts the input if and only if every individual node has
accepted.
</p>
<p>There are three models in the distributed verifier proof system family:
$\mathsf{LCP}$, $\mathsf{dIP}$, and our proposed $\mathsf{dPCP}$, with the
fundamental difference between these coming from the type of communication
established between the verifiers and the prover. In this paper, we will first
go over the past work in the $\mathsf{LCP}$ and $\mathsf{dIP}$ space before
showing properties and proofs in our $\mathsf{dPCP}$ system.

<p>Our result fills the key remaining gap in the state-of-the-art MPC algorithms

$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum weight matching as well as for
$(2+\varepsilon)$-approximate minimum cardinality vertex cover. However, the

generalization, Top-2-sadilla to several state of the art approaches, including
the tensor transposition routine used in the SPLATT tensor factorization
library. In serial tests, Quesadilla was the best strategy for 60% of all
tensor and transposition combinations and improved over SPLATT by at least 19%
in half of the combinations. In parallel tests, at least one of Quesadilla or
Top-2-sadilla was the best strategy for 52% of all tensor and transposition
combinations.

investigate the problem of finding a spanning tree of $G$ that satisfies the
constraints imposed by $D$. The restrictions to add an edge in the tree depend
on its neighborhood in $D$. Here, we generalize previously investigated
problems by also considering as input functions $\ell$ and $u$ on $E(G)$ that
give a lower and an upper bound, respectively, on the number of constraints
that must be satisfied by each edge. The produced feasibility problem is
denoted by \texttt{G-DCST}, while the optimization problem is denoted by
\texttt{G-DCMST}. We show that \texttt{G-DCST} is NP-complete even under strong
assumptions on the structures of $G$ and $D$, as well as on functions $\ell$
and $u$. On the positive side, we prove two polynomial results, one for
\texttt{G-DCST} and another for \texttt{G-DCMST}, and also give a simple
exponential-time algorithm along with a proof that it is asymptotically optimal
under the \ETH. Finally, we prove that other previously studied constrained
spanning tree (\textsc{CST}) problems can be modeled within our framework,
namely, the \textsc{Conflict CST}, the \textsc{Forcing CS, the \textsc{At Least
One/All Dependency CST}, the \textsc{Maximum Degree CST}, the \textsc{Minimum
Degree CST}, and the \textsc{Fixed-Leaves Minimum Degree CST}.

    <title>Lasso formulation of the shortest path problem</title>

problem, known as lasso. Based on this formulation, a connection is established
between Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and the least angle regression
(LARS) for the lasso problem. Specifically, the solution path of the lasso
problem, obtained by varying the regularization parameter from infinity to zero
(the regularization path), corresponds to shortest path trees that appear in
the bi-directional Dijkstra algorithm. Although Dijkstra's algorithm and the
LARS formulation provide exact solutions, they become impractical when the size
of the graph is exceedingly large. To overcome this issue, the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve the lasso
formulation. The resulting algorithm produces good and fast approximations of
the shortest path by sacrificing exactness that may not be absolutely essential
in many applications. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the
performance of the proposed approach.

    <summary>We study the MaxRes rule in the context of certifying unsatisfiability. We show that it can be exponentially more powerful than tree-like resolution, and when augmented with weakening (the system MaxResW), p-simulates tree-like resolution. In devising a lower bound technique specific to MaxRes (and not merely inheriting lower bounds from Res), we define a new semialgebraic proof system called the SubCubeSums proof system. This system, which p-simulates MaxResW, is a special case of the Sherali-Adams proof system. In expressivity, it is the integral restriction of conical juntas studied in the contexts of communication complexity and extension complexity. We show that it is not simulated by Res. Using a proof technique qualitatively different from the lower bounds that MaxResW inherits from Res, we show that Tseitin contradictions on expander graphs are hard to refute in SubCubeSums. We also establish a lower bound technique via lifting: for formulas requiring large degree in SubCubeSums, their XOR-ification requires large size in SubCubeSums.</summary>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) roughly asks what the “complexity” of a given string is. Informally, one can think of this as determining the degree of “computational order” a string has.</p>
<p>In the past several years, there has been a resurgence of interest in MCSP. A series of exciting results have begun unraveling what looks to be a fascinating story. This story already reveals deep connections between MCSP and a growing list of fields, including cryptography, learning theory, structural complexity theory, average-case complexity, and circuit complexity. As an example, Santhanam recently proved a conditional equivalence between the complexity of MCSP and the existence of one-way functions.</p>
<p>This talk is split into two parts. The first part is a broad introduction to MCSP, answering the following questions: What is this problem? Why is it interesting? What do we know so far, and where might the story go next? The second part discusses recent joint work with Bruno Loff and Igor Oliveira showing that the “multi-output version” of MCSP is NP-hard.</p></blockquote>

Gerolamo Cardano is often credited with introducing the notion of complex numbers. In 1545, he wrote a book titled <i>Ars Magna</i>. He introduced us to numbers like <img alt="{\sqrt{-5}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B-5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{-5}}"/> in his quest to understand solutions to equations. Cardano was often short of money and gambled and played a certain board game to make money—see the second paragraph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano#Mathematics">here</a>. </p>
<p>
Today, for amusement, Ken and I thought we’d talk about tells.</p>
<p>
What are tells? Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_(poker)">says</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A tell in poker is a change in a player’s behavior or demeanor that is claimed by some to give clues to that player’s assessment of their hand. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/math-tells/tell/" rel="attachment wp-att-17068"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17068" height="300" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/tell.jpg?w=201&amp;h=300" width="201"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Other Tells </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken and I have been thinking of tells in a wider sense—when and whether one can declare inferences amid uncertain information. Historians face this all the time. So do biographers, at least when their subjects are no longer living. We would also like to make inferences in our current world, such as about the pandemic. The stakes can be higher than in poker. In poker, if your “tell” inference is wrong and you lose, you can play another hand—unless you went all in. With science and other academic areas the attitude must be that you’re all-in all the time.</p>
<p>
Cardano furnishes several instances. Wikipedia—which we regard as an equilibrium of opinions—says that Cardano </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> acknowledged the existence of imaginary numbers … [but] did not understand their properties, [which were] described for the first time by his Italian contemporary Rafael Bombelli. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This is a negative inference from how one of Cardano’s books stops short of treating imaginary numbers as objects that follow rules. </p>
<p>
There are also questions about whether Cardano can be considered “the father of probability” ahead of Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. Part of the problem is that Cardano’s own writings late in life recounted his first erroneous reasonings as well as final understanding in a Hamlet-like fashion. Wikipedia doubts whether he really knew the rule of multiplying probabilities of independent events, whereas the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2113/index_files/Gorroochurn-Some Laws.pdf">essay</a> by Prakash Gorroochurn cited there convinces us that he did. Similar doubt extends to how much Cardano knew about the natural sciences, as correct inferences (such as mountains with seashell fossils having once been underwater) are mixed in with what we today regard as howlers.</p>
<p>
Every staging of Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i> shows a book by Cardano—or does it? In Act II, scene 2, Polonius asks, “What do you read, my lord?”; to which Hamlet first replies “Words words words.” Pressed on the book’s topic, Hamlet perhaps references the section “Misery of Old Age” in Cardano’s 1543 book <i>De Consolatione</i> but what he <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/nofear/shakespeare/hamlet/page_102/">says</a> is so elliptical it is hard to tell. The book also includes particular allusions between sleep and death that go into Hamlet’s soliloquy opening Act III. The book had been published in England in 1573 as <i>Cardan’s Comfort</i> under the aegis of the Earl of Oxford so it was well-known. Yet the writer Italo Calvino <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pQabBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=Hamlet+words+words+words+Cardano&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mu1gcM6b8E&amp;sig=ACfU3U3W7te91qlDaIIC8EeHLM1GxpR2Dw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikkNjX1MfpAhWChHIEHQaWDZsQ6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hamlet words words words Cardano&amp;f=false">held back</a> from the inference:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> To conclude from this that the book read by Hamlet is definitely Cardano, as is held by some scholars of Shakespeare’s sources, is perhaps unjustified. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
To be sure, there are some who believe Shakespeare’s main source was Oxford, in manuscripts if not flesh and blood. One reason we do not go there is that we do not see the wider community as having been able to establish reliable principles for judging what kinds of inferences are probably valid. We wonder if one could do an experiment of taking resolved cases, removing most of the information to take them down to the level of unresolved cases, and seeing what kinds of inferences from partial information would have worked.  That’s not our expertise, but within our expertise in math and CS, we wonder if a little experiment will be helpful.</p>
<p>
To set the idea, note that imaginary numbers are also called complex numbers. Yet the term complex numbers can mean other things. Besides numbers like <img alt="{2 + 3i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2+%2B+3i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2 + 3i}"/> it also can mean how hard it is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_complexity">construct</a> a number. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In number theory, the integer complexity of an integer is the smallest number of ones that can be used to represent it using ones and any number of additions, multiplications, and parentheses. It is always within a constant factor of the logarithm of the given integer. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
How easy is it to tell what kind of “complex” is meant if you only have partial information?  We don’t only mean scope-of-terminology issues; often a well-defined math object is used in multiple areas.  Let’s try an experiment.</p>

    <title>TR20-081 |  Algebraic Hardness versus Randomness in Low Characteristic | 

	Robert Andrews</title>
    <summary>We show that lower bounds for explicit constant-variate polynomials over fields of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ are sufficient to derandomize polynomial identity testing over fields of characteristic $p$. In this setting, existing work on hardness-randomness tradeoffs for polynomial identity testing requires either the characteristic to be sufficiently large or the notion of hardness to be stronger than the standard syntactic notion of hardness used in algebraic complexity. Our results make no restriction on the characteristic of the field and use standard notions of hardness.

We do this by combining the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with a white-box procedure to take $p$-th roots of circuits computing a $p$-th power over fields of characteristic $p$. When the number of variables appearing in the circuit is bounded by some constant, this procedure turns out to be efficient, which allows us to bypass difficulties related to factoring circuits in characteristic $p$.

We also combine the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with recent ``bootstrapping'' results in polynomial identity testing to show that a sufficiently-hard family of explicit constant-variate polynomials yields a near-complete derandomization of polynomial identity testing. This result holds over fields of both zero and positive characteristic and complements a recent work of Guo, Kumar, Saptharishi, and Solomon, who obtained a slightly stronger statement over fields of characteristic zero.</summary>

    <title>TR20-080 |  Continuous LWE | 

	Joan Bruna, 

	Oded Regev, 

	Min Jae Song, 

	Yi Tang</title>
    <summary>We introduce a continuous analogue of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, which we name CLWE. We give a polynomial-time quantum reduction from worst-case lattice problems to CLWE, showing that CLWE enjoys similar hardness guarantees to those of LWE. Alternatively, our result can also be seen as opening new avenues of (quantum) attacks on lattice problems. Our work resolves an open problem regarding the computational complexity of learning mixtures of Gaussians without separability assumptions (Diakonikolas 2016, Moitra 2018). As an additional motivation, (a slight variant of) CLWE was considered in the context of robust machine learning (Diakonikolas et al.~FOCS 2017), where hardness in the statistical query (SQ) model was shown; our work addresses the open question regarding its computational hardness (Bubeck et al.~ICML 2019).</summary>

    <title>TR20-079 |  On Minimizing Regular Expressions Without Kleene Star | 

	Hermann Gruber , 

	Markus Holzer, 

	Simon Wolfsteiner</title>
    <summary>Finite languages lie at the heart of literally every regular expression. Therefore, we investigate the approximation complexity of minimizing regular expressions without Kleene star, or, equivalently, regular expressions describing finite languages. On the side of approximation hardness, given such an expression of size~$s$, we prove that it is impossible to approximate the minimum size required by an equivalent regular expression within a factor of  $O\left(\frac{s}{(\log s)^{2+\delta}}\right)$ if the running time is bounded by a quasipolynomial function depending on~$\delta$, for every $\delta&gt;0$, unless the exponential time hypothesis (ETH) fails. For approximation ratio~$O(s^{1-\delta})$, we prove an exponential time lower bound depending on~$\delta$, assuming ETH. The lower bounds apply for alphabets of constant size. On the algorithmic side, we show that the problem can be approximated in polynomial time within~$O(\frac{s\log\log s}{\log s})$, with~$s$ being the size of the given regular expression. For constant alphabet size, the bound improves to~$O(\frac{s}{\log s})$. Finally, we devise a familiy of superpolynomial approximation algorithms that attain the performance ratios of the lower bounds, while their running times are only slightly above those excluded by the ETH.</summary>

    <title>Incentive Compatible Sensitive Surveys</title>

<p>In this post, we discuss three papers which propose solutions to this problem through the lens of <em>mechanism design</em>. The idea is to carefully design payments so that we received an unbiased sample, leading to a hopefully accurate estimate.</p>

<h2><strong>Model</strong></h2>

<p>We use <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> to denote agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>‘s data (e.g., her weight). We assume that each agent also has a personal cost <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>, representing her level of reluctance to reveal her data. Agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> is willing to reveal <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> if and only if she receives a payment of at least <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>. Our goal is to allocate higher payments to agents with higher <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>‘s, in order to get an unbiased sample. However, we also must obey an budget constraint: we cannot spend more than <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B"/> total. The solution is to transact non-deterministically: with some probability, offer to purchase an agent’s data. Agents with higher costs will receive higher payments, but lower transaction probabilities.</p>

<p>We assume that agents are drawn at random independently from some distribution. Our crucial assumption is that we known the marginal distribution of agent costs, which we denote <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}"/> (we will explore later what happens when this assumption is removed). However, we do not know the distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>, and that distribution can be arbitrarily correlated with <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}"/>. As mentioned above, one might expect agents with less “desirable” <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s may have higher costs, but one can imagine more complex correlations as well.</p>

<p>Our mechanisms consist of two parts: an <em>allocation rule</em> <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/>, and a <em>payment rule</em> <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>. Given <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>, the mechanism works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Ask each agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> to report <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>. Let <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/> denote the actual reported cost.</li><li>With probability <img alt="A(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A(c)"/>, we purchase the agent’s data and pay her <img alt="P(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c)"/>. With probability <img alt="1 - A(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+-+A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="1 - A(c)"/>, we do not buy the data, and no payment is made.</li><li>At the end, use the data we learned to form an estimate of the population average of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>. Let <img alt="\bar{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{z}"/> denote our estimate.</li></ol>

<p>In this model, agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>‘s expected utility for reporting <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/> is <img alt="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_i%28c%29+%3D+A%28c%29+%28P%28c%29+-+c_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)"/>.</p>

<p>We have four main requirements:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Truthfulness. </strong>It should be in each agent’s best interest to truthfully report <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>.</li><li><strong>Individual rationality. </strong>Agents should not receive negative utility if they are honest, i.e., we should have <img alt="P(c_i) \ge c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c_i%29+%5Cge+c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c_i) \ge c_i"/> for all <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>.</li><li><strong>Budget constrained. </strong>Our total expected payment should not exceed <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B"/>, i.e., <img alt="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Csum_i+A%28c_i%29+P%28c_i%29%5D+%5Cle+B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B"/>.</li><li><strong>Unbiased. </strong>Our estimate isn’t consistently too high or too low. Specifically, the expected value of our estimate should be equal to the true average, i.e., <img alt="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Cbar%7Bz%7D%5D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Bz_i%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]"/>.</li></ol>

<p>Lack of bias doesn’t mean that our estimate is accurate, however. To this end, our primary goal is to <strong>minimize the variance</strong>, subject to the mechanism obeying the four above criteria. We evaluate variance via a worst-case framework: given a mechanism, we wish minimize the variance with respect to the worst-case distribution of agents for that mechanism. The idea is that the distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s is not known to the mechanism, so we require it to perform well for all distributions.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1729" height="203" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/goal.jpg?w=970" width="438"/>Goal.</figure></div>

<p>When we refer to the “optimal” mechanism, we mean minimum variance, subject to being truthful, individually rational, budget constrained, and unbiased (henceforth TIBU).</p>

<p><strong>The Horvitz Thomspon Estimator</strong></p>

<p>Once we have learned the <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s, how do we actual form an estimate of the mean? Luckily for us, this question has a simple answer. If we restrict ourselves to linear unbiased estimators, there is a unique way to do this, known as the <em>Horvitz-Thompson estimator</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum%5Climits_i+%5Ccfrac%7Bz_i%7D%7BA%28c_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}"/></p>

<p>Thus our task is simply to choose <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>.</p>

<h2>Approach #1</h2>

<p>This model was first considered by Roth and Schoenebeck (2012). They are able to characterize a mechanism which is TIBU and has variance at most <img alt="1/n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="1/n"/> more than the optimal variance, where <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n"/> is the number of agents. However, they do make the strong assumption that <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> is either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Their approach relies on <em>Take-It-Or-Leave-It</em> mechanisms. Such a mechanism is defined by a distribution $G$ over the positive real numbers, and works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Each agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> reports a cost <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/>.</li><li>Sample a payment <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> from <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/>.</li><li>If <img alt="p \ge c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%5Cge+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p \ge c"/>, buy the agent’s data with payment <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/>. If <img alt="p &lt; c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3C+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p &lt; c"/>, do not buy the agent’s data.</li></ol>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" height="212" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDzLmHAWwAAEPkl.jpg" width="293"/></figure></div>

<p>This amounts to an allocation rule <img alt="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29+%3D+1+-+%5Ctext%7BPr%7D%5Bp%5Cge+c%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]"/>, and a payment rule <img alt="P(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c)"/> equal to the distribution <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/> conditioned on being at least <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/>. The authors show that these mechanisms are fully general, i.e., any allocation and payment rule can be implemented by a Take-It-Or-Leave-It mechanism.</p>

<p>The proof of their main result is primarily based on using the calculus of variations to optimize over the space of distributions <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/>. The paper contains some additional results, for example regarding an alternate model where we wish to minimize the budget, but that is outside the scope of this blog post.</p>

<h2>Approach #2</h2>

<p>Although the above result is a great step, it leaves room for improvement. First of all, the assumption that <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> is binary is quite strong, and does not apply to our running example of body weight. Secondly, their mechanism does not quite achieve the optimal variance. Chen et al. (2018) remedy both of these concerns. That is, they allow <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> to be any real number, and they characterize the TIBU mechanism with optimal variance. Their result also generalizes to more complex statistical estimates, not just the average <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>, and it holds for both continuous and discrete agent distributions.</p>

<p>The approach of Chen et al. (2018) is based on two primary ideas. First, they show that any monotone allocation rule (i.e., we are always less likely to purchase data from an agent with higher cost) can be implemented in a TIBU fashion by a unique payment rule. Thus we only need to identify the optimal allocation rule. (This is similar to the standard result from auction theory about implementable monotone allocation rules (Myerson 1981).)</p>

<p>The second idea is to view the problem as a zero-sum game between ourselves (the mechanism designer) and an adversary who chooses the distribution of agents. Given a distribution, we choose an allocation rule to minimize the variance, and given an allocation rule, the adversary chooses a distribution to maximize the variance.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" height="297" src="https://i2.wp.com/marketbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Zero-Sum-Game.jpg?fit=511%2C521&amp;ssl=1&amp;resize=1200%2C1223.4833659491" width="292"/></figure></div>

<p>The authors are able to solve for the equilibrium of this game and thus identify the TIBU mechanism with minimum possible variance.</p>

<h2>Approach #3</h2>

<p>Approach #2 gave us our desired result: a minimum variance mechanism subject to our four desired properties (TIBU), for any distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‘s. But we are still making a very strong assumption: that we know the distribution of agent costs.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1766" height="230" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/prior.png?w=500" width="427"/></figure></div>

<p>Chen and Zheng (2019) do away with this assumption in a follow-up paper. They consider a model where the mechanism has no prior information on the distribution of costs (or on the distribution of data), and $n$ agents arrive one-by-one in a uniformly random order. Each agent reports a cost, and we decide whether to buy her data, and what to pay her. In order to price well, we need to learn the cost distribution, but we must do this while simultaneously making irrevocable purchasing decisions. The main result is a TIBU mechanism with variance at most a constant factor worse than optimal.</p>

<p>The authors note that after each step <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>, the reported costs up to that point induce an empirical cost distribution <img alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}_i"/>. Using the results of Chen et al. (2018), we can determine the optimal mechanism for <img alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}_i"/>. The basic idea is to use that mechanism for the current step, learn a new agent cost <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/> (note that the agent reports <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/> regardless of whether we purchase her data) and then update our empirical distribution accordingly. (The authors actually end up using an approximately optimal allocation rule, but the idea is the same.) The mechanism also uses more budget in the earlier rounds, to make up for the pricing being less accurate.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>In this post, we considered the problem of surveying a sensitive attribute where an agent’s data may be correlated with their willingness to participate. We discussed three different approaches, all of which rely of giving higher payments to agents with higher costs, in order to incentivize them to participate and to obtain an unbiased estimate. The final approach was able to give a truthful, individually rational, budget feasible, and unbiased mechanism with approximately optimal variance, without making any prior assumptions on the distribution of agents.</p>

<p>However, all three of the approaches assume that agents cannot lie about the data. This is reasonable for some attributes, such as a body weight, where an agent can be asked to step onto a physical scale. However, requiring participants come in person to a particular location will certainly lead to less engagement. Furthermore, for other sensitive attributes, there may not be a verifiable way to obtain the data. Future work could investigate alternative models where this assumption is not necessary. For example, perhaps agents do not maliciously lie, but rather are simply inaccurate at reporting their own attributes. For example, research has demonstrated that people consistently over-report height and under-report weight (e.g., Gorber et al., 2007). Could a mechanism learn the pattern of inaccuracy and compensate for that to still obtain an unbiased estimate?</p>

    <title>Obit for Richard Dudley</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div>
Richard M. (Dick) Dudley died on Jan. 19, 2020 (NOT from Coronavirus).You can find obituaries for him  <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/richard-dudley-mit-mathematics-professor-emeritus-dies-0218">here</a>, <a href="https://math.mit.edu/about/history/obituaries/dudley.php">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/in-memory/in-memory">here</a> and an interview with him from 2019  <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056041">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Professor Dudley worked in Probability and Statistics. His work is now</div>
<div>
being used in Machine Learning. Here is a guest-post-obit by</div>
<div>
David Marcus who had Prof. Dudley as his PhD Thesis Advisor.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
-----------------------------------</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Guest Blog Obit by David Marcus:</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Dick was my thesis advisor at M.I.T. After I got my Ph.D. in 1983, I went</div>
<div>
to work in industry, so did not work closely with him, as some of his other</div>
<div>
students did. But, I enjoyed working with him very much in graduate school.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Dick was very precise. His lecture notes and articles (and later his books)</div>
<div>
said exactly what needed to be said and didn't waste words. In his classes,</div>
<div>
he always handed out complete lecture notes, thus letting you concentrate</div>
<div>
on the material rather than having to take a lot of notes.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Dick was very organized, but his office had piles of papers and journal</div>
<div>
articles everywhere. There is a picture <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/richard-dudley-mit-mathematics-professor-emeritus-dies-0218">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Before Dick was my advisor, I took his probability course. My orals were</div>
<div>
going to be towards the end of the term, and I was going to use probability</div>
<div>
as one of my two minor areas. So, I spent a lot of time studying the</div>
<div>
material. Dick gave a final exam in the course. The final exam was unlike</div>
<div>
any other final exam I ever took: The exam listed twelve areas that had</div>
<div>
been covered in the course. The instructions said to pick ten and for each</div>
<div>
area give the main definitions and theorems and, if you had time, prove the</div>
<div>
theorems. Since I had been studying the material for my orals, I didn't</div>
<div>
have much trouble, but if I hadn't been studying it for my orals, it would</div>
<div>
have been quite a shock!(COMMENT FROM BILL: Sounds like a lazy way to make up an exam, though on this</div>
<div>
level of may it works. I know of a prof whose final was</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Make up 4 good questions for the final. Now Solve them.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Once Dick became my advisor, Dick and I had a regular weekly meeting. I'd</div>
<div>
tell him what I'd figured out or what I'd found in a book or journal</div>
<div>
article over the last week and we'd discuss it and he'd make suggestions.</div>
<div>
At some point, I'd say I needed to think about it, and I'd leave. I never</div>
<div>
did find out how long these meetings were supposed to last because I was</div>
<div>
always the one to end them.(COMMENT FROM BILL: It's good someone ended them! Or else you might never</div>
<div>
had graduated :-) )</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
When I began working with Dick, he said he already had a full</div>
<div>
load of students, but he would see if he had something I could work on. The</div>
<div>
problem Dick came up with for me to work on was to construct a</div>
<div>
counterexample to a theorem that Dick had published. Dick knew his</div>
<div>
published proof was wrong, and had an idea of what a counterexample might</div>
<div>
look like, so suggested I might be able to prove it was a counterexample.</div>
<div>
In retrospect, this was perhaps a risky thesis problem for me since if the</div>
<div>
student gets stuck, the professor can spend time figuring out how to do it.</div>
<div>
But, in this case, presumably Dick had already put some effort into it</div>
<div>
without success. Regardless, with Dick's guidance, I was able to prove it,</div>
<div>
and soon after got my Ph.D.(COMMENT FROM BILL: Sounds risky since if Dick could not do it, maybe it's too hard.)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
In 2003 there was a conference in honor of Dick's 65th birthday. All of his</div>
<div>
ex-students were invited, and many of them attended. There was a day of</div>
<div>
talks, and we all went out to dinner (Chinese food, if I recall correctly)</div>
<div>
in the evening. At dinner, I asked Dick if any of his other students had</div>
<div>
written a thesis that disproved one of his published theorems. He said I</div>
<div>
was the only one.(COMMENT FROM BILL: Really good that not only was he okay with you disproving</div>
<div>
his theorem, he encouraged you to!)</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
<br/></div></div>

    <title>TR20-077 |  Factorization of Polynomials Given by Arithmetic Branching Programs | 

	Amit Sinhababu, 

	Thomas Thierauf</title>
    <summary>Given a multivariate polynomial computed by an arithmetic branching program (ABP) of size $s$, we show that all its factors can be computed by arithmetic branching programs of size $\text{poly}(s)$. Kaltofen gave a similar result for polynomials computed by arithmetic circuits. The previously known best upper bound for ABP-factors was $\text{poly}(s^{\log s}) $.</summary>

<p><i> We discuss our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">paper</a>
on diagnosing bias in dataset replication 
studies. Zooming in on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">ImageNet-v2</a>
reproduction effort, we explain the majority of the accuracy drop between
ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 (from 11.7% to 3.6%) after accounting
for bias in the data collection process. </i></p>

<h2 id="measuring-progress-in-supervised-learning">Measuring Progress in Supervised Learning</h2>
<p>In the last few years, researchers have made extraordinary progress on
increasing accuracy on vision tasks like those in the <a href="http://image-net.org">ImageNet</a>,
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a>, and <a href="http://cocodataset.org/#home">COCO</a> datasets. Progress on these tasks is promising, but
comes with an important caveat: the test sets used to measure performance are
finite, fixed, and have been used and re-used by countless researchers over
several years.</p>

<p>There are (at least) two possible ways in which evaluating solely with test-set
accuracy could hinder our progress on the tasks researchers design benchmarks to
proxy (e.g. general image classification for ImageNet). The first of these
issues is adaptive overfitting: since each dataset has only one test
set to measure performance on, algorithmic progress on that (finite and fixed)
test set could be mistaken for algorithmic progress on the distribution from
which the test set was chosen from.</p>

<p>The second issue that could arise is
oversensitivity to irrelevant properties of the test distribution
arising from the dataset collection process; for example, the image encoding
algorithm used to save images.</p>

<p><em>How can we assess whether models are truly making progress on the tasks that
our benchmarks proxy</em>?</p>

<h3 id="dataset-replication">Dataset replication</h3>
<p>A promising approach to diagnosing the two above issues is <em>dataset
replication</em>, in which one mimics the original test set creation process as
closely as possible to make a new dataset. Then, existing models’ performance on
this newly created test set should identify any models that have adaptively
overfit to the original test set. Moreover, since every intricacy of a dataset
collection process cannot be mimicked exactly, natural variability in the
replication should help us unearth cases of algorithms’ oversensitivity to the
original dataset creation process.</p>

<p>The problem of replicating the original test set creation process is harder than it may initially appear. Particularly challenging is controlling for relevant covariates In experimental design, a <a href="https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/confusing-statistical-terms-5-covariate/">covariate</a>is a variable that is not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables#Statistics">independent variable</a> (in our case the choice of dataset), but affects measurements of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables#Statistics">dependent variable</a> (in our case the accuracy).&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; For example, suppose we wanted to replicate a study about the effect of a certain drug on an age-linked disease. After gathering subjects, we have to reweight or filter them so that the age distribution matches that of the original study, as otherwise the results of the studies are incomparable. This filtering/reweighting step is analogous to dataset replication, with participant age being the relevant covariate., or variables that we expect to have an impact on the outcome (i.e., model accuracy) we measure.</p>

<p>To match covariate distributions between the new reproduction and the original
dataset, we frame dataset replication as a two-step process. In step one, the
replicator collects candidate data using a data pipeline as similar as possible
to that used by the original dataset creators. Then, after approximating the
original pipeline, the dataset replicator should identify the relevant covariate
statistic(s), and choose candidates (via filtering or reweighting the collected
candidate data) so that the distributions of the statistic under the replicated
and original datasets are equal. We call this process statistic
matchingIn causal inference literature, statistic matching is often
referred to as enforcing covariate balance..</p>

<h3 id="imagenet-v2">ImageNet-v2</h3>
<p>In their recent work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Recht et al.</a> use
dataset replication to take a closer look at model performance on ImageNet, one
of the most widely used computer vision datasets. They first use an apparatus
similar to that of the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575">ImageNet
paper</a> to collect a large set of candidate
images and labels from the photo-sharing site <a href="https://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Then, in the second step, they identify and control for a covariate called the
“selection frequency.” Selection frequency is a measure of how frequently a
(time-limited) human decides that an image (with its candidate label) is
“correctly labeled.” We can get estimate selection frequencies by asking crowd
workers questions like:</p>

<p><br/>
<!-- PIPELINE DIAGRAM --></p>

  <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/idbias/selfreq.png"/>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Selection frequency is a very reasonable (and in some sense, the
“right”) covariate to control for, since the original ImageNet dataset 
was filtered using a similar measureTo construct ImageNet, the
authors scraped many candidate image-label pairs, and just as above, asked
crowd workers whether the image corresponded to the label---filtering was done
via a convincing-majority vote procedure, making the selection frequency a
relevant metric.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Recht et al.</a> obtain empirical selection
frequency estimates for the ImageNet validation set and their collected
candidate pool by presentingThe figure above is simplified for
clarity—in reality, datapoints are presented to the crowd workers as
groups of 48 images, all corresponding to the same candidate label, and
annotators are asked to select the images in that group that truly correspond to
the
label. each (image, label) pair to 10 crowd workers.</p>

<p>By filtering on the selection frequency in various ways, the authors come up
with three new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImageNet-v2</code> datasets. One of these, called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MatchedFrequency</code>, is a “true” dataset replication in the sense that it tries
to control for the selecion frequency by filtering the candidate images and
labels so that the resulting selection frequency distribution matches that of
the original ImageNet validation set. 
Since our focus is on dataset
replication, from now on we’ll ignore the other datasets, and use
“MatchedFrequency” and “ImageNet-v2” interchangeably. For convenience, we’ll
also use “ImageNet” and “ImageNet-v1” interchangeably to refer to the original
ImageNet validation setSince the test set is not released, the
ImageNet validation set usually acts as a de facto test set, and the two terms
(validation and test) are used interchangeably to refer to the validation
set..</p>

<p>The key observation made by the ImageNet-v2 authors—and the one that we’ll
focus on in this post—is a <em>consistent</em> drop in accuracy that models suffer
when evaluated on ImageNet-v2 instead of ImageNet:</p>

<p><br/></p>
<canvas height="200" id="v1v2_orig" width="400"/>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Each dot in the scatter plot above represents a model—the $x$ coordinate is
the model’s ImageNet accuracy, and the $y$ coordinate is the model’s accuracy
when evaluated on ImageNet-v2. (You can mouse over the dots to see
model names!) Ideally, since the generating pipelines for the two datasets are
similar, and the relevant covariates were matched, one would expect all of the
models to fall on the dotted line $y = x$. Yet, across the examined models,
their accuracies dropped by an average of 11.7% between ImageNet and
ImageNet-v2.</p>

<h2 id="our-findings">Our Findings</h2>
<p>The significant accuracy drop above presents an empirical mystery given the
similarity in data pipeline between the two datasets. Why do classifiers perform
so poorly on ImageNet-v2?</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">work</a>, we identify an aspect of the dataset reproduction process
that might lead to a significant accuracy drop. The general phenomenon we
identify is that in dataset replication, even mean-zero noise in measurements of
the relevant covariate/control variable can result in significant bias in the
resulting matched dataset if not accounted for.</p>

<p>In the case of ImageNet-v2, we show how noisy readings of the selection
frequency statistic can result in bias in the ImageNet-v2 dataset towards lower
selection frequency and consequently, lower accuracyRecht et al. observed previously that changes in selection frequency affect model performance..</p>

<p>After accounting for this bias and thus controlling for selection
frequency, we estimate that the adjusted ImageNet to ImageNet-v2
accuracy gap is less than or equal to 3.6% (instead of the initially observed
11.7%).</p>

<p>In the next few sections, we’ll focus on ImageNet-v2, first trying to get a
clearer picture of the source of statistical bias in this dataset replication
effort, and then discussing ways to correct for it.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-the-bias">Identifying the bias</h3>

<p>Earlier, we decomposed the data replication process into two steps: (1)
replicating the pipeline, and (2) controlling for covariates via statistic
matching. 
To perform the latter of these two steps, one
first needs to find the distribution of the relevant statistic (e.g., selection
frequency, in the case of ImageNet) for both the original test set as well as
the newly collected data. 
Just as with any empirical statistic, however, we can’t 
read the true selection frequency $s(x)$ for any given image $x$. We can only sample from a binomial random variable,</p>

<p>\[
    \widehat{s}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\text{Binomial}(n, s(x)),
\]</p>

<p>to obtain a selection frequency estimate, i.e., where $n$
is the number of crowd workers used.</p>

<p>Now, even though the expected value of the measurement we get is indeed $s(x)$
(i.e., $\widehat{s}(x)$ is an unbiased estimator of $s(x)$), 
the reading itselfThis is not the same as the underlying selection frequency for an image; for example, a
image-label pair $x$ might have a true selection frequency of $s(x) = 0.645$,
meaning that on average a crowd annotator is 64.5% likely to say that the image
corresponds to the label. If we ask 10 crowd annotators to label the pair,
however, we never observe this 64.5% number. will be $k/n$ for some integer $k$ (with $n=10$, in the
case of the ImageNet-v2 replication process).</p>

<p>To see why this seemingly innocuous fact impacts the dataset replication
process, suppose we knew exactly what the distribution of true selection
frequency looked like for both the original ImageNet test set and the candidate
images collected through the ImageNet-v2 replication pipeline:</p>

<p><br/></p>
<canvas id="priorCtx"/>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Suppose now that we estimate a selection frequency of $\widehat{s}(x) = 0.7$ for
a given image $x$ (i.e., seven of the ten workers who were shown the image and
its candidate label, marked it as correctly labeled). The key observation here
is that given this empirical selection frequency, the most likely value for
$s(x)$ is not $\widehat{s}(x)$ (even though $\widehat{s}(x)$ is an unbiased
estimator of $s(x)$). Instead, the maximum likelihood estimate actually depends
on which dataset $x$ is from!</p>

<p>If $x$ was sourced from ImageNet, it’s more likely that $s(x) &gt; 0.7$ and
therefore that $\widehat{s}(x)$ is an underestimate, since most of the mass of
the ImageNet selection frequency distribution—see our (hypothetical) plot
above—is on $s(x) &gt; 0.7$. Conversely, if $x$ was a newly collected candidate
image, then most likely $s(x) &lt; 0.7$.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<strong>Remark:</strong> Mathematically, the phenomenon is that
$E[\widehat{s}(x)|s(x)] = s(x)$, but $E[s(x)|\widehat{s}(x)]$ is not equal to $s(x)$, and
instead depends on the distribution of $s(x)$ via Bayes'
ruleSpecifically, we have that for a given dataset,
$$p(s|\widehat{s}) = \frac{p_{data}(s) \cdot p_{binom}(\widehat{s}|s)} {\int
p(s') p_{binom}(\widehat{s}|s')\ ds'},$$ where $p_{data}$ is the density function
for selection frequencies under this dataset, and $p_{binom}$ is the binomial
probability mass function..
</div>

<p>The interactive graph below visualizes this intuition: by moving the
slider, you can adjust the “observed” selection frequency $\widehat{s}(x)$. The 
shaded curves then show what our belief about the corresponding true
selection frequency $s(x)$ looks like, depending on which pool the image
came from.</p>

</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Thus, if the selection frequency distribution of ImageNet is skewed upwards
compared to that of the collected candidate images (which is likely, since
ImageNet was already filtered for qualityImageNet was
originally constructed by collecting candidate images in a way similar to the
ones described here, and then subsequently filtering for quality using a
"majority vote" based on selection frequency. when it was
constructed), matching the two data sources via observed selection frequency
will result in ImageNet images having systematically higher selection
frequencies than their new ImageNet-v2 counterparts. Also, the noiser our
reading of observed selection frequency are (i.e. the less annotators we use),
the more important the source distribution becomes, and so the greater the
effect of the bias. Indeed, if we were able to use infinite annotators for each
image, the bias would disappear, as we would have perfect readings of the
corresponding selection frequency. The only possible value for $s(x)$ would then
be $s(x) = \widehat{s}(x)$, making the shaded distributions above collapse
into a point mass at the green line.</p>

<p>The bias we are describing is summarized visually in the interactive graph below: by adjusting the
sliders, you can manipulate the distributions of “true” selection frequency for
ImageNet (red) and for the candidate data (black), as well as the number of
annotators used to estimate selection frequencies. The distribution of
ImageNet-v2 selection frequencies resulting from performing statistic matching
is shown in blue. Notice that as long as the candidate selection frequencies do
not come from the same distribution as the ImageNet selection frequencies,
the resulting ImageNet-v2 test set never matches the original test set
statistics. For the reasons we discussed earlier, having less annotators, or having a bigger gap between ImageNet and the candidate
distribution, also exacerbate the effect.</p>

<h2 id="quantifying-the-effects-of-bias">Quantifying the Effects of Bias</h2>

<p>The model above, paired with the fact that ImageNet (having already been
filtered for quality before) is likely much higher-quality than candidate images sourced from
Flickr, predicts that ImageNet-v2 images’ selection frequencies are
consistently lower than those of ImageNet images. To test this
theory, we set up another crowdsourced task that is extremely similar (but
not quite identicalWe implemented a few changes for quality control but kept
the task instructions and interface constant: the exact differences are outlined in Appendix
B.2 of our paper.) to the one used by the ImageNet-v2
creators, this time using 40 annotators per image (instead of 10) to estimate
its selection frequency. A histogram of the selection frequencies we 
observed in our experiment is shown below:</p>

<p><br/></p>

  <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/idbias/selfreq_histogram.png"/>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Even though the ImageNet-v2 creators report average selection
frequencies for ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 of 0.71 and 0.73 respectively, our
new experiments yield average selection frequencies of 0.85 and 0.81; note the change
in relative ordering (why are the selection frequencies
higher?We discuss this in depth in Appendix B.2 of our
paper. The task and instructions are the same, so we hypothesize that the
discrepancy boils down to either (a) data quality: we used <a href="https://blog.mturk.com/tutorial-managing-worker-cohorts-with-qualifications-e928cd30b173">worker
qualifications</a> to ensure annotator quality while the original experiment did
not—qualifications have been shown to reduce the share of low-quality or
inattentive crowd workers from 34% to 2% in other studies (e.g., the
study we reference found that 16%/0.4% of workers without/with qualifications reported
having had a <em>fatal</em> heart attack while watching television); or (b) data makeup:
workers are presented with grids of 48 images at a time in both experiments,
with grids containing a mix of ImageNet, ImageNet-v2, and candidate
images—but the exact proportions of this mix differ between the two
experiments.).</p>

<div class="footnote"><strong>Aside</strong>: Why did we need to run a new
crowdsourced study to observe this gap, instead of using the data already
collected for the ImageNet-v2 study? The answer is finite-sample reuse:
the selection frequencies collected in the original study are
precisely the ones used to filter the ImageNet-v2 dataset. So, by
construction, these selection frequency will match the selection
frequencies of the ones of ImageNet test set, regardless of whether
there is bias in the selection processTo draw a crude analogy here,
suppose that instead of matching image datasets we are matching piles of coins: 
Pile A is rigged $P(\text{heads})=1$, but Pile B is fair $P(\text{heads}) =
0.5$. We flip all the coins in both piles 10 times each---inevitably (if
there are enough total coins in Pile B), some of the Pile B coins will land
"heads" all 10 times, and will thus appear identical to the rigged Pile A
coins. Are they in fact identical? (After all, these coins match the Pile A
coins according to the "number of heads" statistic!) The answer is obviously
"no," but the key is that even though all the coins in Pile B are
fair (and flipping them another 10 times would reveal this), it's impossible to
conclude anything other than $P(\text{heads}) = 1$ solely from the
already-collected data on the selected coins.. If we're
careful about avoiding this finite-sample reuse (for example, by
re-performing the filtering process using half of the annotators and then
measuring selection frequencies with the other half) we can actually identify
bias in the original data—the process for doing so
is shown in Appendix C of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">our paper</a>.</div>

<h3 id="how-does-this-bias-affect-measured-accuracy">How does this bias affect measured accuracy?</h3>

<p>Our model and experiments suggest that matching empirical statistics from
different sources introduces bias into the dataset replication pipeline, and
that in the case of ImageNet-v2 this means that selection frequencies are
actually lower for the new ImageNet-v2 test set compared to the old one. Since
selection frequency is meant to roughly reflect data quality, and is known (as
found already by the ImageNet-v2 authors) to affect model accuracy, we expect the
downwards selection frequency bias in ImageNet-v2 to directly translate into a downwards
bias in model accuracy.</p>

<p>To test if this is really the case, we use a progressively increasing number of
annotators $n$ out of the 40 that we collected. For each $n$, we matchWe perform this matching via reweighting, rather than
filtering---more details are given in the next section. the
ImageNet-v2 observed selection frequencies (calculated using $n$ annotators) to
the ImageNet onesFor context, the ImageNet-v2 creators
matched their candidate pool to ImageNet with $n = 10$, and measure the
resulting model accuracies.
Our statistical model predicts that more annotators means less noise in the
observed selection frequencies, which in turn means less bias and higher model accuracies
in the original selection frequency used to create ImageNet-v2, and so we
should see the resulting model accuracies
increase. The data confirms this prediction: below we plot model accuracies on
ImageNet versus their adjusted accuracies on ImageNet-v2—using the slider
below the graph, you can vary the number of annotators used to make the
adjustment from zero (i.e. no matching, just raw ImageNet-v2 accuracies) to 40
(accuracies after statistic matching using all 40 annotations).</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>After using 40 workers to control for selection frequency
between ImageNet and ImageNet-v2, we reduce the 11.7% gap that was originally observed
to a gap of 5.7%. This is already a significant reduction, but the trend of the
graph suggests that 5.7% is still an overestimate—the gap continues to
consistently shrink with each increase in number annotators. In the final part
of this post, we’ll use a technique from classical statistics to get
an even better estimate of the real, bias-adjusted gap between ImageNet and
ImageNet-v2 model accuracies.</p>

<h2 id="adjusting-for-bias-with-the-statistical-jackknife">Adjusting for Bias with the Statistical Jackknife</h2>

<p>The statistic matching that led to the previous graph was based on what we’ll call a
<em>selection frequency-adjusted accuracy</em> estimator, defined for a given
classifier $f$ as:</p>

<p>\[
    \text{Acc}(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n 
    E_{x\sim \text{ImageNet-v2}}\left(1[\text{$f$ is correct on }x] | \widehat{s}(x) = \frac{k}{n}\right)\cdot 
    P_{x\sim \text{ImageNet}}\left(\widehat{s}(x) = \frac{k}{n}\right)
\]</p>

<p>This estimator has a simple interpretation: it is equivalent to
(a) sampling an ImageNet-v1 image and observing its (empirical) selection frequency;
then (b) finding a random ImageNet-v2 image with the same (empirical) selection
frequency, and recording the classifier’s correctness on that input. So what we are
estimating here is what a model’s accuracy on ImageNet-v2 would be, if the
selection frequencies of ImageNet-v2 were distributed as in the ImageNet test
set. (Notice that if the ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 selection frequency
distributions already matched, then this estimator would be independent from $n$
and would evaluate to exactly model accuracy on ImageNet-v2.)</p>

<p>Now, the $\text{Acc}(n)$ estimator is subject to the same bias as dataset
replication itself, as it too ignores the discrepancy between the empirical
selection frequency $\widehat{s}(x)$ and the true selection frequency $s(x)$.
Since we’ve been talking about bias pretty abstractly in this post, it’s worth
noting that the $\text{Acc}(n)$ estimator ties everything back to the formal,
statistical definition of bias. Specifically, our main finding can be restated
(though maybe less intuitively) as “$\text{Acc}(n)$ is a downwards-biased
estimator of the true reweighted accuracy,” that is</p>

<p>\[
    E[\text{Acc}(n)] &lt; \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \text{Acc}(n). 
\]</p>

<p>So, from this perspective, our graph in the previous section can be viewed as just a plot of the value of $\text{Acc}(n)$ for every
classifier for various values of $n$. Also, the estimator behaves exactly how as predicted by
our model of the bias—as $n$ increases, $\widehat{s}(x)$ becomes a less
noisy estimator of $s(x)$, so the bias in the matching process decreases and
so $\text{Acc}(n)$ increases.</p>

<p>Now, what we really want to know is what $\text{Acc}(n)$ looks like as $n
\rightarrow \infty$, especially given that even when we use 40 annotators for
statistic matching the adjusted accuracy still improves.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">our paper</a> we present further techniques for tackling this problem.
These include making use of tools from empirical Bayes estimation techniques,
beta-binomial regression, and kernel density estimation. To keep things short
here, we’ll only discuss the simplest estimation method we use: one based on a
technique known as the statistical jackknife.</p>

<p>The jackknife dates back to the work of <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1015.9344&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Maurice Quenouille</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177706647">John

short, the jackknife estimate of an $n$-sample estimator
$\Theta_n(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ is given by</p>

    \widehat{\theta}_{n-1}^{(i)} - \widehat{\theta}_n

<article class="small">
A brief summary: consider our $n$-sample estimator $\Theta_n$, and define
$\Theta$ to be the true value of the estimator, i.e. $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
\Theta_n$. In our case, $\Theta$ would be the adjusted accuracy of ImageNet-v2
if we had infinite workers. Now, suppose that the bias in $\Theta_n$ is on
the order of $1/n$, i.e.

\[
    E[\Theta_n] = \Theta + \frac{b(\Theta)}{n}
\]

Now, for a given n-sample estimate $\widehat{\Theta}_n$, we define a
<em>leave-one-our</em> estimator $\widehat{\Theta}_n^{(-i)}$ to be $\widehat{\Theta}_n$ 
computed with all but the $i$th datapoint. There are $n$ possible such leave-one-out 
estimators for a given $\widehat{\Theta}_n$. The main idea behind the jackknife
is to make the following two approximations:

\[
    \widehat{\Theta}_n \approx E[\Theta_n] = \Theta + \frac{b(\Theta)}{n}
\]
\[
    \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1} \widehat{\Theta}_n^{(-i)} \approx E[\Theta_{n-1}] = \Theta + \frac{b(\Theta)}{n-1}
\]

Using these two assumptions, one can solve for $b(\Theta)$ and end up with the
bias estimate given in the post.

</section>

<p>Averaging across all of the classifiers studied, the jackknife estimates the
bias in our estimator as about 1.0%, meaning that the bias-corrected gap
between ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 shrinks from 11.7% (without any correction) to
5.7% (using the 40 annotators we have to correct), to 4.7% (using this additional
jackknife bias correction). Moreover, as our paper discusses, this is almost
certainly still an overestimate—using more refined methods for bias estimation
reduces the gap to somewhere between 3.4% and 3.8% (with variation being across
different methods).</p>

<h2 id="summary-and-conclusions">Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<p>We find that noise—even if it is mean-zero—can result in bias in dataset reproductions if not
accounted for. Zooming in on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImageNet-v2</code> replication effort, we use
statistical modeling to find that majority of the observed accuracy drop can be
explained by differences in selection frequency distribution between the
original dataset and its replication. Our results suggest that statistic modeling
of the data collection process can be an important tool in data replication efforts.

procedures, further experiments, and future directions.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-076 |  The Round Complexity of Perfect MPC with Active Security and Optimal Resiliency | 

	Benny Applebaum, 

	Eliran Kachlon, 

	Arpita Patra</title>
    <summary>In STOC 1988, Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson (BGW) established an important milestone in the fields of cryptography and distributed computing by showing that every functionality can be computed with perfect (information-theoretic and error-free) security at the presence of an active (aka Byzantine) rushing adversary that controls up to $n/3$ of the parties.

We study the round complexity of general secure multiparty computation in the BGW model. Our main result shows that every functionality can be realized in only four rounds of interaction, and that some functionalities cannot be computed in three rounds. This completely settles the round-complexity of perfect actively-secure optimally-resilient MPC, resolving a long line of research.

Our lower-bound is based on a novel round-reduction technique that allows us to lift existing three-round  lower-bounds for verifiable secret sharing to four-round lower-bounds for general MPC. To prove the upper-bound, we develop new round-efficient protocols for computing degree-2 functionalities over large fields, and establish the completeness of such functionalities. The latter result extends the recent completeness theorem of Applebaum, Brakerski and Tsabary (TCC 2018, Eurocrypt 2019) that was limited to the binary field.</summary>

Cynthia Dwork is the <a href="http://www.sigact.org/prizes/knuth/citation2020.pdf">winner</a> of the 2020 Donald E. Knuth Prize. The prize is awarded jointly by ACM SIGACT and the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee. The ceremony will include a lecture by Cynthia at <a href="https://focs2020.cs.duke.edu/">FOCS 2020</a>, which is still projected to meet in-person at Duke next November 16–19.</p>
<p>
Today we congratulate Cynthia and talk a little about her work.</p>
<p>
I, Dick, have known her for many years. I am excited to see that she has won the Knuth prize. </p>
<p>
She has always been a top researcher and a terrific speaker. I fondly recall some of her earlier talks at Princeton and elsewhere. There is something about her ability to explain complex ideas in a lucid manner. I have often thought that this ability must be one of the reasons she has been so successful in her research. </p>
<p>
We will talk a little about <em>differential privacy</em> (DP) and then her other joint work which led to another prize. We should be quick to <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/02/06/cynthia-dwork-and-a-brilliant-idea/">mention</a> that <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/02/07/still-a-brilliant-idea/">others</a> have been instrumental in both developments.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Quantifying an Idea </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
DP might have been appreciated long before there were large databases and computer systems. The genius is not just the simplicity of the idea but the development of mathematical tools to govern its application.</p>
<p>
For a simple example, suppose a professor has a general policy of posting exam average scores in her class of 100. Suppose she posts that the average is 73.3 after 98 students have taken the exam but two need to make it up a week later. Then suppose she re-posts the average after they take it and it is 72.5. The difference may not seem like much. But the class learns two things: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Both students had their makeup scores included in the average. (If the 73.3 is exact then it is not even possible to get a rounded 72.5 with just one score of zero, pending the other.) <p/>
</li><li>
The two students collectively bombed the exam. (Just possibly one got a zero while the other did OK, but even then the other’s score was below average.)
</li></ul>
<p>
Your first thought might be that the fault is in the excessive precision in the grade reporting. If she had rounded to the nearest integer then both averages would have been reported as “73” and there would be no problem. But rounding is accidental. The new average could have been 72.49, which would be rounded down to “72,” when the set of possible interpretations is worse than before. </p>
<p>
In wide-scale situations where queries for multiple averages at different times are allowed, effects of rounding may cancel so that a large statistical analysis can subtract them out. Thus passively reducing precision is not enough. The key is to affect the precision actively by adding a random <img alt="{\pm \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm \epsilon}"/> to the reported results, where <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/> is judiciously chosen. The point is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Adding <img alt="{\pm \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm \epsilon}"/>, better than rounding, makes inference much harder. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the exam-score example, randomly adding or subtracting a number between 0 and 2 changes the calculus so that seeing “73.3” and then “72.5” does not allow a high-confidence inference about the makeup students’ scores. One could reason that the first number could easily have been 72.3 and the second 73.5, in line with interpretations where the makeup students upped the average. Actually, a jump from 72.3 to 73.5 in the <em>true</em> averages is impossible from just two new scores, so the class could deduce that the reported averages are fudged. But that is OK. Two basic purposes of reporting the averages are met despite the fudging: </p>
<ul>
<li>
to show the exam was consistent with past years—especially good to know this year; <p/>
</li><li>
to give you some idea (knowing your own score exactly) where you stand relative to the class.
</li></ul>
<p>
In related situations, one could argue that a mean of <img alt="{\pm 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 1}"/> for <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/> is not enough. If the exam has 100 one-point questions each with a 73.3% expectation of getting it right for everyone, then the standard deviation about the mean is almost <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/>. Using a mean change of <img alt="{\pm 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 2}"/> seems also fine in this case, whereas rounding to the nearest 05 (i.e., reporting “70” or “75” as the average) might be too coarse.</p>
<p>
We do not intend our example to be definitive, only that it conveys relevant issues. The example is enough to convey that DP leads into deep matters in statistics and <em>what can be inferred by statistical methods</em>. The latter melds the complexity-theoretic notion of knowledge gain from interactive protocols with statistical (machine) learning. And as with quantum computing, theorems and methods from the subfield have come back to inform fundamental questions about complexity (of course, this is true of crypto in general).</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Privacy and Online Chess </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I, Ken, am the lead on this post, and have had data-privacy affect me personally. The pandemic has forced the cancellation of all over-the-board (OTB) tournaments, some as far ahead as August. Chess has all moved online, as heralded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/sports/coronavirus-chess-online-tournament.html">two</a> recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/sports/chess-cheating-south-dakota-races.html">articles</a> in the New York Times and one in the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/forget-sourdough-everyone-is-playing-chess-now-11588845643">proclaiming</a>, “Sports: Chess Is the New King of the Pandemic.” </p>
<p>
As these articles also note, cheating has long been a major concern for online chess. I have been a recourse for second-opinions in online cheating cases but have not tried to be <em>primary</em> in this domain. A great conversation in November 2006 with Daniel Sleator (who—besides being famous for splay trees and amortized analysis—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Chess_Club#History">co-founded</a> the Internet Chess Club) told me how online cheating detection avails much information about the manner of play that is not applicable or reliably available in OTB chess. Also for academic reasons, I chose a minimal approach of using no information besides the moves of the games and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo ratings</a> of the players. An unexpected advantage of that choice is exemplified by an e-mail I received—fifteen minutes before a conference call on Wednesday with representatives of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) and other online platforms—from a different chess organizer requesting a statement that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …you will only use the data of the games, and not any personal data that might be obtained from the [tournaments] for your research, such as player name etc. … in writing as a standard precaution … to make sure that there isn’t third party usage of the data or usage outside of its intent. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Some recent legal decisions have confirmed that the moves of the games are public data and cannot be copyrighted. The e-mail did not mention the players’ ratings. As used by FIDE and the US and most online platforms (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-calculate-nba-elo-ratings/">and</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings">much</a> <a href="https://dotesports.com/general/news/elo-ratings-explained-20565">more</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-nfl-predictions-work/">widely</a>), those are 4-digit numbers, and they are public. Knowing all four digits might be enough to pinpoint the identity of a player. </p>
<p>
Thus I suggested rounding the rating to the nearest 10 or even 20. This makes little difference to my statistical cheating tests, which already give 25 Elo points benefit-of-doubt for uncertainty about the rating. Tournament officials I’ve served have done this in a couple of individual cases but now the need is <em>en masse</em>. </p>
<p>
The question based on the previous section above is whether I should instead (or also) suggest that they implement full DP by adding <img alt="{\pm \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm \epsilon}"/> with a mean of <img alt="{\pm 10}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 10}"/> or <img alt="{\pm 20}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+20%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm 20}"/> or so, with-or-without rounding. A caveat is that it is easy for someone with a tournament spreadsheet to round a column of figures before exporting text to me, but applying a random function is less familiar and prone to major mess-ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Other Prize </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The Knuth Prize is not Cynthia’s only win for 2020. In December she was awarded the 2020 IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal. A <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/honors-2020-cynthia-dwork-wins-the-ieee-richard-w-hamming-medal">video</a> gives a one-minute summary of differential privacy and her work on <em>non-malleable</em> cryptosystems via lattice bases. The latter stems from her 2000 <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dolev/pubs/nmc.pdf">paper</a> with Danny Dolev and Moni Naor (DDN).</p>
<p>
We have not covered this crypto topic before. It involves chosen-ciphertext attacks where Eve, the evesdropper, first gets hold of a transmitted ciphertext <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>. The cryptosystem is <em>malleable</em> if Eve can know enough about the structure of <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> to make a legal ciphertext <img alt="{y'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y'}"/>, one that may decode to a plaintext <img alt="{x'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x'}"/> that advances her interests compared to the intended <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability_(cryptography)">article</a> gives an example where <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> embeds a numerical field <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> that Eve can recognize and alter en-route. The paper gives a similar example where Eve cannot disrupt the transmission of <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> but can separately send her own <img alt="{y'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y'}"/> with a value <img alt="{r'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r'}"/> that gives her advantage. This may be so even without being able to decode or gain any information about the plain value of <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/>, except that <img alt="{r'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r'}"/> is different in a meaningful way. For instance, <img alt="{r'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r'}"/> could be a lower bid on a contract or higher bid in a secure auction.</p>
<p>
One would think that <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r}"/> should just be encoded via an error-correcting code whose range is secure so that an attacker would be overwhelmingly unlikely to find another value <img alt="{r'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r'}"/> in the legal range of the code. However, this clashes with the goal of <em>homomorphic encryption</em> which allows numerical operations on encoded values. Or the technology used may be too simple, as in the paper’s mention of submitting bids to a fax number. </p>
<p>
Note: both fax machines and the paper date to the previous millennium. But the paper next gives an example that is staying with us in this millennium, where <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> is a proof of <img alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}"/>. Suppose Alice arranges to transmit <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> to a referee Ralph using a zero-knowledge protocol, but Eve is able to intercept their messages. Eve can impersonate Ralph to Alice and impersonate Alice to Ralph as Ralph asks questions in the protocol. It may seem impossible to forestall such a “man-in-the-middle” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">attack</a> without extrinsic considerations of hardware and timing, but DDN design an ingenious scheme for <em>non-malleable zero-knowledge proofs</em>. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Video </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
<em>En-passant</em> of this, we want to note a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wl-3kadvgw">video</a> that was made for next month’s Women in Theory <a href="https://womenintheory.wordpress.com/">workshop</a>. It has an all-female cast and lyrics by Avi Wigderson parodying the song “I Will Survive.” Cynthia is not in the video, but she likewise has been a great spokesperson for the experiences of women in our professional life.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our congratulations again to Cynthia—by name—on the Knuth and Hamming prizes.</p>
