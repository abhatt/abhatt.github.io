Jan Krajicek is an expert on linking computational complexity and mathematical logic. He has authored four books on this area including the often cited <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bounded-arithmetic-propositional-logic-and-complexity-theory/899C8FF084B3EB2430EDEBC27921D635">text</a> <em>Bounded Arithmetic and Complexity Theory</em>. Moreover, he has studied the consistency of various of theories and whether they can prove <img alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}"/> and related questions. </p>
<p>
Today I thought we would discuss consistency proofs in general.</p>
<p>
Lately I have been thinking about <img alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}"/> and logic, with emphasis on consistency results. Thanks to Kurt Gödel’s famous Second Incompleteness Theorem we know that consistency theorems are difficult to prove. In particular he showed that</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1 (Informally)</b> <em> Any sufficiently powerful consistent theory cannot prove that it is consistent. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
In order to prove that some theory <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> is consistent we need a stronger theory say <img alt="{T^{*}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%5E%7B%2A%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T^{*}}"/>. But to prove this theory is itself consistent we need an even stronger theory <img alt="{T^{**}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%5E%7B%2A%2A%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T^{**}}"/> and so on. As they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Its turtles all the way down. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
It is not clear who first said this, but an 1854 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SGtYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">transcript</a> of debates between a mainline and maverick minister records the former (Joseph Berg) saying of the latter (Joseph Barker):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> My opponent’s reasoning reminds me of the heathen, who, being asked on what the world stood, replied, “On a tortoise.” But on what does the tortoise stand? “On another tortoise.” With Mr. Barker, too, there are tortoises all the way down. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Recall a logical theory is consistent provided it never proves <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{\neg A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneg+A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neg A}"/> where as usual <img alt="{\neg A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneg+A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neg A}"/> means “not” <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>. Thus a theory is consistent provided it will never prove both <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{\neg A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneg+A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neg A}"/>. This means that once a statement is proved we are done. There will be no surprise in the future. </p>
<p>
Bluntly: I would hate if my paper showing that <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> is true, was followed by your paper showing that <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> is also false. Besides pride I would hate this because, then any statement is true. This would certainly reduce any interest in my theorem proving <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> and also in your theorem proving <img alt="{\neg X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneg+X%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neg X}"/>. This is “ex contradictione quodlibet”.</p>
<p>
The rule 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  X \text{ and } \neg X \implies \text{``Pigs can fly''} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++X+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%5Cneg+X+%5Cimplies+%5Ctext%7B%60%60Pigs+can+fly%27%27%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  X \text{ and } \neg X \implies \text{``Pigs can fly''} "/></p>
<p>must be true. Right. Or must it? In a moment, but first some examples of consistency issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Failure of Consistency </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Since David Hilbert explicitly, and before implicitly, there has been interest in showing that our math theories are consistent. It may seem strange that consistency could ever be an issue, but read on.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>A theory that was thought to be inconsistent:</i><br/>
The creation of non-Euclidean geometries asked could these geometries be consistent? The answer is yes. It is possible to show that they are as consistent as Euclidean geometries. This done by building models of their new geometry by using Eucildean geometries in clever ways.</p>

The famous Russell paradox destroyed early formulations of set theory. Bertrand Russell noted that the formulations allowed defining the following as a set: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  S = \{ x \mid x \not\in x \}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++S+%3D+%5C%7B+x+%5Cmid+x+%5Cnot%5Cin+x+%5C%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  S = \{ x \mid x \not\in x \}. "/></p>
<p>But this is a problem, since it creates logical statements that are equivalent to their negations: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x \in S \iff x \not\in S. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%5Cin+S+%5Ciff+x+%5Cnot%5Cin+S.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  x \in S \iff x \not\in S. "/></p>
<p>Fixing this led to the creation of modern set theory <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/#AxiZFC">ZF</a>. It is named Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, after Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>A theory that was thought to be—still unclear:</i> <br/>
William Quine’s theory “New Foundations” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Foundations">NF</a>) of set theory remains a problem. There are some possible relative proofs that show that it is as consistent as normal set theory. See this for the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01406">claim</a> by Randall Holmes that NF is as consistent as ZF—see <a href="https://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/nfproof/sorted_at_last_maybe.pdf">this</a>.</p>

</p><p/><h2> Length-based Immunity </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The sentences used by Krajicek and his co-authors Jan Bydzovsky and Igor Oliveira in a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12935">paper</a> deal with forms of <em>length-based immunity</em>. The complexity-theoretic definition is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 2</b> <em><a name="lbimmune"/> A language <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> is <b>length-based immune</b> (LBI) to <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> if for every polynomial-time program <img alt="{P_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_i%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P_i}"/>, there are only finitely many <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> such that <img alt="{P_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_i%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P_i}"/> is correct on strings of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>.

</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This property is akin to <em>immunity</em>: not having an infinite easy subset. The known <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>-complete sets are <em>not</em> immune: for instance there are many easy cases of SAT. Under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berman-Hartmanis_conjecture">Isomorphism Conjecture</a>, no <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>-complete set is immune. Whether SAT can be length-based immune might depend on details of how formulas are encoded, but under a “natural” encoding one might expect length-based immunity to hold.</p>
<p>
Of course, if <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> has a length-based immune set then <img alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}"/>. Say a theory <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> is “adequate” if it is consistent and proves basic facts about complexity classes such as that one. Then for an adequate theory <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Suppose we prove it is consistent with <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> that <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> has an LBI set.

Since <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/> imples that <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> does not have an LBI set, this yields the simple and notable conclusion that <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> cannot prove <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D.%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}.}"/> That is, <img alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}"/> is consistent with <img alt="{T.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT.%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T.}"/></em>

<p/><p>
Krajicek, as we said before, has tried to prove that complexity statements like <img alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}"/> are consistent. The trouble is that such questions are difficult. So he and others have worked on showing that these questions are at least consistent with theories <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of arithmetic. It seems too hard to handle Peano arithmetic yet, so they work with theories <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> that are weaker than Peano arithmetic—but still adequate. For these theories, Krajicek and company have results for some variations of Definition~<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#lbimmune">2</a>, albeit ones that seem not to have a direct relation to <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>. The two main ways to vary the Definition~<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#lbimmune">2</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Change the class <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> that has—or may not have—a length-based immune set to something else, for instance <img alt="{\mathcal{C} = \mathsf{P^{NP}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BP%5E%7BNP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{C} = \mathsf{P^{NP}}}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
Change the class <img alt="{\mathcal{Q}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{Q}}"/> of programs the sets are immune to from polynomial-time programs to something else.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Fixed Polynomial Size Circuits </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
They fix a constant exponent <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> and take <img alt="{\mathcal{Q}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{Q}}"/> to be families of <em>circuits</em> <img alt="{C_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C_n}"/> of fixed polynomial size <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/>. The circuits can be non-uniform, and indeed the unprovable statements are defined by a process that is not constructive. </p>
<p>
Circuits of linear or other fixed polynomial size are a fascinating and important topic in themselves. We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/a-problem-with-proving-problems-are-hard/">posted</a> about Ravi Kannan’s famous theorem that for every fixed <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>, the second level of the polynomial hierarchy has languages without <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/>-sized circuits. The upper bound has since been pushed lower but not all the way to <img alt="{\mathsf{P^{NP}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%5E%7BNP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P^{NP}}}"/>. It is of course believed that <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> has languages without <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/>-sized circuits, since SAT is believed to require super-polynomial size. But the question of whether <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> has sets that lack such circuits—let alone being immune—is currently not known to have implications about <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>. </p>
<p>
Note that the easy instances of SAT that we alluded to above are easy for linear-size circuits. Moreover, whether <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> itself has—or doesn’t have—sets that are length-based immune to <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/>-size circuits is a statement that can be plausibly argued either way. Krajicek and Oliveira had earlier <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00263">proved</a> that a particular theory called PV—which we will discuss next—cannot prove for any <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> that every language in <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> has <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/>-sized circuits. This unprovable statement, without the LBI condition, strikes us as less plausible—hence less surprising that a weaker theory like PV cannot prove it. What they prove now is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 3</b> <em><a name="thm1a"/> For any fixed <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>, PV cannot prove that every language in <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> allows circuits of size <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/> to get the right answers on infinitely many input lengths. That is, it is consistent with PV that <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> has sets that are LBI to <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/>-size circuits.</em></p><em>

Moreover, for some particular theories called <img alt="{S^1_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%5E1_2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S^1_2}"/> and <img alt="{T^1_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%5E1_2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T^1_2}"/> that extend PV, it is consistent that <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>, respectively <img alt="{\mathsf{p^{NP}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7Bp%5E%7BNP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{p^{NP}}}"/> has sets that are LBI to <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/>-sized circuits. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We will talk a little more about these theories.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> PV and Related Theories </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are the candidate theories for <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/>? One is PV, a theory created by Steve Cook. For every polynomial-time program <img alt="{P_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P_i}"/>, PV has a symbol <img alt="{\varphi_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarphi_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\varphi_i}"/> for the function that <img alt="{P_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P_i}"/> computes. Then add all the equations that these functions satisfy and you have PV. For example, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  2^{x+1} = 2 \times 2^{x}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5E%7Bx%2B1%7D+%3D+2+%5Ctimes+2%5E%7Bx%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  2^{x+1} = 2 \times 2^{x}, "/></p>
<p>for the exponential function <img alt="{x \rightarrow 2^{x}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Crightarrow+2%5E%7Bx%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x \rightarrow 2^{x}}"/>. </p>
<p>
PV can formalize and prove properties of program-building constructs like composition and bounded for-loops that preserve running in polynomial time. It can formalize the concept of polynomial-size Boolean circuits and establish basic facts about them. It can prove deep results like the PCP theorem and more. </p>
<p>
Thus showing that your favorite statement is at least consistent with PV would be neat. It is critical that PV only allows equations as axioms. Thus PV does not axiomatize the statement 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \forall x \exists y&gt;x \ 2^{y}-1 \text{ is a prime} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cforall+x+%5Cexists+y%3Ex+%5C+2%5E%7By%7D-1+%5Ctext%7B+is+a+prime%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \forall x \exists y&gt;x \ 2^{y}-1 \text{ is a prime} "/></p>
<p>even if it is true. The more-formal statement of their theorem for PV is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 4</b> <em><a name="thm1b"/> For every <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>, there is a formula <img alt="{\varphi(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarphi%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\varphi(x)}"/> in the language of PV such that the statement </em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \Upsilon_{\varphi} = (\forall \ell)(\exists n &gt; \ell)(\exists C_n \text{ of size } \leq n^k)(\forall x\in \Sigma^n): \varphi(x) = C_n(x) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CUpsilon_%7B%5Cvarphi%7D+%3D+%28%5Cforall+%5Cell%29%28%5Cexists+n+%3E+%5Cell%29%28%5Cexists+C_n+%5Ctext%7B+of+size+%7D+%5Cleq+n%5Ek%29%28%5Cforall+x%5Cin+%5CSigma%5En%29%3A+%5Cvarphi%28x%29+%3D+C_n%28x%29+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \Upsilon_{\varphi} = (\forall \ell)(\exists n &gt; \ell)(\exists C_n \text{ of size } \leq n^k)(\forall x\in \Sigma^n): \varphi(x) = C_n(x) "/></p>
</em><p><em>is not provable in PV, and such that the function <img alt="{\varphi(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarphi%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\varphi(x)}"/> is polynomial-time computable. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The theorem is not diminished if we restrict attention to yes/no formulas and circuit outputs. Thus it is not provable that every language in <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> has infinitely many input lengths at which it is easy for <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/>-sized circuits. Put another way, it is consistent with PV to assert (for any <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>) that <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> has a language that lacks size-<img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/> circuits <img alt="{C_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C_n}"/> in the strong sense of <em>every</em> <img alt="{C_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C_n}"/> making an error on some string of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>, beyond a finite number of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. This is stronger than saying the language lacks <img alt="{n^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n^k}"/>-size circuits, which makes the consistency more notable.</p>
<p>
Where PV lacks power is with the unrestricted induction enjoyed by Peano Arithmetic. The other theories <img alt="{S_2^1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_2%5E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_2^1}"/> and <img alt="{T_2^1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT_2%5E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T_2^1}"/>, which were named and studied by Sam Buss in the 1980s, add more induction—by limiting the kind of formulas on which it is allowed.</p>
<p>
Here is where we point to the papers for details. The devil in those details is that the exceptional formulas <img alt="{\varphi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\varphi}"/> are not expressly constructed. For one, the proofs of their theorems use a disjunction about whether the polynomial hierarchy collapses at a certain level. Note that something similar is already at work in our <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/a-problem-with-proving-problems-are-hard/">post</a> on Kannan’s theorem. </p>
<p>
Second, their proofs exploit a quirk of PV and the other theories that they have symbols for all polynomial-time programs without having commensurate command of the semantics of what these programs represent. The induction and axioms available to <img alt="{S_2^1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_2%5E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_2^1}"/> and <img alt="{T_2^1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT_2%5E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T_2^1}"/> bridge some but not all of these gaps. </p>
<p>
Third and most particular, their theorem uses a self-referential strategy. It starts building <img alt="{\varphi'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarphi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\varphi'}"/> but branches according to whether the theory <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> can prove <img alt="{\Upsilon_{\varphi'}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CUpsilon_%7B%5Cvarphi%27%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Upsilon_{\varphi'}}"/>. If not it keeps going, if yes it does something else. Thus the proof does not tell what <img alt="{\varphi(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarphi%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\varphi(x)}"/> is, nor identify a particular language in <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> for which the LBI property is consistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Another way of saying “Statement <img alt="{\Upsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CUpsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Upsilon}"/> is consistent with <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/>” is that one can build a <em>model</em> of <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> in which <img alt="{\Upsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CUpsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Upsilon}"/> is true. What do those models look like? Do they relate to the notion of <em>oracles</em> <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> relative to which certain statements—such as <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}^A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5EA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}^A}"/> having languages that are (length-based-) immune to <img alt="{\mathsf{P}^A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5EA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}^A}"/>—are true?</p>

We show that Imbalance is XP parameterized by twin cover, and FPT when
parameterized by the twin cover and the size of the largest clique outside the
twin cover. In contrast, we introduce a notion of succinct representations of
graphs in terms of their twin cover and demonstrate that Imbalance is NP-hard
in the setting of succinct representations, even for graphs that have a twin
cover of size one.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The next TCS+ talk will take place this coming Wednesday, May 13th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC). <strong>Sahil Singla</strong> from Princeton University and IAS will speak about “<em>Online Vector Balancing and Geometric Discrepancy</em>” (abstract below).</p>
<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. Due to security concerns, <em>registration is required</em> to attend the interactive talk. (The link to the YouTube livestream will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk">on our website</a> on the day of the talk, so people who did not sign up will still be able to watch the talk live.) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: We consider an online vector balancing question where <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="T"/> vectors, chosen from an arbitrary distribution over <img alt="[-1,1]^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B-1%2C1%5D%5En&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="[-1,1]^n"/>, arrive one-by-one and must be immediately given a <img alt="\{+1,-1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%2B1%2C-1%5C%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\{+1,-1\}"/> sign. The goal is to keep the discrepancy—the <img alt="\ell_{\infty}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\ell_{\infty}"/>-norm of any signed prefix-sum—as small as possible. A concrete example of this question is the online interval discrepancy problem where <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="T"/> points are sampled one-by-one uniformly in the unit interval <img alt="[0,1]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="[0,1]"/>, and the goal is to immediately color them <img alt="\{+1,-1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%2B1%2C-1%5C%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\{+1,-1\}"/> such that every sub-interval remains always nearly balanced. As random coloring incurs <img alt="\Omega(T^{1/2})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28T%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\Omega(T^{1/2})"/> discrepancy, while the worst-case offline bounds are <img alt="\Theta(\sqrt{n \log (T/n)})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%28%5Csqrt%7Bn+%5Clog+%28T%2Fn%29%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\Theta(\sqrt{n \log (T/n)})"/> for vector balancing and 1 for interval balancing, a natural question is whether one can (nearly) match the offline bounds in the online setting for these problems. One must utilize the stochasticity as in the worst-case scenario it is known that discrepancy is <img alt="\Omega(T^{1/2})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28T%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\Omega(T^{1/2})"/> for any online algorithm.</p>
<p>In this work, we introduce a new framework that allows us to handle online vector balancing even when the input distribution has dependencies across coordinates. In particular, this lets us obtain a <img alt="\textrm{poly}(n, \log T)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpoly%7D%28n%2C+%5Clog+T%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\textrm{poly}(n, \log T)"/> bound for online vector balancing under arbitrary input distributions, and a <img alt="\textrm{poly}\log (T)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpoly%7D%5Clog+%28T%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\textrm{poly}\log (T)"/> bound for online interval discrepancy. Our framework is powerful enough to capture other well-studied geometric discrepancy problems; e.g., we obtain a <img alt="\textrm{poly}(\log^d (T))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpoly%7D%28%5Clog%5Ed+%28T%29%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\textrm{poly}(\log^d (T))"/> bound for the online <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="d"/>-dimensional Tusnády’s problem. All our bounds are tight up to polynomial factors.</p>
<p>A key new technical ingredient in our work is an anti-concentration inequality for sums of pairwise uncorrelated random variables, which might also be of independent interest.</p>
<p>Based on joint works with Nikhil Bansal, Haotian Jiang, Janardhan Kulkarni, and Makrand Sinha. Part of this work appears in STOC 2020 and is available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03350" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03350</a></p></blockquote>

<p>My short introduction: There is nothing like a new hypercontractivity inequality to cheer you up in difficult times and this post describes an amazing new hypercontractivity inequality.  The post describes a recent hypercontractive inequality by Peter Keevash, Noam Lifshitz, Eoin Long and Dor Minzer (KLLM) from their paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05568">Hypercontractivity for global functions and sharp thresholds</a>. (We reported on this development in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/10/30/exciting-beginning-of-the-year-activities-and-seminars/">this post</a>. By now, there are quite a few important applications.) And for Talagrand’s generic chaining inequality, see this <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2020/05/03/talagrands-generic-chaining/">beautiful blog post</a> by Luca Trevisan.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/barrysimon.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19825" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/barrysimon.jpg?w=640"/></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Barry Simon coined the term “hypercontractivity” in the 70s.  (We asked about it here and Nick Read was the first to answer.) A few months ago Barry told us about the early history of hypercontractivity inequalities, and, in particular, the very entertaining story on William Beckner’s Ph. D. qualifying exam.</span></p>
<p>And now to Noam Lifshitz’s guest post.</p>
<h2>Hypercontractivity on product spaces</h2>
<p>Analysis of Boolean functions (ABS) is a very rich subject. There are many works whose concern is generalising some of the results on analysis of Boolean functions to other (product) settings, such as functions on the multicube <img alt="{\left[m\right]^{n},}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cleft%5Bm%5Cright%5D%5E%7Bn%7D%2C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\left[m\right]^{n},}"/> where <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> is very large. However, in some of these cases the fundemental tools of AOBF seem to be false for functions on the multicube <img alt="{f\colon\left[m\right]^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%5Ccolon%5Cleft%5Bm%5Cright%5D%5E%7Bn%7D%5Crightarrow%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f\colon\left[m\right]^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.}"/> However, in the recent work of Keevash, Long, Minzer, and I. We introduce the notion of global functions. These are functions that do not strongly depend on a small set of coordinates. We then show that most of the rich classical theory of AOBF can in fact be generalised to these global functions. Using our machinery we were able to strengthen an isoperimetric stability result of Bourgain, and to make progress on some Erdos-Ko-Rado type open problem.</p>
<p>We now discuss some background on the Fourier analysis on functions on the multicube <img alt="{f\colon\left\{ 1,\ldots,m\right\} ^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%5Ccolon%5Cleft%5C%7B+1%2C%5Cldots%2Cm%5Cright%5C%7D+%5E%7Bn%7D%5Crightarrow%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f\colon\left\{ 1,\ldots,m\right\} ^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.}"/></p>
<h3>Derivatives and Laplacians</h3>
<p>There are two fundemental types of operators on Boolean functions <img alt="{f\colon\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%5Ccolon%5Cleft%5C%7B+0%2C1%5Cright%5C%7D+%5E%7Bn%7D%5Crightarrow%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f\colon\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.}"/> The first ones are the discrete derivatives, defined by <img alt="{D_{i}[f]=\frac{f_{i\rightarrow1}-f_{i\rightarrow0}}{2},}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD_%7Bi%7D%5Bf%5D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bf_%7Bi%5Crightarrow1%7D-f_%7Bi%5Crightarrow0%7D%7D%7B2%7D%2C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D_{i}[f]=\frac{f_{i\rightarrow1}-f_{i\rightarrow0}}{2},}"/> where <img alt="{f_{i\rightarrow x}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bi%5Crightarrow+x%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{i\rightarrow x}}"/> denotes the we plug in the value <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> for the <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>th coordinate.

<h3>Generalisation to functions on the multicube</h3>
<p>For functions on the multicube we don’t have a very good notion of a discrete derivative, but it turns out that it will be enough to talk about the laplacians and their restrictions. The Laplacians are again defined via <img alt="{L_{i}f\left(x\right):=f\left(x\right)-\mathbb{E}f\left(\mathbf{y}\right),}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bi%7Df%5Cleft%28x%5Cright%29%3A%3Df%5Cleft%28x%5Cright%29-%5Cmathbb%7BE%7Df%5Cleft%28%5Cmathbf%7By%7D%5Cright%29%2C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{i}f\left(x\right):=f\left(x\right)-\mathbb{E}f\left(\mathbf{y}\right),}"/> where <img alt="{\mathbf{y}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7By%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbf{y}}"/> is obtained from <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> by resampling its <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>th coordinate. It turns out that in the continuous cube it’s not enough to talk about Laplacians of coordinate, and we will also have to concern ourselves with Laplacians of sets. We define the generalised Laplacians of a set <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> by composing the laplacians corresponding to each coordinate in <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> <img alt="{L_{\left\{ i_{1},i_{2},\ldots,i_{r}\right\} }\left[f\right]:=L_{i_{1}}\circ\cdots\circ L_{i_{r}}\left[f\right].}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7B%5Cleft%5C%7B+i_%7B1%7D%2Ci_%7B2%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Ci_%7Br%7D%5Cright%5C%7D+%7D%5Cleft%5Bf%5Cright%5D%3A%3DL_%7Bi_%7B1%7D%7D%5Ccirc%5Ccdots%5Ccirc+L_%7Bi_%7Br%7D%7D%5Cleft%5Bf%5Cright%5D.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{\left\{ i_{1},i_{2},\ldots,i_{r}\right\} }\left[f\right]:=L_{i_{1}}\circ\cdots\circ L_{i_{r}}\left[f\right].}"/></p>
<p>We now need to convince ourselves that these laplacians have something to do with the impact of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> on the outcome of <img alt="{f.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f.}"/> In fact, the following notions are equivalent</p>

<li>For each <img alt="{x\in\left[m\right]^{S}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Cin%5Cleft%5Bm%5Cright%5D%5E%7BS%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x\in\left[m\right]^{S}}"/> we have <img alt="{\|L_{S}[f]_{S\rightarrow x}\|_{2}&lt;\delta_{2},}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7CL_%7BS%7D%5Bf%5D_%7BS%5Crightarrow+x%7D%5C%7C_%7B2%7D%3C%5Cdelta_%7B2%7D%2C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\|L_{S}[f]_{S\rightarrow x}\|_{2}&lt;\delta_{2},}"/></li>

<p>The main theme of our work is that one can understand <strong>global</strong> function on the continuous cube, and these are functions that satisfy the above equivalent notions for all small sets <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/>.</p>

    <title>TR20-075 |  Rigid Matrices From Rectangular PCPs | 

	Amey Bhangale, 

	Prahladh Harsha, 

	Orr Paradise, 

	Avishay Tal</title>
    <summary>We introduce a variant of PCPs, that we refer to as *rectangular* PCPs, wherein proofs are thought of as square matrices, and the random coins used by the verifier can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, one determining the *row* of each query and the other determining the *column*.

We construct PCPs that are *efficient*, *short*, *smooth* and (almost-)*rectangular*. As a key application, we show that proofs for hard languages in NTIME$(2^n)$, when viewed as matrices, are rigid infinitely often. This strengthens and considerably simplifies a recent result of Alman and Chen [FOCS, 2019] constructing explicit rigid matrices in FNP. Namely, we prove the following theorem:
- There is a constant $\delta \in (0,1)$ such that there is an FNP-machine that, for infinitely many $N$, on input $1^N$ outputs $N \times N$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{F}_2$ that are $\delta N^2$-far (in Hamming distance) from matrices of rank at most $2^{\log  N/\Omega(\log \log N)}$.

Our construction of rectangular PCPs starts with an analysis of how randomness yields queries in the Reed--Muller-based outer PCP of Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan and Vadhan [SICOMP, 2006; CCC, 2005]. We then show how to preserve rectangularity under PCP composition and a smoothness-inducing transformation. This warrants refined and stronger notions of rectangularity, which we prove for the outer PCP and its transforms.</summary>

    <title>TR20-074 |  Depth-First Search in Directed Graphs, Revisited | 

	Eric Allender, 

	Archit Chauhan, 

	Samir Datta</title>
    <summary>We present an algorithm for constructing a depth-first search tree in planar digraphs; the algorithm can be implemented in the complexity class UL, which is contained in nondeterministic logspace NL, which in turn lies in NC^2. Prior to this (for more than a quarter-century), the fastest uniform deterministic parallel algorithm for this problem was O(log^10 n) (corresponding to the complexity class AC^10, which is contained in NC^11).

We also consider the problem of computing depth-first search trees in other classes of graphs, and obtain additional new upper bounds.</summary>

    <title>TR20-073 |  Lower Bounds on OBDD Proofs with Several Orders | 

	Dmitry Itsykson, 

	Sam Buss, 

	Dmitry Sokolov, 

	Alexander Knop, 

	Artur Riazanov</title>
    <summary>This paper is motivated by seeking lower bounds on OBDD($\land$, weakening, reordering) refutations, namely OBDD refutations that allow weakening and arbitrary reorderings. We first work with 1-NBP($\land$) refutations based on read-once nondeterministic branching programs. These generalize OBDD($\land$, reordering) refutations. There are polynomial size 1-NBP($\land$) refutations of the pigeonhole principle, hence 1-NBP($\land$) is strictly stronger than OBDD($\land$, reordering). There are also formulas that have polynomial size tree-like resolution refutations but require exponential size 1-NBP($\land$) refutations. As a corollary, OBDD($\land$, reordering) does not simulate tree-like resolution, answering a previously open question.

The system 1-NBP($\land$, $\exists$) uses projection inferences instead of weakening. 1-NBP($\land$, $\exists_k$) is the system restricted to projection on at most $k$ distinct variables. We construct explicit constant degree graphs $G_n$ on $n$ vertices and an $\epsilon &gt; 0$, such that 1-NBP($\land$, $\exists_{\epsilon n}$) refutations of the Tseitin formula for $G_n$ require exponential size.

Second, we study the proof system OBDD($\land$, weakening, reordering$_\ell$) which allows $\ell$ different variable orders in a refutation. We prove an exponential lower bound on the complexity of tree-like OBDD($\land$, weakening, reordering$_\ell$) refutations for $\ell = \epsilon \log n$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $\epsilon &gt; 0$ is a constant. The lower bound is based on multiparty communication complexity.</summary>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Submodular functions model the intuitive notion of diminishing returns. Due to their far-reaching applications, they have been rediscovered in many fields such as information theory, operations research, statistical physics, economics, and machine learning. They also enjoy computational tractability as they can be minimized exactly or maximized approximately.</p>



<p>The goal of this talk is simple. We see how a little bit of randomness, a little bit of greediness, and the right combination can lead to pretty good methods for offline, streaming, and distributed solutions. I do not assume any background on submodularity and try to explain all the required details during the talk.</p>

    <title>TR20-072 |  Locally testable codes via high-dimensional expanders | 

	Irit Dinur, 

	Prahladh Harsha, 

	Yotam Dikstein, 

	Noga Ron-Zewi</title>
    <summary>Locally testable codes (LTC) are error-correcting codes that have a local tester which can distinguish valid codewords from words that are far from all codewords, by probing a given word only at a very small (sublinear, typically constant) number of locations. Such codes form the combinatorial backbone of PCPs. A major open problem is whether there exist LTCs with positive rate, constant relative distance and testable with a constant number of queries. 

In this paper, we present a new approach towards constructing such LTCs using the machinery of high-dimensional expanders. 
To this end, we consider the Tanner representation of a code, which is specified by a graph and a base code. Informally, our result states that if this graph is part of an {\em agreement expander} then the local testability of the code follows from the local testability of the base code. Agreement expanders allow one to stitch together many mostly-consistent local functions into a single global function. High-dimensional expanders are known to yield agreement expanders with constant degree. 

This work unifies and generalizes the known results on testability of the Hadamard, Reed-Muller and lifted codes, all of which are proved via a single round of local self-correction: the corrected value at a vertex v depends on the values of all vertices that share a constraint with v. In the above codes this set includes all of the vertices. In contrast, in our setting the degree of a vertex might be a constant, so we cannot hope for one-round self-correction. We overcome this technical hurdle by performing iterative self correction with logarithmically many rounds and tightly controlling the error in each iteration using properties of the agreement expander.

Given this result, the missing ingredient towards constructing a constant-query LTC with positive rate and constant relative distance is an instantiation of a base code and a constant-degree agreement expander that interact well with each other.</summary>

    <title>TR20-071 |  A Tight Lower Bound on Adaptively Secure Full-Information Coin Flip | 

	Iftach Haitner, 

	Yonatan Karidi-Heller</title>
    <summary>In a distributed coin-flipping protocol, Blum [ACM Transactions on Computer Systems '83],
the parties try to output a common (close to) uniform bit, even when some adversarially chosen parties try to bias the common output. In an adaptively secure full-information coin flip, Ben-Or and Linial [FOCS '85], the parties communicate over a broadcast channel and a computationally unbounded adversary can choose which parties to corrupt during the protocol execution. Ben-Or and Linial proved that the $n$-party majority protocol is resilient to $o(\sqrt{n})$ corruptions (ignoring log factors), and conjectured this is a tight upper bound for any $n$-party protocol (of any round complexity). Their conjecture was proved to be correct for single-turn (each party sends a single message) single-bit (a message is one bit) protocols, Lichtenstein, Linial, and Saks [Combinatorica '89], symmetric protocols Goldwasser, Kalai, and Park [ICALP '15], and recently for (arbitrary message length) single-turn protocols Tauman Kalai, Komargodski, and Raz [DISC '18]. Yet, the question for many-turn (even single-bit) protocols was left completely open.

In this work we close the above gap, proving that no $n$-party protocol (of any round complexity) is resilient to $O(\sqrt{n})$ (adaptive) corruptions.</summary>

    <title>TR20-070 |  On the list recoverability of randomly punctured codes | 

	Ben Lund, 

	Aditya Potukuchi</title>
    <summary>We show that a random puncturing of a code with good distance is list recoverable beyond the Johnson bound.
In particular, this implies that there are Reed-Solomon codes that are list recoverable beyond the Johnson bound.
It was previously known that there are Reed-Solomon codes that do not have this property. 
As an immediate corollary to our main theorem, we obtain better degree bounds on unbalanced expanders that come from Reed-Solomon codes.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>April is now behind us, and we hope you and your families are all staying safe and healthy. We saw <s>six</s> seven property papers appear online last month, so at least there is some reading ahead of us! A mixture of privacy, quantum, high-dimensional distributions, and juntas (juntæ?). A lot of distribution testing, overall.</p>



<p><strong>Connecting Robust Shuffle Privacy and Pan-Privacy</strong>, by Victor Balcer, Albert Cheu, Matthew Joseph, and Jieming Mao (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09481">arXiv</a>). This paper considers a recent notion of differential privacy called<em> shuffle privacy</em>, where users have sensitive data, a central untrusted server wants to do something with that data (for instance, say… testing its distribution), and a trusted middle-man/entity shuffles the users’ messages u.a.r. to bring in a bit more anonymity. As it turns out, testing uniformity (or identity) of distributions in the shuffle privacy model is (i) much harder than without privacy constraints; (ii) much harder than with ‘usual’ (weaker) differential privacy (iii) much easier than with local privacy; (iv) related to the sample complexity under another privacy notion, <em>pan-privacy</em>. It’s a brand exciting new world out there!</p>



<p><em>(Note: for the reader interested in keeping track of identity/uniformity testing of probability distributions under various privacy models, I wrote a very short summary of the current results <a href="https://github.com/ccanonne/probabilitydistributiontoolbox/blob/master/private-goodness-of-fit.pdf">here</a>.)</em></p>



<p><strong>Entanglement is Necessary for Optimal Quantum Property Testing, </strong>by Sebastien Bubeck, Sitan Chen, and Jerry Li (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07869">arXiv</a>). The analogue of uniformity testing, in the quantum world, is testing whether a quantum state is equal (or far from) the maximally mixed state. It’s known that this task  has “quantum sample complexity” (number of measurements) \(\Theta(d/\varepsilon^2)\) (i.e., square root dependence on  the dimension of the state, \(d^2\)). But this requires <em>entangled</em> measurements, which may be tricky to get (or, in my case, understand): what happens if the measurements can be adaptive, but not entangled? In this work, the authors show that, under this weaker access model \(\Omega(d^{4/3}/\varepsilon^2)\) measurements are necessary: adaptivity alone won’t cut it. It may still help though: without either entanglement <em>nor</em> adaptivity, the authors also show a \(\Omega(d^{3/2}/\varepsilon^2)\) measurements lower bound.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Data Binnings</strong>, by Clément Canonne and Karl Wimmer (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/062/">ECCC</a>). More identity testing! Not private and not quantum for this one, but… not <em>quite</em> identity testing either. To paraphrase the abstract: this paper introduces (and gives near matching bounds for)  the related question of <em>identity up to binning</em>, where the reference distribution \(q\) is over \(k \ll n\) elements: the question is then whether there exists a suitable binning of the domain \([n]\) into \(k\) intervals such that, <em>once binned</em>, \(p\) is equal to \(q\).” </p>



<p><strong>Hardness of Identity Testing for Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Potts models</strong>, by Antonio Blanca, Zongchen Chen, Daniel Štefankovič, and Eric Vigoda (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10805">arXiv</a>). Back to identity testing of distributions, but for high-dimensional structured ones this one. Specifically, this paper focuses on the undirected graphical models known as <em>restricted Boltzmann machines, </em>and provides efficient algorithms for identity testing and conditional hardness lower bounds depending on the type of correlations allowed in the graphical models.</p>



<p><strong>Robust testing of low-dimensional functions</strong>, by Anindya De, Elchanan Mossel, and Joe Neeman (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11642">arXiv</a>). Junta testing is a classical, central problem in property testing, with motivations and applications in machine learning and complexity. The related (and equally well-motivated) question of junta testing of functions on \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (instead of the Boolean hypercube) was recently studied by the same authors; and the related (and, again, equally well-motivated) question of <em>tolerant</em> junta testing on the Boolean hypercube was also recently studied (among other works) by the same authors. Well, this paper does it all, and tackles the challenging (and, for a change, equally well-motivated!) question of <em>tolerant</em> testing of juntas  on \(\mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p><strong>Differentially Private Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam</strong>, by Jayadev Acharya, Ziteng Sun, and Huanyu Zhang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06830">arXiv</a>). Back to probability distributions and privacy. This paper provides differentially private analogues of the classical eponymous statistical inference results (Assouad’s lemma, Fano’s inequality, and Le Cam’s method). In particular, it gives ready-to-use, blackbox tools to prove testing and learning lower bounds for distributions in the differentially private setting, and shows how to use them to easily derive, and rederive, several lower bounds.</p>



<p><strong>Edit: </strong>We missed one!</p>



<p><strong>Learning and Testing Junta Distributions with Subcube Conditioning</strong>, by Xi Chen, Rajesh Jayaram, Amit Levi, Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12496">arXiv</a>). This paper focuses on the <em>subcube conditioning</em> model of (high-dimensional) distribution testing, where the algorithm can fix some variables to values of its choosing and get samples conditioned on those variables. Extending and refining techniques from <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1227">a previous work by a (sub+super)set of the authors</a>, the paper shows how to optimally learn and test <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v49/aliakbarpour16.html">junta distributions</a> in this framework—with exponential savings with respect to the usual i.i.d. sampling model.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<h2>1.1 Lattices and lattice-based cryptography</h2>
<p>Lattices are classically-studied geometric objects that in the past few decades have found a multitude of applications in computer science. The most important application area is <em>lattice-based cryptography</em>, the design of cryptosystems whose security is based on the apparent intractability of computational problems on lattices, even for quantum computers. Indeed, lattice-based cryptography has revolutionized the field because of its apparent quantum resistance and its other attractive security, functionality, and efficiency properties.</p>
<p>Intuitively, a lattice is a regular ordering of points in some (typically high-dimensional) space. More precisely, a <em>lattice</em> \( {{\cal{L}}}\) of rank \( {n}\) is the set of all integer linear combinations of some linearly independent vectors \( {\mathbf{b}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{b}_n}\), which are called a <em>basis</em> of \( {{\cal{L}}}\). We will be primarily interested in analyzing the running times of lattice algorithms as functions of the lattice’s rank \( {n}\).</p>
<h2>1.2. Computational lattice problems</h2>
<p>The two most important computational problems on lattices are the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP). SVP asks, given a basis of a lattice \( {{\cal{L}}}\) as input, to find a shortest non-zero vector in \( {{\cal{L}}}\). CVP, which can be viewed as an inhomogeneous version of SVP, asks, given a basis of a lattice \( {{\cal{L}}}\) and a target point \( {\mathbf{t}}\) as input, to find a closest vector in \( {{\cal{L}}}\) to \( {\mathbf{t}}\).</p>
<p>Algorithms for solving SVP form the core of the best known attacks on lattice-based cryptography both in theory and in practice. Accordingly, it is critical to understand the precise complexity of SVP as well as possible. The best provably correct algorithms for both SVP and CVP run in \( {2^{n + o(n)}}\)-time [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7994">ADRS15</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01995">ADS15</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01535">AS18a</a>]. The best heuristic algorithms for SVP run in \( {2^{cn + o(n)}}\)-time for \( {c = 0.292}\) classically [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1128">BDGL16</a>] and \( {c = 0.265}\) using quantum speedups [<a href="http://www.thijs.com/docs/phd-final.pdf">Laa15</a>] (see also [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1016">KMPR19</a>]), and most real-world lattice-based cryptosystems assume that these algorithms are close to optimal. Indeed, many of these cryptosystems assume what Bos et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/659">B+16</a>] call a “paranoid” worst-case estimate of \( {c = 0.2075}\) (based on the kissing number and assuming that sieving algorithms are optimal) as the fastest hypothetical running time for SVP algorithms when choosing parameters. (See also Albrecht et al. [<a href="https://estimate-all-the-lwe-ntru-schemes.github.io/paper.pdf">A+18</a>], which surveys the security assumptions made in a wide range of lattice-based cryptosystems.) Accordingly, the difference in being able to solve SVP in \( {2^{0.2075n}}\) versus \( {2^{n/20}}\) versus \( {2^{\sqrt{n}}}\) time may mean the difference between lattice-based cryptosystems being secure, insecure with current parameters, or effectively broken in practice.</p>
<p>There is a rank-preserving reduction from SVP to CVP [<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~daniele/papers/GMSS.pdf">GMSS99</a>], so any algorithm for CVP immediately gives an essentially equally fast algorithm for SVP. In other words, CVP is at least as hard as SVP (and probably a bit harder). Indeed, historically, almost all lower bounds for SVP are proven via reduction from CVP (and nearly all algorithmic progress on CVP uses ideas originally developed for SVP).</p>
<h2>1.3. Fine-grained hardness</h2>
<p>The field of fine-grained complexity works to give strong, quantitative lower bounds on computational problems assuming standard complexity-theoretic assumptions. Proving such a (conditional) lower bound for an \( {{\mathsf{NP}}}\)-hard problem generally works by (1) assuming a stronger hardness assumption than \( {{\mathsf{P}} \neq {\mathsf{NP}}}\) about the complexity of \( {k}\)-SAT (such as ETH or SETH, defined below), and (2) giving a highly efficient reduction from \( {k}\)-SAT to the problem. The most important hardness assumptions for giving lower bounds on \( {{\mathsf{NP}}}\)-hard problems are the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) and the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) of Impagliazzo and Paturi [<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~paturi/myPapers/pubs/ImpagliazzoPaturi_2001_jcss.pdf">IP01</a>]. ETH asserts that there is no \( {2^{o(n)}}\)-time algorithm for \( {3}\)-SAT, and SETH asserts that for every \( {\epsilon &gt; 0}\) there exists \( {k \in {\mathbb Z}^+}\) such that there is no \( {2^{(1 – \epsilon)n}}\)-time algorithm for \( {k}\)-SAT, where \( {n}\) denotes the number of variables in the SAT instance.</p>
<p>Here by “highly efficient” reductions we mean linear ones, i.e., reductions that map a \( {3}\)-SAT or \( {k}\)-SAT formula on \( {n}\) variables to an SVP or CVP instance of rank \( {C n + o(n)}\) for some absolute constant \( {C &gt; 0}\). Indeed, by giving a reduction from \( {3}\)-SAT (respectively, \( {k}\)-SAT for any \( {k \in {\mathbb Z}^+}\)) instances on \( {n}\) variables to SVP or CVP instances of rank \( {C n + o(n)}\), we can conclude that there is no \( {2^{o(n)}}\)-time (resp., \( {2^{(1-\epsilon)n/C}}\)-time for any \( {\epsilon &gt; 0}\)) algorithm for the corresponding problem assuming ETH (resp., SETH). Note that the smaller the value of \( {C}\) for which one can show such a reduction, the stronger the conclusion. In particular, a reduction mapping \( {k}\)-SAT instances on \( {n}\) variables to SVP or CVP instances of rank \( {n + o(n)}\) would imply an essentially tight lower bound on the corresponding problem assuming SETH — as mentioned above, the best provably correct algorithms for both SVP and CVP run in time \( {2^{n + o(n)}}\).</p>
<h2>1.4. Fine-grained hardness of CVP (and SVP)</h2>
<p>It is relatively easy to show that CVP is “ETH-hard,” i.e., to show that a \( {2^{o(n)}}\)-time algorithm for CVP would imply a \( {2^{o(n)}}\)-time algorithm for \( {3}\)-SAT instances with \( {n}\) variables. This would falsify ETH. (It’s a nice exercise to show that the Subset Sum problem on a set of size \( {n}\) reduces to CVP on a lattice of rank \( {n}\), which implies the result.)</p>
<p>With some work, Divesh Aggarwal and Noah extended this to SVP [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00942">AS18b</a>]. In particular, we showed a reduction from CVP to SVP that only increases the rank of the lattice by some constant multiplicative factor. (Formally, the reduction only works with certain minor constraints on the CVP instance. The reduction originally relied on a geometric conjecture, which was open for decades. But, Serge Vlăduţ proved the conjecture [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00886">Vlă19</a>] shortly after we published!)</p>
<p>So, unless ETH is false, there is no \( {2^{o(n)}}\)-time algorithm for CVP or SVP. But, for cryptographic applications, even, say, a \( {2^{n/20}}\)-time algorithm would be completely devastating. If such an algorithm were found, cryptographic schemes that we currently think are secure against absurdly powerful attackers straight out of science fiction (say, one with a computer the size of the sun running until the heat death of the universe) would turn out to be easily broken (e.g., in seconds on our laptops).</p>
<p>In [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03928">BGS17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02440">ABGS20</a>], we <em>almost</em> showed that CVP is “SETH-hard,” i.e., that a \( {2^{(1-\epsilon)n}}\)-time algorithm for CVP would imply such an algorithm for \( {k}\)-SAT for <em>any</em> constant \( {k}\). This would falsify SETH. So, we <em>almost</em> showed that the [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01995">ADS15</a>] algorithm is optimal. The “almost” is because our proof works with \( {\ell_p}\) norms, that is, we show hardness for the version of CVP in which the distance from the target to a lattice vector is defined in terms of the \( {\ell_p}\) norm,</p>
<p align="center">\( \displaystyle \|\mathbf{x}\|_p := (|x_1|^p + \cdots + |x_d|^p)^{1/p} \; . \)</p>
<p>We call the corresponding problem \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\). In fact, our proof works for all \( {\ell_p}\) norms <em>except</em> when \( {p}\) is an even integer. (To see why this might happen, notice \( {\|\mathbf{x}\|_p^p}\) is a polynomial in the \( {x_i}\) if and only if \( {p}\) is an even integer. In fact, there’s some sense in which “\( {\ell_2}\) is the easiest norm,” because for any \( {p}\), there is a linear map \( {A \in {\mathbb R}^{d \times m}}\) such that \( {m}\) is not too large and \( {\|\mathbf{x}\|_2 \approx \|A \mathbf{x}\|_p}\).) Of course, we are most interested in the case \( {p= 2}\) (the only case for which the [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01995">ADS15</a>] algorithm works), which is an even integer! Indeed, for all \( {p \neq 2}\), the fastest known algorithm for CVP is still Ravi Kannan’s \( {n^{O(n)}}\)-time algorithm from 1987 [<a href="https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/Minkowski_s_convex_body_theorem_and_integer_programming/6607328/files/12097865.pdf">Kan87</a>]. (For SVP and for constant-factor approximate CVP, \(2^{O(n)}\)-time algorithms are known [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5666">DPV11</a>].)</p>
<p>In fact, we showed that for \( {p = 2}\), no “natural” reduction can rule out a \( {2^{3n/4}}\)-time algorithm for CVP under SETH. A “natural” reduction is one with a fixed bijection between witnesses. In particular, any “natural” reduction from \( {3}\)-SAT to CVP must reduce to a lattice with rank at least roughly \( {4n/3}\). So, new ideas will be needed to prove stronger hardness of CVP in the \( {\ell_2}\) norm.</p>
<h1>2. Open problems</h1>
<p>We now discuss some of the problems that we left open in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03928">BGS17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02440">ABGS20</a>]. For simplicity, we ask for specific results (e.g., “prove that problem \( {A}\) is \( {T}\)-hard under hypothesis \( {B}\)“), but of course any similar results would be very interesting (e.g., “\( {A}\) is \( {T’}\)-hard under hypothesis \( {B’}\)“).</p>
<h2>2.1. Hardness in the \(\ell_2\) norm</h2>
<p>The most obvious question that we left open is, of course, to prove similar \( {2^n}\)-time hardness results for \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_2}\) (and more generally for \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) for even integers \( {p}\)).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 1.</b> Show that there is no \( {2^{0.99 n}}\)-time algorithm for \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_2}\) assuming SETH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that we showed that any proof of such a strong result would have to use an “unnatural” reduction. So, a fundamentally different approach is needed. One potentially promising direction would be to find a Cook reduction, as our limitations only apply to Karp reductions.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one might try for a different result that gets around this “natural” reduction limitations. E.g., even the following much weaker result would be very interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 2.</b> Show an efficient reduction from \( {3}\)-SAT on \( {n}\) variables to \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_2}\) on a lattice of rank \( {\approx 10n}\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a reduction to \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_2}\) on a lattice of rank \( {Cn}\) for some large constant \( {C}\) is known by applying the Sparsification Lemma [<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/ipz.pdf">IPZ01</a>] to \( {3}\)-SAT, but showing such a reduction for any reasonably small \( {C}\) or even any explicit \( {C}\) using a different proof technique would be interesting.</p>
<p>Also, our limitations only apply to reductions that map satisfying assignments to <em>exact</em> closest vectors. So, one might try to get around our limitation by working directly with approximate versions of \( {3}\)-SAT and \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_2}\). (In [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02440">ABGS20</a>], we show such reductions from Gap-\( {k}\)-SAT to constant-factor approximate \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) for all \( {p \notin 2{\mathbb Z}}\) as well as all \( {k \leq p}\). We also show reductions from Gap-\( {k}\)-Parity that achieve relatively large approximation factors.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 3.</b> Show an efficient reduction from Gap-\( {3}\)-SAT on \( {n}\) variables to approximate \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_2}\) on a lattice of rank \( {n}\).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2.2. Hardness in \(\ell_p\) norms</h2>
<p>Intuitively, one reason that we are able to prove such strong results for \( {\ell_p}\) norms for \( {p \neq 2}\) is because we can use lattices with large ambient dimension \( {d}\) but low rank \( {n}\). In other words, while our reductions produce lattices \( {{\cal{L}}}\) that live in some \( {n}\)-dimensional subspace of \( {\ell_p}\)-space, the ambient space itself has large dimension \( {d}\) relative to \( {n}\). Of course, any subspace of the \( {\ell_2}\) norm is an \( {\ell_2}\) subspace (i.e., every slice of a ball is a lower-dimensional ball), so in the \( {\ell_2}\) norm, one can assume without loss of generality that \( {d = n}\). In particular, if we were able to prove \( {2^n}\)-hardness for the \( {\ell_2}\) norm, then we would actually prove \( {2^d}\)-hardness for free. However, a potentially easier problem would be to improve the \( {2^n}\)-hardness of \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) shown in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03928">BGS17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02440">ABGS20</a>]  to \( {2^d}\)-hardness for some \( p \neq 2 \).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 4.</b> Show that there is no \( {2^{0.99 d}}\)-time algorithm for \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) (for some \( {p}\)) assuming SETH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More generally, it would be very interesting to settle the fine-grained complexity of \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) for some \( {p \neq 2}\) (either in terms of rank \( {n} \) or dimension \( {d} \)). This could take the form either of showing improved algorithms (currently the fastest algorithms for \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) for general \( {p}\) run in \( {n^{O(n)}}\)-time [<a href="https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/Minkowski_s_convex_body_theorem_and_integer_programming/6607328/files/12097865.pdf">Kan87</a>], and \( {2^{O(n)}}\)-time for a constant approximation factor [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5666">DPV11</a>]), or showing super-\( {2^n}\) hardness, or both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 5.</b> Show matching upper bounds and lower bounds (under SETH) for \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) for some \( {p}\) (possibly with a constant approximation factor).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case where \( {p = \infty}\) is especially interesting. Indeed, because the kissing number in the \( {\ell_\infty}\) norm is \( {3^n-1}\), one might guess that the fastest algorithms for \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_\infty}\) and \( {{\mathrm{SVP}}_\infty}\) actually run in time \( {3^{n + o(n)}}\) or perhaps \( {3^{d + o(d)}}\). (See [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02358">AM18</a>], which essentially achieves this.) We therefore ask whether stronger lower bounds can be proven in this special case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 6.</b> Show that \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_\infty}\) cannot be solved in time \( {3^{0.99n}}\) (under SETH).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2.3. Hardness closer to crypto</h2>
<p>The most relevant problem to cryptography is approximate \( {{\mathrm{SVP}}_2}\) with an approximation factor that is polynomial in the rank \( {n}\). Our fastest algorithms to solve this problem work via a reduction to exact (or near exact) \( {{\mathrm{SVP}}_2}\) with some lower rank \( {n’ = \Theta(n)}\), so that even for these polynomial approximation factors, our fastest algorithms run in time \( {2^{\Omega(n)}}\) (where the hidden constant depends on the polynomial; see <a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/2020/04/lattice-blog-reduction-part-i-bkz/">Michael’s post</a> for more on this topic). And, hardness results for exact SVP rule out attacks on cryptography that use such reductions. We currently only know how to rule out \( {2^{o(n)}}\)-time algorithms for \( {{\mathrm{SVP}}_2}\) (under the Gap-ETH assumption). We ask whether we can do better. (In [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00942">AS18b</a>], we proved the stronger result below for \( {\ell_p}\) norms for large enough \( {p \notin 2{\mathbb Z}}\).)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 7.</b> Prove that there is no \( {2^{n/10}}\)-time algorithm for \( {{\mathrm{SVP}}_2}\) (under SETH).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, we would ideally like to directly rule out faster algorithms for approximate \( {{\mathrm{SVP}}_2}\) with the approximation factors that are most directly relevant to cryptography. There are serious complexity-theoretic barriers to overcome to get all the way there (e.g., \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) and \( {{\mathrm{SVP}}_p}\) are known to be in \( {{\mathsf{NP}}} \cap {{\mathsf{coNP}}}\) for large enough polynomial approximation factors. But, we can still hope to get as close as possible, by proving stronger hardness results for approximate \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) and approximate \( {{\mathrm{SVP}}_p}\). Indeed, a beautiful sequence of works showed hardness for approximation factors up to \( {n^{c/\log \log n}}\) (so “nearly polynomial) [<a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dinuri/mypapers/cvpjournal.pdf">DKRS03</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04087">HR12</a>], but these results are not fine grained.</p>
<p>The best <em>fine-grained</em> hardness of approximation results known rule out algorithms for small constant-factor approximations for \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) with \( {p \notin 2{\mathbb Z}}\) in time \( {2^{0.99n}}\) for \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) and \( {{\mathrm{SVP}}_p}\) for any \( {p}\) in time \( {2^{o(n)}}\). We ask whether we can do better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 8.</b> Prove that there is no \( {2^{0.99 n}}\)-time algorithm for \( {2}\)-approximate \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) (under some form of Gap-SETH, see below).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 9.</b> Prove that there is no \( {2^{o(n)}}\)-time algorithm for \( {\gamma}\)-approximate \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) for superconstant \( {\gamma = \omega(1)}\) (under Gap-ETH).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2.4. Gap-SETH?</h2>
<p>One issue that arose in our attempts to prove fine-grained hardness of approximation results is that we don’t even know the “right” complexity-theoretic assumption about approximate CSPs to use as a starting point. For fine-grained hardness of exact problems, ETH and SETH are very well established hypotheses, and they are in some sense “the weakest possible” assumptions of their form. E.g., it is easy to see that \( {k}\)-SAT is \( {2^{Cn}}\) hard if any \( {k}\)-CSP is. But, for hardness of approximation, the situation is less clear.</p>
<p>The analogue of ETH in the regime of hardness of approximation is the beautiful Gap-ETH assumption, which was defined independently by Irit Dinur [<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2016/128/">Din16</a>] and Pasin Manurangsi and Prasad Raghavendra [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02986.pdf">MR17</a>]. This assumption says that there exists some constant approximation factor \( {\delta \neq 1}\) such that \( {\delta}\)-Gap-\( {3}\)-SAT cannot be solved in time \( {2^{o(n)}}\). (Formally, both Dinur and Manurangsi and Raghavendra say that there is no \( {2^{o(n)}}\)-time algorithm that distinguishes a satisfiable formula from a formula for which no assignment satisfies more than a \( {(1-\epsilon)}\) fraction of the clauses, but we ignore this requirement of perfect completeness here.) It is easy to see that this hypothesis is equivalent to a similar hypothesis about any \( {3}\)-CSP (or, indeed, any \( {k}\)-CSP for any constant\( {k}\)).</p>
<p>However, to prove hardness of approximation with the finest of grains, we need some “gap” analogue of SETH, i.e., we would like to assume that for large enough \( {k}\), some Gap-\( {k}\)-CSP is hard to approximate up to some constant factor \( {\delta \neq 1}\) in better than \( {2^{0.99n}}\)-time. (Formally, we should add an additional variable \( {\epsilon &gt; 0}\) and have such a hypothesis for every running time \( {2^{(1-\epsilon)n}}\), but we set \( {\epsilon = 0.01}\) here to keep things relatively simple.)</p>
<p>An issue arises here concerning the dependence of the approximation factor \( {\delta}\) on the arity \( {k}\). In particular, recall that \( {k}\)-SAT can be trivially approximated up to a factor of \( {1-2^{-k}}\) (since a random assignment satisfies a \( {1-2^{-k}}\) fraction of the clauses in expectation). So, if we define Gap-SETH in terms of Gap-\( {k}\)-SAT, then we must choose \( {\delta = \delta(k) \geq 1-2^{-k}}\) that converges to one as \(k\) increases. Manurangsi proposed such a version of Gap-SETH in his thesis [<a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-49.html">Man19</a>, Conjecture 12.1], specifically that for every large enough constant \( {k}\) there exists a constant \( {\delta = \delta(k) \neq 1}\) such that Gap-\( {k}\)-SAT cannot be approximated up to a factor of \( {\delta}\) in time \( {2^{0.99n}}\). (Again, we are leaving out an additional variable, \( {\epsilon}\).)</p>
<p>If we rely on this version of Gap-SETH, then our current techniques seem to get stuck at proving hardness of approximation for, say, \( {\gamma}\)-approximate \( {{\mathrm{CVP}}_p}\) for some non-explicit constant \( {\gamma_p &gt; 1}\) (and, if one works out the numbers, one can see immediately that \( {\gamma_p}\) must be really quite close to one). However, other Gap-\(k\)-CSPs are known to be (\(\mathsf{NP}\)-)hard to approximate up to much better approximation factors. E.g., for any \( {k}\), Gap-\(k\)-Parity is \( {{\mathsf{NP}}}\)-hard to approximate up to any constant approximation factor \( {1/2 &lt; \delta \leq 1}\) [<a href="http://kiosk.nada.kth.se/theory/projects/publications/optimaljh.pdf">Hås01</a>], and Gap-\( {k}\)-AND is \( {{\mathsf{NP}}}\)-hard to approximate for any constant approximation factor \( {\Omega(k/2^k) \leq \delta \leq 1}\) [<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2012/110/">Cha16</a>]. Indeed, Gap-\( {k}\)-AND is a quite natural problem to consider in this context since there is a fine-grained, approximation-factor preserving reduction from any Gap-\( {k}\)-CSP to Gap-\( {k}\)-AND. This generality motivates understanding the precise complexity of Gap-\( {k}\)-AND.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Open problem 10.</b> What is the fine-grained complexity of the \( {\delta}\)-Gap-\( {k}\)-AND problem in terms of \( {n}\), \( {k}\), and \( {\delta}\)? In particular, if</p>
<p align="center">\( \displaystyle C_{k,\delta} := \inf \{ C &gt; 0 \ : \ \text{there is a $2^{C_{k,\delta}}$-time algorithm for algorithm for $\delta$-Gap-$k$-AND}\}\)</p>
<p>then what is the behavior of \( {C_{k,\delta}}\) as \( {k \rightarrow \infty}\) (for various functions \( {\delta = \delta(k)}\) of \( {k}\))?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, if one were to hypothesize sufficiently strong hardness of \( {\delta}\)-Gap-\( {k}\)-AND — i.e., to define an appropriate variant of Gap-SETH based on Gap-\( {k}\)-AND — then one might be able to use this hypothesis to prove very strong fine-grained hardness of approximation results. There is a fine-grained (but non-approximation preserving) reduction from Gap-\( {k}\)-AND to Gap-\( {k}\)-SAT, and so Manurangsi’s Gap-SETH is equivalent to the conjecture that there exists some non-explicit \( {\delta(k)}\) such that \( {\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} C_{k,\delta} = 1}\).</p>

    <title>TR20-069 |  Optimal Error Pseudodistributions for Read-Once Branching Programs | 

	Eshan Chattopadhyay, 

	Jyun-Jie Liao</title>
    <summary>In a seminal work, Nisan (Combinatorica'92) constructed a pseudorandom generator for length $n$ and width $w$ read-once branching programs  with seed length $O(\log n\cdot \log(nw)+\log n\cdot\log(1/\varepsilon))$ and  error $\varepsilon$. It remains a central question  to reduce the seed length to $O(\log (nw/\varepsilon))$, which would prove that $\mathbf{BPL}=\mathbf{L}$. However, there has been no improvement on Nisan's construction for the case $n=w$, which is most relevant to space-bounded derandomization.




Recently, in a beautiful work, Braverman, Cohen and Garg (STOC'18) introduced the notion of a \emph{pseudorandom pseudo-distribution} (PRPD) and gave an explicit construction of a PRPD with seed length $\tilde{O}(\log n\cdot \log(nw)+\log(1/\varepsilon))$. A PRPD is a relaxation of a pseudorandom generator, which suffices for derandomizing $\mathbf{BPL}$ and also implies a hitting set. Unfortunately, their construction is quite involved and complicated. Hoza and Zuckerman (FOCS'18) later constructed a much simpler hitting set generator with seed length $O(\log n\cdot \log(nw)+\log(1/\varepsilon))$, but their techniques are restricted to hitting sets.

In this work, we construct a PRPD with seed length 
$$O(\log n\cdot \log (nw)\cdot \log\log(nw)+\log(1/\varepsilon)).$$
This improves upon the construction in \cite{BCG18} by a $O(\log\log(1/\varepsilon))$ factor, and is optimal in the small error regime. In addition, we believe our construction and analysis to be   simpler than the work of Braverman, Cohen and Garg.</summary>

    <title>TR20-068 |  One-Sided Error Testing of Monomials and Affine Subspaces | 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Dana Ron</title>
    <summary>We consider the query complexity of three versions of the problem of testing monomials and affine (and linear) subspaces with one-sided error, and obtain the following results: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The general problem, in which the arity of the monomial (resp., co-dimension of the subspace) is not specified, has query complexity ${\widetilde{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the proximity parameter. 
\item The bounded problem, in which the arity of the monomial (resp., co-dimension of the subspace) is upper bounded by a fixed parameter, has query complexity ${\widetilde{O}}(1/\epsilon)$.
\item The exact problem, in which the arity of the monomial (resp., co-dimension of the subspace) is required to equal a fixed parameter (e.g., equals~2), has query complexity ${\widetilde{\Omega}}(\log n)$, where $n$ denotes the length of the argument for the tested function.  
\end{itemize}
The running time of the testers in the positive results is linear in their query complexity.</summary>

    <title>TR20-067 |  Computational and proof complexity of partial string avoidability | 

	Dmitry Itsykson, 

	Alexander Okhotin, 

	Vsevolod Oparin</title>
    <summary>The partial string avoidability problem is stated as follows: given a finite set of strings with possible ``holes'' (wildcard symbols), determine whether there exists a two-sided infinite string containing no substrings from this set, assuming that a hole matches every symbol. The problem is known to be NP-hard and in PSPACE, and this paper establishes its PSPACE-completeness. Next, string avoidability over the binary alphabet is interpreted as a version of conjunctive normal form satisfiability problem (SAT), where each clause has infinitely many shifted variants. Non-satisfiability of these formulas can be proved using variants of classical propositional proof systems, augmented with derivation rules for shifting proof lines
(such as clauses, inequalities, polynomials, etc). First, it is proved that there is a particular formula that has a short refutation in Resolution with a shift rule, but requires classical proofs of exponential size At the same time, it is shown that exponential lower bounds for classical proof systems can be translated for their shifted versions. Finally, it is shown that superpolynomial lower bounds on the size of shifted proofs would separate NP from PSPACE; a connection to lower bounds on circuit complexity is also established.</summary>

    <title>TR20-066 |  Quantum Implications of Huang&amp;#39;s Sensitivity Theorem | 

	Scott Aaronson, 

	Shalev Ben-David, 

	Robin Kothari, 

	Avishay Tal</title>
    <summary>Based on the recent breakthrough of Huang (2019), we show that for any total Boolean function $f$, the deterministic query complexity, $D(f)$, is at most quartic in the quantum query complexity, $Q(f)$: $D(f) = O(Q(f)^4)$. This matches the known separation (up to log factors) due to Ambainis, Balodis, Belovs, Lee, Santha, and Smotrovs (2017). We also use the result to resolve the quantum analogue of the Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg conjecture. We show that if $f$ is a nontrivial monotone graph property of an $n$-vertex graph specified by its adjacency matrix, then $Q(f) = \Omega(n)$, which is also optimal.</summary>

Francis Galton is a perfect example of a Victorian era scientist. Sir Galton, he was knighted in 1909, had many roles: a statistician, a sociologist, a psychologist, an anthropologist, a tropical explorer, a geographer, a meteorologist, a geneticist, and an inventor. He coined the phrase “nature versus nurture” and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton">more</a>.</p>
<p>
Today we trade in jokes for some mathematics of the virus.</p>
<p>
We wish there was something clever we can say about the spread of the virus. But the statistics of the spread are complex. We wish there was something theory can contribute to the fight against the virus. But the front-line is clearly dominated by medicine and biology.</p>
<p>
However there are two areas that are relevant. The first is the math of how fast the virus spreads and the second is how valid are the claims about the virus. The latter is an area where theory could play a role in the future.</p>
<p>
In preparing this discussion we noted that Galton was indeed an inventor. He invented a device to demonstrate the central limit theorem. You probably have seen some <a href="http://www.karlsims.com/marbles/">version</a>. Sometimes called the bean machine, it gives a visual demonstration of the central limit theorem. Other times it is called the Galton board. Perhaps if Galton were alive today he would be on cable news explaining how the virus spreads. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/05/01/mathematics-of-covid-19/marble-run/" rel="attachment wp-att-17009"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17009" height="300" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/marble-run.jpg?w=168&amp;h=300" width="168"/></a></p>
<p>
Galton also had views that are troubling. See <a href="https://www.statisticsviews.com/details/news/11158556/June-2019-issue-of-Significance-just-published.html">this</a> for example. He lived over one hundred years ago, but his views on eugenics are still upsetting. Should we not have featured him? What do you think?</p>
<p/><h2> Extinction </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The issue is will the terrible virus stop infecting people? Will it become extinct? Or will it at least stop infecting more and more people. The part of math that studies such questions was invented by Galton in 1889 as a model to track family names. We wish we were talking today about family names and not a killer virus. The area he invented is now called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_process">branching process</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> There was concern amongst the Victorians that aristocratic surnames were becoming extinct. Galton originally posed the question regarding the probability of such an event in an 1873 issue of The Educational Times, and the Reverend Henry Watson replied with a solution. Together, they then wrote an 1874 paper entitled <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2841222?origin=crossref&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">On the probability of the extinction of families</a>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We are interested in branching processes and when they are likely to become extinct. We want the virus to stop infecting people, and become extinct. Or at least stop its explosive growth that is so terrible. See these <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-flatten-the-curve-of-coronavirus-a-mathematician-explains-133514">comments</a>, for more information. </p>

</p><p/><h2> On Average </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The contagiousness of a disease is described by its “reproduction rate” or the average number of people infected by one infectious person in a population without immunity. You might also hear this number referred to as the <img alt="{R_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R_0}"/> value. When it is less than <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, the disease does not become an pandemic. This process is called a <i>branching process</i>. In order to tell if a branching process will eventually become extinct we need more than <img alt="{R_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R_0}"/>. That is we need to understand more than the average number of descendants. Let’s see why.</p>
<p>
Consider a process <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> that creates <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> descendants with probability <img alt="{a_{k}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_%7Bk%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a_{k}}"/> and a process <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> that creates <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> descendants with probability <img alt="{b_{k}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb_%7Bk%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b_{k}}"/>. The number of average descendants is for <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mu_{A} = a_{1} + 2a_{2} + \dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmu_%7BA%7D+%3D+a_%7B1%7D+%2B+2a_%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \mu_{A} = a_{1} + 2a_{2} + \dots "/></p>
<p>and for <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mu_{B} = b_{1} + 2b_{2} + \dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmu_%7BB%7D+%3D+b_%7B1%7D+%2B+2b_%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \mu_{B} = b_{1} + 2b_{2} + \dots "/></p>
<p>Is it always better to have the process with the smaller average? The answer is no.</p>
<p>
Consider the process <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  a_{0} = 0, a_{1} = 1, a_{2} = \epsilon, a_{3} = 0, \dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a_%7B0%7D+%3D+0%2C+a_%7B1%7D+%3D+1%2C+a_%7B2%7D+%3D+%5Cepsilon%2C+a_%7B3%7D+%3D+0%2C+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  a_{0} = 0, a_{1} = 1, a_{2} = \epsilon, a_{3} = 0, \dots "/></p>
<p>And consider the process <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  b_{0} = 1/n, b_{1} = 1/n, \dots, b_{n} = 1/n, b_{n+1} = 0, \dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++b_%7B0%7D+%3D+1%2Fn%2C+b_%7B1%7D+%3D+1%2Fn%2C+%5Cdots%2C+b_%7Bn%7D+%3D+1%2Fn%2C+b_%7Bn%2B1%7D+%3D+0%2C+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  b_{0} = 1/n, b_{1} = 1/n, \dots, b_{n} = 1/n, b_{n+1} = 0, \dots "/></p>
<p>The first average <img alt="{\mu_{A} = 1 + 2\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7BA%7D+%3D+1+%2B+2%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mu_{A} = 1 + 2\epsilon}"/> and the second average is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  1/n + 2/n + \cdots + n/n = (n+1)/2. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++1%2Fn+%2B+2%2Fn+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+n%2Fn+%3D+%28n%2B1%29%2F2.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  1/n + 2/n + \cdots + n/n = (n+1)/2. "/></p>
<p>Clearly the second has a much larger value for <img alt="{n \ge 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cge+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n \ge 2}"/>. But the first will never go extinct and the second can become extinct.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> It’s In the Variance </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The key difference is that the second process has higher <em>variance</em>. The importance of the variance—as opposed to the mean—is remembered in some ways but seems to be forgotten in others. It is the nub of one of the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/04/26/time-for-some-jokes/">jokes</a> we included in the previous post:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> There was a statistician who drowned crossing a river—that was only 3 feet deep on average. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
For an example closer to our point, suppose a third-party candidate <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> entering a race expects to take more votes away from candidate <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> than candidate <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> so as to double the margin that <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> expects to lose by. But suppose <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> alters the dynamics of the race so that the standard deviation is quadrupled. Then <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> generally has a better chance of winning under that scenario. If the distribution is normal and the original standard deviation equaled the expected margin, then <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>‘s chances of winning improve from 16% to over 30%.</p>
<p>
In our case, “winning” means outcomes where the virus dies out, locally and ultimately globally. Such outcomes are needed for opening up. It is not enough to reduce the number of active cases to “<img alt="{O(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(1)}"/>” because the branching started from such a state. Whatever active cases there are must be known and contained as well as <img alt="{O(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(1)}"/>. This is the situation currently <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52436658">claimed</a> in New Zealand.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Branching and Uncertainty </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
At the other end is the state where the virus is not contained but branching stops because of saturation. When the proportion of targeted descendants who have already had the virus and are (we hope) immune is greater than the branching factor, then the expectation takes over from the variance as a determinant of stoppage. This proportion is what is meant by “herd immunity” and is estimated to be 60–70% for this virus.</p>
<p>
What we feel is the central mystery is whether there are enough undetected cases to bring that point even possibly in range. Randomized testing in the New York area has found nearly a 25% rate of antibodies. Analogous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/health/coronavirus-antibodies-california.html">tests</a> in less-affected California and in other countries have found under 10% positive rates, however. Those results are subject to uncertainty in the representativeness of the samples.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We had planned on saying something about checking if reported data about the virus is correct, or is it faked. With so much at stake it seems smart to insist on data being verified. More on that in the future.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Optimization algorithms often rely on simple intuitive principles, but their analysis quickly leads to a lot of algebra, where the original idea is not transparent. In last month <a href="https://francisbach.com/computer-aided-analyses/">post</a>, <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/">Adrien Taylor</a> explained how convergence proofs could be automated. This month, I will show how proof sketches can be obtained easily for algorithms based on gradient descent. This will be done using vanishing step-sizes that lead to <em>gradient flows</em>.</p>



<h2>Gradient as local information</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The intuitive principle behind gradient descent is the quest for <em>local</em> descent. We thus need to characterize the local behavior of the function we aim to optimize. This is what gradients are for.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I will consider minimizing a function \(f\) over \(\mathbb{R}^d\). Assuming \(f\) is differentiable, a first order Taylor expansion of \(f\) around a point \(x\) leads to $$f(x+\delta) = f(x) + \nabla f(x) ^\top \delta + o(\| \delta\|),$$ for any norm \(\| \cdot \|\) on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), where \(\nabla f(x) \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is  the gradient of \(f\) at \(x\), composed of partial derivatives of \(f\). Therefore, around \(x\), \(f\) is approximately affine.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since we have a local affine approximation around \(x\), we can look for the direction of steepest descent, that is, the unit norm vector \(u \in \mathbb{R}^d\) such that \(f\) decays the most along \(u\), that is such that $$  u^\top \nabla f(x)$$ is minimized. This steepest descent direction depends on the choice of norm (assuming that the gradient is not zero at \(x\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the \(\ell_2\)-norm, then minimizing \(u^\top \nabla f(x)\) such that \(\|u\|_2 = 1\), leads to $$ \displaystyle u = \ – \frac{\nabla f(x)}{ \| \nabla f(x) \|_2},$$ that is the steepest descent is along the negative gradient (see an illustration below). In this blog post I will only focus on this steepest descent direction. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3542" height="149" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gradient_contours-1024x358.png" width="428"/>Function \(f\) represented through its contour lines for values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Negative gradient \(– \nabla f(x)\) as the steepest descent direction at point \(x\), which is orthogonal to the contour lines.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">As as side note, for the \(\ell_1\)-norm, then minimizing \(u^\top \nabla f(x)\) such that \(\|u\|_1 = 1\), leads to $$u \in\  – \arg\max_{ v \in \{-e_1,\, e_1,\, -e_2,\, e_2,\dots,\, -e_d,\, e_d \}} v^\top \nabla f(x),$$ where \(e_i\) is the \(i\)-th canonical basis vector of \(\mathbb{R}^d\). Here the steepest descent is along a coordinate axis (along the positive or negative side), and this leads to various forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_descent">coordinate descent</a> (this will probably be a topic for another post). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that the negative gradient leads to the steepest descent direction (for the Euclidean norm), it is natural to use this as a direction for an iterative algorithm, an idea that dates back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy">Cauchy</a> in 1847 [<a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90190w/f406">1</a>] (see the nice summary by Claude Le Maréchal [<a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/documenta/vol-ismp/40_lemarechal-claude.pdf">2</a>]).</p>



<h2>From gradient descent to gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">Gradient descent</a> is the most classical iterative algorithm to minimize differentiable functions. It takes the form $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} \, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n})$$ at iteration \(n\), where \(\gamma &gt; 0 \) is a step-size.  </p>



<p class="justify-text">Gradient descent comes in many flavors, steepest, stochastic, pre-conditioned, conjugate, proximal, projected, accelerated, etc. There are lots of papers and books [e.g., 3, 4, 5] analyzing it in various settings.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, to simplify its analysis and setting the stage for later posts, I will present the gradient flow, which is essentially the limit of gradient descent when the step-size \(\gamma\) tends to zero.</p>



<p class="justify-text">More precisely, this is obtained by considering that our iterates \(x_n\) are sampled at each multiple of \(\gamma\), from a function \(X: \mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}^d\), as $$x_n = X(n\gamma).$$ We can then use a piecewise affine interpolation to define a function defined on all points. We then have for \(t = n\gamma\), $$X(t + \gamma) = x_{n+1} =x_{n} \, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n}) = X(t)\, – \gamma \nabla f(X(t)).$$ Dividing by \(\gamma\), we get $$ \frac{1}{\gamma} \big[ X(t + \gamma) \, – X(t) \big] = \, – \nabla f(X(t)).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\gamma\) tends to zero (and with simple additional regularity assumptions), the left hand side tends to the derivative of \(X\) at \(t\), and thus the function \(X\) tends to the solution of the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation">ordinary differential equation</a> $$ \dot{X}(t) = \ – \nabla f (X(t)).$$ See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3479" height="271" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logistic_2d_flow.gif" width="348"/>Gradient descent (with piece-wise affine interpolation between iterates) vs. gradient flow on the same time scale for a logistic regression problem.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Studying the gradient flow in lieu of the gradient descent recursions comes with pros and cons.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simplified analyses</strong>. The gradient flow has no step-size, so all the traditional annoying issues regarding the choice of step-size, with line-search, constant, decreasing or with a weird schedule are unnecessary. Moreover, the use of differential calculus makes proving properties really simple (see examples below). We can thus focus on the essence of the algorithm rather than on technicalities.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From (continuous) flow to actual (discrete) algorithms</strong>. A flow cannot be run on a computer at is is a continuous-time object. The traditional discretization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler method</a>, that exactly replaces the flow by a piecewise-affine interpolation of the gradient descent iterates, where as shown above, we see \(x_n\) as \(X(n\gamma)\), where \(\gamma\) is the time increment between two samples. Four interesting observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>No direct proof transfer</em> : While Euler discretization always provides an algorithm, the generic convergence proofs do not allow to transfer immediately continuous-time proofs to convergence results for the discrete analysis. A key difficulty is to set-up the step-size \(\gamma\). However, the analysis can often be mimicked, i.e., similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function">Lyapunov functions</a> can be used (see examples below).</li><li><em>Proximal algorithms</em> : Faced with non-continuous gradient functions, the <em>forward</em> version of Euler discretization \(x_{n+1} = x_{n} – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n})\) can be replaced by the <em>backward</em> version $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} \, –  \gamma \nabla f(x_{n+1}),$$ which is only implicit as it can be solved by minimizing $$ f(x) + \frac{1}{2\gamma}\|x-x_{n}\|_2^2,$$ thus leading to the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithme_proximal_(optimisation)">proximal point algorithm</a>. Forward-backward schemes can also be recovered when \(f\) is the sum of a smooth and a non-smooth term.</li><li><em>Stochastic gradient descent</em> : There are two ways to deal with stochastic gradient descent, leading to two very different continuous limits. Adding independent and identically distributed (for simplicity) zero-mean noise \(\varepsilon_n\) to the gradient leads to the recursion $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} – \gamma \big[ \nabla f(x_{n}) + \varepsilon_n\big] = x_{n}\, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n}) \,- \gamma \varepsilon_n,$$ where the noise is multiplied by the step-size \(\gamma\). Surprisingly, taking the limit when \(\gamma\) tends to zero leads to the deterministic gradient flow equation. A more detailed argument is presented at the end of post, but the main hand-waving reason is that the noise contribution vanishes because it is multiplied by the step-size. Note that this limiting behavior is consistent with a convergence to a minimizer of \(f\).</li><li><em>Convergence to a Langevin diffusion</em> : When instead the noise is added with magnitude proportional to the square root \(\sqrt{2 \gamma}\) of the step-size (which is asymptotically larger than \(\gamma\)), when \(\gamma\) tends to zero, and if the covariance of the noise is identity, we converge to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_process">diffusion process</a> which is the solution of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation">stochastic differential equation</a>: $$ dX(t) = \ – \nabla f(X(t)) + \sqrt{2} dB(t),$$ where \(B\) is a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>. Moreover, as \(t\) tends to infinity, \(X(t)\) happens to tend in distribution to a random variable with density proportional to \(\exp( – f(x) )\). See more details at the end of the post and in [6]. The difference in behavior is illustrated below.</li></ul>

The flow is deterministic and converges to a stationary point of \(f\) (here the global minimum), while the diffusion is stochastic and converges to a distribution (which is typically not a point mass)</figure></div>



<h2>Properties of gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The gradient flow $$ \dot{X}(t) = \ – \nabla f (X(t)) $$ is well-defined for a wide variety of conditions on the function \(f\). The most classical ones are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem">Lipschitz-continuity</a> or semi-convexity [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13373-017-0101-1.pdf">7</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most obvious property is that the function decreases along the flow; in other words, \(f(X(t))\) is decreasing, which is a simple consequence of $$ \frac{d}{dt} f(X(t)) =  \nabla f(X(t))^\top \frac{dX(t)}{dt} =\  – \| \nabla f (X(t) )\|_2^2 \leqslant 0.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">If \(f\) is bounded from below, then \(f(X(t))\) will always converge (as a non-increasing function which is bounded from below, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_convergence_theorem">here</a>). However, in general, \(X(t)\) may not always converge without any further assumptions, e.g., it may oscillate forever. This is however rare and there are a variety of sufficient conditions for convergence of gradient flows, that date back to Lojasiewicz [8], and are based on “Lojasiewicz inequalities” that state that for \(y\) and \(x\) close enough, \(|f(x) – f(y)|^{1-\theta} \leqslant C \| \nabla f(x)\|\) for some \(C &gt; 0 \) and \(\theta \in (0,1)\). These are satisfied for “sub-analytical functions”, that include most functions one can imagine [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/sdfe/reader/pii/S0022247X05006864/pdf">9</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Once \(X(t)\) converges to some \(X(\infty) \in \mathbb{R}^d\), assuming \(\nabla f\) is continuous, we must have \(\nabla f(X(\infty))=0\), that is, \(X(\infty)\) is a stationary point of \(f\). Among all stationary points (that can be local minima, local maxima, or saddle-points), the one to which \(X(t)\) converges to depends on \(X(0)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given any stationary point, one can look at the set of initializations that lead to it. Typically, only local minima are stable, that is, the attraction basins of other stationary points has typically zero Lebesgue measure (see, e.g., [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v49/lee16.pdf">10</a>]). See examples below. </p>



<p class="justify-text">We start with a simple function defined on the two-dimensional plane, with several local minima and saddle-points.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3490" height="401" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/plot_non_convex-1.png" width="511"/>Various gradient flows trajectories, starting from green points and ending in black points. Note the proximity of the three top starting points, all ending in different local minima. See the motion below.</figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3492" height="500" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logistic_2d_flow_noncvx-1.gif" width="519"/>Various gradient flows trajectories, in motion! All flows share the same time scale. Some seem “slower” than others (because the gradient norm is small).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Before moving on, I cannot resist presenting a “real” two-dimensional example that probably all skiers, hikers, and cyclists with some form of mathematical abilities have thought of, the topographic map. Here is an example below:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3751" height="458" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/glandon_croix_de_fer-1-1024x1024.jpg" width="458"/>Extract from <a href="https://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/">IGN</a> topographic map, around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Glandon">Col du Glandon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_la_Croix_de_Fer">Col de la Croix de Fer</a> (French Alps).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Given the topographic map, how would gradient descent or gradient flow perform? Clearly, this corresponds to a non convex function, but it is quite well-behaved, as following water flows will typically lead to sea level. I chose two starting points famous to cyclists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Glandon">Col du Glandon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_la_Croix_de_Fer">Col de la Croix de Fer</a>, and ran gradient descent with a small step-size (to approximate the gradient flow), without noise (left) and with noise (right), on the topographic map (thanks to <a href="http://recherche.ign.fr/labos/matis/cv.php?nom=Landrieu">Loïc Landrieu</a> for the data extraction).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3753" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flows_final_square_small-1024x394.png"/></figure>



<p class="justify-text">Without noise, the descent from la Croix de Fer ends up getting stuck quickly in a local minimum, while the one from Glandon goes down to the valley, but then is not able to follow the almost flat slope. When noise is added, the two flows go a bit lower, highlighting the benefits of noise to escape local minima.</p>



<h2>Gradient flows for optimization and machine learning</h2>



<p class="justify-text">There are (at least) two key questions in optimization and machine learning related to gradient flows: </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>When can we have global guarantees for convergence? That is, can we make sure that we choose an initialization point well enough to get the the global optimum <em>without knowing where the global optimum is</em>. A key difficulty is that the volume of the attraction basin of the global optimum can be made arbitrarily small, even for infinitely differentiable functions (imagine a function equal to zero everywhere except on a small ball where it is negative).</li><li>How fast can we get there? “there” can be a stationary point or a global optimum. This is an important question as mere convergence in the limit may be arbitrarily slow [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6707-gradient-descent-can-take-exponential-time-to-escape-saddle-points.pdf">11</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">An important class of function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function">convex functions</a>, where everything works out very well. We will study them below. Other functions will be studied in future posts.</p>



<h2>Convex functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now assume that the function \(f\) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function">convex</a> and differentiable. Within machine learning, this corresponds to objective functions encountered for supervised learning which are based on empirical risk minimization with a prediction function which is linearly parameterized, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are various definitions of convexity, which are based on global properties (the function is always “below its chords”, or it is always “above its tangents”) or local properties (the Hessian is always positive semi-definite). The one which we need here is to be above its tangents, that is, for any \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d\), $$f(x) \geqslant f(y)  + \nabla f(y)^\top ( x \, – y).$$ Applying this to any stationary point \(y\) such that \(\nabla f(y)=0\) shows that for all \(x\), \(f(x) \geqslant f(y)\), that is, \(y\) is a global minimizer of \(f\). This is the classical benefit of convexity: no need to worry about local minima.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another property we will need is the Lojasiewicz inequality, which is in particular satisfied when \(f\) is \(\mu\)-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function#Strongly_convex_functions">strongly convex</a> (that is, \(f – \frac{1}{2} \| \cdot \|_2^2\) is convex): $$ f(x) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{2 \mu} \| \nabla f (x)\|^2$$ for any minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(f\) and any \(x\). This property allows to go from a bound on the gradient norm to a bound on function values.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We then obtain the convergence rate <em>in one line</em> as follows (see more details in [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6711-integration-methods-and-optimization-algorithms.pdf">12</a>]): $$ \frac{d}{dt} \big[ f(X(t))\ – f(x_\ast) \big] =\  \nabla f(X(t))^\top \dot{X}(t) =  \ – \| \nabla f(X(t))\|_2^2 \leqslant \ – 2\mu  \big[ f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big]$$ using the Lojasiewicz inequality above, leading to by simple integration of the derivative of \(\log \big[ f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big]\): $$f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \exp( – 2\mu t ) \big[ f(X(0))\  – f(x_\ast) \big], $$ that is, the convergence is exponential and the characteristic time is proportional to \(1/\mu\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The gradient flow gives the main insight (exponential convergence); and applying the result above to \(t = \gamma n\), we seem to recover the traditional rate proportional to \(\exp( – \gamma \mu n)\); HOWEVER, this is only true asymptotically for \(\gamma\) tending to zero, and proving a result for gradient descent requires extra steps to deal with having a constant step-size. This requires typically \(\gamma \leqslant 1/L\), where \(L\) is the smoothness constant of \(f\), and the simplest proof happens to use the same structure (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04636">13</a>] and references therein, as well as [<a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=zvmmf&amp;paperid=7813&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng">14</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Without strong convexity, we have, using the tangent property at \(X(t)\) and \(x_\ast\): $$ \frac{d}{dt}\big[   \| X(t)\ – x_\ast \|^2 \big] = \ –   2 ( X(t) \ – x_\ast )^\top \nabla f(X(t)) \leqslant \ – 2 \big[ f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big],$$  leading to, by integrating from \(0\) to \(t\), and using the monotonicity of \(f(X(t))\): $$  f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t \big[ f(X(u)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big] du \leqslant \frac{1}{2t} \| X(0) \ – x_\ast \|^2 \ – \frac{1}{2t} \| X(t) \ – x_\ast \|^2.$$ We recover the usual rates in \(O(1/n)\), with \(t = \gamma n\), with the same caveat as above (the step-size needs to be bounded).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I covered the basic aspects of gradient flows, in particular their relationships with various forms of gradient descent, and their use in obtaining simple convergence justifications. Next months, I will cover extensions of the analyses above, in particular in terms of (1) acceleration for convex functions, where several flows and discretizations are interesting beyond the gradient flow and Euler method [12, 15], and (2) another class of functions which includes non-convex functions as encountered when learning with neural networks [16].</p>

<h2>Limits of stochastic gradient descent for vanishing step-sizes</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence to gradient flow. </strong>We consider fixed times \(t = n \gamma \) and \(s = m \gamma\), and we let \(\gamma\) tend to zero, with thus \(m\) and \(n\) tending to infinity. Starting from the recursion $$x_{n+1} = x_{n}\, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n})\  – \gamma \varepsilon_n,$$ we get the following by applying it \(m\) times: $$X(t+s) \ – X(t) = x_{n+m}-x_n = \ – \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \nabla f\Big(X\Big(t+\frac{sk}{m}\Big)\Big)\  – \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \varepsilon_{k+n}.$$ The term \(\displaystyle \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \nabla f\Big(X\Big(t+\frac{sk}{m}\Big)\Big)\) converges to \(\displaystyle \int_{t}^{t+s}\!\!\! \nabla f(X(u)) du\), while the term \(\gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \varepsilon_{k+n}\) has zero expectation and variance equal to \(\gamma^2 m = \gamma s \) times the variance of each \(\varepsilon_{k+n}\), and thus it tends to zero (since \(\gamma\) tends to zero). Thus, in the limit, $$X(t+s)\  – X(t) = \ – \int_{t}^{t+s} \!\!\! \nabla f(X(u)) du,$$ which is equivalent to the gradient flow equation.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence to diffusion.</strong> We consider the recursion $$x_{n+1} = x_{n}\,  – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n}) + \sqrt{2\gamma} \varepsilon_n.$$ With the same argument as above, we now get $$X(t+s) \ – X(t) = x_{n+m}-x_n =\ – \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \nabla f\Big(X\Big(t+\frac{sk}{m}\Big)\Big)\ – \sqrt{2\gamma} \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \varepsilon_{k+n}.$$ Now the second term has zero mean but a variance proportional to \(2s\) (<em>which does not go to zero when \(\gamma\) goes to zero</em>). We can then use when \(m\) tends to infinity the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process#Wiener_process_as_a_limit_of_random_walk">limit of the sum of independent variables as a Wiener process</a>, to get $$X(t+s)\ – X(t) =\  – \int_{t}^{t+s} \!\!\! \nabla f(X(u)) du + \sqrt{2} \big[ B(t+s)-B(t) \big].$$ The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4_diffusion#Invariant_measures">limiting distribution</a> of \(X(t)\) happens to be the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_measure">Gibbs</a> distribution, with density \(\exp(-f(x))\) (the factor of \(\sqrt{2}\) was added to avoid an extra constant factor in the Gibbs distribution). More on this in a future post.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: A classic result from Christofides in the 70s tells us that a fast algorithm for the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) exists which returns a solution at most 3/2 times worse than the optimal. Since then, however, no better approximation algorithm has been found. In this talk, I will give an overview of research towards the goal of beating 3/2 and will present the first sub-3/2 approximation algorithm for the special case of “half integral” TSP instances. These instances have received significant attention in part due to a conjecture from Schalekamp, Williamson and van Zuylen that they attain the integrality gap of the subtour polytope. If this conjecture is true, our work shows that the integrality gap of the polytope is bounded away from 3/2, giving hope for an improved approximation for the general case. This presentation is of joint work with Anna Karlin and Shayan Oveis Gharan.</p></blockquote></div>

    <title>An interview with Rob van Glabbeek, CONCUR Test-of-Time Award recipient</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This post is devoted to the third interview with the <a href="https://concur2020.forsyte.at/test-of-time/index.html">colleagues</a> who were selected for the first edition of the CONCUR  Test-of-Time Award. (See <a href="https://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2020/04/an-interview-with-davide-sangiorgi.html">here</a> for the interview with <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sangio/">Davide Sangiorgi</a>, and <a href="https://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2020/04/an-interview-with-nancy-lynch-and.html">here</a> for the interview with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/lynch/">Nancy Lynch</a> and <a href="http://profs.sci.univr.it/~segala/">Roberto Segala</a>.) I asked <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/">Rob van Glabbeek</a> (Data61, CSIRO, Sydney, Australia) a few questions via email and I am happy share his answers with readers of this blog below. Rob's words brought me back to the time when the CONCUR conference started and our field of concurrency theory was roughly a decade old. I hope that his interesting account and opinions will inspire young researchers in concurrency theory of all ages.<br/><br/>Luca: You receive one of the two CONCUR ToT Awards for the period  1990-1993 for your companion papers on "The Linear Time-Branching Time  Spectrum", published at CONCUR 1990 and 1993. Could you tell us briefly  what spurred you to  embark in the encyclopaedic study of process semantics you developed in  those two papers and what were your main sources of inspiration?<br/><br/>Rob: My PhD supervisors, Jan Willem Klop and Jan Bergstra, were examining<br/>bisimulation semantics, but also failures semantics, in collaboration<br/>with Ernst-Ruediger Olderog, and at some point, together with Jos Baeten,<br/>wrote a paper on ready-trace semantics to deal with a priority operator.<br/>I had a need to see these activities, and also those of Tony Hoare and<br/>Robin Milner, as revealing different aspects of the same greater whole,<br/>rather than as isolated research efforts. This led naturally to an<br/>abstraction of their work in which the crucial difference was the semantic<br/>equivalence employed. Ordering these semantics in a lattice was never<br/>optional for me, but necessary to see the larger picture.  It may be in<br/>my nature to relate different solutions to similar problems I encounter<br/>by placing them in lattices.<br/><span class="im"/> <br/>Luca: Did you imagine at the time that the papers on "The Linear Time-Branching Time Spectrum" would have so much impact? <br/><div><br/></div><div>Rob: I didn't think much about impact in those days. I wrote the papers<br/>because I felt the need to do so, and given that, could just as well<br/>publish them. Had I made an estimate, I would have guessed that my<br/>papers would have impact, as I imagined that things that I find<br/>necessary to know would interest some others too. But I would have<br/>underestimated the amount of impact, in part because I had grossly<br/>underestimated the size of the research community eventually working<br/>on related matters.<span class="im"><br/></span></div><div><br/></div><div>Luca: In your papers, you present characterizations of process semantics in  relational form, via testing scenarios, via modal logics and in terms of  (conditional) equational axiomatizations. Of all those  characterizations, which ones do you think have been most useful in  future work? To your mind, what are the most  interesting or unexpected uses in the  literature of the notions and techniques you developed in the "The  Linear Time-Branching Time Spectrum"? </div><div> </div><div>Rob: I think that all these characterizations together shed the light on<br/>process semantics that makes them understandable and useful.<br/>Relational characterizations, i.e., of (bi)simulations, are often the<br/>most useful to grasp what kind of relation one has, and this is essential<br/>for any use. But modal characterizations are intimately linked with<br/>model checking, which is one of the more successful verification tools.<br/>Equational characterizations also find practical use in verification,<br/>e.g., in normalization. Yet, they are most useful in illustrating<br/>the essential difference between process semantics, and thus form a guide<br/>in choosing the right one for an application. To me, the testing scenarios<br/>are the most useful in weighing how realistic certain semantic<br/>identifications are in certain application contexts.</div><div><span class="im"/> </div><div>Luca: How much of your later work has  built on your award-winning papers? What follow-up results of yours are  you most proud of and why?</div><div> </div><div>Rob: About one third, I think.</div><div><ul><li>My work on action refinement, together with Ursula Goltz, extends theclassification of process semantics in a direction orthogonal to the linear time - branching time spectrum. I am proud of this work mostly because, for a distinct class of applications, action refinement is great criterion to tell which semantics equivalences one ought to prefer over others. These process semantics have also been used in later work on distributability with Ursula and with Jens-Wolfhard Schicke Uffmann. Distributability tells us which distributed systems can be cast as sequential systems cooperating asynchronously, and which fundamentally cannot.</li><li>I wrote several papers on Structural Operational Semantics, many jointly with Wan Fokkink, aiming to obtain congruence results for semantic equivalences. These works carefully employed the modal characterizations from my spectrum papers. I consider this work important because congruence properties are essential in verification, as we need compositionality to avoid state explosions. </li><li>I used a version of failure simulation semantics from my second spectrum paper in work with Yuxin Deng, Matthew Hennessy, Carroll Morgan and Chenyi Zhang, characterizing may- and must testing equivalences for probabilistic nondeterministic processes. Probability and nondeterminism interact in many applications, and I think that may- and must testing are the right tools to single out the essence of their semantics.</li></ul></div><div><span class="im"><br/></span> </div><div>Luca: If I remember correctly, your master thesis was in pure mathematics. Why  did you decide to move to a PhD in computer science? What was it like  to work as a PhD student at CWI in the late 1980s? How did you start  your collaborations with Jos Baeten and fellow PhD student Frits  Vaandrager, amongst others? </div><div> </div><div>Rob: I was interested in mathematical logic already since high school,<br/>after winning a book on the foundations of logic set theory in a<br/>mathematics Olympiad.  I found the material in my logic course,<br/>thought at the University of Leiden by Jan Bergstra, fascinating, and<br/>when doing a related exam at CWI, where Jan had moved to at that<br/>time, and he asked me to do a PhD on related subjects, I say no reason<br/>not to. But he had to convince me first that my work would not involve<br/>any computer science, as my student advisor at The University of<br/>Leiden, Professor Claas, had told us that this was not a real<br/>science. Fortunately, Jan had no problem passing that hurdle.<br/><br/>I was the third member of the team of Jan Bergstra and Jan Willem<br/>Klop, after Jos Baeten had been recruited a few months earlier, but in<br/>a more senior position. Frits arrived a month later than me. As we<br/>were exploring similar subjects, and shared an office, it was natural<br/>to collaborate. As these collaborations worked out very well, they<br/>became quite strong.<br/><br/>CWI was a marvelous environment in the late 1980s. Our group gradually<br/>grew beyond a dozen members, but there remained a much greater<br/>cohesion then I have seen anywhere else. We had weekly process<br/>algebra meetings, where each of us shared our recent ideas with others<br/>in the group. At those meetings, if one member presented a proof, the<br/>entire audience followed it step by step, contributing meaningfully<br/>where needed, and not a single error went unnoticed.</div><div><span class="im"><br/></span> </div><div>Luca: Already as PhD student, you took up leadership roles within the  community. For instance, I remember attending a workshop on "Combining  Compositionality and Concurrency" <span>in March 1988,</span> which you  co-organized with Ursula Goltz and Ernst-Ruediger Olderog. Would you  recommend to a PhD student that he/she become involved in that kind of  activities early on in their career? Do you think that doing so had a  positive effect on your future career?  </div><div> </div><div>Rob: Generally I recommend this. Although I co-organized this workshop<br/>because the circumstances were right for it, and the need great; not<br/>because I felt it necessary to organize things.  My advice to PhD<br/>students would not be specifically to add a leadership component to<br/>their CV regardless of the circumstances, but instead do take such an<br/>opportunity when the time is right, and not be shy because of lack of<br/>experience.</div><div> </div><div>This workshop definitively had a positive effect on my future career.<br/>When finishing my PhD I inquired at Stanford and MIT for a possible<br/>post-doc position, and the good impressions I had left at this<br/>workshop were a factor in getting offers from both institutes.<br/>In fact, Vaughan Pratt, who was deeply impressed with work I had<br/>presented at this workshop, convinced me to apply straight away for an<br/>assistant professorship, and this led to my job at Stanford.   </div><div><span class="im"><br/></span> </div><div>Luca: I still have vivid memories of your talk at the first CONCUR conference  in 1990 in Amsterdam, where you introduced notions of black-box  experiments on processes using an actual box and beer-glass mats. You  have attended and contributed to many of the editions of the conference  since then. To your mind, how has the focus of CONCUR changed since its  first edition in 1990? </div><div> </div><div>Rob: I think the focus on foundations has shifted somewhat to more applied<br/>topics, and the scope of "concurrency theory" has broadened significantly.<br/>Still, many topics from the earlier CONCURs are still celebrated today.</div><div><span class="im"><br/></span> </div><div>Luca: The last forty years have seen a huge amount of work on process algebra  and process calculi. However, the emphasis on that field of research  within concurrency theory seems to have diminished over the last few  years, even in Europe. What advice would you give to a young researcher  interested in working  on process calculi today? </div><div> </div><div>Rob: Until 10 years ago, many people I met in industry voiced the opinion<br/>that formals methods in general, and process algebra in particular,<br/>has been tried in the previous century, and had been found to not to<br/>scale to tackle practical problems. But more recently this opinion is<br/>on the way out, in part because it became clear that the kind of<br/>problems solved by formal methods are much more pressing then originally<br/>believed, and in part because many of the applications that were<br/>deemed to hard in the past, are now being addressed quite adequately.<br/>For these reasons, I think work on process calculi is still a good bet<br/>for a PhD study, although a real-world application motivating the<br/>theory studied is perhaps harder needed than in the past, and toy<br/>examples just to illustrate the theory are not always enough.</div><div><span class="im"><br/></span> </div><div>Luca: What are the research topics that currently excite you the most?</div><div> </div><div>Rob: I am very excited about showing liveness properties, in Lamport's<br/>sense, telling that a modeled system eventually achieves a desirable outcome.<br/>And even more in creating process algebraic verification frameworks<br/>that are in principle able to do this. I have come to believe that<br/>traditional approaches popular in process algebra and temporal logic<br/>can only deal with liveness properties when making fairness<br/>assumptions that are too strong and lead to unwarranted conclusions.<br/>Together with Peter Hoefner I have been advocating a weaker concept of<br/>fairness, that we call justness, that is much more suitable as a basis<br/>for formulating liveness properties. Embedding this concept into the<br/>conceptual foundations of process algebra and concurrency theory, in<br/>such a way that it can be effectively used in verification, is for a me<br/>a challenging task, involving many exciting open questions.<br/><br/>A vaguely related subject that excites me since the end of last year,<br/>is the extension of standard process algebra with a time-out operator,<br/>while still abstaining from quantifying time. I believe that such an<br/>extension reaches exactly the right level of expressiveness necessary<br/>for many applications.<br/><br/>Both topics also relate with the impossibility of correctly expressing<br/>expressing mutual exclusion in standard process algebras, a discovery<br/>that called forth many philosophical questions, such as under which<br/>assumptions on our hardware is mutual exclusion, when following the<br/>formal definitions of Dijkstra and others, even theoretically implementable.</div><div> </div></div>

    <title>Lessons from COVID-19: What works online and what doesn’t</title>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>(I am now on <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs">Twitter</a> ,  so you can follow this blog there too if you prefer it. –Boaz)</p>



<p>Between Zoom meetings and deadlines, I thought I’d jot down a few of my impressions so far on what lessons we can draw from this period on how well research and education can work online.  I’ve had a few surprises in both directions – things that worked better than I would have expected, and aspects that were more problematic than I realized. These are personal impressions – please do comment on your own experiences.</p>



<p>As a rule of thumb, the interactions that most successfully replicate online are those that are relatively short and focused (an hour or so – e.g., a focused research meeting, seminar talk, or a lecture in a course).  Other interactions (e.g., faculty meetings) are also fairly easily to port online, perhaps because the original wasn’t that great to begin with.</p>



<p>The things that are harder to replicate are sustained interactions over longer periods. These include more extended and less directed research collaborations, informal workshops, as well as support for students outside lectures in education.</p>



<p><strong>Works well: Research seminars</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how effective research seminars such as our <a href="https://mltheory.org/">machine learning theory seminar</a> are over Zoom. In particular these were no less interactive than physical seminars – in fact people are offten <em>more</em> comfortable asking questions on chat than they would during in-person seminars. I hope such seminars become common practice even after this period ends- flying a speaker across the country or the world to give an hour talk doesn’t makes much sense given that there is a perfectly satisfactory alternative. </p>



<p><strong>Works well: Lectures</strong></p>



<p>This term I am teaching <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">cryptography</a>, and online lectures on Zoom have gone surprisingly well (after  working out some <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/03/26/technology-for-theory-covid-19-edition/">technical issues</a>). Students participate on chat and ask questions, and seem to be following the lecture quite well. The important caveat is that lectures only work well for the students that attend and can follow them. For students who need extra support, it’s become much harder to access it.  It’s also much easier for students to (literally) “fall off the screen” and fall behind in a course, which brings me to the next point.</p>



<p><strong>Works less well: Support outside lectures</strong></p>



<p>Lectures are just one component of a course. Most of students’ learning occurs outside the classroom, where students meet together and work on problem sets, or discuss course material. These interactions between students (both related and unrelated to course) are where much of their intellectual growth happens. </p>



<p>All these interactions are greatly diminished online, and I did not yet see a good alternative. I’ve seen reduced attendance in office hours and sections, and reports are that students find it much harder to have the sort of chance discussions and opportunities to find study partners that they value so much.  If anything, this experience had made me <em>less</em> positive about the possibility of online education replacing physical colleges (though there are interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_Schools_at_KGI">hybrid models</a>, where the students are co-located but lecturers are online).</p>



<p><strong>Works less well: unstructured research collaborations</strong></p>



<p>A focused meeting reporting on results or deciding on work allocation works pretty well over Zoom. So far it seems that extended brainstorming meetings, such as talking to someone over several hours in a coffeeshop, are much harder to replicate. In particular, a good part of such meetings is often spent with people staring in silence into their notebooks. As I <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1253330145789673473">wrote</a>,  mutual silence seems to be very hard to do over Zoom.</p>



<p>Generally, informal week-long workshops, where much time is devoted to unstructured discussions, are ones that are most important to hold in person, and are hard (or maybe impossible) to replicate online. I have still not attended an online conference, but I suspect that these aspects of the conference would also be the ones hardest to replicate.</p>



<p><strong>Works well: faculty meetings</strong></p>



<p>I’ve always found it hard to bring a laptop to a faculty meeting and get work done, while listening with one ear to what’s going on. This is so much easier over Zoom <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p></div>

    <title>What’s Your Story?</title>
    <summary>Last quarter, I taught a course on research methods in TOC, which gave me an opportunity to think through many aspects of research. I was promoting a human-centric perspective on research: how to facilitate better research by addressing the conditions needed for an individual researcher and groups of researchers to succeed. As science is a communal effort, the communication of science is critical, and thus one of the topics we covered is oral presentations. There are plenty of resources about research talks, and mostly they emphasize form over matter. How many words in a slide? How many slides in a talk? how to and how not to use font colors? How to and how not to use animation? and so on. While all of these are important, I find that the failing of many research talks is on a much more basic level. Think back to a research talk you heard recently, or to one you heard a few months ago. You may remember how you felt and what you thought of the talk but what do you remember of this talk in terms of content? Most of us will find that we don’t remember much, I rarely do.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Last quarter, I taught <a href="https://omereingold.wordpress.com/cs-353-the-practice-of-theory-research/">a course on research methods</a> in TOC, which gave me an opportunity to think through many aspects of research.

<p>There are plenty of resources about research talks, and mostly they emphasize form over matter. How many words in a slide? How many slides in a talk? how to and how not to use font colors? How to and how not to use animation? and so on. While all of these are important, I find that the failing of many research talks is on a much more basic level.</p>
<p>Think back to a research talk you heard recently, or to one you heard a few months ago. You may remember how you felt and what you thought of the talk but what do you remember of this talk in terms of content? Most of us will find that we don’t remember much, I rarely do. Yet in our presentations, we often follow a research-paper-like mold and squeeze in many little details that are somehow important to us, forgetting that they will all vanish in our audience’s memory soon after (or completely missed in the first place). Giving a talk (writing a paper, writing a blog post etc.) is about communication: who is your audience? what are the limitation of the medium? what is the message you want to convey? Since so little stays with the audience long term, it makes sense to make sure that this little will be what seems most important for you to convey.</p>
<p>The idea I am promoting here is not new, and there are various techniques towards this goal. One (which I think Oded Goldreich shared with me), is to think of audience’s attention as a limited currency. Whenever you share a big idea you spend a big token and other ideas cost a smaller token. Imagine you have one or two big tokens and a few smaller tokens. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OFAhBw0OXs">Another approach</a>, emphasizes the notion of <strong>a premise</strong>. The idea promoted here is that a talk needs a premise and this should be the title of the talk. Furthermore, every slide needs a premise and it should be the title of the slide. A premise is a main idea and is a complete sentence. It is not unusual to find a slide titled “Analysis” or “Efficiency” but neither of these is a premise. “Problem X has an efficient algorithm” could be. The talk’s premise could help you distill what you want the audience to take out of your talk. It also helps shape the talk, as everything that doesn’t serve the premise shouldn’t be there. Note that each paper can provoke many different premises and thus many different talks.</p>
<p>Here I want to play with a different idea, that I find intriguing, even if it may seem a bit extreme. It will not be controversial that a good talk (and paper) tells a story. After all, humans understand and remember narratives. But could we take inspiration from the form of storytelling in fiction writing? A vast literature, classifies different kinds of stories and explores their templates (see for example <a href="http://storybistro.com/7-story-frameworks/">this short discussion</a>).  Can we find analogues to these types in scientific research talks?</p>
<p>The type of story that is easiest to relate to is the <strong>Quest/Hero’s Journey</strong> (think Lord of the Rings). These have several distinct ingredients: a call to adventure, tests, allies, enemies, ordeal, reward, victorious return. Some research talks that follow this template do it well and preserve a sense of suspense and excitement, others seem like a long list of problems and the tricks that the work uses to handle them.</p>
<p>I believe that many other story templates can find analogues is research talks as well. Here are my initial attempts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coming of age</strong> stories – this area of research previously only had naive ideas but this works brings significant depth.</li>
<li><strong>The Under<span style="color: #000000;">dog</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> (think David and Goliath): a modest technique that concurred a great challenge.</span></li>
<li><strong>Rags to Riches</strong> (think the Ugly Duckling): an area or technique that were not successful prove powerful.
<ul>
<li>Similarly: <strong>Rebirth</strong> (reinvention, renewal).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comedy</strong> (or the Clarity Tale) – conceptual works shedding a new perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Tragedy</strong> (or the Cautionary Tale) – Some impossibility results come to mind (couldn’t we view Arrow’s impossibility theorem as being tragic?)</li>
<li><strong>Redemption stories</strong>: the field so far has missed the point, was misleading or harmful, but this work makes amends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you suggest papers and a story type that could fit them?</p></div>

John Littlewood lived through the 1918–1919 flu pandemic, yet he appears not to have remarked on it in print. Nor can we find mention of it by Godfrey Hardy in <em>A Mathematician’s Apology</em>—though Hardy did write about the ravages of WW I.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought you might like some fun comments that are not about the current pandemic. </p>
<p>
This is not to say we are ignoring it. We are all fighting the virus in one way or another. Our hearts go out to those of you fighting it directly. We are all worried about ourselves and others. We are stuck at home, at least most of us. We are all in this terrible time together. We hope you all are safe and well. </p>
<p>
We thought we would list a few jokes and stories that you might enjoy. We wrote recently about one kind of mathematical <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/02/28/reductions-and-jokes/">joke</a> that can be given various proportions of pure levity and mathematical content. Our friends Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch, plus commenters in their <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/06/funniest-computer-science-joke-ever.html">item</a>, collected some jokes on the computer science side.</p>
<p>
Littlewood’s notion of “mathematical joke” leaned more on mathematical content, though his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician's_Miscellany">memoir</a> <em>A Mathematician’s Miscellany</em> includes many funny stories as well. At the end of his introduction to the book, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A good mathematical joke is better, and better mathematics, than a dozen mediocre papers. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We will start at the levity end. This is almost a math <a href="http://web.sonoma.edu/Math/faculty/falbo/jokes.html">joke</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The Daily News published a story saying that one-half of the MP (Members of Parliament) were crooks.<br/>
The Government took great exception to that and demanded a retraction and an apology.<br/>
The newspaper responded the next day with an apology and reported that one-half of the MPs were not crooks. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We like this one, even if it is not really a hardcore math one. It does rely on the fact that <img alt="{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%3D+1.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.}"/></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Jokes and More </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The following are some examples that we hope you all like. They are from a variety of sources: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Jokes that mathematicians think are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/13-math-jokes-that-every-mathematician-finds-absolutely-hilarious-2013-5">funny</a>. <p/>
</li><li>
Some are from <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3111/funny-tcs-related-papers-etc">StackExchange</a>. <p/>
</li><li>
Others are from Andrej Cherkaev’s <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/mathjokes.html">page</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>We have lightly edited a few.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> “My age is two billion years old,” said Paul Erdös. The point is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When I was seventeen years old it was said the earth was two billion years old. Now they say it is four billion years old. So my age is about two billion years old. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> There was a statistician that drowned crossing a river <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> It was 3 feet deep on average. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. The first one orders a beer. The second orders half a beer. The third orders a third of a beer. The bartender bellows, “Get the heck out of here, are you trying to ruin me?”</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> An chemist, a physicist, and a mathematician are stranded on an island when a can of food rolls ashore. The chemist and the physicist comes up with many ingenious ways to open the can. Then suddenly the mathematician gets a bright idea: “Assume we have a can opener <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/>” </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> A theorist decides she wants to learn more about practical problems. She sees a seminar with the title: “The Theory of Gears.” So she goes. The speaker stands up and begins, “The theory of gears with a finite number of teeth is well known <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/></p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> The reason that every major university maintains a department of mathematics is that it is cheaper to do this than to institutionalize all those people.</p>
<p>
Regarding the last one, Littlewood did after all write in his book:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Mathematics is a dangerous profession; an appreciable proportion of us go mad. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This appears to have been a playful swipe at Hardy’s decision to leave Cambridge for Oxford. It was couched in a discussion of events that would seem to have had tiny probabilities before they happened. </p>
<p>
The last two we’ve picked out from the above sites verge into philosophy:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> The cherry theorem: Question: What is a small, red, round thing that has a cherry pit inside? <br/>
Answer: A cherry.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> René Descartes went into his favorite bar and the bartender asked, “would you like your usual drink tonight, Monsieur Descartes?” Descartes replied “I think not.” Then he promptly ceased to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Wrong Derivations, Right Results </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Littlewood’s standards for a “mathematical joke” were higher than ours, but we will start by adapting an example from this MathOverflow <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/38856/jokes-in-the-sense-of-littlewood-examples">discussion</a> of Littlewood-style jokes. Sometimes we can play a joke on ourselves by deriving a result we know is right but with an incorrect proof. Here is the example:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1bntfg/are_there_or_can_there_be_jokes_or_puns_in/">Casting out 6’s</a>. Suppose we want to simplify the fraction <img alt="{\frac{166}{664}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B166%7D%7B664%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{166}{664}}"/>. We can use the rule of casting out 6’s to get </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{166}{664} = \frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B166%7D%7B664%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B16%7D%7B64%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \frac{166}{664} = \frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}. "/></p>
<p>
The rule works quite generally:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{1666}{6664} = \frac{16666}{66664} = \frac{166666}{666664} = \cdots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B1666%7D%7B6664%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B16666%7D%7B66664%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B166666%7D%7B666664%7D+%3D+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \frac{1666}{6664} = \frac{16666}{66664} = \frac{166666}{666664} = \cdots "/></p>
<p/><p/>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{26}{65} = \frac{266}{665} = \frac{2666}{6665} = \frac{26666}{66665} = \cdots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B26%7D%7B65%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B266%7D%7B665%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2666%7D%7B6665%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B26666%7D%7B66665%7D+%3D+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \frac{26}{65} = \frac{266}{665} = \frac{2666}{6665} = \frac{26666}{66665} = \cdots "/></p>
<p>You can even turn the paper upside down and cast out the <img alt="{6}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{6}"/>‘s that you see then:</p>
<p/><p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{19}{95} = \frac{199}{995} = \frac{1999}{9995} = \frac{19999}{99995} = \cdots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B19%7D%7B95%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B199%7D%7B995%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1999%7D%7B9995%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B19999%7D%7B99995%7D+%3D+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \frac{19}{95} = \frac{199}{995} = \frac{1999}{9995} = \frac{19999}{99995} = \cdots "/></p>
<p/><p/>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{49}{98} = \frac{499}{998} = \frac{4999}{9998} = \frac{49999}{99998} = \cdots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B49%7D%7B98%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B499%7D%7B998%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B4999%7D%7B9998%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B49999%7D%7B99998%7D+%3D+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \frac{49}{98} = \frac{499}{998} = \frac{4999}{9998} = \frac{49999}{99998} = \cdots "/></p>
<p>
Note, this is a joke: The rule of course does not actually work all the time: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{56}{65} = \frac{5}{5} = 1. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B56%7D%7B65%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B5%7D+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \frac{56}{65} = \frac{5}{5} = 1. "/></p>
<p/><p><br/>
We thought to try to come up with our own examples, or at least blend in other sources. It once struck me (Ken), on reading a column by Martin Gardner on difference equations, that they give a “convincing proof” of <img alt="{0^0 = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%5E0+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0^0 = 1}"/>. Consider the powers of a natural number <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>, say <img alt="{k = 5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k = 5}"/>. Take differences like so: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{ccccccccccc} 1 &amp; &amp; 5 &amp; &amp; 25 &amp; &amp; 125 &amp; &amp; 625 &amp; &amp; \dots\\ &amp; 4 &amp; &amp; 20 &amp; &amp; 100 &amp; &amp; 500 &amp; &amp; \dots\\ &amp; &amp; 16 &amp; &amp; 80 &amp; &amp; 400 &amp; &amp; \dots &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; 64 &amp; &amp; 320 &amp; &amp; \dots &amp; &amp; &amp;\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 256 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; &amp; \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccccccccccc%7D+1+%26+%26+5+%26+%26+25+%26+%26+125+%26+%26+625+%26+%26+%5Cdots%5C%5C+%26+4+%26+%26+20+%26+%26+100+%26+%26+500+%26+%26+%5Cdots%5C%5C+%26+%26+16+%26+%26+80+%26+%26+400+%26+%26+%5Cdots+%26+%26+%5C%5C+%26+%26+%26+64+%26+%26+320+%26+%26+%5Cdots+%26+%26+%26%5C%5C+%26+%26+%26+%26+256+%26+%26+%26+%26+%5C%5C+%26+%26+%26+%26+%26+%5Cddots+%26+%26+%26+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{ccccccccccc} 1 &amp; &amp; 5 &amp; &amp; 25 &amp; &amp; 125 &amp; &amp; 625 &amp; &amp; \dots\\ &amp; 4 &amp; &amp; 20 &amp; &amp; 100 &amp; &amp; 500 &amp; &amp; \dots\\ &amp; &amp; 16 &amp; &amp; 80 &amp; &amp; 400 &amp; &amp; \dots &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; 64 &amp; &amp; 320 &amp; &amp; \dots &amp; &amp; &amp;\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 256 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; &amp; \end{array} "/></p>
<p>
The powers of <img alt="{k-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k-1}"/> always appear on the bottom diagonal. Thus we have: <img alt="{(k-1)^0 = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28k-1%29%5E0+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(k-1)^0 = 1}"/>, <img alt="{(k-1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28k-1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(k-1)}"/>, <img alt="{(k-1)^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28k-1%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(k-1)^2}"/>, and so on.

    <link href="http://paulwgoldberg.blogspot.com/2020/04/surge-pricing-anyone.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Surge pricing, anyone?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">One social contribution that I tentatively attribute to Uber is popularisation of the concept of surge pricing. That is, we try to call an Uber and all-too-frequently get told that we have to pay a premium at this particular point in time, due to high demand. On the other hand, recent shortages of toilet paper, paracetamol, and certain foods were not accompanied by any kind of surge pricing, and the limits imposed on how much stuff you can buy, were not so effective in keeping these goods available. At this point, things have improved, although I have not been able to buy flour recently: the shortage of flour in the supermarkets I visit seems to be chronic.<br/><br/>Now I appreciate the objection to charging to charging a premium to allcomers, rich and poor alike, in the context of vital food and medicine. (Although, limits on purchases can also be criticised as being unfair to a single purchaser buying for a large family, or a key worker who is short of time and doesn't want to search excessively for a desired item.) In trying to advocate surge pricing, let me turn instead to possible examples less controversial, such as hairdressers and garden centres. When these establishments are allowed to reopen, it seems reasonable that they should charge a premium (temporarily). Not only do they need the money, but it would help to control a flood of customers all causing long queues and infecting each other at close quarters. To be honest, I’m not optimistic that this will happen, since they will still worry about accusations of price-gouging, plus there’s the question of how big a premium is appropriate.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/04/25/the-impossibility-of-measuring-inflation-in-a-pandemic">An article in the Economist</a> highlights a related problem, which is the difficulty of measuring the rate of inflation, at a time when various goods and services (whose prices get used to measure inflation) are unavailable. Coming back to flour, it may be felt that some of it (not all!) should be sold at market price, meaning one that some people will pay, but where it stays on the shelves for a few days, at least. There is a moral case against selling goods too cheaply, which is that it becomes an attempt to hide a problem — a successful attempt, if inflation cannot be measured.<br/><br/>Finally, the problem discussed here touches on a defect at the heart of traditional economic theory, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%E2%80%93Debreu_model">celebrated existence</a> of “correct” prices, unaccompanied by a means of arriving at those prices. The Algorithmic Game Theory community has quite rightly worried about price discovery and its computational obstacles. But the obstacles are also social, and status quo bias plays a big part.</div></div>

    <title>Exponential Learning Rate Schedules for Deep Learning (Part 1)</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This blog post concerns our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07454.pdf">ICLR20 paper</a> on a surprising discovery about learning rate (LR), the most basic hyperparameter in deep learning.</p>

<p>As illustrated in many online blogs, setting LR too small  might slow down the optimization, and setting it too large  might make the network overshoot the area of low losses. The standard mathematical analysis for  the right choice of LR relates it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness">smoothness</a> of the loss function.</p>

<p>Many practitioners use a ‘step decay’ LR schedule, which systematically drops the LR after specific training epochs. One often hears the intuition—with some mathematical justification if one treats SGD as a random walk in the  loss landscape— that large learning rates are useful in the initial (“exploration”) phase of training whereas lower rates  in later epochs allow a slow settling down to a local minimum in the landscape. Intriguingly, this intuition is called into  question by the success of exotic learning rate schedules such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983">cosine</a> (Loshchilov&amp;Hutter, 2016), and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186">triangular</a> (Smith, 2015), featuring an oscillatory LR.  These divergent approaches suggest that LR, the most basic and intuitive hyperparameter in deep learning, has not revealed all its mysteries yet.</p>

<h1 id="surprise-exponentially-increasing-lr">Surprise: Exponentially increasing LR</h1>

<p>We report experiments that state-of-the-art networks for image recognition tasks can be trained with an exponentially increasing LR (ExpLR): in each iteration it increases by $(1+\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$.  (The $\alpha$ can be varied over epochs.) Here $\alpha$ is not too small in our experiments, so as you would imagine, the LR hits astronomical values in no time.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a rate schedule has been successfully used, let alone for highly successful architectures. In fact, as we will see below, the reason we even did this bizarre experiment  was that we already had a mathematical proof that it would work. Specifically, we could show that such ExpLR schedules are at least as powerful as the standard step-decay ones, by which we mean that ExpLR can let us achieve (in function space) all the nets obtainable via the currently popular step-decay schedules.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-does-this-work">So why does this work?</h2>

<p>One key property of state-of-the-art nets we rely on is that they all use some normalization of parameters within layers, usually Batch Norm (BN), which has been shown to give benefits in optimization and generalization across architectures. Our result also holds for other normalizations, including Group Normalization (Wu &amp; He, 2018), Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016), Instance Norm (Ulyanov et al., 2016), etc.</p>

<p>The second key property of current training is that they use weight decay (aka $\ell_2$ regularizer). When combined with BN, this implies strange dynamics in parameter space, and the experimental papers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05350">van Laarhoven, 2017</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01814">Hoffer et al., 2018a</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lz-3Rct7">Zhang et al., 2019</a>),  noticed that combining BN and weight decay can  be viewed as increasing the LR.</p>

<p>Our paper gives a rigorous proof of the power of ExpLR by showing the following about the end-to-end function  being computed (see Main Thm in the paper):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Informal Theorem) For commonly  used values of the paremeters, every net produced by <em>Weight Decay + Constant LR + BN + Momentum</em> can also be produced (in function space) via <em>ExpLR + BN + Momentum</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>*NB: If the LR is not fixed but decaying in discrete steps, then the equivalent ExpLR training decays the exponent. (See our paper for details.)</p>

<p>At first sight such a claim may seem difficult (if not impossible) to prove given that we lack any mathematical characterization of nets produced by training (note that the theorem makes no mention of the dataset!).  The  equivalence is shown by reasoning about <em>trajectory</em> of optimization, instead of the usual “landscape view” of stationary points, gradient norms, Hessian norms, smoothness, etc.. This is an example of the importance of trajectory analysis, as argued in <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/06/03/trajectories/">earlier blog post of Sanjeev’s</a> because optimization and generalization are deeply intertwined for deep learning. Conventional wisdom says LR controls optimization, and the regularizer controls generalization. Our result shows that the effect of weight decay can  under fairly normal conditions be * exactly*  realized by the ExpLR rate schedule.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/exp_lr.png" style="width: 550px;"/>
</div>
<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Training PreResNet32 on CIFAR10 with fixed LR $0.1$, momentum $0.9$ and other standard hyperparameters. Trajectory was unchanged when WD was turned off  and LR at iteration $t$ was $\tilde{\eta}_ t = 0.1\times1.481^t$. (The constant $1.481$ is predicted by our theory given the original hyperparameters.) Plot on right shows  weight norm $\pmb{w}$ of the first convolutional layer in the second residual block. It grows exponentially as one would expect, satisfying $|\pmb{w}_ t|_ 2^2/\tilde{\eta}_ t = $ constant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.offconvex.org/feed.xml# (We first want to clarify that the exponential LR schedules work for normalized networks only and will lead parameter and output explosion for networks without normalization. )">comment</a>:# (In the rest of the post, we will first explain how does this equivalence result arises from various types of normalization schemes and then sketch the proof. We will also present a more general exponential growing learning schedule called ‘'’Tapered Exponential Learning Rate Schedule’, or TEXP, which is both experimentally and theoretically equivalent to the standard Step Decay schedule + Weight Decay. )</p>

<h2 id="scale-invariance-and-equivalence">Scale Invariance and Equivalence</h2>

<p>The formal proof holds for any training loss satisfying 
what we call <em>Scale Invariance</em>:</p>



<p>BN and other normalization schemes result in a Scale-Invariant Loss for the popular deep architectures (Convnet, Resnet, DenseNet etc.) if the output layer –where normally no normalization is used– is fixed throughout training. Empirically, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Dh8Tg0-">Hoffer et al. (2018b)</a>  found that randomly fixing the output layer at the start does not harm the final accuracy. 
(Appendix C of our paper demonstrates scale invariance for  various architectures; it is somewhat nontrivial.)</p>

<p>For batch ${\mathcal{B}} = \{ x_ i \} _ {i=1}^B$, network parameter ${\pmb{\theta}}$, we  denote the network by $f_ {\pmb{\theta}}$ and the loss function at iteration $t$ by $L_ t(f_ {\pmb{\theta}}) = L(f_ {\pmb{\theta}}, {\mathcal{B}}_ t)$ . We also use $L_ t({\pmb{\theta}})$ for convenience. We say the network $f_ {\pmb{\theta}}$ is <em>scale invariant</em> if $\forall c&gt;0$, $f_ {c{\pmb{\theta}}} = f_ {\pmb{\theta}}$, which implies the loss $L_ t$ is also scale invariant, i.e., $L_  t(c{\pmb{\theta}}_ t)=L_ t({\pmb{\theta}}_ t)$, $\forall c&gt;0$. A key source of intuition is the following lemma provable via chain rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 1</strong>. A scale-invariant loss $L$ satisfies
(1). $\langle\nabla_ {\pmb{\theta}} L, {\pmb{\theta}} \rangle=0$ ;<br/>
(2). $\left.\nabla_ {\pmb{\theta}} L \right|_ {\pmb{\theta} = \pmb{\theta}_ 0} = c \left.\nabla_ {\pmb{\theta}} L\right|_  {\pmb{\theta} = c\pmb{\theta}_ 0}$, for any $c&gt;0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first property immediately implies that $|{\pmb{\theta}}_ t|$ is monotone increasing for SGD if WD is turned off by Pythagoren Theorem. And based on this, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03981.pdf">our previous work</a> with Kaifeng Lyu shows that GD with any fixed learning rate can reach $\varepsilon$ approximate stationary point for scale invariant objectives in $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/inv_lemma.png" style="width: 360px;"/>
<br/>
<b>Figure 3.</b> Illustration of Lemma 1. 
</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Below is the main result of the paper. We will explain the proof idea (using scale-invariance) in a later post.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 1(Main, Informal).</strong> SGD on a scale-invariant objective with initial learning rate $\eta$, weight decay factor $\lambda$, and momentum factor $\gamma$ is equivalent to SGD with momentum factor $\gamma$ where at iteration $t$, the ExpLR $\tilde{\eta}_ t$  is defined as $\tilde{\eta}_ t = \alpha^{-2t-1} \eta$ without weight decay($\tilde{\lambda} = 0$) where $\alpha$ is a non-zero root of equation 
     </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifically, when momentum $\gamma=0$,  the above schedule can be simplified as $\tilde{\eta}_ t = (1-\lambda\eta)^{-2t-1} \eta$.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="sota-performance-with-exponential-lr">SOTA performance with exponential LR</h3>

<p>As mentioned, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy  requires reducing the learning rate a few times. Suppose the training has $K$ phases, and the learning rate is divided by some constant $C_I&gt;1$ when entering phase $I$. To realize the same effect with an exponentially increasing LR, we have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 2:</strong> ExpLR with the below modification generates the same network sequence as Step Decay with momentum factor $\gamma$ and WD $\lambda$ does. We call it <em>Tapered Exponential LR schedule</em> (TEXP).<br/>
<strong>Modification when entering a new phase $I$</strong>: (1). switching to some smaller exponential growing rate; (2). divinding the current LR by $C_I$.</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/TEXP.png" style="width: 500px;"/>
</div>
<p><strong>Figure 5.</strong> PreResNet32 trained with Step Decay (as in Figure 1) and its corresponding TEXP schedule. As predicted by Theorem 2, they have similar trajectories and performances.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We hope that this bit of theory and supporting experiments have changed your outlook on learning rates for deep learning.</p>

<p>A follow-up post will present the proof idea and give more insight into why ExpLR suggests a rethinking of the “landscape view” of optimization in deep learning.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Adaptive sampling is a useful algorithmic tool for data summarization problems in the classical centralized setting, where the entire dataset is available to the single processor performing the computation. Adaptive sampling repeatedly selects rows of an underlying <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="n"/> by <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="d"/> matrix <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="A"/>, where <img alt="n \gg d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cgg+d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="n \gg d"/>, with probabilities proportional to their distances to the subspace of the previously selected rows. Intuitively, adaptive sampling seems to be limited to trivial multi-pass algorithms in the streaming model of computation due to its inherently sequential nature of assigning sampling probabilities to each row only after the previous iteration is completed. Surprisingly, we show this is not the case by giving the first one-pass algorithms for adaptive sampling on turnstile streams and using space <img alt="\text{poly}(d,k,\log n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bpoly%7D%28d%2Ck%2C%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\text{poly}(d,k,\log n)"/>, where <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> is the number of adaptive sampling rounds to be performed.</p>
<p>Our adaptive sampling procedure has a number of applications to various data summarization problems on turnstile streams that either improve state-of-the-art or have only been previously studied in the more relaxed row-arrival model. This includes column subset selection, subspace approximation, projective clustering, and volume maximization. We complement our volume maximization algorithmic results with lower bounds that are tight up to lower order terms, even for multi-pass algorithms. By a similar construction, we also obtain lower bounds for volume maximization in the row-arrival model, which we match with competitive upper bounds.</p>
<p>This is a joint work with Ilya Razenshteyn, David Woodruff, and Samson Zhou.</p></blockquote></div>

    <title>Reading in Private</title>
    <summary>(This blog post is based on joint work with Dima Kogan.) One of the great unsung perks of being a college student is having access to the university library.

<p>One of the great unsung perks of being a college student is having access to the university library. There is something thrilling about hunting down exactly the right reference deep in the stacks, or reading through the archived papers of a public figure from years back.</p>
<p>The pandemic has closed all of our libraries for the time being. Even so, through the fruits of computer science—databases, the Internet, e-readers, and so on—we can get access to much of the same information even when we are cooped up at home.</p>
<p>But for me, one of the true pleasures of using a library is the fact that I can browse through any book I want in complete privacy. If I want to go up to the stacks and read about tulip gardening, or road-bike maintenance, or strategies for managing anxiety, I can do that pretty much without anyone else knowing.</p>
<p>In contrast, if I go online today and search for “tulip gardening,” Google will take careful note of my interest in tulips and I will be seeing ads about gardening tools for months.</p>
<p>An ideal digital library would let us download and read books without anyone—not even the library itself—learning which books we are reading. How could we build such a privacy-respecting digital library?</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss the private-library problem and how <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">our recent work on private information retrieval</a> might be able to help solve it.</p>
<h3><b>The Private-Library Problem</b></h3>
<p>Let us define the problem a little more precisely. We will imagine a protocol running between a library, which holds the books, and a student, who wants to download a particular book.</p>
<p>Say that the library has <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> books—let’s call the books <img alt="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N)"/>. To keep things simple, let’s pretend that each book consists of just a single bit of information, so <img alt="x_i \in \{0,1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_i \in \{0,1\}"/> for all <img alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}"/>.</p>
<p>The student starts out holding the index <img alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}"/> of her desired book. To fetch the digital book from the library, the student and library exchange some messages. At the end of the interaction, we want the following two properties to hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Correctness.</b> The student should have her desired book (i.e., the bit <img alt="x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x_i"/>).</li>
<li><b>Privacy. </b>The library should have not learned any information, in a cryptographic sense, about which book the student downloaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we have grossly simplified the problem: a real book is more than a single bit in length, book titles are not consecutive integers, maybe the student would like to find a book using a keyword search, etc. But even this simplified private-information-retrieval problem, which <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~bchor/PIR.pdf">Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan introduced</a> in the 90s, is already interesting enough.</p>
<h3><b>A simple but inefficient solution</b></h3>
<p>There is a simple solution to this problem: the student can just ask the library to send her the contents of all <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> books. This solution achieves both correctness and privacy, so what’s the problem? Are we done?</p>
<p>Well, there are two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of <b>communication</b> is large: Just to read a single book, the client must download the contents of the entire library! So this is terribly inefficient.</li>
<li>The amount of <b>computation</b> is large: Just to fetch a single book, the library must do work proportional to the size of the entire library. So “checking out” a book from this digital library will take a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Research on private information retrieval typically focuses on the first problem: how can we reduce the <i>communication</i> cost? Using a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2968443">variety</a> of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/646125">clever</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978429">techniques</a>, it is possible to drive down the communication cost to something very small—sub-polynomial or even logarithmic in the library size <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>.</p>
<p>But today we are interested in the <i>computational</i> burden on the library. Is there any way that the student can privately download a book from the library while requiring the library to do only <img alt="o(N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="o(N)"/> work in the process?</p>
<h3><b>Doing the hard work in advance</b></h3>
<p>To have both correctness and privacy, it seems that the library needs to touch each of the <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/> books in the process of responding to each student’s request. And, in some sense, <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/malkin/BIM.ps">this is true</a>. So, to allow the library to run in time sublinear in <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>, we will have to tweak the problem slightly.</p>
<p>Our idea is to have the library do the <img alt="O(N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(N)"/>-time computation in an <b>offline phase</b>, which takes place <i>before</i> the student decides which book she wants to read. For example, this offline phase might happen overnight while the library’s servers would otherwise be idle.</p>
<p>Later on, once the student decides which book in the library she wants to read, the student and library can run a <img alt="o(N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="o(N)"/>-time <b>online phase</b> in which the student is able to retrieve her desired book. The total communication cost, in both offline and online phases, will be <img alt="o(N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="o(N)"/>.</p>
<p>So, by pushing the library’s expensive linear scan to an offline phase, the library can service the student’s request for a book in sublinear online time.</p>
<h3><b>Our offline/online private information retrieval scheme</b></h3>
<p>Let’s see how to construct such an offline/online scheme. To make things simple for the purposes of this post, let’s assume that the student has access to two non-colluding libraries that hold the same set of books. To be concrete, let’s call the two libraries “Stanford” and “Berkeley.”</p>
<p>The privacy property will hold as long as the librarians at Stanford and Berkeley don’t get together and share the information that they learned while running the protocol with the student. So Stanford and Berkeley here are “non-colluding.” (Equivalently, our scheme that protects privacy against an adversary that controls one of the two libraries—but not both.)</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1670" style="width: 571px;"><img alt="Offline-online PIR" class=" wp-image-1670" height="365" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/offlineonline.png?w=561&amp;h=365" width="561"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1670">In the offline phase, which happens before the student knows which book she wants to read, the Stanford library does linear work. In the online phase, which runs once the student has the index of her desired book, the Berkeley library runs in sublinear time. (We are suppressing log factors here.)</p></div>
<p>Now, let’s describe an offline/online protocol by which the student can privately fetch a book from the digital library:</p>
<p><b>Offline Phase.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The student partitions the integers <img alt="\{1, .., N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C+..%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{1, .., N\}"/> into <img alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sqrt{N}"/> non-overlapping sets chosen at random, where each set has size <img alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sqrt{N}"/>. Call these sets <img alt="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+S_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}"/>.</li>
<li>The student sends these sets <img alt="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+S_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}"/> to Stanford (the first library). To reduce the communication cost here, the student can compress these sets using pseudorandomness.</li>
<li>For each set <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/>, the Stanford library computes the <i>parity</i> of all of the books indexed by set <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/> and returns the parity bits <img alt="(b_1, \dots, b_{\sqrt{N}})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28b_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+b_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="(b_1, \dots, b_{\sqrt{N}})"/> to the student. In other words, if the books are <img alt="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N) \in \{0,1\}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_N%29+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N) \in \{0,1\}^n"/>, then <img alt="b_j = \sum_{k \in S_j} x_k \bmod 2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk+%5Cin+S_j%7D+x_k+%5Cbmod+2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="b_j = \sum_{k \in S_j} x_k \bmod 2"/>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total communication in this phase is only <img alt="O(\sqrt{N})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{N})"/> bits and the student and the Stanford library can run this step <i>before</i> the student decides which book she wants to read.</p>
<p><b>Online Phase.</b> Once the student decides that she wants to read book <img alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}"/>, the student and Berkeley (the second library) run the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The student finds the set <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/> that contains the index <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> of her desired book.</li>
<li>The student flips a coin that is weighted to come up heads with some probability <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/>, to be fixed later.</li>
<li>If the coin lands <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heads</span>:
<ul>
<li>The student sends <img alt="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cgets+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i\}"/> to the Berkeley library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the coin lands <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tails</span>:
<ul>
<li>The student samples <img alt="i' \gets_R S_j \setminus \{i\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27+%5Cgets_R+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i' \gets_R S_j \setminus \{i\}"/>.</li>
<li>The student sends <img alt="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i'\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cgets+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%27%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i'\}"/> to the Berkeley library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Berkeley library receives the set <img alt="S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Csubseteq+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}"/> from the student. The Berkeley library returns the contents of all books whose indices appear in set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S"/> to the student.</li>
<li>Now, the student can recover its desired book as follows:
<ul>
<li>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heads</span>: the student now has the parity of the books in <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/> (from the offline phase) and the value of all books in <img alt="S_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S_j"/> that are not book <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>. This is enough to recover the contents of book <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>.</li>
<li>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tails</span>: <img alt="i \in S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i \in S"/>. In this case the Berkeley library has sent the contents of book <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> to the student in the online phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before we fix the weight <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> of the coin, we see that the protocol satisfies <b>correctness</b>, since no matter how the coin lands the client recovers its desired book. Also, the total communication cost is <img alt="O(\sqrt{N} \log N)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D+%5Clog+N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{N} \log N)"/> bits, which is sublinear as we had hoped. Finally, the <b>online computation cost</b> is also sublinear: the Berkeley library just needs to return <img alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\sqrt{N}"/> books to the client, which it can do in time roughly <img alt="O(\sqrt{N})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="O(\sqrt{N})"/>.</p>
<p>The last matter to address is <b>privacy</b>. Again, we are assuming that the adversary controls only one of the two libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the offline phase, the student’s message to the Stanford library is independent of <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>, so the protocol is perfectly private with respect to Stanford.</li>
<li>In the online phase, we must be more careful. It turns out that if we choose the weight <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> of the coin as <img alt="p = 1 - (\sqrt{N} - 1)/N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+1+-+%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D+-+1%29%2FN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p = 1 - (\sqrt{N} - 1)/N"/>, then the set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="S"/> that the student sends to UC Berkeley in the online phase is just a uniformly random size-<img alt="(\sqrt{N}-1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="(\sqrt{N}-1)"/> subset of <img alt="\{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\{1, \dots, N\}"/>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Open problems</b></h3>
<p>So, the student can privately fetch a book from our digital libraries in sublinear online time. What else is left to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting rid of the need for two non-colluding libraries is a clear next step. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">Our work</a> has some results along these lines, but they pay a price either in (a) asymptotic efficiency or in (b) the strength of the cryptographic assumptions required.</li>
<li>A beautiful paper of <a href="https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~beimel/Papers/BIM.pdf">Beimel, Ishai, and Malkin</a> shows that if the library can store its collection of books using a special type of error-correcting encoding, the <b>total</b> computational time at the libraries (not just the online time) can be sublinear in <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="N"/>. As far as we know, these schemes are not concretely efficient enough to use in practice. Could they be made so?</li>
<li>Privacy is just one of the many pleasures of using a physical library. During this period of confinement, I also miss the smell of the books, the beauty of light filtering through the stacks, and the peacefulness of thinking in a study carrel. Can a digital library ever give us these things too?</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these questions catch your fancy, please check out <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">our Eurocrypt paper</a> for more background, pointers, and results.</p>
<p>Don Knuth <a href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf">has reportedly said</a> “Using a great library to solve a specific problem… Now <i>that</i> […] is real living.” With better digital libraries, maybe we could all live a little bit more during these challenging days.</p></div>

    <title>SIGecom Announcement: EC 2020 will be virtual</title>
    <summary>As many of you have probably anticipated, due to concerns regarding the novel coronavirus COVID-19, the 2020 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 2020) will be held virtually.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As many of you have probably anticipated, due to concerns regarding the novel coronavirus COVID-19, the <a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/">2020 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 2020)</a> will be held virtually.</p>
<p>This change of format will of course present us with difficult challenges, but we believe it will offer exciting new opportunities as well.  (And not to worry, your opportunity to attend EC in Budapest is just deferred to 2021.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://sigecom.org/officers.html">SIGecom Executive Committee</a> has appointed and will serve on a Virtual Transition Team that additionally includes the following new conference officers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual General Chair: <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/">Jason Hartline</a></li>
<li>Virtual Local Chair: <a href="https://yannai.gonch.name/">Yannai Gonczarowski</a></li>
<li>Virtual Global Outreach Chairs: <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~red/">Rediet Abebe</a> and <a href="https://research.fb.com/people/sodomka-eric/">Eric Sodomka</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This team is working with the <a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/committees-acm/organizing-committee/">EC 2020 organizing committee</a> and <a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/committees-acm/program-committee/">EC 2020 PC chairs</a> to put together a plan that leverages the opportunities of the virtual format to the fullest extent. Though these plans are still in the works, we have identified the following “minimal commitment” for authors of accepted papers to the main EC conference: at least one author will need to</p>
<ul>
<li>register for the conference;</li>
<li>be available virtually on the conference dates (July 14-16);</li>
<li>provide a camera-ready paper or abstract by the camera-ready deadline;</li>
<li>provide a pre-recorded talk presenting the paper two weeks in advance (by June 28).</li>
</ul>
<p>We are optimistic that, while a virtual EC may lack some of the positive features of a classical conference, the format will also provide opportunities that improve on the classical experience.  As with any conference there will be opportunities to participate beyond the “minimal commitment.”  We hope that speakers and participants will join in other activities, which may include preview sessions for talks before the conference proper, watch parties for speakers and attendees, and mechanisms for reaching a wider audience with the technical program. With many academic interactions moving virtual, the barriers to collaboration with distant colleagues have lowered, and we hope that EC 2020 will kindle and rekindle global collaborations.</p>
<div>
<p>Further details about these activities as well as the minimal requirements will be circulated by June 1.</p>
<p>Tutorial speakers and workshop organizers will receive separate emails from the Tutorial and Workshop Chairs about plans for moving these events online.</p>

<p><b>1. CDF Estimation for Discrete, Univariate Distributions </b></p>
<p>Suppose we have a distribution <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> over the ordered, discrete domain <img alt="{\{1,\dots,D\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{1,\dots,D\}}"/> and let <img alt="{\mathcal{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{P}}"/> be the family of all such distributions. The CDF of the distribution is the function <img alt="{\Phi_{P} : \{1,\dots,D\} \rightarrow [0,1]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi_%7BP%7D+%3A+%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5B0%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi_{P} : \{1,\dots,D\} \rightarrow [0,1]}"/> given by</p>

<p>This shows hierarchical decomposition of the domain <img alt="{\{1,\dots,8\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2C8%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{1,\dots,8\}}"/> using 14 intervals. The highlighted squares represent the interval <img alt="{\{1,\dots,7\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2C7%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{1,\dots,7\}}"/> and the highlighted circles show the decomposition of this interval into a union of <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3}"/> intervals in the tree.</p>

<p><b> 1.2. Why Restrict the Domain? </b></p>
<p>A drawback of the estimator we constructed is that it only applies to distributions of finite support <img alt="{\{1,2,\dots,D\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{1,2,\dots,D\}}"/>, albeit with a relatively mild dependence on the support size. If privacy isn’t a concern, then no such restriction is necessary, as the bound <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#eqdkw">(2)</a> applies equally well to any distribution over <img alt="{{\mathbb R}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\mathbb R}}"/>. Can we construct a differentially private estimator for distributions with infinite support?</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the answer to this question is no! Any differentially private estimator for the CDF of the distribution has to have a rate that depends on the support size, and cannot give non-trivial rates for distributions with infinite support.</p>

<p>We emphasize that this theorem shouldn’t meet with too much alarm, as <img alt="{\log^* D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%5E%2A+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\log^* D}"/> grows remarkably slowly with <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/>. There are differentially private CDF estimators that achieve very mild dependence on <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/> [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNS13">BNS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNSV15">BNSV15</a>], including one nearly matching the lower bound in Theorem <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#thmcdf-lb">2</a>. Moreover, if we want to estimate a distribution over <img alt="{{\mathbb R}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\mathbb R}}"/>, and are willing to make some mild regularity conditions on the distribution, then we can approximate it by a distribution with finite support and only increase the rate slightly. However, what Theorem <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#thmcdf-lb">2</a> shows is that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to private CDF estimation that achieves similar guarantees to the empirical CDF. That is, the right algorithm has to be tailored somewhat to the application and the assumptions we can make about the distribution.</p>
<p><b>2. More Private Statistics </b></p>
<p>Of course, the story doesn’t end here! There’s a whole wide world of differentially private statistics beyond what we’ve mentioned already. We proceed to survey just a few other directions of study in private statistics.</p>

Tight lower bounds for this problem follow from the tracing attacks introduced in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BUV14">BUV14</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSUV15">DSSUV15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BSU17">BSU17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17a">SU17a</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>]. A very recent work of Acharya, Sun, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ20">ASZ20</a>] adapts classical tools for proving estimation and testing lower bounds (lemmata of Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam) to the differentially private setting. Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>] give tight minimax lower bounds for the weaker guarantee of selecting the largest coordinates of the mean, which were refined by Cai, Wang, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CWZ19">CWZ19</a>] to give lower bounds for sparse mean-estimation problems.</p>
<p>Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith introduced the highly general sample-and-aggregate paradigm, which they apply to several learning problems (e.g., learning mixtures of Gaussians) [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#NRS07">NRS07</a>]. Later, Smith [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Smi11">Smi11</a>] showed that this paradigm can be used to transform any estimator for any asymptotically normal, univariate statistic over a bounded data domain into a differentially private one with the same asymptotic convergence rate.</p>
<p>Subsequent work has focused on both relaxing the assumptions in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Smi11">Smi11</a>], particularly boundedness, and on giving finite-sample guarantees. Karwa and Vadhan investigated the problem of Gaussian mean estimation, proving the first near-optimal bounds for this setting [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KV18">KV18</a>]. In particular, exploiting concentration properties of Gaussian data allows us to achieve non-trivial results even with unbounded data, which is impossible in general. Following this, Kamath, Li, Singhal, and Ullman moved to the multivariate setting, investigating the estimation of Gaussians and binary product distributions in total variation distance [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KLSU19">KLSU19</a>]. In certain cases (i.e., Gaussians with identity covariance), this is equivalent to mean estimation in <img alt="{\ell_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell_2}"/>-distance, though not always. For example, for binary product distribution, one must estimate the mean in a type of <img alt="{\chi^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\chi^2}"/>-distance instead. The perspective of distribution estimation rather than parameter estimation can be valuable. Bun, Kamath, Steinke, and Wu [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BKSW19">BKSW19</a>] develop a primitive for private hypothesis selection, which they apply to learn any coverable class of distributions under pure differential privacy. Through the lens of distribution estimation, their work implies an upper bound for mean estimation of binary product distributions that bypasses lower bounds for the same problem in the empirical setting. In addition to work on mean estimation in the sub-Gaussian setting, such as the results discussed earlier, mean estimation has also been studied under weaker moment conditions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BS19">BS19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KSU20">KSU20</a>]. Beyond these settings, there has also been study of estimation of discrete multinomials, including estimation in Kolmogorov distance [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNSV15">BNSV15</a>] and in total variation distance for structured distributions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DHS15">DHS15</a>], and parameter estimation of Markov Random Fields [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ZKKW20">ZKKW20</a>].</p>
<p>A different approach to constructing differentially private estimators is based on robust statistics. This approah begins with the influential work of Dwork and Lei [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DL09">DL09</a>], which introduced the propose-test-release framework, and applied to estimating robust statistics such as the median and interquartile range. While the definitions in robust statistics and differential privacy are semantically similar, formal connections between the two remain relatively scant, which suggests a productive area for future study.</p>
<p><b> 2.2. Hypothesis Testing </b></p>
<p>An influential work of Homer et al. [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#HSRDTMPSNC08">HSRDTMPSNC08</a>] demonstrated the vulnerability of classical statistics in a genomic setting, showing that certain <img alt="{\chi^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\chi^2}"/>-statistics on many different variables could allow an attacker to determine the presence of an individual in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Motivated by these concerns, an early line of work from the statistics community focused on addressing these issues [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#VS09">VS09</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#USF13">USF13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#YFSU14">YFSU14</a>].</p>
<p>More recently, work on private hypothesis testing can be divided roughly into two lines. The first focuses on the minimax sample complexity, in a line initiated by Cai, Daskalakis, and Kamath [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CDK17">CDK17</a>], who give an algorithm for privately testing goodness-of-fit (more precisely, a statistician might refer to this problem as one-sample testing of multinomial data). A number of subsequent works have essentially settled the complexity of this problem [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ18">ASZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADR18">ADR18</a>], giving tight upper and lower bounds. Other papers in this line study related problems, including the two-sample version of the problem, independence testing, and goodness-of-fit testing for multivariate product distributions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ18">ASZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADR18">ADR18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADKR19">ADKR19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMUZ19">CKMUZ19</a>]. A related paper studies the minimax sample complexity of property <em>estimation</em>, rather than testing of discrete distributions, including support size and entropy [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AKSZ18">AKSZ18</a>]. Other recent works in this vein focus on testing of simple hypotheses [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMTZ18">CKMTZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>]. In particular [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>] proves an analogue of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma for differentially private testing of simple hypotheses. A paper of Awan and Slavkovic [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AS18">AS18</a>] gives a universally optimal test when the domain size is two, however Brenner and Nissim [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BN14">BN14</a>] shows that such universally optimal tests cannot exist when the domain has more than two elements. A related problem in this space is private change-point detection [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMTZ18">CKMTZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKLZ19">CKLZ19</a>] — in this setting, we are given a time series of datapoints which are sampled from a distribution, which at some point, changes to a different distribution. The goal is to (privately) determine when this point occurs.</p>
<p>Complementary to minimax hypothesis testing, a line of work [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#WLK15">WLK15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#GLRV16">GLRV16</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KR17">KR17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KSF17">KSF17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CBRG18">CBRG18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SGGRGB19">SGGRGB19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKSBG19">CKSBG19</a>] designs differentially private versions of popular test statistics for testing goodness-of-fit, closeness, and independence, as well as private ANOVA, focusing on the performance at small sample sizes. Work by Wang et al. [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#WKLK18">WKLK18</a>] focuses on generating statistical approximating distributions for differentially private statistics, which they apply to hypothesis testing problems.</p>
<p><b> 2.3. Differential Privacy on Graphs </b></p>
<p>There is a significant amount of work on differentially private analysis of graphs. We remark that these algorithms can satisfy either edge or node differential privacy. The former (easier) guarantee defines a neighboring graph to be one obtained by adding or removing a single edge, while in the latter (harder) setting, a neighboring graph is one that can be obtained by modifying the set of edges connected to a single node. The main challenge in this area is that most graph statistics can have high sensitivity in the worst-case.</p>
<p>The initial works in this area focused on the empirical setting, and goals range from counting subgraphs [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KRSY11">KRSY11</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS13">BBDS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KNRS13">KNRS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CZ13">CZ13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#RS16">RS16</a>] to outputting a privatized graph which approximates the original [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#GRU12">GRU12</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS12">BBDS12</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Upa13">Upa13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AU19">AU19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#EKKL20">EKKL20</a>]. In contrast to the setting discussed in most of this series, it seems that there are larger qualitative differences between the study of empirical and population statistics due to the fact that many graph statistics have high worst-case sensitivity, but may have smaller sensitivity on typical graphs from many natural models.</p>
<p>In the population statistics setting, recent work has focused on parameter estimation of the underlying random graph model. So far this work has given estimators for the <img alt="{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta}"/>-model [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KS16">KS16</a>] and graphons [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BCS15">BCS15</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BCSZ18">BCSZ18</a>]. Graphons are a generalization of the stochastic block model, which is, in turn, a generalization of the Erdös-Rényi model. Interestingly, the methods of Lipschitz-extensions introduced in the empirical setting by [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS13">BBDS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KNRS13">KNRS13</a>] are the main tool used in the statistical setting as well. While the first works on private graphon estimation were not computationally efficient, a recent focus has been on obviating these issues for certain important cases, such as the Erdös-Rényi setting [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU19">SU19</a>].</p>

<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk">the online form</a>. Due to security concerns, <strong>registration is required</strong> to attend the interactive talk. (The link to the YouTube livestream will also be posted <a>on our website</a> on the day of the talk, so people who did not sign up will still be able to watch the talk live.) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: Given a set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="S"/> of <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="n"/> (distinct) keys from key space <img alt="[U]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5BU%5D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="[U]"/>, each associated with a value from <img alt="\Sigma" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CSigma&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\Sigma"/>, the <em>static dictionary problem</em> asks to preprocess these (key, value) pairs into a data structure, supporting value-retrieval queries: for any given <img alt="x \in [U]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%5BU%5D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="x \in [U]"/>, valRet<img alt="(x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="(x)"/> must return the value associated with <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="x"/> if <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="x"/> is in <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="S"/>, or return “N/A” if <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="x"/> is not in <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="S"/>. The special case where <img alt="|\Sigma|=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5CSigma%7C%3D1&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="|\Sigma|=1"/> is called the membership problem. The “textbook” solution is to use a hash table, which occupies linear space and answers each query in constant time. On the other hand, the minimum possible space to encode all (key, value) pairs is only <img alt="\textrm{OPT} := \lg \binom{U}{n} + n \lg |\Sigma|" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BOPT%7D+%3A%3D+%5Clg+%5Cbinom%7BU%7D%7Bn%7D+%2B+n+%5Clg+%7C%5CSigma%7C&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\textrm{OPT} := \lg \binom{U}{n} + n \lg |\Sigma|"/> bits, which could be much less.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will talk about a randomized dictionary data structure using <img alt="\textrm{OPT}+\textrm{poly}\lg n+O(\lg\lg\cdots\lg U)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BOPT%7D%2B%5Ctextrm%7Bpoly%7D%5Clg+n%2BO%28%5Clg%5Clg%5Ccdots%5Clg+U%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\textrm{OPT}+\textrm{poly}\lg n+O(\lg\lg\cdots\lg U)"/> bits of space and expected constant query time, assuming the query algorithm have access to an external data-independent lookup table of size <img alt="n^{0.001}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B0.001%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="n^{0.001}"/>. Previously, even for membership queries and when <img alt="U\leq n^{O(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U%5Cleq+n%5E%7BO%281%29%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="U\leq n^{O(1)}"/>, the best known data structure with constant query time requires <img alt="\textrm{OPT}+n/\textrm{poly} \lg n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BOPT%7D%2Bn%2F%5Ctextrm%7Bpoly%7D+%5Clg+n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\textrm{OPT}+n/\textrm{poly} \lg n"/> bits of space (due to Pagh [Pagh’01] and Pătraşcu [Pat’08]). It has <img alt="O(\lg n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Clg+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(\lg n)"/> query time when the space is at most <img alt="\textrm{OPT}+n^{0.999}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BOPT%7D%2Bn%5E%7B0.999%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\textrm{OPT}+n^{0.999}"/>.</p></blockquote></div>
