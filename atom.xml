(streaming and distributed) models. We mainly focus on low dimensional problems
in which the number of constraints is much larger than the number of variables.
Low dimensional LP-type problems appear frequently in various machine learning
tasks such as robust regression, support vector machines, and core vector
machines. As supporting large-scale machine learning queries in database
systems has become an important direction for database research, obtaining
efficient algorithms for low dimensional LP-type problems on massive datasets
is of great value. In this paper we give both upper and lower bounds for
LP-type problems in distributed and streaming models. Our bounds are almost
tight when the dimensionality of the problem is a fixed constant.

    <title>Efficient Shortest Path Algorithm Using An Unique And Novel Graph Matrix Representation</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1552521600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Sivakumar Karunakaran, Lavanya Selvaganesh <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05377">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The neighbourhood matrix, $\mathcal{NM}(G)$, a novel representation of graphs
proposed in \cite {ALPaper} is defined using the neighbourhood sets of the
vertices. The matrix also exhibits a bijection between the product of two
well-known graph matrices, namely the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian
matrix. In this article, we extend this work and introduce the sequence of
powers of $\mathcal{NM}(G)$ and denote it by $ \mathcal{NM}^{\{l\}}, 1\leq l
\leq k(G) $ where $ k(G) $ is called the \textbf{iteration number}, $
k(G)=\lceil{\log_{2} diameter(G)}\rceil$. The sequence of matrices captures the
distance between the vertices in a profound fashion and is found to be useful
in various applications. One of the interesting results of this article is that
whenever $ \eta_{ij}^{\{l\}}=-1$, for $ 1\leq l \leq k(G) $, then
$d_{G}(i,j)=2^{l}$ , where $d_{G}(i,j)$ is the shortest path distance between $
i $ and $ j $. Further, we characterize the entries of the matrices $
\mathcal{NM}^{\{l\}}$, for every $l, 1\leq l \leq k(G)$. Using this concept of
the sequence of powers of neighbourhood matrix and with the aid of some of its
properties, we propose an algorithm to find the shortest path between any pair
of vertices in a given undirected unweighted simple graph. The proposed
algorithm and the claims therein are formally validated through simulations on
synthetic data and the real network data from Facebook where sampling-based
computations are performed for large collection of graphs containing
large-sized graph. The empirical results are quite promising with our algorithm
having the best running time among all the existing well known shortest path
algorithms.

require at least $c$ edge-crossings when drawn in the plane. For every fixed
pair of integers with $c\ge 13$ and $d\ge 1$, we give first explicit
constructions of $c$-crossing-critical graphs containing a vertex of degree
greater than $d$. We also show that such unbounded degree constructions do not
exist for $c\le 12$, precisely, that there exists a constant $D$ such that
every $c$-crossing-critical graph with $c\le 12$ has maximum degree at most
$D$. Hence, the bounded maximum degree conjecture of $c$-crossing-critical
graphs, which was generally disproved in 2010 by Dvo\v{r}\'ak and Mohar
(without an explicit construction), holds true, surprisingly, exactly for the
values $c\le 12.$

    <title>Near-Optimal Algorithms for Shortest Paths in Weighted Unit-Disk Graphs</title>

shortest-path} (SSSP) problem, in weighted unit-disk graphs. We first propose
an exact (and deterministic) algorithm which solves the problem in $O(n \log^2
n)$ time using linear space, where $n$ is the number of the vertices of the
graph. This significantly improves the previous deterministic algorithm by
Cabello and Jej\v{c}i\v{c} [CGTA'15] which uses $O(n^{1+\delta})$ time and
$O(n^{1+\delta})$ space (for any small constant $\delta&gt;0$) and the previous
randomized algorithm by Kaplan et al. [SODA'17] which uses $O(n \log^{12+o(1)}
n)$ expected time and $O(n \log^3 n)$ space. More specifically, we show that if
the 2D offline insertion-only (additively-)weighted nearest-neighbor problem
with $k$ operations (i.e., insertions and queries) can be solved in $f(k)$
time, then the SSSP problem in weighted unit-disk graphs can be solved in $O(n
\log n+f(n))$ time. Using the same framework with some new ideas, we also
obtain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithm for the problem, using $O(n
\log n + n \log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ time and linear space. This improves the
previous $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithm by Chan and Skrepetos
[SoCG'18] which uses $O((1/\varepsilon)^2 n \log n)$ time and
$O((1/\varepsilon)^2 n)$ space. More specifically, we show that if the 2D
offline insertion-only weighted nearest-neighbor problem with $k_1$ operations
in which at most $k_2$ operations are insertions can be solved in $f(k_1,k_2)$
time, then the $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate SSSP problem in weighted unit-disk
graphs can be solved in $O(n \log n+f(n,O(\varepsilon^{-2})))$ time. Because of
the $\Omega(n \log n)$-time lower bound of the problem (even when approximation
is allowed), both of our algorithms are almost optimal.

clustering problems. They provide an alternative data representation in which
the underlying structure of the clusters can be better captured. However, most
of the research in this area is mainly focused on enhancing the sparse coding
part of the problem. In contrast, we introduce a novel objective term in our
proposed SSC framework which focuses on the separability of data points in the
coding space. We also provide mathematical insights into how this
local-separability term improves the clustering result of the SSC framework.
Our proposed non-linear local SSC algorithm (NLSSC) also benefits from the
efficient choice of its sparsity terms and constraints. The NLSSC algorithm is
also formulated in the kernel-based framework (NLKSSC) which can represent the
nonlinear structure of data. In addition, we address the possibility of having
redundancies in sparse coding results and its negative effect on graph-based
clustering problems. We introduce the link-restore post-processing step to
improve the representation graph of non-negative SSC algorithms such as ours.
Empirical evaluations on well-known clustering benchmarks show that our
proposed NLSSC framework results in better clusterings compared to the
state-of-the-art baselines and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
link-restore post-processing in improving the clustering accuracy via
correcting the broken links of the representation graph.

contained within another polytope. This problem is rooted in computational
convexity, and arises in applications such as verification and control of
dynamical systems. The complexity heavily depends on how the polytopes are
represented. Describing polytopes by their hyperplanes (H-polytopes) is a
popular representation. In many applications we use affine transformations of
H-polytopes, which we refer to as AH-polytopes. Zonotopes, orthogonal
projections of H-polytopes, and convex hulls/Minkowski sums of multiple
H-polytopes can be efficiently represented as AH-polytopes. While there exists
efficient necessary and sufficient conditions for AH-polytope in H-polytope
containment, the case of AH-polytope in AH-polytope is known to be NP-complete.
In this paper, we provide a sufficient condition for this problem that is cast
as a linear program with size that grows linearly with the number of
hyperplanes of each polytope. Special cases on zonotopes, Minkowski sums,
convex hulls, and disjunctions of H-polytopes are studied. These efficient
encodings enable us to designate certain components of polytopes as decision
variables, and incorporate them into a convex optimization problem. We present
examples on the zonotope containment problem, polytopic Hausdorff distances,
zonotope order reduction, inner approximations of orthogonal projections, and
demonstrate the usefulness of our results on formal controller verification and
synthesis for hybrid systems.

    <title>Planar graphs needing many lines</title>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As I said in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/counting-polygon-triangulations.html">my previous post</a> my two SoCG papers both
involved trying and failing to prove something else, and writing down
what I could prove instead. For the one that appears today, “Cubic
planar graphs that cannot be drawn on few lines” (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05256">arXiv:1903.05256</a>),
that something else was Open Problem 16.14 of my book, which can be
rephrased as: does there exist a family of planar graphs that cannot be
drawn planarly with all vertices on a constant number of convex curves?</p>

<p>Instead I expand on something that was already known, the existence of
planar graphs that cannot be drawn with all vertices on a constant
number of lines.</p>

<p>There were two previously known methods for constructing such graphs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_network">planar
3-tree</a>. This
is a planar graph formed by recursively subdividing triangles into three
smaller triangles. If the vertices are drawn on some family of lines,
the line through the subdivision point must miss one of the three
smaller triangles, so by induction you can be forced to use a
non-constant number of lines. But the bound you get is only logarithmic.<sup id="fnref:book"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/13/planar-graphs-needing.html#fn:book">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Planar 3-tree" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/planar-3-tree.svg"/></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a maximal planar graph whose dual graph has no long paths.
In a maximal planar graph, any line through many vertices can be
translated into a path through many dual vertices. So if there is no
long dual path there must be many lines. This gives a polynomial lower
bound on the number of lines, but with a tiny exponent.<sup id="fnref:dual"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/13/planar-graphs-needing.html#fn:dual">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The new paper finds a third method:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a graph that has many disjoint collections of many nested cycles.
Drawing a big set of nested cycles on a small
number of lines necessarily uses up one of the crossing points of the lines.
So if there are more nests than crossing points, one of them will have
to use many lines.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Graph with many disjoint collections of many nested cycles" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/spiderwebs.svg"/></p>

<p>This leads to stronger polynomial bounds, but also (more importantly I
think) wider families of planar graphs that need non-constant numbers of
lines. For instance, it works for series-parallel graphs of maximum
degree three, which are far from being maximal planar. And even though
every tree can be drawn with its vertices on two lines, adding a single
vertex to a tree can produce a graph that requires a non-constant number
of lines.</p>

topic in Graph Drawing. Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the
number of bends on the edges. A key ingredient for bend minimization algorithms
is the existence of an orthogonal representation that allows to describe such
drawings purely combinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges
around each vertex and the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any
kind of geometric information such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths. Barth
et al. [2] have established the existence of an analogous ortho-radial
representation for ortho-radial drawings, which are embeddings into an
ortho-radial grid, whose gridlines are concentric circles around the origin and
straight-line spokes emanating from the origin but excluding the origin itself.
While any orthogonal representation admits an orthogonal drawing, it is the
circularity of the ortho-radial grid that makes the problem of characterizing
valid ortho-radial representations all the more complex and interesting. Barth
et al. prove such a characterization. However, the proof is existential and
does not provide an efficient algorithm for testing whether a given
ortho-radial representation is valid, let alone actually obtaining a drawing
from an ortho-radial representation. In this paper we give quadratic-time
algorithms for both of these tasks. They are based on a suitably constrained
left-first DFS in planar graphs and several new insights on ortho-radial
representations. Our validity check requires quadratic time, and a naive
application of it would yield a quartic algorithm for constructing a drawing
from a valid ortho-radial representation. Using further structural insights we
speed up the drawing algorithm to quadratic running time.

(SA) hierarchies. We prove a collection of dependencies among these hierarchies
both for general CPOPs and for optimization problems on the Boolean hypercube.
Key results include for the general case that the SONC and SOS hierarchy are
polynomially incomparable, while SDSOS is contained in SONC. A direct
consequence is the non-existence of a Putinar-like Positivstellensatz for
SDSOS. On the Boolean hypercube, we show as a main result that Schm\"udgen-like
versions of the hierarchies SDSOS*, SONC*, and SA* are polynomially equivalent.
Moreover, we show that SA* is contained in any Schm\"udgen-like hierarchy that
provides a O(n) degree bound.

    <title>conLSH: Context based Locality Sensitive Hashing for Mapping of noisy SMRT Reads</title>

Gen technology developed by Pacific Bio (PacBio). It comes with an explosion of
long and noisy reads demanding cutting edge research to get most out of it. To
deal with the high error probability of SMRT data, a novel contextual Locality
Sensitive Hashing (conLSH) based algorithm is proposed in this article, which
can effectively align the noisy SMRT reads to the reference genome. Here,
sequences are hashed together based not only on their closeness, but also on
similarity of context. The algorithm has $\mathcal{O}(n^{\rho+1})$ space
requirement, where $n$ is the number of sequences in the corpus and $\rho$ is a
constant. The indexing time and querying time are bounded by $\mathcal{O}(
\frac{n^{\rho+1} \cdot \ln n}{\ln \frac{1}{P_2}})$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^\rho)$
respectively, where $P_2 &gt; 0$, is a probability value. This algorithm is
particularly useful for retrieving similar sequences, a widely used task in
biology. The proposed conLSH based aligner is compared with rHAT, popularly
used for aligning SMRT reads, and is found to comprehensively beat it in speed
as well as in memory requirements. In particular, it takes approximately
$24.2\%$ less processing time, while saving about $70.3\%$ in peak memory
requirement for H.sapiens PacBio dataset.

is the complement of an induced cycle of length at least $4$. A hole or
antihole is long if its length is at least $5$. For an integer $k$, the
$k$-prism is the graph consisting of two cliques of size $k$ joined by a

long-hole-free graphs remains an important open problem. In this paper we give
a polynomial time algorithm to solve MWIS in long-hole-free graphs with no
$k$-prism (for any fixed integer $k$), and a subexponential algorithm for MWIS
in long-hole-free graphs in general. As a special case this gives a polynomial
time algorithm to find a maximum weight clique in perfect graphs with no long

minimal chordal completions and potential maximal cliques.

    <title>Optimal Parallel Algorithms in the Binary-Forking Model</title>

variety of fundamental problems, including sorting, semisorting, list ranking,
tree contraction, range minima, and set union, intersection and difference. In
the binary-forking model, tasks can only fork into two child tasks, but can do
so recursively and asynchronously, and join up later. The tasks share memory,
and costs are measured in terms of work (total number of instructions), and
span (longest dependence chain).
</p>
<p>Due to the asynchronous nature of the model, and a variety schedulers that
are efficient in both theory and practice, variants of the model are widely
used in practice in languages such as Cilk and Java Fork-Join. PRAM algorithms
can be simulated in the model but at a loss of a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$ so
most PRAM algorithms are not optimal in the model even if optimal on the PRAM.
All algorithms we describe are optimal in work and span (logarithmic in span).
Several are randomized. Beyond being the first optimal algorithms for their
problems in the model, most are very simple.

    <title>Counting polygon triangulations is hard</title>
    <summary>In some sense both of my accepted papers at SoCG are about a situation where I really wanted to prove something else, wasn’t able to, and wrote up what I could prove instead. The one whose preprint appears today, “Counting polygon triangulations is hard” (arXiv:1903.04737), proves that it’s -complete to count the triangulations of a polygon with holes.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In some sense both of my accepted papers at SoCG are about a situation where I really wanted to prove something else, wasn’t able to, and wrote up what I could prove instead. The one whose preprint appears today, “Counting polygon triangulations is hard” (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04737">arXiv:1903.04737</a>), proves that it’s -complete to count the triangulations of a polygon with holes.</p>

<p>It’s easy to prove that it’s -hard to count maximum non-crossing subsets of line segment arrangements: the intersections graphs of line segments include all the planar graphs, so this follows immediately from the -completeness of maximum independent sets in planar graphs. The gadgets in my paper (drawn below) turn a single line segment into a part of a polygon for which many triangulations use diagonals in approximately the same position as the line segment, and there are few other triangulations. By using these gadgets, one could easily construct a polygon in which most of the triangulations correspond to maximum non-crossing subsets, showing that it’s also -hard to count triangulations. But this is unsatisfactory because it’s the wrong kind of completeness. For counting problems, we want -completeness, not just -hardness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Gadgets for proving hardness of polygon triangulation" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/tricount-gadgets.svg"/></p>

<p>The reason the outline above isn’t already a -completeness proof is that we need to control the rest of the triangulation better. It’s not enough for most triangulations to come from maximum non-crossing subsets. We need each maximum non-crossing subset of line segments to contribute exactly the same number of triangulations (or at least a predictable and controlled number) so that we can recover the number of maximum non-crossing subsets from the number of triangulations. The gadgets control the parts of the triangulation near each segment of the non-crossing subsets, but we also need to control the parts of the triangulation that are not near those segments. Achieving this took much of the work in my new paper. There are two main ideas: First, we use special arrangements with the property that, when you close off the gadgets of a maximum non-crossing subset, the remaining parts of the polygon form pieces of predictable shapes for which we can count the triangulations. In these arrangements, there are two colors of segments, red and blue; each blue segment is crossed by two red segments, and each red segment is crossed in the order blue-red-blue. So we need a new counting reduction from graph independent sets that produces arrangements of this type. And second, we decompose the total number of maximum non-crossing subsets into a sum of smaller numbers, of subsets that have a given number of red segments. Subsets with the same number of red segments leads to the same numbers of triangulations, allowing the terms in the sum to be recovered from the number of triangulations.</p>

<p>A secondary goal was to do this all using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_counting_reduction">polynomial-time counting reduction</a> rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction">Turing reductions</a> that are more commonly used for -completeness. One cannot use an even stronger notion of reduction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsimonious_reduction">parsimonious reductions</a>, to reduce  problems that might have zero solutions to a problem like triangulation that always has at least one. But to me, counting reductions are more closely analogous to the many-one reductions used for -completeness. We can use them, so we should use them. So the reductions in the paper are polynomial-time counting reductions, but more work would be needed to prove that the starting graph problem I used (counting independent sets in regular planar graphs) is complete for those reductions.</p>

<p>Surprisingly to me, this appears to be the first published proof of a -completeness result in two-dimensional computational geometry. And although some 2d geometric structures have been proven -hard to construct (and therefore -hard to count) it seems to be the first hardness proof of any kind for counting 2d structures that can be constructed rather than counted in polynomial time. But as I said at the top of this post, it’s not what I really wanted to prove. I was hoping to prove hardness for counting non-crossing structures on point sets, such as simple polygons, triangulations, non-crossing matchings, or pointed pseudotriangulations. The polygon question was suggested to me by Sara Billey when I visited her last April, in connection with a different problem we were working on (and still haven’t published). And counting the triangulations of a point set would fit the theme of my recent book, because this count is a numerical parameter that depends only on the order type of the points and mostly behaves monotonically under point deletion (exception: delete the center point of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx">quincunx</a>). Instead I had to settle for polygon triangulations. But maybe another paper can take this line of research one step farther, to counting problems on points.</p>

    <title>TR19-040 |  The Complexity of Finding {$S$}-factors in Regular Graphs |

	Mihalis Yannakakis</title>
    <summary>A graph $G$ has an \emph{$S$-factor} if there exists a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that for all $v \in V: \deg_F(v) \in S$.
The simplest example of such factor is a $1$-factor, which corresponds to a perfect matching in a graph. In this paper we study the computational complexity of finding $S$-factors in regular graphs.
Our techniques combine some classical as well as recent tools from graph theory.</summary>

    <summary>We provide new upper bounds on the complexity of the s-t-connectivity problem in planar graphs, thereby providing additional evidence that this problem is not complete for NL. This also yields a new upper bound on the complexity of computing edit distance. Building on these techniques, we provide new upper bounds on the complexity of several other computational problems on planar graphs. All of these problems are shown to be solvable in logarithmic time on a concurrent-read exclusive-write (CREW) PRAM. The new upper bounds are provided by making use of a known characterization of CREW algorithms in terms of "unambiguous" AC$^1$ circuits. This seems to be the first occasion where this characterization has been used in order to provide new upper bounds on natural problems.</summary>

    <title>Richard Karp: His influence and how to honor him</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When I first saw the definition of NP-Complete I first thought<i> if there are NP-complete problems I suspect they are contrived. </i>When I saw the proof that  SAT is NP-complete I thought <i>okay, so there is one natural problem  NP-complete by a trick of encoding, but I suspect there aren't any more.</i>  I then read Karp's article that had 22 NP-complete problems. I thought <i>okay, there are 22, but I suspect there are no more. </i>No I didn't think that. But the point is that Cook and Karp together birthed modern complexity theory by introduction NP-completeness and showing that there are MANY natural problems that are NP-complete.<br/>
<br/>
How many people has Richard Karp inspired? I don't know but I suspect it's a  cardinal between countable and the reals so it may depend on your model of set theory. Later in this post I will present Samir Khuller's story of how Richard Karp inspired him.<br/>
<br/>
How to honor him?  The Simons inst. is currently welcoming contributions to the Richard M Karp Fund, which honors the scientific contributions of Founding Director Dick Karp. The fund will provide vital support for the mission and activities of the Simons institute. They have a deadline of Pi-Day. You can go <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/support/donate">here</a> to contribute and/or <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/goldwasserkarp.txt">here</a> for a letter from Shafi Goldwasser, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Umesh Vazirani about the fund.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY, Samir's story:<br/>

<b>Mentoring and Influence via a Train Journey...</b></div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Almost to the day, 33 years ago I was running from my dorm room to catch an unreliable bus to the train station as I headed home for a mid-semester break.  On the way,I  stopped by the mailroom, and not knowing where to put the CACM that had just arrived,  stuffed it into the side of my bag and in the process, dropping my   notebook in the process. On the train, when I looked for my  notebook to go over  some material I realized it was missing! All I had was a CACM and a very long train ride. Skimming through the journal, I found Karp’s Turing Award article “Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness“. I  started reading this article, and was riveted! It was one of those life changing moments for me, when my immediate future became clear - I wanted to study Theoretical Computer Science and specifically the complexity of combinatorial problems. Without ever having met Dick Karp, he changed my life forever.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I met Dick long after he influenced me via his Turing Award Lecture and it was a real privilege to have had the opportunity to interview him via a fireside chat at Simons. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DT_UeJwps">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I am delighted about the fund Bill mentions above as the money that goes to it will help inspire others as Karp inspired me.</div>

<p/><p>
Bill Gasarch and Clyde Kruskal are colleagues in Computer Science at the University of Maryland. They have just seen the publication of their <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/11261">book</a> <em>Problems With a Point</em>.</p>
<p>
Today Dick and I congratulate them on the book and give a brief overview of it.</p>
<p>
The tandem of Bill and Clyde were <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/theorems-are-forever-a-great-one-from-1492/">featured</a> before on this blog in connection with a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.138.6154">series</a> of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/3apsurvey.pdf">papers</a> with James Glenn on sets of numbers that have no arithmetical progressions of length 3. </p>
<p>
Can a “series” have only two members? We could add a third <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11821069_13">paper</a> to the series, but it is by Glenn and Bill with Richard Beigel rather than Clyde and is on the different topic of multi-party communication complexity. But Clyde gets into the act since it is the topic of Chapter 19 of the book. That chapter analyzes a game form of problems that go back to a 1983 <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/multiparty-vdw.pdf">paper</a> by Dick with Ashok Chandra and Merrick Furst. Does this mean Dick should get some royalties? Note that this last link is to Bill’s website. And ‘vdw’ in this link seems to refer to van der Waerden’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waerden's_theorem">theorem</a>, which is a pillar of both Ramsey theory and number theory, which in turn receive much attention in the book.</p>
<p>
My last paragraph flits through divergent questions but they are representative of things that we working mathematical computing theorists think about every day—and of various kinds of content in the book. Of course, Bill partners on Lance Fortnow’s prominent <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/">blog</a> and so has shared all kinds of these musings. The book, which incorporates numerous posts by Bill but is not a “blog book” <em>per-se</em>, furnishes contexts for them. Let’s look at the book.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Book </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The book has three main parts, titled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stories With a Point. <p/>
</li><li>
Problems With a Point. <p/>
</li><li>
Theorems With a Point.
</li></ul>
<p>
All the chapters except three are prefaced with a section titled “Point”—or “The Point” or “Points”—after one sentence on prior knowledge needed, which often reads, “None.”</p>
<p>
The first part begins with a chapter titled, “When Terms From Math are Used By Civilians,” one of several with social discussion. The second is about how human aspects of sports upset statistical regularities one might expect to see. For example, many more baseball hitters have had season batting averages of .300 than .299 or .301, evidently because .300 is a “goal number” everyone strives to meet. There are numerous things in the book I didn’t know. </p>
<p>
The next chapter largely reproduces this record-long <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/07/disproofing-myth-that-many-early.html">post</a> on the blog but adds much extra commentary. Then there are chapters on what makes a mathematical function worth defining, on how mathematical objects are named, on Bill’s visit to a “Gathering for [Martin] Gardner” <a href="http://www.gathering4gardner.org/">conference</a>, on coloring the plane, two on imagined applications of Ramsey Theory to medieval history, and one on the methodological and social impact of having theorems that represent barriers to ways of trying to prove other theorems. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Chapter Ten </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This last chapter of Part I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/04/lets-prove-something-instead-of-proving.html">draws</a> on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/04/but-seriously-now-folks-what-do-you.html">several</a> of Bill’s <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/03/other-fields-of-math-dont-prove-barrier.html">posts</a>. It goes most to the heart of what we all in computational complexity grapple with daily and benefits from having more context: As we just mused in this blog’s 10-year anniversary <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/18/have-ten-years-brought-us-closer/">post</a>, the major questions in complexity are not only as open as when we started, but as open as when the field started 50-plus years ago. There has barely been any discernible direct progress, and this is not only a concern for entering students but a retardant on everyone—about which we’ve given <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/lets-mention-foundations/">exhortation</a>.</p>
<p>
There are instead <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/barriers-to-pnp-proofs/">barrier</a> theorems saying <em>why</em> the main questions will not be resolvable by the very techniques that were used to build the field. Of three broad categories of barriers, “oracle results” de-fang all the methods typically taught in intro graduate complexity courses. Those methods meter computations at inputs and outputs but not how they “progress” inside toward a solution. Oracle languages supply blasts of external information that either make progress trivially quick or allow conditioning the terms of the complexity-class relation under analysis to information in the oracle that is tailored to obfuscate. Oracles of the former kind usually collapse complexity classes together, such as <img alt="{A =}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A =}"/> any polynomial-space complete language making <img alt="{\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5EA+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5EA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A}"/>, whereas oracles <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> of the latter kind drive them apart (so <img alt="{\mathsf{P}^B \neq \mathsf{NP}^B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5EB+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5EB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}^B \neq \mathsf{NP}^B}"/>) but often for reasons that frustrate as much as enlighten. When contemplating a new complexity class relation it is incumbent to frame a “relativized” version of it and see if some oracles can make it true and others false. Such oracle constructions were initially easy to come by—“fast food” for research—but their ultimate besideness-of-the-point is reflected in this early <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/i-hate-oracle-results/">post</a> by Dick.</p>
<p>
Next after oracles is the “Natural Proofs” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof">barrier</a>, which basically cuts against all the techniques taught in advanced graduate complexity courses unless they can somehow be weirdly narrow or intensely complex in their conceptual framing. The attitude on those is captured by the title of another early <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/whos-afraid-of-natural-proofs/">post</a> by Dick titled, “Who’s Afraid of Natural Proofs?” The third barrier is <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/algstoc.pdf">algebrization</a>, which cuts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Results_about_difficulty_of_proof">against</a> efforts to escape from oracles. </p>
<p>
Amid all this environment of obstruction, what of consequence can we prove? Well, the chapter on this has by far the highest concentration of Bill’s trademark all-capital letters and exclamation points. The initial “Point” section is titled, “Rant.” (The chapter also includes a page on the attempts to prove Euclid’s parallel postulate, which might be called the original “problem with a point.”)</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Part II </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Much of Part II involves the kind of problems that were used or considered for high-school mathematics competitions. By definition those are not research problems but they often point toward frontiers by representing accessible cases of them. The appealing ones blend equal parts research relevance, amusement value, and reward of technical command. Often they require mathematical “street smarts” and a repertoire of useful tricks and proof patterns. Practicing researchers will find this aspect of the book most valuable. The problems are mainly on the number-theory side of recreational mathematics, plus geometric and coloring problems. Egyptian fractions, prime-factor puzzles, sums over digits, summation formulas, and of course Ramsey theory all make their appearance. Here is one problem I mention partly to correct a small content error, where the correction seems to make the problem more interesting. Say that <img alt="{C(n,m)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28n%2Cm%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(n,m)}"/> holds if there are integers <img alt="{n_1,\dots,n_m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cn_m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n_1,\dots,n_m}"/> such that </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  n_1 + \cdots + n_m = n \qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{1}{n_1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n_m} = 1. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++n_1+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+n_m+%3D+n+%5Cqquad%5Ctext%7Band%7D%5Cqquad+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn_1%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn_m%7D+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  n_1 + \cdots + n_m = n \qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{1}{n_1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n_m} = 1. "/></p>
<p>A general principle discovered by Joseph Sylvester gives cases such as <img alt="{C(1861,5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%281861%2C5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(1861,5)}"/> being witnessed by </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  1861 = 2 + 3 + 7 + 43 + 1806 \qquad\text{and}\qquad 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{43} + \frac{1}{1806}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++1861+%3D+2+%2B+3+%2B+7+%2B+43+%2B+1806+%5Cqquad%5Ctext%7Band%7D%5Cqquad+1+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B43%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1806%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  1861 = 2 + 3 + 7 + 43 + 1806 \qquad\text{and}\qquad 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{43} + \frac{1}{1806}. "/></p>
<p>How can it and related ideas be extended to other cases? The particular problem is given <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> to find <img alt="{m_n =}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_n =}"/> the least <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> such that <img alt="{C(n,m)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28n%2Cm%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(n,m)}"/> holds—and to find a witnessing sum. The error is an assertion that <img alt="{m_n \leq n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n+%5Cleq+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_n \leq n}"/> “by writing <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> as a sum of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>‘s,” but then the reciprocals add up to <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> not <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. So is there any bound on <img alt="{m_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_n}"/>? That is rather fun to think about. </p>
<p>
This problem’s chapter is made from a short <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/12/is-this-problem-too-hard-for-hs-math.html">post</a> with an enormous comments section.  There is also a chapter on the boundary between a fair problem and a “trick question” that much extends an April Fool’s post on the blog.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Part III </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Part III continues the nature of the problem content with emphasis on the worths of proofs of theorems. One illustration involving perfect numbers and sums of cubes notes that the proof loses value because it also applies to certain non-perfect numbers. Two things <em>en-passant</em>: First, Lemma 21.1 in this chapter needs qualification that <img alt="{a,b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a,b}"/> are relatively prime and <img alt="{x+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x+1}"/> is prime. Second, this prompts me to note <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/09/">via</a> Gil Kalai the discovery by Tim Browning that the number 33 is a sum of three cubes: </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  33 = 8,\!866,\!128,\!975,\!287,\!528^3 + (-8,\!778,\!405,\!442,\!862,\!239)^3 + (-2,\!736,\!111,\!468,\!807,\!040)^3. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++33+%3D+8%2C%5C%21866%2C%5C%21128%2C%5C%21975%2C%5C%21287%2C%5C%21528%5E3+%2B+%28-8%2C%5C%21778%2C%5C%21405%2C%5C%21442%2C%5C%21862%2C%5C%21239%29%5E3+%2B+%28-2%2C%5C%21736%2C%5C%21111%2C%5C%21468%2C%5C%21807%2C%5C%21040%29%5E3.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  33 = 8,\!866,\!128,\!975,\!287,\!528^3 + (-8,\!778,\!405,\!442,\!862,\!239)^3 + (-2,\!736,\!111,\!468,\!807,\!040)^3. "/></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Gil points to a Quora <a href="https://affinemess.quora.com/HOLY-CRAP-33-IS-THE-SUM-OF-THREE-CUBES">post</a> by Alon Amit. There is only the bare equation on Browning’s <a href="http://pub.ist.ac.at/~tbrownin/">homepage</a>, and nothing about his methods or how much he used computer search is known. The theme of proofs by computer runs through several chapters of Bill and Clyde’s book. It is also <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4133">current</a> on Scott Aaronson’s blog—we would be remiss if we did not mention Scott in this post—and more widely.</p>
<p>
The penultimate chapter covers the beautiful theory of rectangle-free colorings of grids. We mentioned Bill’s involvement with this Ramsey-style problem in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/how-deep-is-your-coloring/">post</a> on what happened to be this blog’s third anniversary. We connected it to Kolmogorov complexity, which together with uncomputability is the subject of the last chapter. This and other chapters I’ve mentioned exemplify how the research ambit connects traditional mathematics with the terms and concerns of computing theory. How to work in this ambit may be the greatest value of the book for students. In all I found the book light, lighthearted, and enlightening.</p>
<p>

The big open problem with the book is how it might help gear us up to tackle the big open problems.</p>

    <title>TR19-038 |  Statistical Difference Beyond the Polarizing Regime | 

	Itay Berman, 

	Akshay Degwekar, 

	Ron D. Rothblum, 

	Prashant Nalini Vasudevan</title>
    <summary>The polarization lemma for statistical distance ($\mathrm{SD}$), due to Sahai and Vadhan (JACM, 2003), is an efficient transformation taking as input a pair of circuits $(C_0,C_1)$ and an integer $k$ and outputting a new pair of circuits $(D_0,D_1)$ such that if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1)\geq\alpha$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \geq 1-2^{-k}$ and if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1) \leq \beta$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \leq 2^{-k}$. The polarization lemma is known to hold for any constant values $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$, but extending the lemma to the regime in which $\alpha^2 \leq \beta &lt; \alpha$ has remained elusive. The focus of this work is in studying the latter regime of parameters. Our main results are:

1. Polarization lemmas for different notions of distance, such as Triangular Discrimination ($\mathrm{TD}$) and Jensen-Shannon Divergence ($\mathrm{JS}$), which enable polarization for some problems where the statistical distance satisfies $\alpha^2 &lt; \beta &lt; \alpha$. We also derive a polarization lemma for statistical distance with any inverse-polynomially small gap between $\alpha^2$ and $\beta$ (rather than a constant).

2. The average-case hardness of the statistical difference problem (i.e., determining whether the statistical distance between two given circuits is at least $\alpha$ or at most $\beta$), for any values of $\beta &lt; \alpha$, implies the existence of one-way functions. Such a result was previously only known for $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$.

3. A (direct) constant-round interactive proof for estimating the statistical distance between any two distributions (up to any inverse polynomial error) given circuits that generate them.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Via <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4133">Scott</a>, John Horgan wrote a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">blog post</a> following on his 1993 Scientific American article <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">The Death of Proof</a>. The article talked about computer-generated proofs, experimental mathematics and even mentioned some of our work on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/103418.103428">transparent proofs</a> (basically time-efficient probabilistically checkable proofs). I got (sarcastically I think) accused of killing mathematics after that article but of course we had traditional proofs about probabilistically check proofs. Andrew Wiles got a sidebar titled "A Splendid Anachronism?" for merely solving the most famous open problem in all of mathematics. Somehow traditional mathematical proofs survived the article.<div>

Meanwhile in CACM, Moshe Vardi writes <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/3/234913-lost-in-math/fulltext">Lost in Math?</a> </div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
TCS is surely blessed with mathematical beauty. As a graduate student a long time ago, it was mathematical beauty that attracted me to TCS, and continued to lead my research for many years. I find computational complexity theory (or complexity theory, for short), with its theorems (for example, the time-hierarchy and space-hierarchy theorems) and its open questions (for example, P vs NP), to be hauntingly beautiful. Beauty, yes; but what about truth?</blockquote>
Here here on the beauty of complexity. So what about truth? I cover much of this in my <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/9/38904-the-status-of-the-p-versus-np-problem/fulltext">P v NP survey</a>. In short the P v NP captures the most critical aspects of what is efficiently computable but it is not the endpoint. Nevertheless P v NP captures both truth and beauty and that's why the problem has so captivated and guided me throughout my research career.</div>

    <title>A dream come true, sort of: E-ink monitors</title>
    <summary>Spending your life staring at a (traditional) computer screen may not be ideal for your eyes (and more); so since an early age I have been dreaming of a “purely mechanical” monitor that you could stare at more or less indefinitely, like at parchment.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: justify;">Spending your life staring at a (traditional) computer screen may not be ideal for your eyes (and more); so since an early age I have been dreaming of a “purely mechanical” monitor that you could stare at more or less indefinitely, like at parchment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This dream is now becoming reality, sort of.  The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dasung-Ink-Paperlike-13-3-Monitor/dp/B07GWGFW1B/ref=asc_df_B07GWGFW1B/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=309743296044&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=4273202700836301476&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9002067&amp;hvtargid=pla-571127059636&amp;psc=1">Dasung E-ink monitor </a>has no backlight and instead reportedly uses electric flows to move ink droplets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some consideration, spending yet more hours reading reviews online and watching youtube videos about it sealed the deal.  I shelled out $1300 and bought the thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have had it for a few days now and I am sort of happy. I went from using a giant 30-inch monitor far away (my theory for avoiding eye strain) to using a ~13-inch monitor at pretty much the same distance as reading a book. I had to avoid sunlight, now I seek it (see the picture).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="20190307_094550" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" src="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/20190307_094550.jpg?w=640"/></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The monitor makes your computer look like Windows 3.1 on a monochrome screen from the 80’s. The refresh is slow, and there is a ghosting effect, meaning there are shadows of previous images — which you can clear out. Also, it’s 4:3 instead of 16:9, which is a pain because it means I have to change resolution when I am forced to use my other monitor (for example if I have to check colors — the screen is gray-scale, did I mention that?). It makes browsing the internet quite painful, which is a nice side effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contrary to advice, I am using it as my primary monitor. I am sort of happy with it and don’t regret buying it. I have started writing and reading papers with it and it’s working well enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think as soon as the technology improves the market for these things will be huge.  Already having a 17″ monitor in 16:9 ratio, ideally touch-screen, even if gray scale, would be a dream come true.</p></div>

    <title xml:lang="en-US">Death of proof greatly exaggerated</title>
    <summary xml:lang="en-US">In 1993, the science writer John Horgan—who’s best known for his book The End of Science, and (of course) for interviewing me in 2016—wrote a now-(in)famous cover article for Scientific American entitled “The Death of Proof.” Mashing together a large number of (what I’d consider) basically separate trends and ideas, Horgan argued that math was […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In 1993, the science writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horgan_(journalist)">John Horgan</a>—who’s best known for his book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Science-Knowledge-Twilight-Scientific/dp/0465065929">The End of Science</a></em>, and (of course) for <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">interviewing me in 2016</a>—wrote a now-(in)famous cover article for <em>Scientific American</em> entitled <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e56/c6fea76922082400dfc6e13a3a169ae7b9a6.pdf">“The Death of Proof.”</a>  Mashing together a large number of (what I’d consider) basically separate trends and ideas, Horgan argued that math was undergoing a fundamental change, with traditional deductive proofs being replaced by a combination of non-rigorous numerical simulations, machine-generated proofs, probabilistic and probabilistically-checkable proofs, and proofs using graphics and video.  Horgan also suggested that Andrew Wiles’s then-brand-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">proof</a> of Fermat’s Last Theorem—which might have looked, at first glance, like a spectacular counterexample to the “death of proof” thesis—could be the “last gasp of a dying culture” and a “splendid anachronism.”  Apparently, “The Death of Proof” garnered one of the largest volumes of angry mail in <em>Scientific American</em>‘s history, with mathematician after mathematician arguing that Horgan had strung together half-digested quotes and vignettes to manufacture a non-story.</p>



<p>Now Horgan—who you could variously describe as a wonderful sport, or a ham, or a sucker for punishment—has written a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">26-year retrospective</a> on his “death of proof” article.  The prompt for this was Horgan’s recent discovery that, back in the 90s, David Hoffman and Hermann Karcher, two mathematicians annoyed by the “death of proof” article, had named a nonexistent mathematical object after its author.  The so-called <em><a href="https://minimalsurfaces.blog/home/repository/non-existent-surfaces/the-horgan-surface/">Horgan surface</a></em> is a minimal surface that numerical computations strongly suggested should exist, but that can be rigorously proven not to exist after all.  “The term was intended as an insult, but I’m honored anyway,” Horgan writes.</p>



<p>As a followup to his blog post, Horgan then decided to solicit commentary from various people he knew, including yours truly, about “how proofs are faring in an era of increasing computerization.”  He wrote, “I’d love to get a paragraph or two from you.”  Alas, I didn’t have the time to do as requested, but only to write <i>eight</i> paragraphs.  So Horgan suggested that I make the result into a post on my own blog, which he’d then link to.  Without further ado, then:</p>



<hr/>



<p>John, I like you so I hate to say it, but the last quarter century has not been kind to your thesis about “the death of proof”!  Those mathematicians sending you the irate letters had a point: there’s been no fundamental change to mathematics that deserves such a dramatic title.  Proof-based math remains quite healthy, with (e.g.) a solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture">Poincaré conjecture</a> since your article came out, as well as to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05363">Erdős discrepancy problem</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadison%E2%80%93Singer_problem">Kadison-Singer conjecture</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan%27s_conjecture">Catalan’s conjecture</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.998&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">bounded gaps in primes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">testing primality in deterministic polynomial time</a>, etc. — just to pick a few examples from the tiny subset of areas that I know anything about.</p>



<p>There are evolutionary changes to mathematical practice, as there always have been.  Since 2009, the website <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a> has let mathematicians query the global hive-mind about an obscure reference or a recalcitrant step in a proof, and get near-instant answers.  Meanwhile <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/">“polymath” projects</a> have, with moderate success, tried to harness blogs and other social media to make advances on long-standing open math problems using massive collaborations.</p>



<p>While humans remain in the driver’s seat, there are persistent efforts to increase the role of computers, with some notable successes.  These include Thomas Hales’s 1998 computer-assisted proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture">Kepler Conjecture</a> (about the densest possible way to pack oranges) — now fully machine-verified from start to finish, after <del>the </del><em><del>Annals of Mathematics</del></em><del> refused to publish a mixture of traditional mathematics and computer code</del> (seems this is not exactly what happened; see the comment section for more).  It also includes William McCune’s 1996 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_algebra">Robbins Conjecture</a> in algebra (the computer-generated <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/papers/robbins/eqp-theorem.proof.txt">proof</a> was only half a page, but involved substitutions so strange that for 60 years no human had found them); and at the “opposite extreme,” the 2016 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem">Pythagorean triples problem</a> by Marijn Heule and collaborators, which weighed in at 200 terabytes (at that time, “the longest proof in the history of mathematics”).</p>



<p>It’s conceivable that someday, computers will replace humans at all aspects of mathematical research — but it’s also conceivable that, by the time they can do that, they’ll be able to replace humans at music and science journalism and everything else!</p>



<p><a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/proofs.ppt">New notions of proof</a> — including probabilistic, interactive, zero-knowledge, and even quantum proofs — have seen further development by theoretical computer scientists since 1993.  So far, though, these new types of proof remain either entirely theoretical (as with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01664">quantum proofs</a>), or else they’re used for cryptographic protocols but not for mathematical research.  (For example, zero-knowledge proofs now play a major role in certain cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zcash">Zcash</a>.)</p>



<p>In many areas of math (including my own, theoretical computer science), proofs have continued to get longer and harder for any one person to absorb.  This has led some to advocate a split approach, wherein human mathematicians would talk to each other only about the handwavy intuitions and high-level concepts, while the tedious verification of details would be left to computers.  So far, though, the huge investment of time needed to write proofs in machine-checkable format — for almost no return in new insight — has prevented this approach’s wide adoption.</p>



<p>Yes, there are non-rigorous approaches to math, which continue to be widely used in physics and engineering and other fields, as they always have been.  But none of these approaches have displaced proof as the gold standard whenever it’s available.  If I had to speculate about why, I’d say: if you use non-rigorous approaches, then even if it’s clear to you under what conditions your results can be trusted, it’s probably much less clear to others.  Also, even if only one segment of a research community cares about rigor, whatever earlier work that segment builds on will need to be rigorous as well — thereby exerting constant pressure in that direction.  Thus, the more collaborative a given research area becomes, the more important is rigor.</p>



<p>For my money, the elucidation of the foundations of mathematics a century ago, by Cantor, Frege, Peano, Hilbert, Russell, Zermelo, Gödel, Turing, and others, still stands as one of the greatest triumphs of human thought, up there with evolution or quantum mechanics or anything else.  It’s true that the ideal set by these luminaries remains mostly aspirational.  When mathematicians say that a theorem has been “proved,” they still mean, as they always have, something more like: “we’ve reached a social consensus that all the ideas are now in place for a strictly formal proof that could be verified by a machine … with the only task remaining being massive rote coding work that none of us has any intention of ever doing!”  It’s also true that mathematicians, being human, are subject to the full panoply of foibles you might expect: claiming to have proved things they haven’t, squabbling over who proved what, accusing others of lack of rigor while hypocritically taking liberties themselves.  But just like love and honesty remain fine ideals no matter how often they’re flouted, so too does mathematical rigor.</p>

    <title>TR19-037 |  Closure of VP under taking factors: a short and simple proof | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	Chi-Ning  Chou,

    <summary>In this note, we give a short, simple and almost completely self contained proof of a classical result of Kaltofen [Kal86, Kal87, Kal89] which shows that if an n variate degree $d$ polynomial f can be computed by an arithmetic circuit of size s, then each of its factors can be computed by an arithmetic circuit of size at most poly(s, n, d). 

However, unlike Kaltofen's argument, our proof  does not  directly give an efficient algorithm for computing the circuits for the factors of f.</summary>

    <title>TR19-036 |  On the complexity of computing a random Boolean function over the reals | 

	Pavel Hrubes</title>
    <summary>We say that a first-order formula $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ over $\mathbb{R}$ defines a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, if for every $x_1,\dots,x_n\in\{0,1\}$, $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ is true iff $f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=1$. We show that:

(i) every $f$ can be defined by a formula of size $O(n)$, 
(ii) if $A$ is required to have at most $k\geq 1$ quantifier alternations, there exists an $f$ which requires  a formula of size $2^{\Omega(n/k)}$. 
 
The latter result implies several previously known as well as some new lower bounds in computational complexity. We note that (i) holds over any field of characteristic zero, and (ii) holds for any real closed or algebraically closed field.</summary>

    <title>TR19-035 |  PIT for depth-4 circuits and Sylvester-Gallai theorem for polynomials | 

	Alexey Milovanov</title>
    <summary>This text is a development of  a preprint of Ankit Gupta. 

We present an approach for devising a deterministic polynomial time whitekbox identity testing (PIT) algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.
This approach is similar to Kayal-Saraf approach for depth-$3$ circuits. Kayal and Saraf  based their algorithm on Sylvester-Gallai-type theorem about linear polynomials. We show how it is possible to generalize this approach to depth-$4$ circuits. However we failed to implement this plan completely. We succeeded to construct a polynomial time deterministic algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin and its correctness requires a hypothesis. Also we present a  polynomial-time (unconditional) algorithm for some subclass of   depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.</summary>

    <title>TR19-034 |  On $\epsilon$-sensitive monotone computations | 

	Pavel Hrubes</title>
    <summary>We show that strong-enough lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits or the non-negative rank of a matrix imply unconditional lower bounds in arithmetic or Boolean circuit complexity. First, we show that if a polynomial $f\in {\mathbb {R}}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ of degree $d$ has an arithmetic circuit of size $s$ then $(x_1+\dots+x_n+1)^d+\epsilon f$ has a monotone arithmetic circuit of size $O(sd^2+n\log n)$, for some $\epsilon&gt;0$.  Second, if $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a Boolean function,  we associate with $f$ an explicit exponential-size matrix $M(f)$ such that the Boolean circuit size of $f$ is at least $\Omega(\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))- 2n)$, where $J$ is the all-ones matrix and $\hbox{rk}_+$ denotes the non-negative rank of a matrix. In fact, the quantity $\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))$ characterizes how hard is it to distinguish rejecting and accepting inputs of $f$ by means of a linear program. 
Finally, we introduce a proof system resembling the Boolean monotone calculus and show that similar $\epsilon$-sensitive lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits imply lower bounds on proof-size in the system.</summary>

    <title>TR19-033 |  Counting basic-irreducible factors mod $p^k$ in deterministic poly-time and $p$-adic applications | 

	Ashish Dwivedi,

	Nitin Saxena</title>
    <summary>Finding an irreducible factor, of a polynomial $f(x)$ modulo a prime $p$, is not known to be in deterministic polynomial time. Though there is such a classical algorithm that {\em counts} the number of irreducible factors of $f\bmod p$. We can ask the same question modulo prime-powers $p^k$. The irreducible factors of $f\bmod p^k$ blow up exponentially in number; making it hard to describe them. Can we count  those irreducible factors $\bmod~p^k$ that remain irreducible mod $p$? These are called {\em basic-irreducible}. A simple example is in $f=x^2+px \bmod p^2$; it has $p$ many basic-irreducible factors. Also note that, $x^2+p \bmod p^2$ is irreducible but not basic-irreducible!

We give an algorithm to count the number of basic-irreducible factors of $f\bmod p^k$ in deterministic poly($\deg(f),k\log p$)-time. This solves the open questions posed in (Cheng et al, ANTS'18 \&amp; Kopp et al, Math.Comp.'19). In particular, we are counting roots $\bmod\ p^k$; which gives the first deterministic poly-time algorithm to compute Igusa zeta function of $f$. Also, our algorithm efficiently partitions the set of all basic-irreducible factors (possibly exponential) into merely $\deg(f)$-many disjoint sets, using a compact tree data structure and {\em split} ideals.</summary>
