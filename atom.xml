long time and has applications in different areas of Mathematics and Computer
Science. One of the well-known measures to evaluate the uniformity of a given
distribution is Discrepancy, which assesses the difference between the Uniform
distribution and the empirical distribution given by putting mass points at the
points of the given set. While Discrepancy is very useful to measure
uniformity, it is computationally challenging to be calculated accurately. We
introduce the concept of directed Discrepancy based on which we have developed
an algorithm, called Directional Discrepancy, that can offer accurate
approximation for the cap Discrepancy of a finite set distributed on the unit
Sphere, $\mathbb{S}^2.$ We also analyze the time complexity of the Directional
Discrepancy algorithm precisely; and practically evaluate its capacity by
calculating the Cap Discrepancy of a specific distribution, Polar Coordinates,
which aims to distribute points uniformly on the Sphere.

set---describing a graph topology which is subject to discrete changes over
time. A $\Delta$-temporal matching $M$ is a set of time edges $(e,t)$ (an edge
$e$ paired up with a point in time $t$) such that for all distinct time edges
$(e,t),(e',t') \in M$ we have that $e$ and $e'$ do not share an endpoint, or
the time-labels $t$ and $t'$ are at least $\Delta$ time units apart. Mertzios
et al. [STACS~'20] provided a $2^{O(\Delta\nu)}\cdot |{\mathcal
G}|^{O(1)}$-time algorithm to compute the maximum size of $\Delta$-temporal
matching in a temporal graph $\mathcal G$, where $|\mathcal G|$ denotes the
size of $\mathcal G$, and $\nu$ is the $\Delta$-vertex cover number of
$\mathcal G$. The $\Delta$-vertex cover number is the minimum number of
vertices which are needed to hit (or cover) all edges in any $\Delta$
consecutive layers of the temporal graph. We show an improved algorithm to
compute a $\Delta$-temporal matching of maximum size with a running time of
$\Delta^{O(\nu)}\cdot |\mathcal G|$ and hence provide an exponential speedup in
terms of $\Delta$.

fundamental problem with many applications. As computations on dense graphs can
be prohibitively expensive, and it is preferable to perform the computations on
a sparse skeleton of the given graph that roughly preserves the shortest paths
information. Spanners and emulators serve this purpose. This paper develops
fast dynamic algorithms for sparse spanner and emulator maintenance and
provides evidence from fine-grained complexity that these algorithms are tight.
</p>
<p>Under the popular OMv conjecture, we show that there can be no decremental or
incremental algorithm that maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge (purely additive)
$+n^{\delta}$-emulator for any $\delta&lt;1/2$ with arbitrary polynomial
preprocessing time and total update time $m^{1+o(1)}$. Also, under the
Combinatorial $k$-Clique hypothesis, any fully dynamic combinatorial algorithm
that maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge $(1+\epsilon,n^{o(1)})$-spanner or emulator
must either have preprocessing time $mn^{1-o(1)}$ or amortized update time
$m^{1-o(1)}$. Both of our conditional lower bounds are tight.
</p>
<p>As the above fully dynamic lower bound only applies to combinatorial
algorithms, we also develop an algebraic spanner algorithm that improves over
the $m^{1-o(1)}$ update time for dense graphs. For any constant $\epsilon\in
(0,1]$, there is a fully dynamic algorithm with worst-case update time
$O(n^{1.529})$ that whp maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge
$(1+\epsilon,n^{o(1)})$-spanner.
</p>
<p>Our new algebraic techniques and spanner algorithms allow us to also obtain
(1) a new fully dynamic algorithm for All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) with
update and path query time $O(n^{1.9})$; (2) a fully dynamic
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate APSP algorithm with update time $O(n^{1.529})$; (3)
a fully dynamic algorithm for near-$2$-approximate Steiner tree maintenance.

    <title>Towards and Ethical Framework in the Complex Digital Era</title>

communities of practice. The digital revolution enabled by AI and Data is
bringing ethical wicked problems in the crossroads of technology and behavior.
However, the need of a comprehensive and constructive ethical framework is
emerging as digital platforms connect us globally. The unequal structure of the
global system makes that dynamic changes and systemic problems impact more on
those that are most vulnerable. Ethical frameworks based only on the
individual-level are not longer sufficient. A new ethical vision must comprise
the understanding of the scales and complex interconnections of social systems.
Many of these systems are internally fragile and very sensitive to external
factors and threats, which turns into unethical situations that require
systemic solutions. The high scale nature of digital technology that expands
globally has also an impact at the individual level having the risk to make
humans beings more homogeneous, predictable and ultimately controllable. To
preserve the core of humanity ethic must take a stand to preserve and keep
promoting individual rights and uniqueness and cultural heterogeneity tackling
the negative trends and impact of digitalization. Only combining human-centered
and collectiveness-oriented digital development it will be possible to
construct new social models and human-machine interactions that are ethical.
This vision requires science to enhance ethical frameworks and principles with
the actionable insights of relationships and properties of the social systems
that may not be evident and need to be quantified and understood to be solved.
Artificial Intelligence is both a risk and and opportunity for an ethical
development, thus we need a conceptual construct that drives towards a better
digitalizated world.

multivariate Gaussians under the constraint of approximate differential
privacy. These are the first finite sample upper bounds for general Gaussians
which do not impose restrictions on the parameters of the distribution. Our
bounds are near-optimal in the case when the covariance is known to be the
identity, and conjectured to be near-optimal in the general case. From a
technical standpoint, we provide analytic tools for arguing the existence of
global "locally small" covers from local covers of the space. These are
exploited using modifications of recent techniques for differentially private
hypothesis selection. Our techniques may prove useful for privately learning
other distribution classes which do not possess a finite cover.

Traditional
graph algorithms tuned for 32- or 64-bit based memory accesses will be
inefficient on architectures with 512-bit wide (or larger) instruction units
that are already present in the Intel Knights Landing (KNL) manycore CPU.
Anticipating this shift, we propose SlimSell: a vectorizable graph
representation to accelerate Breadth-First Search (BFS) based on sparse-matrix
dense-vector (SpMV) products. SlimSell extends and combines the
state-of-the-art SIMD-friendly Sell-C-sigma matrix storage format with
tropical, real, boolean, and sel-max semiring operations. The resulting design
reduces the necessary storage (by up to 50%) and thus pressure on the memory
subsystem. We augment SlimSell with the SlimWork and SlimChunk schemes that
reduce the amount of work and improve load balance, further accelerating BFS.
We evaluate all the schemes on Intel Haswell multicore CPUs, the
state-of-the-art Intel Xeon Phi KNL manycore CPUs, and NVIDIA Tesla GPUs. Our
experiments indicate which semiring offers highest speedups for BFS and
illustrate that SlimSell accelerates a tuned Graph500 BFS code by up to 33%.
This work shows that vectorization can secure high-performance in BFS based on
SpMV products; the proposed principles and designs can be extended to other
graph algorithms.

    <title>Sorting Short Keys in Circuits of Size o(n log n)</title>

elements, where each element is described with a $k$-bit comparison-key and a
$w$-bit payload. A long-standing open problem is whether there exist $(k + w)
\cdot o(n \log n)$-sized boolean circuits for sorting. We show that one can
overcome the $n\log n$ barrier when the keys to be sorted are short.
Specifically, we prove that there is a circuit with $(k + w) \cdot O(n k) \cdot
\poly(\log^*n - \log^* (w + k))$ boolean gates capable of sorting any input
array containing $n$ elements, each described with a $k$-bit key and a $w$-bit
payload. Therefore, if the keys to be sorted are short, say, $k &lt; o(\log n)$,
our result is asymptotically better than the classical AKS sorting network
(ignoring $\poly\log^*$ terms); and we also overcome the $n \log n$ barrier in
such cases. Such a result might be surprising initially because it is long
known that comparator-based techniques must incur $\Omega(n \log n)$ comparator
gates even when the keys to be sorted are only $1$-bit long (e.g., see Knuth's
"Art of Programming" textbook). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to achieve non-trivial results for sorting circuits using non-comparison-based
techniques. We also show that if the Li-Li network coding conjecture is true,
our upper bound is optimal, barring $\poly\log^*$ terms, for every $k$ as long
as $k = O(\log n)$.

    <title>Evaluating the Cost of Atomic Operations on Modern Architectures</title>

(FAA) are ubiquitous in parallel programming. Yet, performance tradeoffs
between these operations and various characteristics of such systems, such as
the structure of caches, are unclear and have not been thoroughly analyzed. In
this paper we establish an evaluation methodology, develop a performance model,
and present a set of detailed benchmarks for latency and bandwidth of different
atomics. We consider various state-of-the-art x86 architectures: Intel Haswell,
Xeon Phi, Ivy Bridge, and AMD Bulldozer. The results unveil surprising
performance relationships between the considered atomics and architectural
properties such as the coherence state of the accessed cache lines. One key
finding is that all the tested atomics have comparable latency and bandwidth
even if they are characterized by different consensus numbers. Another insight
is that the hardware implementation of atomics prevents any instruction-level
parallelism even if there are no dependencies between the issued operations.
Finally, we discuss solutions to the discovered performance issues in the
analyzed architectures. Our analysis enables simpler and more effective
parallel programming and accelerates data processing on various architectures
deployed in both off-the-shelf machines and large compute systems.

    <title>GAMesh: Guided and Augmented Meshing for Deep Point Networks</title>

GAMesh, which uses a mesh prior to generate a surface for the output points of
a point network. By projecting the output points onto this prior and
simplifying the resulting mesh, GAMesh ensures a surface with the same topology
as the mesh prior but whose geometric fidelity is controlled by the point
network. This makes GAMesh independent of both the density and distribution of
the output points, a common artifact in traditional surface reconstruction
algorithms. We show that such a separation of geometry from topology can have
several advantages especially in single-view shape prediction, fair evaluation
of point networks and reconstructing surfaces for networks which output sparse
point clouds. We further show that by training point networks with GAMesh, we
can directly optimize the vertex positions to generate adaptive meshes with
arbitrary topologies.

    <title>Hedging in games: Faster convergence of external and swap regrets</title>

optimistic variant to play an $n$-action game repeatedly for $T$ rounds.
</p>
<p>1) For two-player games, we show that the regret of optimistic Hedge decays
at $\tilde{O}( 1/T ^{5/6} )$, improving the previous bound $O(1/T^{3/4})$ by
Syrgkanis, Agarwal, Luo and Schapire (NIPS'15)
</p>
<p>2) In contrast, we show that the convergence rate of vanilla Hedge is no
better than $\tilde{\Omega}(1/ \sqrt{T})$, addressing an open question posted
in Syrgkanis, Agarwal, Luo and Schapire (NIPS'15).
</p>
<p>For general m-player games, we show that the swap regret of each player
decays at rate $\tilde{O}(m^{1/2} (n/T)^{3/4})$ when they combine optimistic
Hedge with the classical external-to-internal reduction of Blum and Mansour
(JMLR'07). The algorithm can also be modified to achieve the same rate against
itself and a rate of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n/T})$ against adversaries. Via standard
connections, our upper bounds also imply faster convergence to coarse
correlated equilibria in two-player games and to correlated equilibria in
multiplayer games.

    <title>On Near-Linear-Time Algorithms for Dense Subset Sum</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1603152000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bringmann:Karl.html">Karl Bringmann</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wellnitz:Philip.html">Philip Wellnitz</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09096">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the Subset Sum problem we are given a set of $n$ positive integers $X$ and
a target $t$ and are asked whether some subset of $X$ sums to $t$. Natural
parameters for this problem that have been studied in the literature are $n$
and $t$ as well as the maximum input number $\rm{mx}_X$ and the sum of all
input numbers $\Sigma_X$. In this paper we study the dense case of Subset Sum,
where all these parameters are polynomial in $n$. In this regime, standard
pseudo-polynomial algorithms solve Subset Sum in polynomial time $n^{O(1)}$.
</p>
<p>Our main question is: When can dense Subset Sum be solved in near-linear time
$\tilde{O}(n)$? We provide an essentially complete dichotomy by designing
improved algorithms and proving conditional lower bounds, thereby determining
essentially all settings of the parameters $n,t,\rm{mx}_X,\Sigma_X$ for which
dense Subset Sum is in time $\tilde{O}(n)$. For notational convenience we
assume without loss of generality that $t \ge \rm{mx}_X$ (as larger numbers can
be ignored) and $t \le \Sigma_X/2$ (using symmetry). Then our dichotomy reads
as follows:
</p>
<p>- By reviving and improving an additive-combinatorics-based approach by Galil
and Margalit [SICOMP'91], we show that Subset Sum is in near-linear time
$\tilde{O}(n)$ if $t \gg \rm{mx}_X \Sigma_X/n^2$.
</p>
<p>- We prove a matching conditional lower bound: If Subset Sum is in
near-linear time for any setting with $t \ll \rm{mx}_X \Sigma_X/n^2$, then the
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis and the Strong k-Sum Hypothesis fail.
</p>
<p>We also generalize our algorithm from sets to multi-sets, albeit with
non-matching upper and lower bounds.

y) = f(x \land y)$ denote the AND-function of $f$, where $x \land y$ denotes
bit-wise AND. We study the deterministic communication complexity of $f_\land$
and show that, up to a $\log n$ factor, it is bounded by a polynomial in the
logarithm of the real rank of the communication matrix of $f_\land$. This comes
within a $\log n$ factor of establishing the log-rank conjecturefor
AND-functions with no assumptions on $f$. Our result stands in contrast with
previous results on special cases of the log-rank conjecture, which needed
significant restrictions on $f$ such as monotonicity or low
$\mathbb{F}_2$-degree. Our techniques can also be used to prove (within a $\log
n$ factor) a lifting theorem for AND-functions, stating that the deterministic
communication complexity of $f_\land$ is polynomially-related to the
AND-decision tree complexity of $f$.
</p>
<p>The results rely on a new structural result regarding boolean functions
$f:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$ with a sparse polynomial representation, which may
be of independent interest. We show that if the polynomial computing $f$ has
few monomials then the set system of the monomials has a small hitting set, of
size poly-logarithmic in its sparsity. We also establish extensions of this
result to multi-linear polynomials $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ with a larger
range.

    <title>Lazy Search Trees</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1603152000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sandlund:Bryce.html">Bryce Sandlund</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wild:Sebastian.html">Sebastian Wild</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08840">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We introduce the lazy search tree data structure. The lazy search tree is a
comparison-based data structure on the pointer machine that supports
order-based operations such as rank, select, membership, predecessor,
successor, minimum, and maximum while providing dynamic operations insert,
delete, change-key, split, and merge. We analyze the performance of our data
structure based on a partition of current elements into a set of gaps
$\{\Delta_i\}$ based on rank. A query falls into a particular gap and splits
the gap into two new gaps at a rank $r$ associated with the query operation. If
we define $B = \sum_i |\Delta_i| \log_2(n/|\Delta_i|)$, our performance over a
sequence of $n$ insertions and $q$ distinct queries is $O(B + \min(n \log \log
n, n \log q))$. We show $B$ is a lower bound.
</p>
<p>Effectively, we reduce the insertion time of binary search trees from
$\Theta(\log n)$ to $O(\min(\log(n/|\Delta_i|) + \log \log |\Delta_i|, \; \log
q))$, where $\Delta_i$ is the gap in which the inserted element falls. Over a
sequence of $n$ insertions and $q$ queries, a time bound of $O(n \log q + q
\log n)$ holds; better bounds are possible when queries are non-uniformly
distributed. As an extreme case of non-uniformity, if all queries are for the
minimum element, the lazy search tree performs as a priority queue with $O(\log
\log n)$ time insert and decrease-key operations. The same data structure
supports queries for any rank, interpolating between binary search trees and
efficient priority queues.
</p>
<p>Lazy search trees can be implemented to operate mostly on arrays, requiring
only $O(\min(q, n))$ pointers. Via direct reduction, our data structure also
supports the efficient access theorems of the splay tree, providing a powerful
data structure for non-uniform element access, both when the number of accesses
is small and large.

    <title>On the Hardness of Average-case k-SUM</title>

classical $k$-SUM problem. A $k$-SUM instance is a collection of $m$ integers,
and the goal of the $k$-SUM problem is to find a subset of $k$ elements that
sums to $0$. In the average-case version, the $m$ elements are chosen uniformly
at random from some interval $[-u,u]$.
</p>
<p>We consider the total setting where $m$ is sufficiently large (with respect
to $u$ and $k$), so that we are guaranteed (with high probability) that
solutions must exist. Much of the appeal of $k$-SUM, in particular connections
to problems in computational geometry, extends to the total setting.
</p>
<p>The best known algorithm in the average-case total setting is due to Wagner
(following the approach of Blum-Kalai-Wasserman), and achieves a run-time of
$u^{O(1/\log k)}$, which beats the known (conditional) lower bounds for
worst-case $k$-SUM. One could wonder whether this can be improved even further.
But, we show a matching average-case lower-bound, by showing a reduction from
worst-case lattice problems, thus introducing a new family of techniques into
the field of fine-grained complexity. In particular, we show that any algorithm
solving average-case $k$-SUM on $m$ elements in time $u^{o(1/\log k)}$ will
give a super-polynomial improvement in the complexity of algorithms for lattice
problems.

measuring these widths typically requires extensive manual work. Computer
vision techniques provide promising directions towards the automation of tree
ring detection, but most automated methods still require a substantial amount
of user interaction to obtain high accuracy. We perform analysis on 3D X-ray CT
images of a cross-section of a tree trunk, known as a tree disk. We present
novel automated methods for locating the pith (center) of a tree disk, and ring
boundaries. Our methods use a combination of standard image processing
techniques and tools from topological data analysis. We evaluate the efficacy
of our method for two different CT scans by comparing its results to manually
located rings and centers and show that it is better than current automatic
methods in terms of correctly counting each ring and its location. Our methods
have several parameters, which we optimize experimentally by minimizing edit
distances to the manually obtained locations.

Mujica-Parodi</a>, Steven S. Skiena <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08676">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Physical or geographic location proves to be an important feature in many
data science models, because many diverse natural and social phenomenon have a
spatial component. Spatial autocorrelation measures the extent to which locally
adjacent observations of the same phenomenon are correlated. Although
statistics like Moran's $I$ and Geary's $C$ are widely used to measure spatial
autocorrelation, they are slow: all popular methods run in $\Omega(n^2)$ time,
rendering them unusable for large data sets, or long time-courses with moderate
numbers of points. We propose a new $S_A$ statistic based on the notion that
the variance observed when merging pairs of nearby clusters should increase
slowly for spatially autocorrelated variables. We give a linear-time algorithm
to calculate $S_A$ for a variable with an input agglomeration order (available
at https://github.com/aamgalan/spatial_autocorrelation). For a typical dataset
of $n \approx 63,000$ points, our $S_A$ autocorrelation measure can be computed
in 1 second, versus 2 hours or more for Moran's $I$ and Geary's $C$. Through
simulation studies, we demonstrate that $S_A$ identifies spatial correlations
in variables generated with spatially-dependent model half an order of
magnitude earlier than either Moran's $I$ or Geary's $C$. Finally, we prove
several theoretical properties of $S_A$: namely that it behaves as a true
correlation statistic, and is invariant under addition or multiplication by a
constant.

such as ID3, C4.5, and CART. Our algorithm achieves provable guarantees for all
target functions $f: \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}$ with respect to the uniform
distribution, circumventing impossibility results showing that existing
heuristics fare poorly even for simple target functions. The crux of our
extension is a new splitting criterion that takes into account the correlations
between $f$ and small subsets of its attributes. The splitting criteria of
existing heuristics (e.g. Gini impurity and information gain), in contrast, are
based solely on the correlations between $f$ and its individual attributes.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm satisfies the following guarantee: for all target functions $f
: \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}$, sizes $s\in \mathbb{N}$, and error parameters
$\epsilon$, it constructs a decision tree of size $s^{\tilde{O}((\log
s)^2/\epsilon^2)}$ that achieves error $\le O(\mathsf{opt}_s) + \epsilon$,
where $\mathsf{opt}_s$ denotes the error of the optimal size $s$ decision tree.
A key technical notion that drives our analysis is the noise stability of $f$,
a well-studied smoothness measure.

    <title>Improving Schroeppel and Shamir's Algorithm for Subset Sum via Orthogonal Vectors</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1603152000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nederlof:Jesper.html">Jesper Nederlof</a>, Karol Węgrzycki <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08576">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present an $\mathcal{O}^\star(2^{0.5n})$ time and
$\mathcal{O}^\star(2^{0.249999n})$ space randomized algorithm for solving
worst-case Subset Sum instances with $n$ integers. This is the first
improvement over the long-standing $\mathcal{O}^\star(2^{n/2})$ time and
$\mathcal{O}^\star(2^{n/4})$ space algorithm due to Schroeppel and Shamir (FOCS
1979).
</p>
<p>We breach this gap in two steps: (1) We present a space efficient reduction
to the Orthogonal Vectors Problem (OV), one of the most central problem in
Fine-Grained Complexity. The reduction is established via an intricate
combination of the method of Schroeppel and Shamir, and the representation
technique introduced by Howgrave-Graham and Joux (EUROCRYPT 2010) for designing
Subset Sum algorithms for the average case regime. (2) We provide an algorithm
for OV that detects an orthogonal pair among $N$ given vectors in $\{0,1\}^d$
with support size $d/4$ in time $\tilde{O}(N\cdot2^d/\binom{d}{d/4})$. Our
algorithm for OV is based on and refines the representative families framework
developed by Fomin, Lokshtanov, Panolan and Saurabh (J. ACM 2016).
</p>
<p>Our reduction uncovers a curious tight relation between Subset Sum and OV,
because any improvement of our algorithm for OV would imply an improvement over
the runtime of Schroeppel and Shamir, which is also a long standing open
problem.

    <title>The graphs of stably matchable pairs</title>
    <summary>The stable matching problem takes as input the preferences from two groups of agents (most famously medical students and supervisors of internships), and pairs up agents from each group in a way that encourages everyone to play along: no pair of agents would rather go their own way together than take the pairings they were both given. A solution can always be found by the Gale–Shapley algorithm, but there are generally many solutions, described by the lattice of stable matchings. Some pairs of agents are included in at least one stable matching, while some other pairs are never matched. In this way, each instance of stable matchings gives rise to a graph, the graph of stably matchable pairs. This graph is the subject and title of my latest preprint, arXiv:2010.09230, which asks: Which graphs can arise this way? How hard is it to recognize these graphs, and infer a stable matching instance that might have generated them? How does the graph structure relate to the lattice structure?</summary>

How hard is it to recognize these graphs, and infer a stable matching instance that might have generated them? How does the graph structure relate to the lattice structure?</p>

<p>For some answers, see the preprint. One detail is connected to <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/10/18/polyhedra-without-disjoint.html">my previous post, on polyhedra with no two disjoint faces</a> (even though there are no polyhedra in the new preprint): the (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free graphs discussed there come up in proving an equivalence between outerplanar graphs of stably matchable pairs and lattices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_problem">closures</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytree">oriented trees</a>. Instead of providing any technical details of any the other results in the paper, though, I thought it would be more fun to show a few visual highlights.</p>

<p>The following figure shows a cute mirror-inversion trick (probably already known, although I don’t know where or by whom) for embedding an arbitrary bipartite graph as an induced subgraph of a regular bipartite graph. I use it to show that graphs of stably matchable pairs have no forbidden induced subgraphs:</p>

<p>This next one depicts a combinatorial description of a stable matching instance having a \(6\times 5\) grid as its graph, in terms of the top and bottom matchings in the lattice of matchings, the “rotations” that can be used to move between matchings in this lattice, and a partial order on the rotations. For what I was doing in this paper, these rotation systems were much more convenient to work with than preferences.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Rotation system describing a system of stable matchings having a 6x5 grid as its graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/5x6.svg" width="80%"/></p>

<p>All the main ideas for a proof of NP-completeness of recognizing these graphs, by reduction from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not-all-equal_3-satisfiability">not-all-equal 3-satisfiability</a>, are visible in the next picture. The proof now in the paper is significantly more complicated, though, because the construction in this image produces nonplanar graphs but I wanted a proof that would also apply in the planar case.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="NP-completeness reduction from NAE3SAT to recognizing graphs of stably matchable pairs" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/nae3sat-to-matching.svg"/></p>

<p>The last one shows a sparse graph that can be represented as a graph of stably-matching pairs (because it’s outerplanar, bipartite, and biconnected) but has a high-degree vertex. If we tried to test whether it could be realized by doing a brute-force search over preference systems, the time would be factorial in the degree, but my preprint provides faster algorithms that are only singly exponential in the number of edges.</p>

    <title>Nature vs Nurture close to my birthday</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> Since I was born on Oct 1, 1960 (that's not true---if I posted  my real birthday I might get my  identity stolen), I will do a nature vs nurture post based on my life, which seems less likely to offend then doing it on someone else's life. I'll just rattle off some random points on Nature vs Nurture.</p><p>1) Is it plausible that I was born with some math talent? Is plausible that I was born with some talent to understand the polynomial van der Warden theorem? What is the granularity of nature-given or nurture-given abilities?</p><p>2) My dad was a HS English teacher and later Vice-Principal. My mom taught English at a Community college. Readers of the blog might think, given my spelling and grammar, that I was switched at birth. My mom says (jokingly?) that I was switched at birth since she thinks I am good at math.</p><p>a) I am not THAT good at math. Also see next point.</p><p>b) While there are some math families, there are not many. See my post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/02/baseball-families-and-math-families.html">here</a>.</p><p>c) I think being raised in an intellectual atmosphere by two EDUCATORS who had the money to send me to college and allowed me the freedom to study what I wanted to  is far more important than the rather incidental matter of what field I studied.</p><p>d) Since my parents never went into math or the sciences it is very hard to tell  if they were `good at math' or even what that means.</p><p>3) There were early signs I was INTERESTED in math, though not that I was good at it.</p><p>a) In fourth grade I wanted to know how many SECONDS were in a century so I spend some time figuring it out on paper. Did I get the right answer?  I forgot about leap years.</p><p>b) I was either a beneficiary of, or a victim of, THE NEW MATH. So I learned about comm. and assoc. operations in 8th grade. We were asked to come up with our own operations. I wanted to come up with an operation that was comm. but not assoc. I did! Today I would write it as f(x,y) = |x-y|. This is the earliest I can think of where I made up a nice math problem. Might have been the last time I made up a nice math problem AND solved it without help. </p><p>c) In 10th grade I took some Martin Gardner books out of the library. The first theorem I learned not-in-school was that a graph is Eulerian iff every vertex has even degree. I read the chapter on Soma cubes and bought a set. (Soma cubes are explained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_cube">here</a>.) </p><p>d) I had a talent (nature?) at Soma Cubes.  I did every puzzle in the book in a week, diagrammed them, and even understood (on some level) the proofs that some could not be done. Oddly I am NOT good at 3-dim geom. Or even 2-dim geom.  For 1-dim I hold my own!</p><p>e) Throughout my childhood I noticed odd logic and odd math things that were said: </p><p>``Here at WCOZ (a radio station) we have an AXIOM, that's like a saying man, that weekends should be SEVEN DAYS LONG'' (Unless that axiom resolves CH, I don't think it should be assumed.) </p><p>``To PROVE we have the lowest prices in town we will give you a free camera!'' (how does that prove anything?) </p><p>``This margarine tastes JUST LIKE BUTTER'' (Okay-- so why not just buy butter?)</p><p>e) In 9th grade when I learned the quadratic formula I re-derived it once-a-month since I though it was important that one can prove such things.  I heard (not sure from where) that there was no 5th degree equation. At that very moment I told my parents:</p><p><i>I am going to major in math so I can find out why there is no 5th degree equation.</i></p><p>There are worse things for parents to hear from their children. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/a-proof-that-227-pi-0-and-more.html">here</a> for dad's reaction. </p><p>f) When I learned that the earth's orbit around the sun is an ellipse and that the earth was one of the foci, I wondered where the other foci is and if its important. I still wonder about this one. Google has not helped me here, though perhaps I have not phrased the question properly. If you know the answer please leave a comment. </p><p>g) I also thought about The Ketchup problem and other problems, that I won't go into since I already blogged about them  <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/06/ketchup-problem.html">here</a></p><p>4) I was on the math team in high school, but wasn't very good at it. I WAS good at making up math team problems. I am now on the committee that makes up the Univ of MD HS math competition. I am still not good at solving the problems but good at making them up. </p><p>5) From 9th grade on before I would study for an exam by making up what I thought would be a good exam and doing that. Often my exam was a better test of knowledge than the exam given. In college I helped people in Math and Physics by making up exams for them to work on as practice. </p><p>6) I was good at reading, understanding, and explaining papers. </p><p>7) I was never shy about asking for help. My curiosity exeeded by ego... by a lot!</p><p>8) Note that items 5,6, and 7 above do not mention SOLVING problems. The papers I have written are of three (overlapping) types:</p><p>a) I come up with the problem, make some inroads on it based on knowledge, and then have people cleverer (this is often) or with more knowledge (this is rarer) help me solve the problems.</p><p>b) I come up with the problem, and combine two things I know from other papers to solve it. </p><p>c) Someone else asks for my help on something and I have the knowledge needed. I can only recall one time where this lead to a paper. </p><p>NOTE- I do not think I have ever had a clever or new technique. CAVEAT: the diff between combining  known knowledge in new ways and having a clever or new technique is murky. </p><p>8) Over time these strengths and weaknesses have gotten more extreme. It has become a self-fulfilling prophecy where I spend A LOT of time making up problems without asking for help, but when I am trying to solve a problem I early on ask for help. Earlier than I should? Hard to know. </p><p>9) One aspect is `how good am I at math' But a diff angle is that I like to work on things that I KNOW are going to work out, so reading an article is better than trying to create new work. This could be a psychological thing. But is that nature or nurture?  </p><p>10) Could I be a better problem solver? Probably. Could I be a MUCH better problem solver? NO. Could I have been a better problem solver  I did more work on that angle when I was younger? Who knows? </p><p>11) Back to the Quintic: I had the following thought in ninth grade, though I could not possibly have expressed it: The question of, given a problem, how hard is it, upper and lower bounds, is a fundamental one that is worth a lifetime of study. As such my interest in complexity theory and recursion theory goes back to ninth grade or even further. My interest in Ramsey Theory for its own sake (and not in the service of complexity theory) is much more recent and does not quite fit into my narrative. But HEY- real life does not have as well defined narratives as fiction does. </p><p>12) Timing and Luck: IF I had been in grad student at a slight diff time I can imagine doing work on  algorithmic  Galois theory. <a href="https://singer.math.ncsu.edu/Algorithmic_slides.pdf">Here</a>  is a talk on Algorithmic  Galois theory. Note that one of the earliest results is by Landau and Miller from 1985---I had a course from Miller on Alg. Group Theory in 1982. This is NOT a wistful `What might have been' thought. Maybe I would have sucked at it, so its just as well I ended up doing recursion theory, then Ramsey theory, then recursion-theoretic Ramsey Theory, then muffins. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><div><br/></div></div>

<p>(See also <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08508">paper on arxiv</a></em>,  <a href="https://gitlab.com/harvard-machine-learning/rationality-generalization">code on gitlab</a>,  <a href="https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/10-28-2020-new-technologies-in-mathematics-seminar/">upcoming talk by Yamini&amp;Boaz</a>,  <a href="https://youtu.be/89ixhju1hJ0">video of past talk</a>)</p>



<p>A central <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/11/15/puzzles-of-modern-machine-learning/">puzzle</a> of deep learning is the question of <em>generalization</em>. In other words, what can we deduce from the <em>training performance</em> of a neural network about its <em>test performance</em> on <em>fresh unseen examples</em>. An <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530">influential paper</a> of Zhang, Bengio, Hardt, Recht, and Vinyals showed that the answer could be “nothing at all.” </p>



<p>Zhang et al. gave examples where modern deep neural networks achieve 100% accuracy on classifying their training data, but their performance on unseen data may be no better than chance. Therefore we cannot give meaningful guarantees for deep learning using traditional “generalization bounds” that bound the difference between test and train performance by some quantity that tends to zero as the number of datapoints <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> increases. This is why (to quote their title), Zhang et al. claimed that <strong>“understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization”</strong>.</p>



<p>But what if the issue isn’t that we’ve been doing generalization bounds wrong, but rather that we’ve been doing deep learning (or more accurately, supervised deep learning) wrong?</p>



<h3>Self Supervised + Simple fit (SSS) learning</h3>



<p>To explain what we mean, let’s take a small detour to contrast “traditional” or “end-to-end” supervised learning with a different approach to supervised learning, which we’ll call here “Self-Supervised + Simple fit” or “SSS algorithms.” (While the name “SSS algorithms” is new, the approach itself has a <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-126-90_%28revised%29bw_ocr.pdf">long history</a> and has recently been used with great success in practice; our work gives no new methods—only new analysis.)</p>



<p>The classical or “end-to-end” approach for supervised learning can be phrased as <em>“ask and you shall receive”</em>. Given labeled data, you ask (i.e., run an optimizer) for a complex classifier (e.g., a deep neural net) that fits the data (i.e., outputs the given labels on the given data points) and hope that it will be successful on future, unseen, data points as well. End-to-end supervised learning achieves state-of-art results for many classification problems, particularly for computer vision datasets ImageNet and CIFAR-10.</p>



<p>However, end-to-end learning does not directly correspond to the way humans learn to recognize objects (see also <a href="https://youtu.be/7I0Qt7GALVk?t=2475">this talk of LeCun</a>). A baby may see millions of images in the first year of her life, but most of them do not come with explicit labels. After seeing those images, a baby can make future classifications using very few labeled examples. For example, it might be enough to show her once what is a dog and what is a cat for her to correctly classify future dogs and cats, even if they look quite different from these examples.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="End-to-end learning vs SSS algorithms." src="https://i.imgur.com/LXRaTQq.png"/><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Cartoon of end-to-end vs SSS learning </figure>



<p>In recent years, practitioners have proposed algorithms that are more similar to human learning than supervised learning. Such methods separate the process into two stages. In the <em>first stage</em>, we do <strong>representation learning</strong> whereby we use <em>unlabeled</em> data to learn a <em>representation</em>: a complex map (e.g., a deep neural net) mapping the inputs into some “representation space.” In the <em>second stage</em>, we fit a simple classifier (e.g., a linear threshold function) to the representation of the datapoints and the given labels. We call such algorithms <strong>“Self-Supervision + Simple fit”</strong> or <strong>SSS algorithms</strong>. (Note that, unlike other representation-learning based classifiers, the complex representation is “frozen” and not “fine-tuned” in the second stage, where only a simple classifier is used on top of it.)</p>



<p>While we don’t have a formal definition, a “good representation” should make downstream tasks easier, in the sense of allowing for fewer examples or simpler classifiers. We typically learn a representation via <strong>self supervision</strong> , whereby one finds a representation minimizing an objective function that intuitively requires some “insight” into the data. Approaches for self-supervision include reconstruction, where the objective involves recovering data points from partial information (e.g., recover missing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">words</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07379">pixels</a>), and <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709">contrastive learning</a></em>, where the objective is to find a representation that make similar points close and dissimilar points far (e.g., in Euclidean space).</p>



<p>SSS algorithms have been traditionally used in natural language processing, where unlabeled data is plentiful, but labeled data for a particular task is often scarce. But recently SSS algorithms were also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06162">used with great success</a> even for vision tasks such as ImageNet and CIFAR10 where <em>all data is labeled!</em> While SSS algorithms do not yet beat the state-of-art supervised learning algorithms, they do get <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029">pretty close</a>. SSS algorithms also have other practical advantages over “end-to-end supervised learning”: they can make use of unlabeled data, the representation could be useful for non-classification tasks, and may have improved out of distribution performance. There has also been recent theoretical analysis of contrastive and reconstruction learning under certain statistical assumptions (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09229">Arora et al</a> and  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01064">Lee et al</a>).</p>



<h3>The generalization gap of SSS algorithms</h3>



<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08508">a recent paper</a>, we show that SSS algorithms not only work in practice, but work in theory too.</p>



<p>Specifically, we show that such algorithms have <strong>(1)</strong> small generalization gap and <strong>(2)</strong> we can <strong>prove</strong> (under reasonable assumptions) that their generalization gap tends to zero with the number of samples, with bounds that are meaningful for many modern classifiers on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We consider the setting where all data is labeled, and the <em>same dataset</em> is used for both learning the representation and fitting a simple classifier. The resulting classifier includes the overparameterized representation, and so we cannot simply apply “off the shelf” generalization bounds. Indeed, a priori it’s not at all clear that the generalization gap for SSS algorithms should be small.</p>



<p>To get some intuition for the generalization gap of SSS algorithms, consider the experiment where we inject some <em>label noise</em> into our distribution. That is, we corrupt an <img alt="\eta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\eta"/> fraction of the labels in both the train and test set, replacing them with random labels. Already in the noiseless case (<img alt="\eta=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta%3D0&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\eta=0"/>), the generalization gap of SSS algorithms is noticeably smaller than that of end-to-end supervised learning. As we increase the noise, the difference becomes starker. End-to-end supervised learning algorithms can always achieve 100% training accuracy, even as the test accuracy deteriorates, since they can “memorize” all the training labels they are given. In contrast, for SSS algorithms, both training and testing accuracy decrease together as we increase the noise, with training accuracy correlating with test performance. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/oct-18-2020-12-44-16.gif"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7826" src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/oct-18-2020-12-44-16.gif?w=812"/></a><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Generalization gap of end-to-end and SSS algorithms on CIFAR 10 as a function of noise (since there are 10 classes, 90% noisy samples corresponds to the Zhang et al experiment). See also <a href="https://plotly.com/~yaminibansal/1.embed" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">interactive version</a>.</figure>



<p/>



<p>Our main theoretical result is a formal proof of the above statement. To do so, we consider training with a small amount of label noise (say <img alt="\eta=5\%" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta%3D5%5C%25&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\eta=5\%"/>) and define the following quantities:</p>



<ul><li>The <strong>robustness gap</strong> is the amount by which training accuracy degrades between the “clean” (<img alt="\eta=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta%3D0&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\eta=0"/>) experiment and the noisy one. (In this and all other quantities, the training accuracy is measured with respect to the original uncorrupted labels.)</li><li>The <strong>memorization gap</strong> considers the noisy experiment (<img alt="\eta=5\%" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta%3D5%5C%25&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\eta=5\%"/>) and measures the amount by which performance on the corrupted data samples (where we received the wrong label) is worse than performance on the overall training set. If the algorithm can memorize all given labels, it will be perfectly wrong on the corrupted data samples, leading to a large memorization gap.</li><li>The <strong>rationality gap</strong> is the difference between the performance on the corrupted data samples and performance on unseen test examples. For example, if <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="x"/> is an image of a dog, then it measures the difference between the probability that <img alt="f(x)=\text{&quot;dog&quot;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3D%5Ctext%7B%22dog%22%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f(x)=\text{&quot;dog&quot;}"/> when <img alt="(x,\text{&quot;cat&quot;})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C%5Ctext%7B%22cat%22%7D%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(x,\text{&quot;cat&quot;})"/> is in the training set and the probability that <img alt="f(x)=\text{&quot;dog&quot;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3D%5Ctext%7B%22dog%22%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f(x)=\text{&quot;dog&quot;}"/> when <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="x"/> is not in the training set at all. Since intuitively, getting the wrong label should be worse than getting no label at all, we typically expect the rationality gap to be around zero or negative. Formally we define the rationality gap to the maximum between <img alt="0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="0"/> and the difference above, so it is always non-negative. We think of an algorithm with a significant positive rationality gap as “irrational.”</li></ul>



<p>By summing up the quantities above, we get the following inequality, which we call the <strong>RRM bound</strong></p>



<p><em><span class="has-inline-color" style="color: #0693e3;">generalization gap</span></em> <img alt="\leq" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleq&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\leq"/> <em><span class="has-inline-color" style="color: #00d084;">robustness gap</span></em> <img alt="+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="+"/> <em><span class="has-inline-color" style="color: #fcb900;">rationality gap</span></em> <img alt="+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="+"/> <em><span class="has-inline-color" style="color: #cf2e2e;">memorization gap</span></em></p>



<p>In practice, the <strong>robustness</strong> and <strong>rationality</strong> gaps are always small, both for end-to-end supervised algorithms (which have a large generalization gap), and for SSS algorithms (which have a small generalization gap). Thus the main contribution to the generalization gap comes from the <strong>memorization gap</strong>. Roughly speaking, our main result is the following:</p>



<p><em>If the complexity of the second-stage classifier of an SSS algorithm is smaller than the number of samples then the generalization gap is small.</em></p>



<p>See the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08508">paper</a> for the precise definition of “complexity,” but it is bounded by the number of bits that it takes to describe the simple classifier (no matter how complex is the representation used in the first stage). Our bound yields non-vacuous results in various practical settings; see the figures below or their <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/yaminibansal/streamlit-apps/main/figure1.py" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">interactive version</a>. </p>

<h3>What’s next</h3>



<p>There are still many open questions. Can we prove rigorous bounds on robustness and rationality? We have some preliminary results in the paper, but there is much room for improvement. Similarly, our complexity-based upper bound is far from tight at the moment, though the RRM bound itself is often surprisingly tight. Our work only applies to SSS algorithms, but people have the intuition that even end-to-end supervised learning algorithms implicitly learn a representation. So perhaps these tools can apply to such algorithms as well. As mentioned, we don’t yet have formal definitions for “good representations,” and the choice of the self-supervision task is still somewhat of a “black art” – can we find a more principled approach?</p></div>

    <title>Polyhedra without disjoint faces</title>
    <summary>Some research I’ve been doing led me to consider the (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free graphs. It’s not always easy to go from forbidden minors to the graphs that forbid them, or vice versa, but in this case I think there’s a nice characterization, which I’m posting here because it doesn’t fit into the research writeup: these are the graphs whose nontrivial triconnected components are \(K_5\), wheel graphs, or the graph \(K_5-e\) of the triangular bipyramid. The illustration below shows an example of a graph with this structure, with its nontrivial triconnected components colored red and yellow. There’s a simpler and more geometric way to say almost the same thing: the only convex polyhedra that do not have two vertex-disjoint faces are the pyramids and the triangular bipyramid.</summary>

<p>Some definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Here by the prism graph I mean the graph of the triangular prism. Any other prism has this one as a minor, and so is irrelevant as a forbidden minor. However, the pyramids in this structure can have any polygon as their base, corresponding to wheel graphs with arbitrarily many vertices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(K_{3,3}\) is a complete bipartite graph with three vertices on each side of its bipartition, famous as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_utilities_problem">utility graph</a>, one of the two forbidden minors for planar graphs. The triangular prism graph and \(K_{3,3}\) are the only two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_graph">3-regular graphs</a> with six vertices.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="The prism graph and K_{3,3}" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/prism-k33.svg"/></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The triconnected components of a graph are the graphs associated with the nodes of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPQR_tree">SPQR tree</a>, or of the SPQR trees of its biconnected components. These are cycle graphs, dipole multigraphs, or 3-connected graphs, and by “nontrivial” I mean the ones that are not cycles or dipoles. A triconnected component might not be a subgraph of the given graph, because it can have additional edges that correspond to paths in the given graph. For instance, subdividing the edges of any graph into paths, or more generally replacing edges by arbitrary series-parallel graphs, does not change its set of nontrivial triconnected components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m using “face” in the usual three-dimensional meaning, a two-dimensional subset of the boundary of the polyhedron. For higher-dimensional polytopes, “face” has a different meaning that also includes vertices and edges, and “facet” would be used to refer to the \((d-1)\)-dimensional faces, but using that terminology seems overly pedantic here.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Sketch of proof of the characterization of polyhedra without two disjoint faces: Consider any polyhedron without disjoint faces. If one face shares an edge with all the others, it’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halin_graph">Halin graph</a>, a graph formed by linking the leaves of a tree into a cycle; if the tree is a star, it’s a pyramid, and otherwise contracting all but one of the interior edges of the tree, and then all but four of the cycle edges, will produce a prism minor. In the remaining case, some two faces share only a vertex \(v\), which must have degree four or more. Each face that is disjoint from \(v\) must touch all that faces incident to \(v\), which can only happen when there is one face disjoint from \(v\) (a pyramid) or two faces disjoint from \(v\), neither of which has an edge disjoint from the other one (a bipyramid).</p>

<p>Sketch of a lemma that every convex polyhedron with two disjoint faces has a prism minor: glue a pyramidal cap into each of the two faces, producing a larger convex polyhedron which by either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinitz%27s_theorem">Steinitz’s theorem</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinski%27s_theorem">Balinski’s theorem</a> is necessarily 3-connected, and find three vertex-disjoint paths between the apexes of the attached pyramids. The parts of these paths outside the two glued pyramids, together with the boundaries of the two faces, form a subdivision of a prism.</p>

<p>Sketch of proof of the characterization of (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free graphs: The nontrivial triconnected components are exactly the maximal triconnected minors of the given graph, so if either of the two triconnected forbidden minors is to be found in the given graph, it will be found in one of the triconnected components. \(K_5\) and the triangular bipyramid are too small to have one of the forbidden minors. The only 3-connected minors of the pyramid graphs are smaller pyramids, obtained by contracting one of the cycle edges of the pyramid, so these also do not have a forbidden minor. Therefore the graphs of the stated form are all (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free.</p>

<p>In the other direction, suppose that a graph is (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free.
Each triconnected component is a minor, so it must also be (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free. What can these components look like? Forbidding \(K_{3,3}\) as a minor rules out nonplanar components other than \(K_5\), by a theorem of Wagner<sup id="fnref:wagner"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/10/18/polyhedra-without-disjoint.html#fn:wagner">1</a></sup> and Hall.<sup id="fnref:hall"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/10/18/polyhedra-without-disjoint.html#fn:hall">2</a></sup> So the remaining components that we need to consider are triconnected planar graphs with no prism minor. These cannot have two disjoint faces by the lemma, and so they can only be pyramids or the triangular bipyramid.</p>

    <title>TR20-155 |  Log-rank and lifting for AND-functions | 

	Sam McGuire, 

	Shachar Lovett, 

	Alexander Knop, 

	Weiqiang Yuan</title>
    <summary>Let $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$ be a boolean function, and let $f_\land (x, y) = f(x \land y)$ denote the AND-function of $f$, where $x \land y$ denotes bit-wise AND. We study the deterministic communication complexity of $f_\land$ and show that, up to a $\log n$ factor, it is bounded by a polynomial in the logarithm of the real rank of the communication matrix of $f_\land$. This comes within a $\log n$ factor of establishing the log-rank conjecture for AND-functions with no assumptions on $f$. Our result stands in contrast with previous results on special cases of the log-rank 
conjecture, which needed significant restrictions on $f$ such as monotonicity or low $\mathbb{F}_2$-degree. Our techniques can also be used to prove (within a $\log n$ factor) a lifting theorem for AND-functions, stating that the deterministic communication complexity of $f_\land$ is polynomially-related to the AND-decision tree complexity of $f$.

The results rely on a new structural result regarding boolean functions $f:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$ with a sparse polynomial representation, which may be of independent interest. We show that if the polynomial computing $f$ has few monomials then the set system of the monomials has a small hitting set, of size poly-logarithmic in its sparsity. We also establish extensions of this result to multi-linear polynomials $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ with a larger range.</summary>

Due to security concerns, <em>registration is required</em> to attend the interactive talk. (The link to the YouTube livestream will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk">on our  website</a> on the day of the talk, so people who did not sign up will still be able to  watch the talk live.)

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: We present a construction of an indistinguishability obfuscation scheme, whose security rests on the subexponential hardness of four well-founded assumptions. We show the existence of an indistinguishability Obfuscation scheme for all circuits assuming sub-exponential security of the following assumptions:</p>

<p class="wp-block-quote">The main technical novelty is the introduction and construction of a cryptographic pseudorandom generator that we call a Structured-Seed PRG (sPRG), assuming LPN over <img alt="\mathbb{Z}_p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D_p&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb{Z}_p"/> and PRGs in <img alt="\mathsf{NC}^0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BNC%7D%5E0&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathsf{NC}^0"/>. During the talk, I will discuss how structured seed PRGs have evolved from different notions of novel pseudorandom generators proposed in the past few years, and how an interplay between different areas of theoretical computer science played a major role in providing valuable insights leading to this work. Time permitting, I will go into the details of how to construct sPRGs. <br/><br/>Joint work with Huijia (Rachel) Lin and Amit Sahai</p></div>

What interests me is their <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shiratski/2242870712/">pentagonal tiles</a>. It’s not one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_tiling">15 monohedral pentagon tilings</a>: the tiles have two shapes, one forming half of a regular hexagon (all angles \(&gt; 60^\circ\)) and another surrounding the hexagons (sharp angle \(= 60^\circ\)).

    <p>Sometimes when I’ve been doing big literature searches on jstor (manually clicking on dozens of links because jstor’s search results don’t tell me which book is being reviewed, delayed by maybe a second or so per click so that I don’t get stopped by jstor’s anti-bot filters) I then get locked out of Google Scholar for a day or so on the same IP address because Google thinks I’m a bot. It doesn’t happen when I search Scholar directly. Has anyone else noticed this? Any idea how to avoid it? (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105037500352288970">\(\mathbb{M}\)</a>)</p>

The link is in Dutch but Google translate works well except at one point: the school’s name, “De Garve”, means “the sheaf”, and the article remarks that this is appropriate for a pattern that looks like ears of corn.</p>

    <title>50 Years of PBS</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) launched fifty years ago this month in the United States. The New York Times talks about its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/arts/television/pbs-50-anniversary.html">fifty reasons</a> how the network mattered. I'll throw in my thoughts.</p><p>I was just slightly too old for shows like Sesame Street, Electric Company, Mr. Rogers and Zoom, not that that stopped me from watching them. My kids grew up on Barney and Friends. My daughter even had a toy Barney that interacted with the show, which went <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/02/barney-evil-dinosaur.html">as well as you'd expect</a>. </p><p>PBS introduced me to those great British TV shows for young nerds like me including Monty Python and Doctor Who. I wasn't into Nova but did watch Carl Sagan's Cosmos religiously in high school.</p><p>My favorite PBS show was the American Experience, short documentaries about US culture. I remember learning about this history of Coney Island and the quiz show scandals before Robert Redford made a movie about it.</p><p>Siskel and Ebert got their start on PBS and became my go to source for movie reviews.</p><p>In 1987 PBS broadcasted Ivy League football games. One Saturday I sat down expecting to watch my alma mater and instead got supreme court hearings. Only on PBS could Cornell football get Borked.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My latest post on this blog was on December 30th 2019. It seems like a lifetime away. The rate at which paradigm shifting events have been happening in 2020 is staggering. And it might very well be that the worst of 2020 is ahead of us, especially for those of us currently in the USA. </p>
<p>When I started communicating online broadly (blog, twitter) I promised myself to keep it strictly about science (or very closely neighboring topics), so the few lines above is all I will say about the current worldwide situation.</p>
<p>In other news, as is evident from the 10 months hiatus in blogging, I have taken elsewhere (at least temporarily) my need for rapid communication about theorems that currently excite me. Namely to <a class="liinternal" href="https://www.youtube.com/sebastienbubeck">youtube</a>. Since the beginning of the pandemic I have been recording home videos of what would have been typically blog posts, with currently 5 such videos:</p>
<ol>
<li><a class="liinternal" href="https://youtu.be/uRarIjJGmhs">A law of robustness for neural networks</a> : I explain the conjecture we recently made that, for random data, any interpolating two-layers neural network must have its Lipschitz constant larger than the squareroot of the ratio between the size of the data set and the number of neurons in the network. This would prove that overparametrization is *necessary* for robustness.</li>
<li><a class="liinternal" href="https://youtu.be/U-XsUB69mvc">Provable limitations of kernel methods</a> : I give the proof by Zeyuan Allen-Zhu and Yuanzhi Li that there are simple noisy learning tasks where *no kernel* can perform well while simple two-steps procedures can learn.</li>
<li><a class="liinternal" href="https://youtu.be/6-GBDpe2kuI">Memorization with small neural networks</a> : I explain old (classical combinatorial) and new (NTK style) construction of optimally-sized interpolating two-layers neural networks.</li>
<li><a class="liinternal" href="https://youtu.be/HIwZH2C--nA">Coordination without communication</a> : This video is the only one in the current series where I don’t talk at all about neural networks. Specifically it is about the cooperative multiplayer multiarmed bandit problem. I explain the strategy we devised with Thomas Budzinski to solve this problem (for the stochastic version) without *any* collision at all between the players.</li>
<li><a class="liinternal" href="https://youtu.be/O84mcq7P_es">Randomized smoothing for certified robustness</a> : Finally, in the first video chronologically, I explain the only known technique for provable robustness guarantees in neural networks that can scale up to large models.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next video will be about basic properties of tensors, and how it can be used for smooth interpolation (in particular in the context of our law of robustness conjecture). After that, we will see, maybe more neural networks, maybe more bandits, maybe some non-convex optimization ….</p>
<p>Stay safe out there!</p><p/></div>

<p><em>[If you’re not American, or you’re American but a masochist who enjoys the current nightmare, this post won’t be relevant to you—sorry!]</em></p>



<p>Until recently, this blog had a tagline that included “HOLD THE NOVEMBER US ELECTION BY MAIL.”  So I thought I should warn readers that circumstances have changed in ways that have important practical implications over the next few weeks.  It’s no longer that we <em>don’t know</em> whether Trump and Pence will acknowledge a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">likely loss</a>—rather, it’s that <em>we know they won’t</em>.  They were repeatedly asked; we all heard their answers.</p>



<p>That means that the <em>best</em> case, the ideal scenario, is already without precedent in the country’s 240-year history.  It’s a president who never congratulates the winner, who refuses to meet him or coordinate a transfer of power, who skips the inauguration, and who’s basically dragged from the White House on January 20, screaming to his supporters (and continuing to scream until his dying breath) that the election was faked.</p>



<p>As I said, that banana-republic outcome is now the <em>best</em> case.  But it’s also plausible that Trump simply declares himself the winner on election night, because the mail-in votes, urban votes, yet-to-be-counted votes, or any other votes that trend the wrong way are fake; social media and the Murdoch press amplify this fantasy; Trump calls on Republican-controlled state legislatures to set aside the “rigged” results and appoint their own slates of electors; the legislatures dutifully comply; and the Supreme Court A-OKs it all.  If you think none of that could happen, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;fbclid=IwAR28w8ZJIZSlvqoOT-To3UWgMj4wVc9PkDA7Vbs60S_J7T0kOo1_RyVGe98">read this <em>Atlantic</em> article</a> from a few weeks ago, carefully to the end, and be more terrified than you’ve ever been in your life.  And don’t pretend that you know what would happen next.</p>



<p>I know, I know, I’m mentally ill, it’s Trump Derangement Syndrome, I see Nazis behind every corner just because they killed most of my relatives, a little global pandemic here and economic collapse there and riots and apocalyptic fires and resurgent fascism and I act as though it’s the whole world coming to an end.  A few months from now, after everything has gone swimmingly, this post will still be here and you can come back and tell me how crazy I was.  I accept that risk.</p>



<p>For now, though, the best chance to avert a catastrophe is for Trump not merely to lose, but <strong>lose in a landslide that’s already clear by election night</strong>.  Which means: as Michelle Obama <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/18/21373177/michelle-obama-dnc-2020-speech-voting-post-office">advised</a> already in August, put on your mask, brave the virus, and vote in person if you can—<em>especially</em> if you live in a state that’s in play, and that won’t start tallying mail-in ballots till after election day.  If your state allows it, and if early votes will be counted by election night (check this!), vote early, when the lines are shorter.  That’s what Dana and I did this morning; Texas <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/10/04/joe-biden-win-texas/">going blue</a> on election night would be one dramatic way to foreclose shenanigans.  If you can’t vote in person, or if your state counts mail-in ballots earlier, then vote by mail or drop-box, but <em>do it now</em>, so you have a chance to fix any problems well before Election Day.  (Note that, even in normal circumstances—which these aren’t—a substantial fraction of all mail-in ballots get rejected because of trivial errors.)  I welcome other tips in the comments, from the many readers more immersed in this stuff than I am.</p>



<p>And if this post helped spur you in any way, please say so in the comments.  It will improve my mood, thereby helping me finish my next post, which will be on the Continuum Hypothesis.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> It’s always fascinating to check my comments and see the missives from parallel universes, where Trump is a normal candidate who one might decide to vote for based on normal criteria, rather than what he himself has announced he is: a knife to the entire system that underlies such decisions.  For a view from <em>this</em> universe, see (e.g.) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02852-x?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=organic&amp;utm_campaign=NGMT_USG_JC01_GL_Nature&amp;fbclid=IwAR1tLfLbZwXPd6U3a8BnqxvvMxo3SUDPWxhQccXYz9BU9_dL8x8deY3_dRc">today’s <em>Nature</em> editorial</a>.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Another Update:</span></strong> If it allays anyone’s fears, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of pandemic preparedness when Dana and I went to vote.  It was in a huge, cavernous gym on the UT campus, the lines were very short, masks and 6ft distancing were strictly enforced, and finger-coverings and hand sanitizer were offered to everyone.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Unrelated Update (10/16):</span></strong> For those who are interested, here’s a <a href="https://mattasher.com/2020/10/16/scott-aaronson-on-the-hunt-for-real-randomness/">new podcast with me and Matt Asher</a>, where we talk about the use of quantum mechanics (especially Bell inequality violations) to generate certified random numbers.</p></div>

    <title>Hugh Woodin, Kurt Godel, Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson, Robert De Niro, David Frum, Tom Selleck: Do I care what they think? Should I?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> MATH:</p><p>My last <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/10/revisiting-continuum-hypothesis.html">post</a> on CH mentioned that Hugh Woodin used to think NOT(CH) but now thinks CH. In both cases his reasons have some math content to them. Also, note that Hugh Woodin seems to believe that CH somehow HAS an answer. Kurt Godel also thought CH HAS an answer. It has been said that he could have announced  his result that CH is consistent by saying  L is THE model, and the problem is now solved. </p><p>Should we care what Hugh Woodin and Kurt Godel think about CH?</p><p>YES- they have both studied the issue A LOT. If you think CH should have an answer, then surely you would care what they think. </p><p>NO-  CH has no answer so there opinions are no better than mine. If you think CH does not have an answer then you might think this; however, I think you should still be at least INTERESTED in what people who have thought about the problem A LOT have to say, even if you will disagree with them.</p><p>But with MATH there are people who clearly know more than you on topics you care about, so it is worth hearing what they have to say. </p><p>POLITICS:</p><p>Recently Dwayne THE ROCK Johnson (by Wikipedia: actor, producer, businessman, and former professional wrestler) ENDORSED Joe Biden. Should we care about his opinion? Maybe, if wrestling fans and former pro wrestler tend to be Republicans, so this may indicate a shift. I do not know if this is the case. </p><p>Robert De Niro was in favor of impeaching Donald Trump. He also said that Trump was like a Gangster. He would know because he was in the movie GOODFELLOWS and later THE IRISHMAN (about Jimmy Hoffa). To be fair I do not think he said that is how he would know. Even so, I don't think I care what he thinks, unless he has some specialized knowledge I do not know about. </p><p>David Frum is a republican who had a break with the party NOT over Donald Trump, but over Obamacare- which you may recall was originally a CONSERVATIVE response to Hillarycare by the Heritage Foundation.  He has a good article on this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/the-republican-waterloo/520833/">here</a>. Because he is an intelligent  republican in favor of Obamacare (or some version of it) he is worth listening to.</p><p>In POLITICS its trickier- who is worth listening to and why. For all I know, THE ROCK has made a detailed study of the Republican and Democratic platforms (actually this cannot be true since the Republicans did not have a platform this time). </p><p>COMMERCIALS:</p><p>Tom Selleck (Actor-Magnum PI a while back, Blue Bloods now)  does commercials for reverse mortgages. A while back I asked a group of people WHY he is doing them. Here were some answers and reactions</p><p>a) He needs the money. Not likely, he seems to have done well and does not seem to have the kind of bad habits (e.g., drugs) that need money. Maybe he has expensive tastes (my only expensive tastes is in fine European Kit Kat bars--- which actually are not that expensive). </p><p>b) He likes doing commercials. Maybe.</p><p>c) He believes in the product. At this, everyone cracked up in laughter.</p><p>This raises a more general point: Why does ANYONE believe ANY commercial since we KNOW the actor is being PAID to say it. I ask non rhetorically as always. </p></div>

<p>
Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, and Andrea Ghez have won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics. The prize is divided half to Penrose for theoretical work and half to Genzel and Ghez for finding a convincing and appreciably large practical example.

</p><p>
Today we congratulate the winners and give further musings on the nature of knowledge and the role of theory.

</p><p>
The physics Nobel has always had the rule that it cannot be for a theory alone, no matter how beautiful and how many mathematical discoveries follow from its development. Stephen Hawking’s theory of black-hole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation">radiation</a> is almost universally accepted, despite its association with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox">paradox</a>, yet it was said that only an empirical confirmation such as mini-black holes being discovered to explode in an accelerator core would have brought it a Nobel. The official citation to Sir Roger says that his prize is:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> “for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity.” </em>
</blockquote>




<p>
What is a “robust” prediction? The word strikes us as having overtones of <em>necessity</em>. Necessary knowledge is the kind we deal with in mathematics. The citation to Genzel and Ghez stays on empirical grounds:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> “for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy.” </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
The “object” <em>must</em> be a black hole—given relativity and its observed gravitational effects, it cannot be otherwise. Among many possible witnesses for the reality of black holes—one being the evident origin of the gravitational waves whose <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/waves-hazards-and-guesses/">detection</a> brought the 2017 Nobel—the centers of galaxies are hefty examples. The combination of these citations opens several threads we’d like to discuss.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> The Proof Horizon of a Black Hole </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
Dick and I are old enough to remember when black holes had the status of conjecture. One of my childhood astronomy books stated that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1">Cygnus X-1</a> X-ray source was the best known candidate for a black hole. In 1974, Hawking bet Kip Thorne that it was not a black hole. The bet lasted until 1990, when Hawking conceded. He wrote the following in his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time">book</a>, <em>A Brief History of Time</em>:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> This was a form of insurance policy for me. I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. But in that case, I would have the consolation of winning my bet. … When we made the bet in 1975, we were 80% certain that Cygnus X-1 was a black hole. By now [1988], I would say that we are about 95% certain, but the bet has yet to be settled. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
In the 1980s, I was a student and then postdoc in Penrose’s department, so I was imbued with the ambience of black holes and never had a thought about doubting their existence. I even once spent an hour with John Wheeler, who coined the term “black hole,” when Penrose delegated me to accompany Wheeler to Oxford’s train station for his return to London. But it seems from the record that the progression to regarding black holes as proven entities was as gradual as many argue the act of crossing a large black hole’s event horizon to be. Although the existence of a central black hole from data emanating from Sagittarius had been proposed at least as far back as 1971, the work by Ghez and then Genzel cited for their prize began in 1995. The official <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/press-release/">announcement</a> for Riccardo Giacconi’s share of the 2002 physics Nobel stated:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> “He also detected sources of X-rays that most astronomers now consider to contain black holes.” </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
This speaks lingering doubt at least about <em>where</em> black holes might be judged to exist, if not their existence at all.

</p><p>
However their time of confirmation might be pinpointed, it is the past five years that have given by far the greatest flood of evidence, including the first visual <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2019/4/19/how-scientists-captured-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole/">image</a> of a black hole last year. The fact of their presence in our universe is undeniable. But <em>necessity</em> is a separate matter, and with Penrose this goes back to 1964.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> Relativity and Necessity </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/an-interview-with-kurt-gdel/">mentioned</a> Kurt Gödel’s solution to the equations of general relativity (GR) in which time travel is possible. This does not mean that time travel must be possible, or that it is possible in our universe. A “solution” to GR is more like a <em>model</em> in logic: it may satisfy a theory’s axioms but have other properties that are contingent (unless the theory is <em>categorical</em>, meaning that all of its models are isomorphic). Gödel’s model has a negative value for Einstein’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant">cosmological constant</a>; the 2011 physics Nobel went to the discovery that in our universe the constant has a tiny <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/empirical-humility/">positive</a> value. GR also allows solutions in which some particles (called <em>tachyons</em>) travel faster than light.

</p><p>
That GR has solutions allowing black holes had been known from its infancy in work by Karl Schwarzschild and Johannes Droste. There are also solutions without black holes; a universe with no mass is legal in GR in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_solution_(general_relativity)">many ways</a> besides the case of special relativity. Penrose took the opposite tack, of giving minimal conditions under which black holes are <em>necessary</em>. Following this <a href="https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-how-penrose-genzel-and-ghez-helped-put-black-holes-at-the-centre-of-modern-astrophysics-147613">article</a>, we list them informally as follows:

</p><p>


</p><ol> 
<li>
Sufficiently large concentrations of mass exerting gravity exist. 
</li><li>
Gravity always attracts, never repels. 
</li><li>
No physical effect can travel faster than light. 
</li><li>
Gravity determines how light bends and moves. 
</li><li>
The space-time manifold is metrically complete. 
</li></ol>



<p>
Penrose showed that any system obeying these properties and evolving in accordance with GR must develop black holes. He showed this without any symmetry assumptions on the system. Thus he derived black holes as a prediction with the force of a theorem derived from minimal axioms.

</p><p>
His 1965 <a href="http://quantum-gravitation.de/media/2d2cde3ec9c38fffffff80d0fffffff1.pdf">paper</a> actually used a proof by contradiction. He derived five properties needed in order for the system to avoid forming a singularity. Then he showed they are mutually inconsistent—a proof by contradiction. Here is the crux of his paper:

</p><p>




</p><p>
</p><table style="margin: auto;">

<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/penrosediagram1965.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17673" height="442" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/penrosediagram1965.jpg?w=600" width="600"/></a>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>



<p>
In the diagram, time flows up. The point in a nutshell—a very tight nutshell—is that once a surface flows inside the cylinder at the Schwarzschild radius then light and any other motion from it can go only inward toward a singularity. The analysis is possible without the kind of symmetry assumption that had been used to tame the algebraic complexity of the equations of GR. The metric completeness mandates a singularity apart from any symmetries; a periodic equilibrium is ruled out by analysis of Cauchy surfaces.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> Necessary For Us? </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
Like Richard Feynman’s famous diagrams for quantum field theory, Penrose developed his diagrams as tools for shortcutting the vicissitudes of GR. We could devote entire other posts to his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling">tiles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle">triangle</a> and other combinatorial inventions. His tools enable quantifying black-hole formation from observations in our universe.

</p><p>
The question of <em>necessity</em>, however, pertains to other possible universes. Let us take for granted that GR and quantum theory are facets of a physical theory that governs the entire cosmos—the long-sought “theory of everything”—and let us also admit the contention of inflationary theorists that multiple universes are a necessary consequence of any inflation theory. The question remains, <em>are black holes necessary in those universes?</em>

</p><p>
It is possible that those universes might not satisfy axiom 1 above, or might have enough complexity for existence of black holes but not large-scale formation of them. The question then becomes whether black holes must exist in any universe rich enough for sentient life forms such as ourselves to develop. This is a branch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle">anthropic principle</a>.

</p><p>
Lee Smolin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_natural_selection">proposed</a> a mechanism via which black holes engender new universes and so propagate the complexity needed for their large-scale formation. Since complexity also attends the development of sentient life forms, this would place our human existence in the wake of consequence, as opposed to the direction of logic when reasoning by the anthropic principle.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> A Little More About Science </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
The 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded this week to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier for their lead roles in developing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR</a> gene-editing technology, specifically around the protein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas9">Cas9</a>. 

</p><p>
We argue that two more different types of results cannot be found: 

</p><p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> Penrose shows that black holes and general relativity are connected, which is a math result. We still cannot create black holes in a lab to experiment with—or maybe we could but should be very afraid of going anywhere near doing so. It was not clear that there could ever be a real application of this result.

</p><p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> Charpentier and Doudna discover that an existing genetic mechanism could be used to edit genetic material. Clearly this can and was experimented on in labs. Also clear that there are applications of this result. Actually it is now a standard tool used in countless labs. There even are patent battles over the method.

</p><p>
We like the fact that Nobels are given for such diverse type of research. It is not just that one is for astrophysics and one for chemistry. It is that Nobels can be given for very different types of research. We think this is important.

</p><p>
But wait. These results do have something in common, something that sets them apart from any research we can do in complexity theory. Both operate like this:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> 	Observe something important from nature. Something that is there independent of us. Then in Penrose’s case explain why it is true. Then in Charpentier and Doudna’s case, use it to solve some important problems. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
We wonder if anything like this could be done in our research world—say in complexity theory?

</p><p>

    <title>TR20-154 |  A Structural Theorem for Local Algorithms with Applications to Coding, Testing, and Privacy |

    <summary>We prove a general structural theorem for a wide family of local algorithms, which includes property testers, local decoders, and PCPs of proximity. Namely, we show that the structure of every algorithm that makes $q$ adaptive queries and satisfies a natural robustness condition admits a sample-based algorithm with $n^{1- 1/O(q^2 \log^2 q)}$ sample complexity, following the definition of Goldreich and Ron (TOCT 2016). We prove that this transformation is nearly optimal. Our theorem also admits a scheme for constructing privacy-preserving local algorithms. 

Using the unified view that our structural theorem provides, we obtain results regarding various types of local algorithms, including the following.


- We strengthen the state-of-the-art lower bound for relaxed locally decodable codes, obtaining an exponential improvement on the dependency in query complexity; this resolves an open problem raised by Gur and Lachish (SODA 2020).
- We show that any (constant-query) testable property admits a sample-based tester with sublinear sample complexity; this resolves a problem left open in a work of Fischer, Lachish, and Vasudev (FOCS 2015) by extending their main result to adaptive testers.
- We prove that the known separation between proofs of proximity and testers is essentially maximal; this resolves a problem left open by Gur and Rothblum (ECCC 2013, Computational Complexity 2018) regarding sublinear-time delegation of computation.

Our techniques strongly rely on relaxed sunflower lemmas and the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem.</summary>
