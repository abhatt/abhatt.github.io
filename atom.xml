    <title>Near-Optimal Distributed Degree+1 Colouring</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If you are interested in graph colouring, and specifically in distributed algorithms for that classic problem, I strongly recommend the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00604" target="_blank">recent paper</a> posted by Magnús M. Halldórsson, Fabian Kuhn, Alexandre Nolin and Tigran Tonoyan. (For the record, three of the authors work, or have worked, in my department at Reykjavik University, so I am biased.) </p><p>The above-mentioned paper addresses the problem of finding a proper colouring of a graph when each node <i>v</i> has a palette of degree(<i>v</i>)+1 colours at its disposal. The paper resolves an open problem in distributed colouring and simplifies known results in doing so. As a byproduct of their results, the authors obtain improved streaming and sub-linear time algorithms.   See the paper for much more information on the context for this result and the technical details. </p><p>Congratulations to the authors!</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m on the ICALP 2022 program committee (PC) and was apparently the first to complain when I saw the draft call for papers, and I asked that the requirement that <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=17">submissions must be in LIPIcs style</a> be put to a vote.  Despite substantial support among the PC for not requiring the majority of authors to squander their time formatting in an exotic style submissions that will be rejected, the Supreme Court blocked the vote.  Their main rationale seems to be ensuring correspondence between submissions and proceedings.  Ironically, at the same time other conferences are allowing authors to publish in proceedings an <em>abridged </em>version of the (accepted) submission, to make it easier to publish the paper in a journal (which may not want to have a full version already in a conference).  We are at the nadir in history where human effort is systematically wasted to produce versions that do not even pretend to be useful for readers — only to check boxes.</p>



<p>When I was at the IAS and was briefed about logistics, I was stunned when they asked me if I type my own papers, or if I needed help with that.  I guess the next level will be if you need help with formatting your submissions.</p>



<p>Picture a 100-year old retired scientist who followed the field for 75 years, and who wants to make one more contribution.  Even though they are no match for the raw power of a 15-year old, their ability to draw connections almost makes up for it, and their perspective is invaluable to the community.  This scientist, whose equipment consists of a desktop from two human generations ago, miraculously held together and kept working through sheer love and intimate knowledge, is now being asked to format their paper in LIPIcs style… or to ask someone else to do it for them (talk about fostering collaboration).</p>



<p>Here’s a non-exclusive list of true, terrible things about conferences, most of which were discussed earlier on this blog (see tag <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia-tcs/">utopia-tcs</a>):</p>



<ol><li>Requiring submissions in proceedings format.</li><li>Pre-registering papers by a deadline different than the submission deadline.</li><li>Requiring authors to submit a separate 2-page summary of the paper.</li><li>Ultra-strict page limits, summary rejection for any deviation.</li><li>Suddenly being forced on a short notice to submit a dummy .pdf so that PC assignments can be made.</li><li>Extending the list of topics two days before the deadline.</li><li>Moving deadlines.</li><li>Forcing authors to check multiple times the call for papers and/or constantly monitor email for any of these last-minute changes.</li><li>In the lucky case of acceptance, following up with a barrage of emails involving minutiae such as underfull \hbox.</li><li>Writing “this only takes 60 seconds.”  For me (and, apparently, many others — otherwise why delay answering emails that take 10 seconds to answer?) attending to <em>any</em> task, following <em>any</em> instruction, even “blink” or “say yes” has a huge fix cost, maybe 30 minutes.  So I translate 60 seconds to 31 minutes.</li><li>Hosting the conference in places which are inconvenient, for the attendees and planet earth.</li><li>Hosting the conference at times which are inconvenient for the attendees.</li><li>Requiring in-person PC meetings whose outcome does not justify the costs.</li></ol>



<p>As usual, people in a position of power do not have much incentive to fight to change the very practices that put them in that position in the first place.  But even this cynical remark doesn’t tell the whole story, since the practices got <em>worse</em> with time, unlike the case of journals.  One impression I have is that people have gotten so used to buggy software, constant updates, and general techno slavery that they just accept all of this as another inevitable misery in life… and by far not the worst!  This last point is important, as I think a seeping philosophy that permeates much of the discussion and the decisions is that much more important things are at stake, so who cares about this?  If you really want to spend cycles fixing something, then what about X?  (It’s fun to think where you end up if you stretch this point.)  But another life is possible.</p>



<p>One day, I will throw in my two cents and launch a new journal.  Besides being electronic and free (like ToC) it will have the following features.</p>



<ol><li>Papers, if accepted, will appear in the authors’ chosen format.  No conversion, and no additional effort, will be required for publication.  All the effort will be exclusively directed at improving the content of the paper.</li><li>Submissions can be by pdf attachment or by overlay, but not only to arxiv: to *any* repository.  In particular, authors will not be required to get their paper to compile on the arxiv.</li><li>The identities of the reviewers will be made public (in case of acceptance).  This I am still debating, but so far I am leaning towards it.  The problem that this is trying to address is that while you get reputation points for being on a program committee or on an editorial board, you don’t get many for being an unknown journal referee who is actually supposedly doing the hard work or finally really checking the proofs.  Instead with public identities people can show off the hard work and their role in the community, as happens on more recent platforms like say stackexchange.</li><li>Authors will be free to submit anonymously, or not.  This choice will be made by the authors, not dictated by a committee.</li><li>And perhaps the most consequential thing that I am still debating, should all submissions be public? (Maybe not.)</li></ol>



<p/>



<p>To finish on a high note, a great thing about conferences is the fast turn-around.  It is really depressing — in other fields — to have to wait so long for any quantifiable feedback on your work, and this is definitely something which I liked about the TCS community.  But, to come back to the mood of the post, this good aspect (and others) of conferences can probably be kept while rethinking the not so good.  (For example, there could be a journal with deadlines similar to conferences, which is also what happens for grant proposals etc.)</p>

    <title>TR21-179 |  Smoothed Complexity of Learning Disjunctive Normal Forms, Inverting Fourier Transforms, and Verifying Small Circuits | 

	tatsuie tsukiji</title>
    <summary>This paper aims to derandomize the following problems in the smoothed analysis of Spielman and Teng. Learn Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), invert Fourier Transforms (FT), and verify small circuits' unsatisfiability. Learning algorithms must predict a future observation from the only $m$ i.i.d. samples of a fixed but unknown joint-distribution $P(G(x),y)$ to explain an $\eta$-noisy target. Inverters must retrieve the hidden parameter $\theta$. The smoothed analysis can weaken the adversarial distribution $P(x,y)$ by injecting an appropriate perturbation $G$ with larger min-entropy $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G)$.  We will establish 1--10 for planted functions (Goldreich's PRG) $f_\theta(x) = f(\theta \circ x_1,\ldots,\theta \circ x_d)$ with variables $x_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,2n-1\}$ plugged into $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor)\oplus x_i$ in 1--4, $\theta\circ x_i := \theta_i \cdot \lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor \cdot (-1)^{x_i}\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 5--6, and $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor) \cdot (-1)^{x_i} \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 7. 8--10 will verify the unsatisfiability of small circuits in the worst case analysis (i.e., $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$). Suppose $\log n \gg \log (ds/\varepsilon) + k$ in 1--4. Randomly pick an example $(X,Y)$ from the observed $m$ data in 4.

1. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$, $\mathrm{Max}k\mathrm{CSP}$ of any $k$-variate predicate $f$ requires the sample size $\Omega(n^{(k-\epsilon)/2}) \le m \le \tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ to distinguish between $|\max_\theta P(y=f_\theta(x)) - \max_\theta P'(y=f_\theta(x))| \ge \Omega(1)$ and $P(x,y) \equiv P'(x,y)$ in $n^{O(k)}$ time by given access to both samplers $P(x,y)$ and $P'(x,y)$.
2. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log s$, the planted $s$-term DNF demands $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log s)}$ for $c$ less than 1, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log s + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than 1, to make $n^{O(\log s)}$-time PAC learning (even under a slight noise).
3. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log 1/\varepsilon$, the $\mathrm{planted}$ $\mathrm{AND}$ needs $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$ for $c$ less than $1$, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log(1/\varepsilon) + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than $1$, to make $(\eta+\varepsilon)$-accurate agnostic learning in $n^{O(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$-time.
4. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(\log s)$, the $\mathrm{monotone}$ $\mathrm{DNF}$ with expanding $s$-terms is PAC learnable from $m = n\cdot \mathrm{poly}(s)$ data with $\mathrm{Pr}[\lfloor{{X_{i}/2}}\rfloor, \lfloor{{X_{i'}/2}}\rfloor] \ge {1}/{n^{1+\epsilon}}$  in $n \cdot \tilde{O}(s^{\log d})$ time.

    <title>Beyond the Longest Letter-duplicated Subsequence Problem</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1639353600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Lai:Wenfeng.html">Wenfeng Lai</a>, Adiesha Liyange, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/z/Zhu:Binhai.html">Binhai Zhu</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/z/Zou:Peng.html">Peng Zou</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05725">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given a sequence $S$ of length $n$, a letter-duplicated subsequence is a
subsequence of $S$ in the form of $x_1^{d_1}x_2^{d_2}\cdots x_k^{d_k}$ with
$x_i\in\Sigma$, $x_j\neq x_{j+1}$ and $d_i\geq 2$ for all $i$ in $[k]$ and $j$
in $[k-1]$. A linear time algorithm for computing the longest letter-duplicated
subsequence (LLDS) of $S$ can be easily obtained. In this paper, we focus on
two variants of this problem. We first consider the constrained version when
$\Sigma$ is unbounded, each letter appears in $S$ at least 6 times and all the
letters in $\Sigma$ must appear in the solution. We show that the problem is
NP-hard (a further twist indicates that the problem does not admit any
polynomial time approximation). The reduction is from possibly the simplest
version of SAT that is NP-complete, $(\leq 2,1,\leq 3)$-SAT, where each
variable appears at most twice positively and exact once negatively, and each
clause contains at most three literals and some clauses must contain exactly
two literals. (We hope that this technique will serve as a general tool to help
us proving the NP-hardness for some more tricky sequence problems involving
only one sequence -- much harder than with at least two input sequences, which
we apply successfully at the end of the paper on some extra variations of the
LLDS problem.) We then show that when each letter appears in $S$ at most 3
times, then the problem admits a factor $1.5-O(\frac{1}{n})$ approximation.
Finally, we consider the weighted version, where the weight of a block
$x_i^{d_i} (d_i\geq 2)$ could be any positive function which might not grow
with $d_i$. We give a non-trivial $O(n^2)$ time dynamic programming algorithm
for this version, i.e., computing an LD-subsequence of $S$ whose weight is
maximized.

    <title>Beyond Parallel Pancakes: Quasi-Polynomial Time Guarantees for Non-Spherical Gaussian Mixtures</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1639353600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Buhai:Rares=Darius.html">Rares-Darius Buhai</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Steurer:David.html">David Steurer</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05445">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider mixtures of $k\geq 2$ Gaussian components with unknown means and
unknown covariance (identical for all components) that are well-separated,
i.e., distinct components have statistical overlap at most $k^{-C}$ for a large
enough constant $C\ge 1$. Previous statistical-query lower bounds [DKS17] give
formal evidence that even distinguishing such mixtures from (pure) Gaussians
may be exponentially hard (in $k$).
</p>
<p>We show that this kind of hardness can only appear if mixing weights are
allowed to be exponentially small, and that for polynomially lower bounded
mixing weights non-trivial algorithmic guarantees are possible in
quasi-polynomial time.
</p>
<p>Concretely, we develop an algorithm based on the sum-of-squares method with
running time quasi-polynomial in the minimum mixing weight. The algorithm can
reliably distinguish between a mixture of $k\ge 2$ well-separated Gaussian
components and a (pure) Gaussian distribution. As a certificate, the algorithm
computes a bipartition of the input sample that separates a pair of mixture
components, i.e., both sides of the bipartition contain most of the sample
points of at least one component.
</p>
<p>For the special case of colinear means, our algorithm outputs a $k$
clustering of the input sample that is approximately consistent with the
components of the mixture.
</p>
<p>A significant challenge for our results is that they appear to be inherently
sensitive to small fractions of adversarial outliers unlike most previous
results for Gaussian mixtures. The reason is that such outliers can simulate
exponentially small mixing weights even for mixtures with polynomially lower
bounded mixing weights.
</p>
<p>A key technical ingredient is a characterization of separating directions for
well-separated Gaussian components in terms of ratios of polynomials that
correspond to moments of two carefully chosen orders logarithmic in the minimum
mixing weight.

    <title>Stable Approximation Algorithms for the Dynamic Broadcast Range-Assignment Problem</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1639353600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Berg:Mark_de.html">Mark de Berg</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sadhukhan:Arpan.html">Arpan Sadhukhan</a>, Frits Spieksma <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05426">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Let $P$ be a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where each point $p\in P$ has
an associated transmission range $\rho(p)$. The range assignment $\rho$ induces
a directed communication graph $\mathcal{G}_{\rho}(P)$ on $P$, which contains
an edge $(p,q)$ iff $|pq| \leq \rho(p)$. In the broadcast range-assignment
problem, the goal is to assign the ranges such that $\mathcal{G}_{\rho}(P)$
contains an arborescence rooted at a designated node and whose cost $\sum_{p
\in P} \rho(p)^2$ is minimized. We study trade-offs between the stability of
the solution -- the number of ranges that are modified when a point is inserted
into or deleted from $P$ -- and its approximation ratio. We introduce
$k$-stable algorithms, which are algorithms that modify the range of at most
$k$ points when they update the solution. We also introduce the concept of a
stable approximation scheme (SAS). A SAS is an update algorithm that, for any
given fixed parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, is $k(\epsilon)$-stable and maintains a
solution with approximation ratio $1+\varepsilon$, where the stability
parameter $k(\varepsilon)$ only depends on $\varepsilon$ and not on the size of
$P$. We study such trade-offs in three settings.
</p>
<p>- In $\mathbb{R}^1$, we present a SAS with $k(\varepsilon)=O(1/\varepsilon)$,
which we show is tight in the worst case. We also present a 1-stable
$(6+2\sqrt{5})$-approximation algorithm, a $2$-stable 2-approximation
algorithm, and a $3$-stable $1.97$-approximation algorithm.
</p>
<p>- In $\mathbb{S}^1$ (where the underlying space is a circle) we prove that no
SAS exists, even though an optimal solution can always be obtained by cutting
the circle at an appropriate point and solving the resulting problem in
$\mathbb{R}^1$.
</p>
<p>- In $\mathbb{R}^2$, we also prove that no SAS exists, and we present a
$O(1)$-stable $O(1)$-approximation algorithm.

robot navigation, network security, and internet search. We initiate the study
of a learning-augmented variant of the classical, notoriously hard online graph
exploration problem by adding access to machine-learned predictions. We propose
an algorithm that naturally integrates predictions into the well-known Nearest
Neighbor (NN) algorithm and significantly outperforms any known online
algorithm if the prediction is of high accuracy while maintaining good
guarantees when the prediction is of poor quality. We provide theoretical
worst-case bounds that gracefully degrade with the prediction error, and we
complement them by computational experiments that confirm our results. Further,
we extend our concept to a general framework to robustify algorithms. By
interpolating carefully between a given algorithm and NN, we prove new
performance bounds that leverage the individual good performance on particular
inputs while establishing robustness to arbitrary inputs.

    <title>Stochastic Vertex Cover with Few Queries</title>

setting. Let $G$ be an arbitrary given graph, $p \in (0, 1]$ a parameter of the
problem, and let $G_p$ be a random subgraph that includes each edge of $G$
independently with probability $p$. We are unaware of the realization $G_p$,
but can learn if an edge $e$ exists in $G_p$ by querying it. The goal is to
find an approximate minimum vertex cover (MVC) of $G_p$ by querying few edges
of $G$ non-adaptively.
</p>
<p>This stochastic setting has been studied extensively for various problems
such as minimum spanning trees, matroids, shortest paths, and matchings. To our
knowledge, however, no non-trivial bound was known for MVC prior to our work.
In this work, we present a:
</p>
<p>* $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation for general graphs which queries
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^3 p})$ edges per vertex, and a
</p>
<p>* $1.367$-approximation for bipartite graphs which queries $poly(1/p)$ edges
per vertex.
</p>
<p>Additionally, we show that at the expense of a triple-exponential dependence
on $p^{-1}$ in the number of queries, the approximation ratio can be improved
down to $(1+\epsilon)$ for bipartite graphs.
</p>
<p>Our techniques also lead to improved bounds for bipartite stochastic
matching. We obtain a $0.731$-approximation with nearly-linear in $1/p$
per-vertex queries. This is the first result to break the prevalent $(2/3 \sim
0.66)$-approximation barrier in the $poly(1/p)$ query regime, improving
algorithms of [Behnezhad et al; SODA'19] and [Assadi and Bernstein; SOSA'19].

considerable attention (Baste et al. 2020; Fomin et al. 2020; Hanaka et al.
2021). In this paper we study the following type of problems: given an integer
$k$, the problem asks for $k$ solutions such that the sum of pairwise
(weighted) Hamming distances between these solutions is maximized. Such
solutions are called diverse solutions. We present a polynomial-time algorithm
for finding diverse shortest $st$-paths in weighted directed graphs. Moreover,
we study the diverse version of other classical combinatorial problems such as
diverse weighted matroid bases, diverse weighted arborescences, and diverse
bipartite matchings. We show that these problems can be solved in polynomial
time as well. To evaluate the practical performance of our algorithm for
finding diverse shortest $st$-paths, we conduct a computational experiment with
synthetic and real-world instances.The experiment shows that our algorithm
successfully computes diverse solutions within reasonable computational time.

    <title>Triangle Centrality</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1639353600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Burkhardt:Paul.html">Paul Burkhardt</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00110">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Triangle centrality is introduced for finding important vertices in a graph
based on the concentration of triangles surrounding each vertex. An important
vertex in triangle centrality is at the center of many triangles, and therefore
it may be in many triangles or none at all.
</p>
<p>We give optimal algorithms that compute triangle centrality in $O(m\sqrt{m})$
time and $O(m+n)$ space. Using fast matrix multiplication it takes
$n^{\omega+o(1)}$ time where $\omega$ is the matrix product exponent.
</p>
<p>On a Concurrent Read Exclusive Write (CREW) Parallel Random Access Memory
(PRAM) machine, we give a near work-optimal algorithm that takes $O(\log n)$
time using $O(m\sqrt{m})$ CREW PRAM processors. In MapReduce, we show it takes
four rounds using $O(m\sqrt{m})$ communication bits, and is therefore optimal.
</p>
<p>We also give a deterministic algorithm to find the triangle neighborhood and
triangle count of each vertex in $O(m\sqrt{m})$ time and $O(m+n)$ space.
</p>
<p>Our empirical results demonstrate that triangle centrality uniquely
identified central vertices thirty-percent of the time in comparison to five
other well-known centrality measures, while being asymptotically faster to
compute on sparse graphs than all but the most trivial of these other measures.

    <title>Did Lane Hemaspaandra invent the Fib numbers?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> (I abbreviate Fibonacci by Fib throughout. Lane Hemaspaandra helped me with this post.) </p><p>We all learned that Fib invented or discovered the Fib Numbers:</p><p>f_0=1,</p><p>f_1=1, and</p><p>for all n\ge 2, f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}.</p><p>We may have learned that they come up in nature (NOT true, see <a href="https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/fibonacc.htm">here</a>) or that they were important in mathematics (questionable--see this blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/01/how-important-are-fib-numbers-in-math.html">here</a> which says no, but some comments give good counterarguments). You also learned that Fibonacci was the mathematician who first studied them. Also not true!  This one surprised me. </p><p>1) I came across this blog post: <a href="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2021/11/16/why-names-matter/">here</a> that says they were invented by Hemachandra first. Wow--I then recalled that Lane Hemaspaandra's birth surname  was Lane Hemachandra (he married Edith Spaan and they are now both Hemaspaandra). So naturally I emailed him to ask how a 20th-century person could invent something earlier than 1170. He told me a picture of him in the basement ages while he stays young. </p><p>2) It would be nice to say OH, let's call them Hemachandra numbers (would that be  easier than convincing the world to use tau instead of pi,? See <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">The Tau Manifesto</a>) and let students know that there were people other than Europeans who did math back then. But even that story is not as simple as it seems. Lane emailed me this article: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/fibfibs.pdf">here</a> that tells the whole muddled story. (In what follows I leave out the accents.)</p><p>Virahanka seems to be the formulator of the Fib recurrence, though not quite the numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry.  He did this between 600 and 800 AD.</p><p>Gopala, in work prior to 1135, was aware of Virhanka's work. In particular he know about the inductive rule. But he also set the initial values and generated numbers, so he was the first to have the sequence we now call the Fib numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry. </p><p>Hemachandra in 1150 also formulated them, independently.  His motivation was Sanskrit poetry.</p><p>(I will learn some Sanskrit poetry the next time I teach Discrete Math so I can give the students an application of the material!)</p><p>So does Virhanka win? Hardly:</p><p>Acarya Pingala's writings from the 5th or 6th century BC (YES- BC!) indicate that he knew about the Fib numbers in the context of (you guessed it!) Sanskrit poetry. </p><p>3) I would support changing the name of the Fib Numbers to the Pingala numbers. This is both good and bad news for Lane:</p><p>a) Bad news in that he does not get a sequence of number that shares his pre-marriage name.</p><p>b) Good news in that if I settled on Hemachandra numbers then Lane and Edith would have to decide if 0 or 1 or 2 of them want to change their name to Hemachandra. I would guess not--too complicated. Plus one name change in a life is enough. </p><p>4) The story (especially  the articles I pointed to) shows just how complicated history can get. Even a straightforward question like:</p><p><i>Who first formulated the Fib Numbers?</i></p><p>might not have a well-defined answer. Perhaps this is  the wrong question since if people formulate the concept independent of each other, they should all get some credit.  Even if the authors are 1000 years apart. </p><p><i>Side note</i>: Independent Discovery may be harder to assert now since, with the web,  Alice could have seen Bob's paper so it may be hard to call Alice's discovery independent. As I have mentioned before on this blog, my students have a hard time with the notion of Cook and Levin coming up with NP-completeness independently  since  surely one would have posted it and the other would have seen it. An era before posting was possible! Unimaginable to them. Sometimes even to me. </p></div>

    <title>TR21-177 |  Johnson Coverage Hypothesis: Inapproximability of k-means and k-median in $\ell_p$-metrics | 

	Vincent Cohen-Addad, 

	Karthik  C. S., 

	Euiwoong Lee</title>
    <summary>k-median and k-means are the two most popular objectives for clustering algorithms. Despite intensive effort, a good understanding of the approximability of these objectives, particularly in $\ell_p$-metrics, remains a major open problem. In this paper, we significantly improve upon the hardness of approximation factors known in literature for these objectives in $\ell_p$-metrics. 
 
We introduce a new hypothesis called the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis (JCH), which roughly asserts that the well-studied k-max coverage problem on set systems is hard to approximate to a factor greater than $1-\frac{1}{e}$, even when the membership graph of the set system is a subgraph of the Johnson graph. We then show that together with generalizations of the embedding techniques introduced by Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19), JCH implies hardness of approximation results for k-median and k-means in $\ell_p$-metrics for factors which are close to the ones obtained for general metrics. In particular, assuming JCH we show that it is hard to approximate the k-means objective:

$\bullet$ Discrete case: To a factor of 3.94 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.73 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.56 and 1.17 respectively, obtained under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).

$\bullet$ Continuous case: To a factor of 2.10 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.36 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.07 in the $\ell_2$-metric obtained under UGC (and to the best of our knowledge, the continuous case of k-means in $\ell_1$-metric was not previously analyzed in literature).
 
We also obtain similar improvements under JCH for the k-median objective. Additionally, we prove a weak version of JCH using the work of Dinur et al. (SICOMP'05) on Hypergraph Vertex Cover, and recover all the results stated above of Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19) to (nearly) the same inapproximability factors but now under the standard NP$\neq$P assumption (instead of UGC).

Finally, we establish a strong connection between JCH and the long standing open problem of determining the Hypergraph Turan number. We then use this connection to prove improved SDP gaps (over the existing factors in literature) for k-means and k-median objectives.</summary>

    <title>TR21-176 |  A super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus | 

	Theodoros Papamakarios</title>
    <summary>We show a quadratic separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus width. We use this gap to get, for the first time, first, a super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus for refuting CNF formulas, and secondly, a quadratic separation between resolution width and monomial space in polynomial calculus with resolution.  Our super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus only applies when clauses are seen as disjunctions of unbounded arity; our examples have linear size cut-free sequent calculus proofs writing, in a particular way, their clauses using binary disjunctions. Interestingly, this shows that the complexity of sequent calculus depends on how disjunctions are represented.</summary>

    <title>Defending the Status Quo</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>When the Wall Street Journal's <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/defending-mathematics-science-stem-equity-education-california-k12-math-matters-11638728196?reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">editorial board</a> and the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/07/hundreds-of-college-professors-blast-woke-math-movement/">New York Post</a> endorse your efforts, that should ring warning bells.</p><p>Several members of the theory and mathematics community and have written and endorsed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">Open Letter on K-12 Mathematics</a> that attacks the proposed revisions to the <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">California Mathematics Framework</a>. I have mixed feelings about these efforts. </p><p>Certainly the CMF has its issues, and the FAQs <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/mathfwfaqs.asp">protest too much</a>. But the letter goes too far in the other direction, arguing mainly for the status quo that worked well for those who signed the letter, very few of which have significant experience in K-12 education. The open letter allows for only incremental change unlikely to lead to any significant improvements.</p><p>Before you sign the letter, take a look at the CMF <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter1.docx">introduction</a></p><p/><blockquote><p>To develop learning that can lead to mathematical power for all California students, the framework has much to correct; the subject and community of mathematics has a history of exclusion and filtering, rather than inclusion and welcoming. There persists a mentality that some people are “bad in math” (or otherwise do not belong), and this mentality pervades many sources and at many levels. Girls and Black and Brown children, notably, represent groups that more often receive messages that they are not capable of high-level mathematics, compared to their White and male counterparts. As early as preschool and kindergarten, research and policy documents use deficit-oriented labels to describe Black and Latinx and low-income children’s mathematical learning and position them as already behind their white and middle-class peers. These signifiers exacerbate and are exacerbated by acceleration programs that stratify mathematics pathways for students as early as sixth grade.</p><p>Students internalize these messages to such a degree that undoing a self-identity that is “bad at math” to one that “loves math” is rare. Before students have opportunities to excel in mathematics, many often self-select out of mathematics because they see no relevance for their learning, and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics.</p></blockquote><p>You may or may not agree with the CMF approach, but it's hard to deny the real challenges they are trying to address and students they are trying to help. If you don't agree with the CMF, work with them to come up with a good alternative that helps create a more inclusive mathematical citizenry. An outright rejection of the approach won't fix problems and probably won't be taken seriously, except from the conservative press.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award recognizes an outstanding dissertation in the field of economics and computation. The award is conferred annually at the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation and includes a certificate, complimentary conference registration, and an honorarium of $1,500. A certificate may further be given to up to two runners-up. No award may be conferred if the nominations are judged not to meet the standards for the award.</p>



<p>To be eligible, a dissertation must be on a topic related to economics and computation and must have been defended successfully during the calendar year preceding the year of the award presentation.</p>



<p>The next SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award will be given for dissertations defended in 2021. Nominations are due by <em>February 28th, 2022</em> (Anywhere on Earth), and must be submitted <a href="mailto:sigecom-awards-diss@acm.org">by email to the Award Committee</a> with “2021 SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award” in the subject. A dissertation may be nominated simultaneously for both the SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award and the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.</p>



<p>Nominations may be made by any member of SIGecom and will typically come from the dissertation supervisor. Self-nomination is not allowed. Nominations for the award <em>must include the following</em>, preferably having items 1, 3, and 4 in a single PDF file:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>A two-page summary of the dissertation, written by the nominee, including bibliographic data and links to publicly accessible versions of published papers based primarily on the dissertation.</li><li>An English-language version of the dissertation in a separate file.</li><li>An endorsement letter of no more than two pages by the nominator, arguing the merit of the dissertation, potential impact, and justification of the nomination. This document should also certify the dissertation defense date.</li><li>The names, email addresses, and affiliations of at least two additional endorsers.</li></ol>



<p>The additional endorsement letters themselves should be <a href="mailto:sigecom-awards-diss@acm.org">sent directly by email</a>, by the same deadline. These endorsements should be no longer than 500 words and should specify the relationship of the endorser to the nominee, contributions of the dissertation, and its potential impact on the field.</p>



<p>It is expected that a nominated candidate, if selected for the award, will attend the next ACM Conference on Economics and Computation on July 11–15, 2022, to accept the award and give a presentation on the dissertation work. The conference will tentatively be held in Boulder, Colorado. The award includes complimentary registration but does not cover travel or accommodation expenses to attend the conference.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The holiday season is just around the corner. Best wishes to you and your loved ones in advance from us here at PTReview. This month, we had <s>four</s> five papers in all. To prepare for the festive mood associated with the onset of December, also included are brief updates on the recently disproven implicit graph conjecture. Let’s dig in. <em>(And please, do let us know if we missed your paper)</em>. </p>



<p>(<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Thanks to our readers for pointing out a paper we missed.)</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Downsampling for Testing and Learning in Product Distributions</strong> by Nathaniel Harms, Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07449">arXiv</a>). Contemplating on connections in algorithms used for testing a diverse collection of function properties, this paper provides a unified and generalized view of a technique: which the authors call downsampling. As the paper explains, the name is motivated by analogy to image/signal processing tasks. Very often, these tasks involve two steps. In the first step, you break the input domain into “grid cells”. You use oracle calls to the function to obtain a crude approximation over all these cells.  In the second step, you learn this gridded-up or coarsened function cell-by-cell.</p>



<p>This two-step attack could just be what the doctor ordered for your favorite function property testing problem: in particular, it has been put to work for approximately testing visual properties, approximating distance to monotonicity in high dimensions, testing \(k\)-monotone functions, and more. However, if you wanted to obtain property testers using this approach in the distribution-free setup, your ordeal might be far from over. The unknown distribution your domain is equipped with can mess with geometric arguments your gridding approach hopes to exploit. This is precisely the setup considered in the paper (i.e, distribution-free testing of function properties).</p>



<p>The essence of downsampling, is captured by a slick proposition that prescribes coarsening as your goto weapon if the<br/>1) fraction of cells on which \(f\) is not constant, and<br/>2) a measure of how non-uniform the unknown distribution D your domain is equipped with is </p>



<p>are both small.</p>



<p>Equipped with this machinery,  the paper tackles the task of designing distribution-free testers for boolean monotonicity with the underlying domain being \(\mathbb{R}^d\). The argument is pretty short and improves upon the sample complexity of the corresponding result in the paper by Black-Chakrabarti-Seshadhri. Do check it out, looks like some nice ammo to add to your toolkit.</p>



<p>Let’s stay on board for sublinear time algorithms for gap-edit distance. </p>



<p><strong>Gap Edit Distance via Non-Adaptive Queries: Simple and Optimal</strong> by Elazar Goldenberg, Tomasz Kociumaka, Robert Krauthgamer, Barna Saha (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12706">arXiv</a>). The edit distance problem needs no introduction. This paper studies the problem of approximating edit distance in sublinear time. In particular, this is formalized by introducing the gapped version of the problem. This entails the following computational task: Fix \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) and some \(c &gt; 0\). Given a pair \(x, y\) of strings over a finite alphabet, decide whether the edit distance between \(x,y\) is at most \(k\) or whether it is at least \(k^c\). This paper resolves the non-adaptive query complexity of edit distance and proves that the above gapped version can be decided in at most \(O\left(\frac{n}{k^{c – 1/2}}\right)\) queries. The paper also proves that this bound is almost optimal up to some polylog factors.</p>



<p/>



<p>Next up, we have <em>time-optimal</em> algorithms for maximum matching and vertex cover! Sweet, right?</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Time-Optimal Sublinear Algorithms for Matching and Vertex Cover</strong> by Soheil Behnezhad (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02942">arXiv</a>). This paper gives algorithms for the classic problem of estimating the size of vertex cover and maximum matching in graphs in sublinear time (in both adjacency matrix and adjacency list models). This is another nice read for the holiday season — after all the paper obtains time-optimal algorithms (up to polylog factors) in both of these models for a multiplicative-additive \((2, \varepsilon n)\) algorithms. Let me set up some historical context to appreciate the maximum matching result better.</p>



<p>In a classic work, Parnas and Ron gave sublinear time algorithms that obtain a \((2,  \varepsilon  n)\) estimate to the size of a maximum matching in a graph using query access to the adjacency list in sublinear time. Their sublinear time algorithm is inspired by ideas with roots in distributed algorithms. In particular, their algorithm returns in time<br/>\(\Delta^{O(\log {\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon}})}\) (where \(\Delta = \Delta(G)\) denotes the degree bound) an estimate \(\text{EST}\) to the size of the max-matching where \(OPT \leq \text{EST} \leq 2 \cdot OPT + \varepsilon  n\). Unfortunately, algorithms in this Parnas-Ron Framework must necessarily suffer a quasi-polynomial running time because of lower bounds from distributed algorithms. Using a randomized greedy approach to estimating the size of a maximum matching, Yoshida, Yamamoto, and Ito gave the first algorithm which returned a \((2,  \varepsilon n)\)-estimate to maximum matching in time \(poly(\Delta/\varepsilon)\). This is where the story essentially froze — though there were results that improved the dependence on \(\Delta\) to \(O(\Delta^2)\). Unfortunately, this is not truly sublinear for large \(\Delta\). In another direction, Kapralov-Mitrovic-Norouzi Fard-Tardos gave an algorithm that estimates the maximum matching size in time \(O(\Delta)\) (which is truly sublinear) but it no longer guarantees a \((2,  \varepsilon  n)\)-approximation and instead returns a \((O(1),  \varepsilon  n)\)-approximation. The current paper, as remarked above achieves the best of both worlds.</p>



<p/>



<!-- <p>Next up, a graph mining paper which explains why some heuristics work on real world graphs.</p> -->



<!-- <p> <strong>FPT Algorithms for Finding Near-Cliques in [latex]c[/latex]-Closed Graphs</strong> by Balaram Behera, Edin Husić, Shweta Jain, Tim Roughgarden, C. Seshadhri (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09768">arXiv</a>). Let us introduce the cast of characters this paper talks about. You call a graph [latex]c[/latex]-closed if any two non-adjacent vertices in your graph have at most [latex]c-1[/latex], common neighbors. The main theorem of the paper presents an FPT style algorithm which on input a [latex]c[/latex]-closed graph [latex]G[/latex] finds in time [latex]O(n^{2d+4} \cdot 4^c)[/latex] the entire list of all maximal induced subgraphs with small degeneracy. The heart of this paper is an alternative proof of a previous result by Fox et al which FPT style enumerates all the maximal cliques in [latex]c[/latex]-closed graphs. The current paper proves this via a backtracking approach that finds cliques and can be used for clique enumeration. The authors make the case that their proofs give mathematical justification for the empirical success of backtracking-based heuristics in mining real-life social networks.</p> -->

<p/>



<p>Final stop, updates on the implicit graph conjecture.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>The Implicit Graph Conjecture is False</strong> by Hamed Hatami, Pooya Hatami (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13198">arXiv</a>). While not a property testing paper per se, it is always good to see an old conjecture resolved one way or the other. In this paper, the Hatami brothers (Pooya and Hamed) refute a three decade old conjecture — the one mentioned in the title. Here is a brief history. Sampath Kannan, Moni Naor and Steven Rudich defined the notion of implicit representation of graphs. Take a family of \(\mathcal{F}\) of graphs and consider a \(n\) vertex graph \(G \in \mathcal{F}\). You say this family admits an efficient implicit representation if there exists an assignment of \(O(\log n)\) length labels to all the vertices in \(V(G)\) such that the adjacencies between every pair of vertices is a function of the labels of the corresponding pair. Crucially, the labeling function may depend on the family, but not on individual graphs in the family. What is cool about families admitting such an efficient implicit representation, is that the number of \(n\)-vertex graphs in this family cannot be any bigger than \(2^{O(n \log n)}\) — that is such families have at most factorial growth rate. Implicit graph conjecture asserts that for every hereditary graph family, the converse also holds. Namely, if the hereditary family has at most factorial growth rate, then the family admits efficient implicit representations. The key, as shown in this paper (which spans all of six pages!) is to choose as your hereditary graph class, the closure of a random collection of graphs. The authors show that now your hand is forced and your representation will no longer be efficient. However, annoyingly, your hereditary graph class need not have a factorial growth rate as taking the closure of a random collection expands to contain all graphs and has growth rate \(2^{\Omega(n^2)}\). The cool thing is, you can avoid this issue by choosing a random collection of slightly sparse random graphs (with \(n^{2-\varepsilon}\) edges). Interestingly, this gives you enough ammo to finally control the growth rate which in turn allows the authors to slay this conjecture.</p>



<p>(<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Omitted Stop, added retroactively). </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating von Neumann entropy</strong> by Tom Gur, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Sathyawageeswar Subramanian (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11139">arXiv</a>). This paper presents quantum algorithms for the problem of obtaining multiplicative estimates of the Shannon entropy of the familiar classical distributions and the more exotic von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum systems. In particular, the paper presents an \(\widetilde{O}(n^{\frac{1+\eta }{2\gamma^2 }})\)-query quantum algorithm that achieves a \(\gamma\)-multiplicative approximation algorithm for the Shannon Entropy of an input distribution \(\mathbf{p}\) supported on a universe of size \(n\) where \(H(\mathbf{p}) \geq \gamma/\eta\). As if this were not already cool enough, the paper also presents sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating Von Neumann Entropy as well. This is supplemented by a lower bound of \(\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{3 \gamma^2}})\) queries for achieving a \(\gamma\)-factor approximation for any of these two kinds of entropies. </p></div>

    <title>Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Clause for Complexity Theorists, If you Only Believe</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Guest Post by Hunter Monroe)
   

In this  guest post and <a href="https://speedupblogger.wordpress.com/2021/12/05/unifying-conjectures-on-complexity-and-noncomputability/">discussion paper</a>, I present a remarkable set of structurally similar conjectures which, if you only believe them, conjure up a dream world for theorists by asserting a new form of diagonalization based on naturally nonrelativizing facts invoking a deep linkage to underlying noncomputable languages. These conjectures, all stronger than the things to be proved, imply that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse because the arithmetic hierarchy does not collapse, and P≠NP≠coNP. The diagonalizations imply the existence of hard instances, with the result that many complexity classes have speedup, including the Π side of PH, and proof speedup for tautologies stems from proof speedup for arithmetic. These conjectures do two things: (1) let us explore a hypothetical world where many open problems about uniform complexity classes are resolved and consider steps beyond e.g. to circuit complexity, and (2) reduce numerous open questions to a single plausible claim about how Turing machines have limited information about noncomputable languages. This would potentially allow a slew of open questions to be resolved at once with a skeleton key.<p>The following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3765">conjecture</a> implying $\textbf{P!=NP}$ is remarkable: it hints at a deeper, unnoticed relationship between complexity and noncomputability; it is <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/scan10.pdf">equivalent</a> to speedup for all paddable $\textbf{coNP}$-complete languages and in proof length for tautologies; tweaked versions would separate other complexity classes; and if true it is a nonrelativizing fact.</p><p/>



Conjecture: (*) For any deterministic TM $M$ accepting the $\textbf{coNP}$-complete language ``nondeterministic TM $N$ on input $x$ does not halt within $t$ steps'' ($\texttt{coBHP}$), there exists a $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ ($N'$ does not halt on $x'$, ever) with $M$'s running time $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by any polynomial.

<p/>

If true, (*) is a nonrelativizing fact; there is no hard $\langle N, x\rangle$ for $M$ with an exponential time oracle. The noncomputable language $\texttt{coHP}$ potentially explains why (*) is true, by analogy with this trivial theorem:

<p/>


Theorem. For any $M$ accepting $\texttt{coBHP}$, there exists some non-halting $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ with $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by a constant.

<p/>


Otherwise, $M$ would accept $\texttt{coHP}$ and have too much information about a non-c.e. language; (*) is just a stronger version. In the extreme, any $M$ is completely ignorant about some $\langle N',x'\rangle$ and requires on the order of $2^t$ steps to rule out every potentially halting branch.  Tweaking (*) yields conjectures implying that $\textbf{PH}$ does not collapse:

<p/>


Conjectures: For any $M^{\Pi^p_i}$ that accepts $\Pi^p_{i+1}=\{\langle N^{\Pi^p_i},x,1^t\rangle|$ $N^{\Pi^p_i}$ does not halt on input $x$ in $t$ steps$\}$, there is a non-halting $\langle N'^{\Pi^p_i},x'\rangle\in \Pi_i$ with $M^{\Pi^p_i}$'s running time not bounded by any polynomial.

<p/>


By invoking every level $\Pi_i$ of the arithmetic hierarchy ($\textbf{AH}$), these conjectures state that the noncollapse $\textbf{PH}$ is due to the noncollapse of $\textbf{AH}$. The conjecture (*) can be calibrated depending on the desired separation to equip $M$ with an oracle or nondeterminism or constrain its resources, to choose a resource-bounded complete problem and underlying non-c.e. language, and to fine tune how hard a hard instance needs to be.

<p/>


Proof speedup for tautologies (equivalent to (*)) may stem from the proof speedup for arithmetic that occurs when adding undecidable statements as new axioms, allowing new theorems to be proved and shortening the proof of existing theorems. This literature translates any arithmetic theorem free of existential quantifiers into a tautology by replacing $k$-bit numbers with $k$ Boolean variables. The analogy with (*) suggests this stronger conjecture may in fact also be equivalent:

<p/>


Conjecture: The following two statements are equivalent: (1) there is no optimal propositional proof system; and (2) Any propositional proof system $P$ is outperformed by a sufficiently powerful conservative extension $T$ of the Peano arithmetic, and $T$ can be improved further by adding any undecidable statement in $T$ as a new axiom.

<p/>


So (*) is a Swiss army knife for generating conjectures that give us a vision of a world in which answering essentially one question would serve as a skeleton key that unlocks many open problems.</div>

    <summary>Entropy is a fundamental property of both classical and quantum systems, spanning myriad theoretical and practical applications in physics and computer science. We study the problem of obtaining estimates to within a multiplicative factor $\gamma&gt;1$ of the Shannon entropy of probability distributions and the von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum states. Our main results are:

       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the Shannon entropy $H(\mathbf{p})$ of a classical probability distribution $\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\ldots,p_n)$;
       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac12+\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ of a density matrix $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$.

    In both cases, the input is assumed to have entropy bounded away from zero by a quantity determined by the parameter $\eta&gt;0$, since, as we prove, no polynomial query algorithm can multiplicatively approximate the entropy of distributions with arbitrarily low entropy. In addition, we provide $\Omega\left(n^{\frac{1}{3\gamma^2}}\right)$ lower bounds on the query complexity of $\gamma$-multiplicative estimation of Shannon and von Neumann entropies.

    We work with the quantum purified query access model, which can handle both classical probability distributions and mixed quantum states, and is the most general input model considered in the literature.</summary>

    <title>TR21-173 |  On the Structure of Learnability beyond P/poly | 

	Ninad Rajgopal, 

	Rahul Santhanam</title>
    <summary>Motivated by the goal of showing stronger structural results about the complexity of learning, we study the learnability of strong concept classes beyond P/poly, such as PSPACE/poly and EXP/poly. We show the following:


1. (Unconditional Lower Bounds for Learning)  Building on [KKO13], we prove unconditionally that BPE/poly cannot be weakly learned in polynomial time over the uniform distribution, even with membership and equivalence queries.

2. (Robustness of Learning) For the concept classes EXP/poly and PSPACE/poly, we show unconditionally that worst-case and average-case learning are equivalent, that PAC-learnability and learnability over the uniform distribution are equivalent, and that membership queries do not help in either case.

3. (Reducing Succinct Search to Decision for Learning) For the decision problems $R_{Kt}$ and $R_{KS}$ capturing the complexity of learning EXP/poly and PSPACE/poly respectively, we show a succinct search to decision reduction: for each of these problems, the problem is in BPP iff there is a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm computing circuits encoding proofs for positive instances of the problem. This is shown via a more general result giving succinct search to decision results for PSPACE, EXP and NEXP, which might be of independent interest. 

4. (Implausibility of Oblivious Strongly Black-Box Reductions showing NP-hardness of learning NP/poly) We define a natural notion of hardness of learning with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions. We show that learning PSPACE/poly is PSPACE-hard with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions. On the other hand, if learning NP/poly is NP-hard with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions, the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.</summary>

    <title>TR21-172 |  Ideals, Determinants, and Straightening: Proving and Using Lower Bounds for Polynomial Ideals | 

	Robert Andrews, 

	Michael Forbes</title>
    <summary>We show that any nonzero polynomial in the ideal generated by the $r \times r$ minors of an $n \times n$ matrix $X$ can be used to efficiently approximate the determinant. Specifically, for any nonzero polynomial $f$ in this ideal, we construct a small depth-three $f$-oracle circuit that approximates the $\Theta(r^{1/3}) \times \Theta(r^{1/3})$ determinant in the sense of border complexity. For many classes of algebraic circuits, this implies that every nonzero polynomial in the ideal generated by $r \times r$ minors is at least as hard to approximately compute as the $\Theta(r^{1/3}) \times \Theta(r^{1/3})$ determinant. We also prove an analogous result for the Pfaffian of a $2n \times 2n$ skew-symmetric matrix and the ideal generated by Pfaffians of $2r \times 2r$ principal submatrices.

This answers a recent question of Grochow about complexity in polynomial ideals in the setting of border complexity. Leveraging connections between the complexity of polynomial ideals and other questions in algebraic complexity, our results provide a generic recipe that allows lower bounds for the determinant to be applied to other problems in algebraic complexity. We give several such applications, two of which are highlighted below.
	
$\bullet$ We prove new lower bounds for the Ideal Proof System of Grochow and Pitassi. Specifically, we give super-polynomial lower bounds for refutations computed by low-depth circuits. This extends the recent breakthrough low-depth circuit lower bounds of Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas to the setting of proof complexity. Moreover, we show that for many natural circuit classes, the approximative proof complexity of our hard instance is governed by the approximative circuit complexity of the determinant.

$\bullet$ We construct new hitting set generators for the closure of low-depth circuits. For any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we construct generators with seed length $O(n^\varepsilon)$ that hit $n$-variate low-depth circuits. Our generators attain a near-optimal tradeoff between their seed length and degree, and are computable by low-depth circuits of near-linear size (with respect to the size of their output). This matches the seed length of the generators recently obtained by Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas, but improves on the degree and circuit complexity of the generator.</summary>

    <title>TheoretiCS: A new open-access journal in Theoretical Computer Science</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjf7-wAXJmH9SiOAhxTj4m6svlchJtMYZVkNnWSoaPMvaVSAq3Xn8x902jjH_K7CEvubT8Rj09SwcNiKvpy0iVgtLuYyWk-fFvk7O4yoTyqumEJqRMVpJGM5ONAQMibKk6SKFPXaEtWQA09kSzd0RW8Yke8qd-RZiR-b5FI4JwvkPEU2ENrLw=s320" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjf7-wAXJmH9SiOAhxTj4m6svlchJtMYZVkNnWSoaPMvaVSAq3Xn8x902jjH_K7CEvubT8Rj09SwcNiKvpy0iVgtLuYyWk-fFvk7O4yoTyqumEJqRMVpJGM5ONAQMibKk6SKFPXaEtWQA09kSzd0RW8Yke8qd-RZiR-b5FI4JwvkPEU2ENrLw=s320" width="320"/></a></div><p> I am delighted to share with all the readers of this blog the news of the launch of <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org" target="_blank">TheoretiCS</a>, a new, top-quality, open-access journal dedicated to the whole of Theoretical Computer Science. The journey leading to the establishment of this new journal has been long and the fact that this path eventually reached its destination is due to the sterling efforts and foresight of a number of people within our community. The seeds of TheoretiCS were sown within the Council of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science during my two terms as president of that association. At that time, <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/jos-baeten" target="_blank">Jos Baeten</a> and <a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/kucera/">Antonin Kucera</a> worked hard to try and set up an open-access journal of the association. That journal never saw the light of day, but the process that eventually led to TheoretiCS was afoot. After some time, <a href="https://ls1-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/en/kontakt-thomas-schwentick" target="_blank">Thomas Schwentick</a> took the baton in the relay race and took decisive steps in turning the establishment of this new journal into a true community effort. It is fair to say that the launch of this journal has involved an unprecedented level of cooperation amongst <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/advisory-board" target="_blank">representatives of leading conferences from across the entire Theoretical Computer Science community</a>. I am immensely grateful to everyone who participated in that work for the effort they put into making TheoretiCS a reality and apologise for not mentioning all the colleagues who contributed explicitly in this post.   You can find more information on TheoretiCS in the text below, which I received from Jos Baeten, founding member-at-large of the Advisory Board of the Theoretics Foundation. </p><p>So, what can you do to support this new journal? There are at least two things that each of us can do and that I believe are important. </p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Help TheoretiCS reach its quality objectives by submitting your best work to it and by encouraging your colleagues to do so too. TheoretiCS aims at publishing articles of a very high quality, and at becoming a reference journal on par with the leading journals in the area. To be accepted, a paper must make a significant contribution of lasting value to a relevant area of TCS, and its presentation must be of high quality. This is elaborated upon in the guiding principles spelled out below. I let you reach your own conclusions about the quality and the breadth of the <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/editorial-board" target="_blank">editorial board of TheoretiCS</a>, which is stellar IMHO. <br/></li><li>Spread the news of the launch of TheoretiCS within your networks. Despite its many years of existence and the role it plays within our community, I still meet colleagues (even in Theoretical Computer Science) who do not know that <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics" target="_blank">LIPIcs</a> exists and who claim that publishing conference proceedings with commercial publishers is a sign of scientific quality. </li></ol><p>If you happen to be in a position to do so, you can support the <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/theoretics-foundation" target="_blank">TheoretiCS foundation</a>, which is a German not-for-profit organization, by making a donation. </p><p/><p>I look forward to seeing the developments of TheoretiCS. Even though predicting the future is difficult, I have no doubt that the journal will become a coveted outlet, with the help of the community it aims to serve. Welcome to TheoretiCS and good luck!</p><p/><p><br/>=== Additional information about the journal ===<br/><br/>---  Guiding principles and objectives  ---<br/><br/>- We believe that our field (and science in general) needs more 'virtuous' open-access journals, a whole eco-system of them, with various levels of specialization and of selectivity. We also believe that, along with the structuring role played by conferences in theoretical computer science, we collectively need to re-develop the practice of journal publications.<br/><br/>- The scope of TheoretiCS is the whole of Theoretical Computer Science, understood in an inclusive meaning (concretely: including, but not restricted to, the Theory of Computing and the Theory of Programming; or equivalently, the so-called TCS-A and TCS-B, reminiscent of Jan van Leeuwen's Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science).<br/><br/>- Our aim is to rapidly become a reference journal and to contribute to the unity of the Theoretical Computer Science global community. In particular, we will seek to publish only papers that make a very significant contribution to their respective fields, that strive to be accessible to a wider audience within theoretical computer science, and that are, generally, of a quality on par with the very best journals in the field.<br/><br/>- TheoretiCS adheres to the principles of 'virtuous' open-access: there is no charge to read the journal, nor to publish in it. The copyright of the papers remains with the authors, under a Creative Commons license.<br/><br/><br/>---  Editorial Board  ---<br/><br/>The inaugural Editors-in-Chief are Javier Esparza (TU München) and Uri Zwick (Tel Aviv U.). The entire Editorial Board can be seen at <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">https://theoretics-journal.org</a> (see below as well).<br/><br/><br/>---  Organization and a bit of history  ---<br/><br/>The project built on groundwork laid in the Council of the EATCS, and started in 2019 and underwent a long gestation. From the start, we wanted to have a thorough discussion with a wide representation of the community, on how to best implement the guiding principles sketched above. It was deemed essential to make sure that all fields of theoretical computer science would feel at home in this journal, and that it would be recognized as a valid venue for publication all over the world.<br/><br/>This resulted in the creation of an Advisory Board, composed of representatives of most of the main conferences in the field (currently APPROX, CCC, COLT, CONCUR, CSL, FOCS, FoSSaCS, FSCD, FSTTCS, ICALP, ICDT, ITCS, LICS, MFCS, PODC, SoCG, SODA, STACS, STOC, TCC) and of so-called members-at-large. The composition of this Advisory Board, which may still evolve, can be consulted at <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">https://theoretics-journal.org</a>.<br/><br/><br/>---  Logistics and answers to some natural questions  ---<br/><br/>- The journal is published by the TheoretiCS Foundation, a non-profit foundation established under German law. <br/><br/>- TheoretiCS is based on the platform episciences.org, in the spirit of a so-called overlay journal.<br/><br/>- The Advisory Board, together with the Editors-in-Chief and the Managing Editors, devolved much of their efforts to designing and implementing an efficient 2-phase review system: efficient in terms of the added-value it brings to the published papers and their authors, and of the time it takes. Yet, as this review system relies in an essential fashion on the work and expertise of colleagues (like in all classical reputable journals), we cannot guarantee a fixed duration for the evaluation of the papers submitted to TheoretiCS.<br/><br/>- Being charge-free for authors and readers does not mean that there is no cost to publishing a journal. These costs are supported for the foreseeable future by academic institutions (at the moment, CNRS and Inria, in France; others may join).<br/><br/>- The journal will have an ISSN, and each paper will have a DOI. There will be no print edition.<br/><br/><br/>---  Editorial Board  ---<br/><br/>Editors-in-Chief<br/><br/>    Javier Esparza (Technische Universität München, Munich)<br/>    Uri Zwick (Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv)<br/><br/>Managing  Editors<br/><br/>    Antoine Amarilli (Institut polytechnique de Paris, Télécom Paris)<br/>    Nathanaël Fijalkow (CNRS, Bordeaux, and The Alan Turing Institute of Data Science, London)<br/><br/>Editors<br/><br/>    Martin Abadi, Google, USA<br/>    Andris Ambainis, U. of Latvia<br/>    Albert Atserias, UPC, Barcelona<br/>    Haris Aziz, UNSW, Sydney<br/>    David Basin, ETH Zürich<br/>    Patricia Bouyer, CNRS, Paris-Saclay<br/>    Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Università di Milano<br/>    Anuj Dawar, Cambridge University<br/>    Luc Devroye,  McGill University, Montreal<br/>    Jacob Fox, Stanford University<br/>    Mohsen Ghaffari, ETH Zürich<br/>    Georg Gottlob, Oxford University<br/>    Anupam Gupta, Carnegie-Mellon University<br/>    Venkatesan Guruswami, Carnegie-Mellon University<br/>    Johan Håstad, KTH, Stockholm<br/>    Ravi Kannan, Microsoft Research India, Bengaluru<br/>    Anna Karlin, University of Washington, Seattle<br/>    Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo<br/>    Valerie King, University of Victoria<br/>    Robert Kleinberg, Cornell University<br/>    Naoki Kobayashi, University of Tokyo<br/>    Elias Koutsoupias, Oxford University<br/>    Xavier Leroy, Collège de France, Paris<br/>    Katrina Ligett, Hebrew University, Jerusalem<br/>    Rupak Majumdar, MPI-SWS, Kaiserslautern<br/>    Joseph Mitchell, State University of New York at Stony Brook<br/>    Mehryar Mohri, Google and New York University<br/>    David Mount, University of Maryland<br/>    Anca Muscholl, Université de Bordeaux<br/>    Danupon Nanongkai, University of Copenhagen<br/>    Moni Naor, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot<br/>    Catuscia Palamidessi, Inria, Palaiseau<br/>    Michał Pilipczuk, University of Warsaw<br/>    Jean-Francois Raskin, Université Libre de Bruxelles<br/>    Peter Sanders, KIT, Karlsruhe<br/>    Davide Sangiorgi, Università di Bologna<br/>    Nitin Saxena, IIT Kanpur<br/>    Alistair Sinclair, UC Berkeley<br/>    Ola Svensson, EPF Lausanne<br/>    Gregory Valiant, Stanford University<br/>    Stephanie Weirich, University of Pennsylvania<br/>    Virginia V.
