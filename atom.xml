<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> 	Should everyone be taught coding in high school? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Today we will discuss their recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-all-children-learn-to-code-by-the-end-of-high-school-11582513441">comments</a> on this issue.</p>
<p>
Bob is a long-time friend of mine, so I want to say that that up front. He is a professor of computer science at Princeton. Cuban is an emeritus professor of education at Stanford. Note, I do not know Cuban but will call him Larry—I hope that is fine. Besides what they say in the article, Larry wrote a <a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2017/07/11/coding-the-new-vocationalism-part-1/">three</a>–<a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2017/07/14/coding-the-new-vocationalism-part-2/">part</a> <a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2017/07/17/coding-the-new-vocationalism-part-3/">series</a> in 2017 on his own education blog, while Bob was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/12/11/president-obama-talks-about-teaching-everyone-to-code-this-professor-does-it/">associated</a> with a 2013 White House-led <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/12/obama-code/">initiative</a> on coding in schools.</p>
<p>
The article consists of ten short paragraphs by Bob followed by eleven from Larry. This is sequential structure—like with statements <img alt="{S_1; S_2;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_1%3B+S_2%3B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_1; S_2;}"/>—or like having candidate town-halls for consectuive hours on CNN and such. What we’d like to see is a debate—like having parallel processes that must sync and communicate. Below we imagine one based on statements in the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Conversation </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The following is a paraphrase that tries to re-structure some of the article in debate format.</p>
<p/><p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<em>Bob:</em> <font color="#000000"> Teaching students to code will help them understand logical thinking, and foster creativity.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Larry:</i> <font color="#000000"> You could say the same for teaching writing, math, history, and many others subjects. There is no research that shows that coding is better than other topics in this regard.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Bob:</i> <font color="#000000"> I am not aware of any research that shows that each topic that is taught now is better than coding.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Larry:</i> <font color="#000000"> Yes that is true, but consider how durable core education has been for our society. A century ago, industrial groups pushed the federal government to require vocational training in schools for particular industrial and agricultural skills and to establish separate vocational schools. Those undermined the broader goals of social development and civic engagement.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Bob:</i> <font color="#000000"> Technology is basic to much of society’s issues. Perhaps the Iowa caucus fiasco could have been avoided if they had a better understanding of computing.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Larry:</i> <font color="#000000"> I think the main argument for coding is being pushed by technology CEO’s. They need more coders. The educational system should not just do what they need. Do you not agree Bob?</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Bob:</i> <font color="#000000">If we teach coding it seems that it may help in lessening economic and gender based gaps. In summary, in the last millennium, education was based on reading, writing, and arithmetic. Perhaps we should now switch to reading, writing, and computing. Coding includes arithmetic and a whole lot more.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Larry:</i> <font color="#000000"> I agree education should help students achieve their potential. I just do not see that coding will do this. And further, data and projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show only an 11 percent increase in IT jobs, from 4.5 to 5 million, between 2018 and 2028. That’s going out a whole decade and still IT will only be about 3 percent of all jobs. Health care will <em>grow</em> in that time by as many jobs as IT has total.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Bob:</i> <font color="#000000"> Those percentages hide much of the benefit. Only a fraction of the thousands I have taught—in person and online—work in tech companies. The rest have gone into a broad variety of careers. Coding literacy is becoming a necessity in health care, social assistance, business services, construction, entertainment, manufacturing, and even politics. </font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
<font color="#0044cc"><br/>
<i>Larry:</i> <font color="#000000"> But what would you cut to make room? Foreign language? History? Arts or music? Or decrease other aspects of math and science? Curricula are already crowded with required courses and frequent testing.</font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What should the role of coding be in our society? Who is right?</p>
<p/></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></div>

    <title>TR20-025 |  Efficient Isolation of Perfect Matching in O(log n) Genus Bipartite Graphs | 

	Chetan Gupta, 

	Vimal Raj Sharma, 

	Raghunath Tewari</title>
    <summary>We show that given an embedding of an O(log n) genus bipartite graph, one can construct an edge weight function in logarithmic space, with respect to which the minimum weight perfect matching in the graph is unique, if one exists. 

As a consequence, we obtain that deciding whether the graph has a perfect matching or not is in SPL. In 1999, Reinhardt, Allender and Zhou proved that if one can construct a polynomially bounded weight function for a graph in logspace such that it isolates a minimum weight perfect matching in the graph, then the perfect matching problem can be solved in SPL. In this paper, we give a deterministic logspace construction of such a weight function.</summary>

    <title>TR20-024 |  Randomized and Symmetric Catalytic Computation | 

	Samir Datta, 

	Chetan Gupta, 

	Rahul Jain, 

	Vimal Raj Sharma, 

	Raghunath Tewari</title>
    <summary>A catalytic Turing machine is a model of computation that is created by equipping a Turing machine with an additional auxiliary tape which is initially filled with arbitrary content; the machine can read or write on auxiliary tape during the computation but when it halts auxiliary tape’s initial content must be restored. In this paper, we study the power of catalytic Turing machines with O(log n)-sized clean tape and a polynomial-sized auxiliary tape.

We introduce the notion of randomized catalytic Turing machine and show that the resulting complexity class CBPL is contained in the class ZPP. We also introduce the notion of symmetricity in the context of catalytic computation and prove that, under a widely believed assumption, in the logspace setting the power of a randomized catalytic Turing machine and a symmetric catalytic Turing machine is equal to a deterministic catalytic Turing machine which runs in polynomial time.</summary>

multiplication) and extremal combinatorics (e.g., the cap set problem and the
sunflower problem), we introduce the geometric rank as a new tool in the study
of tensors and hypergraphs. We prove that the geometric rank is an upper bound
on the subrank of tensors and the independence number of hypergraphs. We prove
that the geometric rank is smaller than the slice rank of Tao, and relate
geometric rank to the analytic rank of Gowers and Wolf in an asymptotic
fashion. As a first application, we use geometric rank to prove a tight upper
bound on the (border) subrank of the matrix multiplication tensors, matching
Strassen's well-known lower bound from 1987.

privacy. Given samples from an unknown probability distribution $p$ and a set
of $k$ probability distributions $\mathcal{Q}$, we aim to output, under the
constraints of $\varepsilon$-local differential privacy, a distribution from
$\mathcal{Q}$ whose total variation distance to $p$ is comparable to the best
such distribution. This is a generalization of the classic problem of $k$-wise
simple hypothesis testing, which corresponds to when $p \in \mathcal{Q}$, and
we wish to identify $p$. Absent privacy constraints, this problem requires
$O(\log k)$ samples from $p$, and it was recently shown that the same
complexity is achievable under (central) differential privacy. However, the
naive approach to this problem under local differential privacy would require
$\tilde O(k^2)$ samples.
</p>
<p>We first show that the constraint of local differential privacy incurs an
exponential increase in cost: any algorithm for this problem requires at least
$\Omega(k)$ samples. Second, for the special case of $k$-wise simple hypothesis
testing, we provide a non-interactive algorithm which nearly matches this
bound, requiring $\tilde O(k)$ samples. Finally, we provide sequentially
interactive algorithms for the general case, requiring $\tilde O(k)$ samples
and only $O(\log \log k)$ rounds of interactivity. Our algorithms are achieved
through a reduction to maximum selection with adversarial comparators, a
problem of independent interest for which we initiate study in the parallel
setting. For this problem, we provide a family of algorithms for each number of
allowed rounds of interaction $t$, as well as lower bounds showing that they
are near-optimal for every $t$. Notably, our algorithms result in exponential
improvements on the round complexity of previous methods.

differentially private mean estimation of distributions with bounded $k$-th

sufficient to estimate the mean to $\alpha$-accuracy under
$\varepsilon$-differential privacy, or any of its common relaxations. This
result demonstrates a qualitatively different behavior compared to estimation
absent privacy constraints, for which the sample complexity is identical for
all $k \geq 2$. We also give algorithms for the multivariate setting whose
sample complexity is a factor of $O(d)$ larger than the univariate case.

prototypical example, the Ising model) under the constraint of differential
privacy. Our learning goals include both structure learning, where we try to
estimate the underlying graph structure of the model, as well as the harder
goal of parameter learning, in which we additionally estimate the parameter on
each edge. We provide algorithms and lower bounds for both problems under a
variety of privacy constraints -- namely pure, concentrated, and approximate
differential privacy. While non-privately, both learning goals enjoy roughly
the same complexity, we show that this is not the case under differential
privacy. In particular, only structure learning under approximate differential
privacy maintains the non-private logarithmic dependence on the dimensionality
of the data, while a change in either the learning goal or the privacy notion
would necessitate a polynomial dependence. As a result, we show that the
privacy constraint imposes a strong separation between these two learning
problems in the high-dimensional data regime.

it possible to detect different types of clustering structure in the same
graph. These objectives also provide a unifying view of other non-parametric
objectives, which often can be captured as special cases. Previous research has
largely focused on parametric objectives for standard graphs, in which all
nodes are of the same type, and edges model pairwise relationships. In our
work, we introduced parameterized objective functions and approximation
algorithms specifically for clustering bipartite graphs and hypergraphs, based
on correlation clustering. This enables us to develop principled approaches for
clustering datasets with different node types (bipartite graphs) or multiway
relationships (hypergraphs). Our hypergraph objective is related to
higher-order notions of modularity and normalized cut, and is amenable to
approximation algorithms via hypergraph expansion techniques. Our bipartite
objective generalizes standard bipartite correlation clustering, and in a
certain parameter regime is equivalent to bicluster deletion, i.e., removing a
minimum number of edges to separate a bipartite graph into disjoint bicliques.
The problem in general is NP-hard, but we show that in a certain parameter
regime it is equivalent to a bipartite matching problem, meaning that it is
polynomial time solvable in this regime. For other regimes, we provide
approximation guarantees based on LP-rounding. Our results include the first
constant factor approximation algorithm for bicluster deletion. We illustrate
the flexibility of our framework in several experiments. This includes
clustering a food web and an email network based on higher-order motif
structure, detecting clusters of retail products in product review hypergraph,
and evaluating our algorithms across a range of parameter settings on several
real world bipartite graphs.

online retailing platforms. Given models for the users' preferences over
products as well as the number of items they are willing to observe before
clicking on one or abandoning the search, what is the best way to rank the
relevant products in response to a search query?
</p>
<p>In order to capture both popularity and diversity effects, we model the
probability that a user clicks on an element from a subset of products as a
monotone submodular function of this set. We also assume that the patience
level of the users, or the number of items they are willing to observe before
clicking on one or abandoning the search, is a given random variable. Under
those assumptions, the objective functions capturing user engagement or
platform revenue can be written as a new family of submodular optimization
problems over a sequence of elements.
</p>
<p>We call this family of natural optimization problems sequential submodular
optimization. By building on and extending the literature on submodular
maximization subject to matroid constraints, we derive a (1-1/e) optimal
approximation algorithm for maximizing user engagement and a bi-criteria
approximation algorithm for maximizing revenue subject to a lower bound on user
engagement.

Datalog, or not even expressible in fixed-point logic with counting. The border
between the two regimes coincides with an important dichotomy in universal
algebra; in particular, the border can be described by a strong height-one
Maltsev condition. For infinite-domain CSPs the situation is more complicated
even if the template structure of the CSP is model-theoretically tame. We prove
that there is no Maltsev condition that characterises Datalog already for the
CSPs of first-order reducts of (Q;&lt;); such CSPs are called temporal CSPs and
are of fundamental importance in infinite-domain constraint satisfaction. Our
main result is a complete classification of temporal CSPs that can be solved in
Datalog, and that can be solved in fixed point logic (with or without
counting); the classification shows that many of the equivalent conditions in
the finite fail to capture expressibility in any of these formalisms already
for temporal CSPs.

Benson</a>, Jon Kleinberg <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09441">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Local graph clustering algorithms are designed to efficiently detect small
clusters of nodes that are biased to a localized region of a large graph.
Although many techniques have been developed for local clustering in graphs,
very few algorithms have been designed to detect local clusters in hypergraphs,
which better model complex systems involving multiway relationships between
data objects. In this paper we present a framework for local clustering in
hypergraphs based on minimum cuts and maximum flows. Our approach extends
previous research on flow-based local graph clustering, but has been
generalized in a number of key ways. First of all, we demonstrate how to
incorporate recent results on generalized hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problems. This
allows us to accommodate a wide range of different hypergraph cut functions,
which can assign different penalties based on how each hyperedge is split
across different clusters. Furthermore, our algorithm comes with a number of
attractive theoretical properties in terms of recovering nodes sets with low
hypergraph conductance and hypergraph normalized cut scores. Finally, and most
importantly, our method is strongly-local, meaning that its runtime depends
only on the size of an input set. In practice this allows our method to quickly
find localized clusters without exploring an entire input hypergraph. We
demonstrate the power of our method in local cluster detection experiments on
an Amazon product hypergraph and a Stack Overflow question hypergraph. Although
both datasets involve millions of nodes, millions of edges, and a large average
hyperedge size, we are able to detect local clusters in a matter of a few
seconds or a few minutes, depending on the size of the cluster.

algorithm to solve a broad class of total variation (TV) regularization
problems. Unlike the usual $z^k\to x^k$ Gauss-Seidel cycle, the proposed
algorithm performs the special $\overline{x}^{k}\to z^k\to x^k$ cycle. The main
idea for our setting is the recent symmetric Gauss-Seidel (sGS) technique which
is developed for solving the multi-block convex composite problem. This idea
also enables us to build the equivalence between the proposed method and the
well-known accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method. The faster convergence
rate of the proposed algorithm can be directly obtained from the APG framework
and numerical results including image denoising, image deblurring, and analysis
sparse recovery problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm.

    <title>A polynomial lower bound on adaptive complexity of submodular maximization</title>

degree of parallelization. In the context of submodular optimization, adaptive
complexity has become a widely-used measure of an algorithm's "sequentiality".
Algorithms in the adaptive model proceed in rounds, and can issue polynomially
many queries to a function $f$ in each round. The queries in each round must be
independent, produced by a computation that depends only on query results
obtained in previous rounds.
</p>
<p>In this work, we examine two fundamental variants of submodular maximization
in the adaptive complexity model: cardinality-constrained monotone
maximization, and unconstrained non-monotone maximization. Our main result is
that an $r$-round algorithm for cardinality-constrained monotone maximization
cannot achieve a factor better than $1 - 1/e - \Omega(\min \{ \frac{1}{r},
\frac{\log^2 n}{r^3} \})$, for any $r &lt; n^c$ (where $c&gt;0$ is some constant).
This is the first result showing that the number of rounds must blow up
polynomially large as we approach the optimal factor of $1-1/e$.
</p>
<p>For the unconstrained non-monotone maximization problem, we show a positive
result: For every instance, and every $\delta&gt;0$, either we obtain a
$(1/2-\delta)$-approximation in $1$ round, or a
$(1/2+\Omega(\delta^2))$-approximation in $O(1/\delta^2)$ rounds. In particular
(in contrast to the cardinality-constrained case), there cannot be an instance
where (i) it is impossible to achieve a factor better than $1/2$ regardless of
the number of rounds, and (ii) it takes $r$ rounds to achieve a factor of
$1/2-O(1/r)$.

often desirable when duplicate samples are not beneficial. Within machine
learning, sampling is useful for generating diverse outputs from a trained
model. We present an elegant procedure for sampling without replacement from a
broad class of randomized programs, including generative neural models that
construct outputs sequentially. Our procedure is efficient even for
exponentially-large output spaces. Unlike prior work, our approach is
incremental, i.e., samples can be drawn one at a time, allowing for increased
flexibility. We also present a new estimator for computing expectations from
samples drawn without replacement. We show that incremental sampling without

In
addition to classical representations using matrices or lists, some compressed
data structures have recently been proposed to represent binary relations in
compact space, such as the $k^2$-tree and the Binary Relation Wavelet Tree
(BRWT). Knowing their storage needs, supported operations and time performance
is key for enabling an appropriate choice of data representation given a domain
or application, its data distribution and typical operations that are computed
over the data.
</p>
<p>In this work, we present an empirical comparison among several compressed
representations for binary relations. We analyze their space usage and the
speed of their operations using different (synthetic and real) data
distributions. We include both neighborhood and set operations, also proposing
algorithms for set operations for the BRWT, which were not presented before in
the literature. We conclude that there is not a clear choice that outperforms
the rest, but we give some recommendations of usage of each compact
representation depending on the data distribution and types of operations
performed over the data. We also include a scalability study of the data
representations.

problem we call $(r, [{\lambda}, {\mu}])$-DOMINATION (implying a bikernel for
r-PERFECT CODE). At the cost of slightly changing the output graph class these
bikernels can be turned into into kernels. Finally, we demonstrate how these
constructions can be combined to create 'multikernels', meaning graphs who
represent kernels for multiple problems at once. Concretely, we show that
$r$-DOMINATING SET, TOTAL $r$-DOMINATION, and $r$-ROMAN DOMINATION admit a
multikernel; as well as $r$-DOMINATING SET and $2r$-INDEPENDENT SET for
multiple values of $r$ at once.

cover of a graph. This model uses the concept of total tessellation cover to
describe the motion of the walker who is allowed to hop both to vertices and
edges of the graph, in contrast with previous models in which the walker hops
either to vertices or edges. We establish bounds on $T_t(G)$, which is the
smallest number of tessellations required in a total tessellation cover of $G$.
We highlight two of these lower bounds $T_t(G) \geq \omega(G)$ and $T_t(G)\geq
is(G)+1$, where $\omega(G)$ is the size of a maximum clique and $is(G)$ is the
number of edges of a maximum induced star subgraph. Using these bounds, we
define the good total tessellable graphs with either $T_t(G)=\omega(G)$ or
$T_t(G)=is(G)+1$. The $k$-total tessellability problem aims to decide whether a
given graph $G$ has $T_t(G) \leq k$. We show that $k$-total tessellability is
in $\mathcal{P}$ for good total tessellable graphs. We establish the
$\mathcal{NP}$-completeness of the following problems when restricted to the
following classes: ($is(G)+1$)-total tessellability for graphs with $\omega(G)
= 2$; $\omega(G)$-total tessellability for graphs $G$ with $is(G)+1 = 3$;
$k$-total tessellability for graphs $G$ with $\max\{\omega(G), is(G)+1\}$ far
from $k$; and $4$-total tessellability for graphs $G$ with $\omega(G) = is(G)+1
= 4$. As a consequence, we establish hardness results for bipartite graphs,
line graphs of triangle-free graphs, universal graphs, planar graphs, and
$(2,1)$-chordal graphs.

measure between shapes. In order to approximate $d_{GH}$ for compact subsets
$X,Y\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, we look into its relationship with $d_{H,iso}$, the
infimum Hausdorff distance under Euclidean isometries. As already known for
dimension $d\geq 2$, the $d_{H,iso}$ cannot be bounded above by a constant
factor times $d_{GH}$. For $d=1$, however, we prove that
$d_{H,iso}\leq\frac{5}{4}d_{GH}$. We also show that the bound is tight. In
effect, this gives rise to an $O(n\log{n})$-time algorithm to approximate
$d_{GH}$ with an approximation factor of $\left(1+\frac{1}{4}\right)$.

    <summary>We present the first explicit construction of a  non-malleable code that can handle tampering functions that are bounded-degree polynomials. 

Prior to our work, this was only known  for  degree-1 polynomials (affine tampering functions), due to  Chattopadhyay and Li (STOC 2017). As a direct corollary, we obtain an explicit non-malleable code that is secure against tampering by bounded-size arithmetic circuits.

We show applications of our non-malleable code in constructing   non-malleable secret sharing schemes that are robust against bounded-degree polynomial tampering. In fact our result is stronger: we can handle adversaries that can adaptively choose the polynomial tampering function based on initial leakage of a bounded number of shares.

Our results are derived from explicit constructions of  seedless non-malleable extractors that can handle bounded-degree polynomial tampering functions. Prior to our work, no such result was known even for degree-2 (quadratic) polynomials.</summary>

    <title>Two applications of maximum matching</title>
    <summary>This quarter I’m teaching a course on graph algorithms (an upper-division elective, so only around 200 students; our required classes are much bigger) and we’ve reached the part of the course where we discuss matching. Motivating bipartite matching, perfect matching, weighted matching, and stable matching are all easy enough but I wanted a few more examples of applications of non-bipartite maximum-cardinality matching, so I asked my colleague Vijay Vazirani who responded with two cute ones that I wasn’t already familiar with.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This quarter I’m teaching a course on graph algorithms (an upper-division elective, so only around 200 students; our required classes are much bigger) and we’ve reached the part of the course where we discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)">matching</a>. Motivating bipartite matching, perfect matching, weighted matching, and stable matching are all easy enough but I wanted a few more examples of applications of non-bipartite <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/02/22/Maximum cardinality matching">maximum-cardinality matching</a>, so I asked my colleague Vijay Vazirani who responded with two cute ones that I wasn’t already familiar with.</p>

<p>His first suggestion was two-processor scheduling. To keep things simple and concrete let’s assume that we have a collection of equal-length tasks, with a partial ordering (or DAG) describing their timing constraints. If we have one processor to perform them on (or one person to perform them), the obvious solution is to schedule them according to a linear extension of the partial order (a topological ordering of the DAG), allowing them to all be performed with no delays, in total time equal to the number of tasks. But now suppose that there are two processors or people performing the tasks, so we can process two tasks at a time and, ideally, finish twice as quickly. We would like to find a schedule with as many compatible pairs of tasks as we can, saving as many time slots as there are pairs. Two tasks are compatible if they are incomparable in the partial order (there is no path between them in the DAG), so it looks like we simply need to find a maximum matching in the incomparability graph of the partial order. This doesn’t quite work because two matched pairs can “cross”,
unable to both be used in the same schedule because each pair contains an element constrained to be earlier than an element of the other pair. But when this happens, it’s possible to uncross them and get another matching that’s at least as good, eventually reaching a matching without any crossings that can be topologically ordered to give an optimal schedule. The connection between this scheduling problem and matching appears to come from Fujii, Kasami, and Ninamiya, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0117070">Optimal sequencing of two equivalent processors</a>”, <em>SIAM J. Appl. Math.</em> 1969; for fast algorithms for this special case of matching see H. Gabow, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/322326.322335">An almost-linear algorithm for two-processor scheduling</a>”, <em>JACM</em> 1982.</p>

<p>Another application, closer to the real world, comes from a problem of matching kidney donors to kidney donor recipients. But we don’t use the obvious bipartite graph of donors and recipients. Most kidney transplant recipients enter the matching process paired up already with a friend or relative who is willing to donote one of their kidneys, because otherwise there wouldn’t be enough kidneys to go around. But usually these donor-recipient pairs are incompatible with each other, so they need to find another donor-recipient pair such that the donors from each pair are compatible with the recipients from the other pair. Then, all four people get together at the same hospital and trade kidneys. More complicated exchanges of three or more pairs are not done, because that would require simultaneous operations with six or more people and significantly greater chances that one of them will back out at the last minute. So to save as many lives as possible, we need a maximum matching on a graph whose vertices are donor-recipient pairs and whose edges represent double compatibility of pairs. There’s a big literature on kidney exchange but the source for the connection to maximum matching appears to be A. E. Roth, T. Sönmez, and M. U. Ünver, “<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w10698.pdf">Pairwise kidney exchange</a>”, <em>J. Econ. Th.</em> 2005.
If pairwise compatibility is an equivalence relation then the matching part is trivial (it’s just matching in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_graph">disjoint union of cliques</a>) but this framework is flexible enough to handle arbitrary non-transitive compatibility relations.</p>

<p>I learned of the kidney donor matching application a little too late to incorporate it into my introductory lecture on matching, so I used the other one. But next time I’ll be prepared with both!</p>

    <title>TR20-022 |  Interactive Error Resilience Beyond $\frac{2}{7}$ | 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Gillat Kol, 

	Raghuvansh Saxena</title>
    <summary>Interactive error correcting codes can protect interactive communication protocols against a constant fraction of adversarial errors, while incurring only a constant multiplicative overhead in the total communication. What is the maximum fraction of errors that such codes can protect against? 

For the non-adaptive channel, where the parties must agree in advance on the order in which they communicate, Braverman and Rao prove that the maximum error resilience is~$\frac{1}{4}$ (STOC, 2011). Ghaffari, Haeupler, and Sudan (STOC, 2014) consider the {\em adaptive} channel, where the order in which the parties communicate may not be fixed, and give a clever protocol that is resilient to a $\frac{2}{7}$ fraction of errors. This was believed to be optimal. 

We revisit this result, and show how to overcome the $\frac{2}{7}$ barrier. Specifically, we show that, over the adaptive channel, every two-party communication protocol can be converted to a protocol that is resilient to $\frac{7}{24} &gt; \frac{2}{7}$ fraction of errors with only a constant multiplicative overhead to the total communication. The protocol is obtained by a novel implementation of a feedback mechanism over the adaptive channel.</summary>

    <title>TR20-021 |  NP-Hardness of Circuit Minimization for Multi-Output Functions | 

	Rahul Ilango, 

	Bruno Loff, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira</title>
    <summary>Can we design efficient algorithms for finding fast algorithms? This question is captured by various circuit minimization problems, and algorithms for the corresponding tasks have significant practical applications. Following the work of Cook and Levin in the early 1970s, a central question is whether minimizing the circuit size of an explicitly given function is ${NP}$-complete. While this is known to hold in restricted models such as DNFs, making progress with respect to more expressive classes of circuits has been elusive.  

In this work, we establish the first ${NP}$-hardness result for circuit minimization of total functions in the setting of general (unrestricted) Boolean circuits. More precisely, we show that computing the minimum circuit size of a given multi-output Boolean function $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ is ${NP}$-hard under many-one polynomial-time randomized reductions. Our argument builds on a simpler ${NP}$-hardness proof for the circuit minimization problem for (single-output) Boolean functions under an extended set of generators.

Complementing these results, we investigate the computational hardness of minimizing communication. We establish that several variants of this problem are ${NP}$-hard under deterministic reductions. In particular, unless ${P} = {NP}$, no polynomial-time computable function can approximate the deterministic two-party communication complexity of a partial Boolean function up to a polynomial. This has consequences for the class of structural results that one might hope to show about the communication complexity of partial functions.</summary>

    <title>TR20-020 |  Improved Approximate Degree Bounds For $k$-distinctness | 

	Shuchen Zhu, 

	Justin Thaler, 

	Nikhil Mande</title>
    <summary>An open problem that is widely regarded as one of the most important in quantum query complexity is to resolve the quantum query complexity of the $k$-distinctness function on inputs of size $N$. While the case of $k=2$ (also called Element Distinctness) is well-understood, there is a polynomial gap between the known upper and lower bounds for all constants $k&gt;2$. Specifically, the best known upper bound is $O(N^{(3/4)-1/(2^{k+2}-4)})$ (Belovs, FOCS 2012), while the best known lower bound for $k &gt;= 2$ is $\Omega(N^{2/3} + N^{(3/4)-1/(2k)})$ (Aaronson and Shi, J.~ACM 2004; Bun, Kothari, and Thaler, STOC 2018).
For any constant $k &gt;= 4$, we improve the lower bound to $\Omega(N^{(3/4)-1/(4k)})$. This yields, for example, the first proof that $4$-distinctness is strictly harder than Element Distinctness. Our lower bound applies more generally to approximate degree.
As a secondary result, we give a simple construction of an approximating polynomial of degree $O(N^{3/4})$ that applies whenever $k &lt;= polylog(N)$.</summary>

<p>
<em>Dr. Strangelove</em> is the classic 1964 movie about the potential for nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union during the cold war. The film was directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Peter Sellers, George Scott, Sterling Hayden, and Slim Pickens. </p>
<p>
Today we try to explain the P=NP problem in an “analog” fashion.</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a>, US President Merkin Muffley wishes to recall a group of US bombers that are incorrectly about to drop nuclear weapons on Russia. He hopes to stop war. Here is the conversation between General Turgidson played by Scott and Muffley played by Sellers, in which Turgidson informs that the recall message will not be received…</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt><br/>
<b>Turgidson:</b> 	…unless the message is preceded by the correct three-letter prefix. </tt></p><tt>
<p><b>Muffley:</b> 	Then do you mean to tell me, General Turgidson, that you will be unable to 	recall the aircraft? </p>
<p><b>Turgidson:</b> 	That’s about the size of it. However, we are plowing through every possible 	three letter combination of the code. But since there are seventeen thousand 	permutations it’s going to take us about two and a half days to transmit them all. </p>
<p><b>Muffley:</b> 	How soon did you say the planes would penetrate Russian radar cover? </p>
</tt><p><tt><b>Turgidson:</b> 	About eighteen minutes from now, sir.<br/>
</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is the problem that P=NP addresses. How do you find a solution to a problem that has many potential solutions? In this case there are over thousands of possible combinations. Since each requires sending a message to an electronic unit that sits on a plane, thousands of miles away, and since messages cannot be sent too often, it will take much too long to find the secret message. </p>
<p>
The central P=NP question is: Can we do better than trying all possibilities? The answer is yes—at least in the case of the movie, the secret combination is indeed found. More on that in a moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Opening Mechanical Locks </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> the issue is finding the three letter code for a certain device that sits on the bombers. The protocol is: Send a three letter code to the bombers. If the code is correct, then the bombers will be recalled, and all is saved. If the code is wrong, then nothing happens. </p>
<p>
Instead of this, consider the same type of problem for finding the combination to a mechanical lock. That is a lock that is often at a gym, for example, to protect your belongings. Recall you spin the lock’s dial three times to the right, stop on the first number, then turn one time to the left, stop on the second number, and finally go to the right to stop at the third number. Then you pull the lock open.</p>
<p>
This works provided you know the combination. In general there are 64,000 such combinations. So unless you know the numbers, you are in trouble. Trying all possible combinations is not possible for mortals. But there is hope. It is possible to find the combination without knowing it. This is possible provided: <i>You have the combination lock in your hands</i>. </p>
<p>
If you only can send a possible combination to someone else to try, you are out of luck. Unfortunately in Dr. Strangelove the device on the bomber is not in your hands. So as the General says, we are trying all the possible combinations one at a time. But if the device is local you can do better.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Breaking The Locks </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
There are many <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Combination-Locks-Without-a-Code">sites</a> on the web that explain how to do much better. Here is one way to find the first number for a lock:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Pull up gently on the shackle and hold it in place. Turn the dial clockwise listening carefully until you hear the lock click. <p/>
</li><li>
Start with a good deal of pressure and gently let up as you spin it around, until you meet resistance in only one place. It should catch in only one place, making a click. <p/>
</li><li>
Add 5 to that number and write it down.
</li></ol>
<p>
This is the first number in the combination. There are similar methods to get the remaining two numbers. But already you have reduced the choices for the combination from 64,000 by a factor of 40. The rest of the how-to-do rules help you get the remaining two numbers. </p>
<p/><p/>
<table style="margin: auto;">

<p>
Note this attack relies on physical properties of the lock. A lock is made from springs and gears and rods, and is not perfect. As you turn the dial the mechanical parts rub and make noises. These noises reveal information, that is useful to you. Information that can reveal the combination of the lock.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Opening Digital Locks </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The point is that there is a way to open a lock without knowing the combination. Here the trick is that you can try and use the lock and play with it in a way that it reveals information about its secret combination. This is what the P=NP question asks: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Are there ways to manipulate a digital lock and get it to reveal information?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Put another way: <i>Do digital locks make noise?</i> </p>
<p>
Essentially P=NP is true if digital locks all are imperfect, like mechanical locks. That is, if digital locks all make noise. It is widely believed that is <b>false</b>. The belief is that P<img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neq}"/> NP which means that there are essentially perfect digital locks. That is some digital locks make no noise. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> P<img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\neq}"/> NP </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Why is it believed that digital locks can be perfect? Well the answer is simple. To date certain types of digital locks have not been broken. That is no one yet knows how to make them click and reveal information. This is of course a dangerous position for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
The failure to break a lock does not mean that someone cleverer cannot break it. <p/>
</li><li>
There are reasons that if some people knew how to break certain digital locks that they would <i>not</i> tell anyone. They might prefer to keep their ability secret to make money or cause harm. <p/>
</li><li>
Finally, it seems dangerous to guess that anything can be done without noise.
</li></ol>
<p>
The latter point is that making systems work perfectly is usually impossible. Mechanical systems must have friction of some kind, and it seems possible that digital systems will also. We will see.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Smart Search </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Colonel Ripper, played by Hayden, is the one that launched the bombers against Russia. The recall code is found and the bombers are recalled. An officer named Mandrake, played by Sellers too, notices some doodles on a pad by the crazy Ripper. It is covered with an interlocking pattern of the words Peace On Earth, and Purity Of Essence. Ripper is obsessed with these ideas—do not ask why.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt><br/>
<b>Mandrake:</b> Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth. Peace on Earth: <b>P O E</b>.<br/>
Purity of essence. <b>O P E</b>. (whispers) <b>O P E</b>.<br/>
</tt>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is the key. This information is sent to the Pentagon and soon the bombers are recalled. The search space is cut down from thousands to 6 possible orders. Success. Well if you’ve seen the movie, you know it was not exactly success, but that failure has nothing to do with our attempt to explain the P=NP question.</p>
<p>
This second idea is different from whether locks make noise. It is whether every lock has a giveaway by dint of the process by which we obtained that particular lock to begin with. Note that the lock is not the definition of the problem itself, like SAT or graph 3-coloring, but rather a particular instance of the problem. We have discussed how instances of factoring that tend to be generated by algorithms have collective giveaways in an earlier <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/do-gaps-between-primes-affect-rsa-keys/">post</a>—which quotes another part of <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I love the movie <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>, and love any excuse to talk about it. So please forgive me this story about P=NP. I hope that trying to understand the P=NP question without complex notation may help us better understand it. What do you all think?</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: MIP* denotes the class of problems that admit interactive proofs with quantum entangled provers. It has been an outstanding question to characterize the complexity of MIP*. Most notably, there was no known computable upper bound on this class.<br/>
We show that MIP* is equal to the class RE, the set of recursively enumerable languages. In particular, this shows that MIP* contains uncomputable problems. Through a series of known connections, this also yields a negative answer to Connes’ Embedding Problem from the theory of operator algebras. In this talk, I will explain the connection between Connes’ Embedding Problem, quantum information theory, and complexity theory. I will then give an overview of our approach, which involves reducing the Halting Problem to the problem of approximating the entangled value of nonlocal games.<br/>

    <title>Snowflake spanners</title>
    <summary>My previous post gave an example of a largish random point set where the greedy geometric spanner for distance ratio 2 had no crossings, while the spanner for the lower distance ratio had many (linearly many) crossings. And you might think from that example that there is some threshold for which distance ratios above the threshold always have planar greedy spanners, or even that the threshold is at or below 2. But it’s not true.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/02/17/spanners-have-sparse.html">My previous post</a> gave an example of a largish random point set where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_geometric_spanner">greedy geometric spanner</a> for distance ratio 2 had no crossings, while the spanner for the lower distance ratio had many (linearly many) crossings. And you might think from that example that there is some threshold for which distance ratios above the threshold always have planar greedy spanners, or even that the threshold is at or below 2. But it’s not true.</p>

<p>To see why not, we have to turn to an idea from an earlier paper of mine, “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/9907031">Beta-skeletons have unbounded dilation</a>” (<em>CGTA</em> 2002). In it, I used a flattened variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch snowflake fractal</a> to find bad examples for a different kind of spanner, and the same thing works here too. The intuitive idea is that these fractals form curves that, locally, look nice to a spanner algorithm (just connect consecutive pairs of points along the curve). But they pack a lot of length into a small area, forcing the spanner algorithm to eventually add some shortcuts to the curve. If we can control where it adds the shortcuts, maybe we can make pairs of shortcuts cross.</p>

<p>In fact the Koch snowflake itself almost works, but it has some closest pairs that are non-consecutive along the curve, allowing the greedy spanner algorithm to choose those pairs instead of the consecutive curve points that we want it to choose. If we flatten the snowflake just a little bit, that complication goes away. If we choose the distance ratio of the spanner large enough, we can make it so that the greedy spanner algorithm doesn’t add any shortcuts until it reaches pairs of points that are opposite each other on the curve. And if we make it just barely large enough for that to be true, it will be forced to add those shortcuts once it does reach that distance in the sorted ordering of the distances. For instance, here’s a point set and its non-planar greedy spanner generated in this way with spanning ratio 4:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Greedy spanner of snowflake-like curve with distance ratio 4" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/snowflake.svg"/></p>

<p>This pretty picture, with the three crossing shortcuts between opposite pairs of points, doesn’t quite generalize to arbitrary-order snowflake-like curves, unfortunately. It will always be possible to find a distance ratio  such that the greedy algorithm adds one of these three shortcuts, as the first shortcut it needs to add. But then once it has added it, that shortcut can make the other two opposite pairs of points closer to each other in the spanner than they were, so that the greedy algorithm doesn’t need to add them. We might only get one of these three crossing edges, instead of all three. (In fact, for the point set shown here, this is exactly what happens for spanning ratio 4.5.)</p>

<p>Instead, let’s look for a slightly lower distance ratio , for which the first shortcuts added by the greedy spanner algorithm cut off two lobes of the snowflake instead of three. For the same points as above,  works:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Greedy spanner of snowflake-like curve with distance ratio 3.5" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/snowflake2.svg"/></p>

<p>These two-lobe shortcuts are shorter than the three-lobe shortcuts, so they’re considered earlier by the greedy algorithm. There are two crossing equilateral triangles of two-lobe shortcuts (forming a Star of David pattern) and the greedy algorithm has to include two edges from each equilateral triangle. This is because, for each of these potential shortcuts, the greedy spanner won’t include a better path between its endpoints until it has either that shortcut itself or the two other shortcuts of the same triangle. No matter which two shortcuts we choose from each of the two equilateral triangles, we get either two crossings or, as here, three crossings.</p>

<p>For any order of flattened Koch snowflake, there’s a distance ratio  producing a greedy spanner that looks like this picture, with two or three crossings. And by choosing a snowflake of high-enough order, we can make  become arbitrarily large. Or, to put it another way, the greedy spanner algorithm can generate crossings for arbitrarily large distance ratios.</p>

    <title>TR20-019 |  A note on the explicit constructions of tree codes over polylogarithmic-sized alphabet | 

	Siddharth Bhandari, 

	Prahladh Harsha</title>
    <summary>Recently, Cohen, Haeupler and Schulman gave an explicit construction of binary tree codes over polylogarithmic-sized output alphabet based on Pudl\'{a}k's construction of maximum-distance-separable (MDS)  tree codes using totally-non-singular triangular matrices. In this short note, we give a unified and simpler presentation of Pudl\'{a}k and Cohen-Haeupler-Schulman's constructions.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Its impact on civilization will be exactly opposite.  Rather than concentrating population, it will disperse it.  Commuting and the traffic crisis will disappear.  So will the housing crisis.  You will have a large lot of land with a robot-ready house built new with safe, eco-friendly material and free of hazardous substance.  You will live away from volcanoes, fault lines, tornadoes, wild fires and other hazards. You’ll be able to move to a location with ideal climate, which for historical reasons are now under-populated.  This will dramatically reduce housing costs, especially heating, and solve  or greatly mitigate the pollution problem. Huge amounts of space will be cleared up and given back to nature, or used for housing.</p>



<p>Doctors will visit patients remotely.  This will enable patients to be followed up more regularly and consistently throughout their lives regardless of where they are.  Doctors will have more time to give meaningful advice rather than having the patient wait 1 year for the appointment and then spend 1 hour to get to the doctor for a 10-minute visit of which 8 are spent looking at the screen and filling reports. Robo-tools will take measurements and send them to the doctor.  If a complicated procedure is required, the expert will connect with the patient and the doctor remotely first, and then the patient will schedule a trip for the procedure.</p>



<p>You’ll take gym classes remotely via a remote gym. The instructor will give you personalized advice and follow your progress anywhere, anytime. Demanding facilities like swimming pools will be next to your house.</p>



<p>Courts of law, and the entire judicial system will be taken off-line.</p>



<p>People will vote from home, elections will be more frequent and granular.  Constituents choosing not to vote will (maybe) have to specifically abstain.  This will finally realize the democratic ideal where the government represents the will of the people.</p>



<p>Constituents will be able to participate to discussions, instead of having to travel 1 hour for a 5-minute in-person discussion.  The level of engagement will be measured by the level of engagement as opposed to travel distance.</p>



<p>Wireless won’t be used on a large scale, since its noxious effects will be undeniable. Instead we will have network cables densely spread out over the earth — one of the few duties of the government will be to maintain these cables for the free, democratic, public use.</p>



<p>Banking will be done remotely, and physical money will disappear.</p>



<p>We will have immersive work-stations with wall-to-wall, solar-powered e-ink screens, holographic images, and audio indistinguishable from reality.  You will be able to attend meetings while exercising, like walking or biking on a machine or outside.  This will boost your health, lowering health care costs for all.</p>



<p>People with special needs will have the same opportunities and duties as everyone else and will be fully integrated.</p>



<p>All learning will be done remotely.  The instructor will be able to provide better, more personalized teaching, and connect with each student face-to-face.  Testing will be done remotely, each student monitored via cameras.  Critical examinations will be administered in special-purpose facilities which are next to your house (similar in spirit to say the way GRE is administered, but much more large scale and flexible, including for example synchronized examination).</p>



<p>You will have farms next to your house, growing organic food that you can eat fresh. Epidemics will be much rarer and more easily controlled, as population will be less concentrated and will travel less.</p>



<p>Fantasy? Actually, many of these things are already happening!</p>

    <title>TR20-018 |  Algorithms and Lower Bounds for de Morgan Formulas of Low-Communication Leaf Gates | 

	Valentine Kabanets, 

	Sajin Koroth, 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Dimitrios Myrisiotis, 

	Igor Oliveira</title>
    <summary>The class $FORMULA[s] \circ \mathcal{G}$ consists of Boolean functions computable by size-$s$ de Morgan formulas whose leaves are any Boolean functions from a class $\mathcal{G}$. We give lower bounds and (SAT, Learning, and PRG) algorithms for $FORMULA[n^{1.99}]\circ \mathcal{G}$, for classes $\mathcal{G}$ of functions with low communication complexity. Let $R^{(k)}(\mathcal{G})$ be the maximum $k$-party number-on-forehead randomized communication complexity of a function in $\mathcal{G}$. Among other results, we show:


(1) The Generalized Inner Product function $GIP^k_n$ cannot be computed in  $FORMULA[s]\circ \mathcal{G}$ on more than $1/2+\varepsilon$ fraction of inputs for
    	    $$
    	        s = o \! \left ( \frac{n^2}{ \left(k \cdot 4^k \cdot {R}^{(k)}(\mathcal{G}) \cdot \log (n/\varepsilon) \cdot \log (1/\varepsilon) \right)^{2}} \right).
    	    $$
    	    This significantly extends the lower bounds against bipartite formulas obtained by [Tal17]. As a corollary, we get an average-case lower bound for $GIP^k_n$ against $FORMULA[n^{1.99}]\circ PTF^{k-1}$, i.e., sub-quadratic-size de Morgan formulas with degree-$(k-1)$ PTF (polynomial threshold function) gates at the bottom. Previously, only sub-linear lower bounds were known [Nis94, Vio15] for circuits with PTF gates.
   	 

(2) There is a PRG of seed length $n/2 + O\left( \sqrt{s} \cdot R^{(2)}(\mathcal{G}) \cdot\log(s/\varepsilon) \cdot \log (1/\varepsilon) \right)$ that $\varepsilon$-fools $FORMULA[s] \circ \mathcal{G}$. For the special case of $FORMULA[s] \circ LTF$, i.e., size-$s$ formulas with LTF (linear threshold function) gates at the bottom, we get the better seed length $O\left(n^{1/2}\cdot s^{1/4}\cdot \log(n)\cdot \log(n/\varepsilon)\right)$. In particular, this  provides the first non-trivial PRG (with seed length $o(n)$) for intersections of $n$ half-spaces in the regime where $\varepsilon \leq 1/n$, complementing a recent result of [OST19].


(3) There exists a randomized $2^{n-t}$-time $\#$SAT algorithm for $FORMULA[s] \circ \mathcal{G}$, where
            $$
                t = \Omega\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{s} \cdot \log^2(s)\cdot R^{(2)}(\mathcal{G})}\right)^{1/2}.
            $$ 
            In particular, this implies a nontrivial #SAT algorithm for $FORMULA[n^{1.99}]\circ LTF$.


(4) The Minimum Circuit Size Problem is not in $FORMULA[n^{1.99}] \circ XOR$; thereby making progress on hardness magnification, in connection with results from [OPS19, CJW19]. On the algorithmic side, we show that the concept class $FORMULA[n^{1.99}] \circ XOR$ can be PAC-learned in time $2^{O(n/\log n)}$.</summary>

    <title>TR20-017 |  Multiparty Karchmer-Wigderson Games and Threshold Circuits | 

	Alexander Kozachinskiy, 

	Vladimir Podolskii</title>
    <summary>We suggest a generalization of Karchmer-Wigderson communication games to the multiparty setting. Our generalization turns out to be tightly connected to circuits consisting of threshold gates. This allows us to obtain new explicit constructions of such circuits for several functions. In particular, we provide an explicit (polynomial-time computable) log-depth monotone formula for Majority function, consisting only of 3-bit majority gates and variables. This resolves  a conjecture of Cohen et al. (CRYPTO 2013).</summary>

    <title>TR20-016 |  Hitting Sets Give Two-Sided Derandomization of Small Space | 

	Kuan Cheng, 

	William Hoza</title>
    <summary>A hitting set is a "one-sided" variant of a pseudorandom generator (PRG), naturally suited to derandomizing algorithms that have one-sided error. We study the problem of using a given hitting set to derandomize algorithms that have two-sided error, focusing on space-bounded algorithms. For our first result, we show that if there is a log-space hitting set for polynomial-width read-once branching programs (ROBPs), then not only does $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{RL}$, but $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{BPL}$ as well. This answers a question raised by Hoza and Zuckerman (FOCS 2018).

Next, we consider constant-width ROBPs. We show that if there are log-space hitting sets for constant-width ROBPs, then given black-box access to a constant-width ROBP $f$, it is possible to deterministically estimate $\mathbb{E}[f]$ to within $\pm \varepsilon$ in space $O(\log(n/\varepsilon))$. Unconditionally, we give a deterministic algorithm for this problem with space complexity $O(\log^2 n + \log(1/\varepsilon))$, slightly improving over previous work.

Finally, we investigate the limits of this line of work. Perhaps the strongest reduction along these lines one could hope for would say that for every explicit hitting set, there is an explicit PRG with similar parameters. In the setting of constant-width ROBPs over a large alphabet, we prove that establishing such a strong reduction is at least as difficult as constructing a good PRG outright. Quantitatively, we prove that if the strong reduction holds, then for every constant $\alpha &gt; 0$, there is an explicit PRG for constant-width ROBPs with seed length $O(\log^{1 + \alpha} n)$. Along the way, unconditionally, we construct an improved hitting set for ROBPs over a large alphabet.</summary>

<p>As part of my speaking tour, in the last month I’ve already given talks at the following fine places:</p>



<p>World Economic Forum at Davos<br/>University of Waterloo<br/>Perimeter Institute<br/>UC Berkeley<br/>Harvard<br/>MIT<br/>Princeton<br/>University of Houston</p>



<p>And I’ll be giving talks at the following places over the next couple of months:</p>

<p>For anyone who’s interested, I’ll add links and dates to this post later (if you want that to happen any faster, feel free to hunt them down for me!).</p>



<p>In the meantime, there are also interviews!  See, for example, <a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/why-quantum-computing-gets-special-attention-in-the-trump-administrations-budget-proposal/">this 5-minute one on Texas Standard</a> (an NPR affiliate), where I’m asked about the current state of quantum computing in the US, in light of the Trump administration’s recent proposal to give a big boost to quantum computing and AI research, even while slashing and burning basic science more broadly.  I made some critical comments—for example, about the need to support the whole basic research ecosystem (I pointed out that “quantum computing can’t thrive in isolation”), and also about the urgent need to make it feasible for the best researchers from around the world to get US visas and green cards.  Unfortunately, those parts seem to have been edited out, in favor of my explanations of basic points about quantum computing.</p>



<p><strong>More Updates:</strong></p>



<p>There was a discussion on Twitter of the ethics of the “Quantum Bullshit Detector” Twitter feed—which dishes out vigilante justice,  like some dark and troubled comic-book hero, by rendering anonymous, unexplained, unaccountable, very often correct albeit not infallible verdicts of “Bullshit” or “Not Bullshit” on claimed quantum information advances.  As part of that discussion, <a href="https://twitter.com/cjsavoie/status/1229495571016278017">Christopher Savoie wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[Criticizing] is what we do in science.  [But not calling] “bullshit” anonymously and without any accountability.  Look at Scott Aaronson’s blog.  He takes strong positions.  But as Scott.  I respect that.</p></blockquote>



<p>What do people think: should “He takes strong positions.  But as Scott.” be added onto the <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> header bar?</p>



<p>In other news, I was amused by the following headline, for a <em>Vice</em> story about the MIP*=RE breakthrough: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xgqg9a/mathematicians-are-studying-planet-sized-quantum-computers-with-god-like-powers">Mathematicians Are Studying Planet-Sized Supercomputers With God-Like Powers</a>.  (If I’m going to quibble about accuracy: only planet-sized???)</p></div>

    <title>Spanners have sparse crossings</title>
    <summary>In a 2017 SIGSPATIAL paper with Sid Gupta, Sid and I modeled non-planar road networks as graph drawings whose edges intersect sparsely, and showed that this implies that these graphs have small separators, allowing algorithms designed for planar graphs (such as linear-time shortest paths) to be extended to them. My latest preprint, with UCI student Hadi Khodabandeh, uses similar ideas of sparse edge intersections to show that greedy geometric spanners also have small separators. The paper is “On the edge crossings of the greedy spanner” (arXiv:2002.05854).</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06113">2017 SIGSPATIAL paper</a> with Sid Gupta, Sid and I <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2017/09/19/graphs-with-sparse.html">modeled non-planar road networks as graph drawings whose edges intersect sparsely, and showed that this implies that these graphs have small separators</a>, allowing algorithms designed for planar graphs (such as linear-time shortest paths) to be extended to them. My latest preprint, with UCI student Hadi Khodabandeh, uses similar ideas of sparse edge intersections to show that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_geometric_spanner">greedy geometric spanners</a> also have small separators. The paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05854">“On the edge crossings of the greedy spanner” (arXiv:2002.05854)</a>.</p>

<p>Here, a spanner is a graph whose vertices are a given finite set of points in the plane, with the property that shortest paths in the graph (with distance measured geometrically along each edge) are a good approximation to shortest paths in the plane, the straight line segments between two given points. The graph is not allowed to have extra vertices, and we don’t care about distances between points that are not in the given set. These things have all sorts of applications, for instance in approximation algorithms (you can approximate a geometric problem involving distances by solving a graph problem on the spanner). Of course, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a> is a spanner in this sense, but it has a lot of edges. We’d like spanners that are sparser, and still accurately approximate all the distances.</p>

<p>You can get a constant-factor approximation with some planar graphs (like the Delaunay triangulation), and planar graphs are sparse and have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_separator_theorem">good separators</a>, among other properties. But the example of four points in a square shows that to get a distance ratio better than  we need to allow edges to cross each other. A standard way of doing this is to use a greedy algorithm: just consider all pairs of points, in order by distance, and add an edge when the graph you’ve built so far doesn’t include a short-enough path between them. For any target distance ratio, this turns out to give spanners that are sparse (a linear rather than quadratic number of edges, and more strongly having bounded degree at each vertex) and low weight (within a constant factor of the minimum spanning tree). Versions of these spanners can be constructed in near-linear time, and work in Euclidean spaces of any bounded dimension.</p>

<p>Here, for instance, is a greedy spanner of 100 random points with distance ratio 2 (big enough that, in this example, there are no crossings):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Greedy spanner with distance ratio 2" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/greedy2.svg"/></p>

<p>And here is a much more accurate greedy spanner on the same points, one with distance ratio 1.1:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Greedy spanner with distance ratio 1.1" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/greedy1.1.svg"/></p>

<p>What we show is that for greedy spanners in the plane, each spanner edge is crossed by a bounded number of longer or equal-length edges. An edge can be crossed by an unbounded number of shorter edges, but our result implies that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_graph">intersection graph</a> of the edges is itself a sparse graph. (In any subgraph of the intersection graph, the longest edge has bounded degree, so the graph as a whole has bounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)">degeneracy</a>.) And that, in combination with the results of the SIGSPATIAL paper, implies that these graphs also have small separators: any -vertex subgraph of a greedy spanner can be split into two smaller graphs of at most  vertices each by the removal of  vertices.</p>

<p>Unlike many of the other known results on greedy spanners, this works only in the plane. It doesn’t make sense to talk about crossings in higher-dimensional greedy spanners, because for points in general position there won’t be any crossings, even in the complete graph. So we don’t know whether higher-dimensional greedy spanners have sublinear separators or not; it would be of interest to find out.</p>
