    <title>Introduction to Core-sets: an Updated Survey</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1605830400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Feldman:Dan.html">Dan Feldman</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09384">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In optimization or machine learning problems we are given a set of items,
usually points in some metric space, and the goal is to minimize or maximize an
objective function over some space of candidate solutions. For example, in
clustering problems, the input is a set of points in some metric space, and a
common goal is to compute a set of centers in some other space (points, lines)
that will minimize the sum of distances to these points. In database queries,
we may need to compute such a some for a specific query set of $k$ centers.
</p>
<p>However, traditional algorithms cannot handle modern systems that require
parallel real-time computations of infinite distributed streams from sensors
such as GPS, audio or video that arrive to a cloud, or networks of weaker
devices such as smartphones or robots.
</p>
<p>Core-set is a "small data" summarization of the input "big data", where every
possible query has approximately the same answer on both data sets. Generic
techniques enable efficient coreset \changed{maintenance} of streaming,
distributed and dynamic data. Traditional algorithms can then be applied on
these coresets to maintain the approximated optimal solutions.
</p>
<p>The challenge is to design coresets with provable tradeoff between their size
and approximation error. This survey summarizes such constructions in a
retrospective way, that aims to unified and simplify the state-of-the-art.

capabilities with respect to multiple tasks. One of the possible causes of the
observed performance gains is the introduction of increasingly sophisticated
text representations. While many of the new word embedding techniques can be
shown to capture particular notions of sentiment or associative structures, we
explore the ability of two different word embeddings to uncover or capture the
notion of logical shape in text. To this end we present a novel framework that
we call Topological Word Embeddings which leverages mathematical techniques in
dynamical system analysis and data driven shape extraction (i.e. topological
data analysis). In this preliminary work we show that using a topological delay
embedding we are able to capture and extract a different, shape-based notion of
logic aimed at answering the question "Can we find a circle in a circular
argument?"

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Jones">Vaughan Jones</a>, one of the greatest mathematicians from New Zealand, passed away on September 6 at 67. Jones is an expert in knot theory among other areas and received the Fields Medal in 1990.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_polynomial">Jones polynomial</a> captures information about knots. Vaughan Jones himself co-authored a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511096">paper</a> on a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for approximating the Jones polynomial, one of the few natural problems outside of factoring that has an exponential improvement with a quantum algorithm. </p><p>From his Vanderbilt <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/09/09/vaughan-jones-preeminent-vanderbilt-mathematician-has-died/">obituary</a></p><blockquote><p>One way he worked to improve the field of mathematics in his native country was to organize a “summer school” in January each year and attract leading mathematicians from around the world to give lectures and interact with local students and professional mathematicians at a variety of beautiful locations around New Zealand. Out of this activity grew the New Zealand Mathematics Research Institute, which he co-founded and then led from the mid-1990s to this year.</p></blockquote><p>I had the pleasure of teaching in one of those summer schools in January 2000 in Kaikoura on the South Island. In between the whale watching, mountain hiking, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/09/jogging-on-trips.html">jogging</a>, gorging on mussels, and Maori ceremonies, the NZMRI summer school <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Aspects_of_Complexity/XlB_JTR0sV8C">Aspects of Complexity</a> had short courses to a mix of students and researchers in complexity and logic. I gave some <a href="https://lance.fortnow.com/papers/files/kaikoura.pdf">lectures</a> on Kolmogorov complexity that preceded a study of algorithmic randomness in the logic community. Other speakers included Eric Allender on basic complexity, Felipe Cucker on real computation, Mike Fellows on parameterized complexity, and Dominic Welsh on counting complexity. </p><p>It took me 36 hours door-to-door to get to Kaikoura but definitely worth it. Thanks to Vaughan Jones, for his research, his polynomial and creating a summer school that gave me that one perfect week in New Zealand.</p></div>

<p>As explained in Boaz’s previous posts <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2018/02/20/research-masters/">[1]</a> <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/07/02/crowdsourcing-masters-program/">[2]</a>, the PhD admission process can be challenging for students who discover their passion for Theory of Computer Science late in their undergraduate studies. Discovering TCS earlier is especially challenging for students who aren’t exposed to CS in high school, and this bias aggravates the diversity issues we have in our community. Masters programs are one way to mitigate this issue.<br/>On a personal note, one of us (Aviad), worked half-time during undergraduate and would not have been in academia today -let alone TCS of all subjects- if it weren’t for the awesome TCS masters program at Tel-Aviv University.</p>



<p><br/>But where would you go (or send your students) to do a masters in TCS?A little over a year ago, we were discussing how useful it would be to have a unified resource that can help students choose. We decided that we should create one! Months passed, and right before we ran out of excuses to procrastinate, Boaz made this <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/07/02/crowdsourcing-masters-program/">post</a> crowdsourcing information on TCS masters programs.<br/>After some more procrastination, we eventually did send a lot of emails and tried to clean and organize the information to the best of our ability. Thanks to everyone who contributed! You can find the latest version <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/masters/masters.html">here</a>. (Short url: <a href="http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters">http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters</a>)</p>



<p>Now you should share it with your brightest students!</p>



<p><br/>This is also meant to be a live project. Please email aviad [at] <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cs.stanford.edu</a> if you have more new information or find any inaccuracies.</p>

<em>Crazy ideas meet crazed audience</em><br/>
<font color="#000000"/></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/19/traveling-salesman-problem-meets-complexity-theory/flood/" rel="attachment wp-att-17793"><img alt="" class="alignright  wp-image-17751" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/flood.jpg?w=144" width="144"/></a></p>
<p>
Merrill Flood was a mathematician who publicized the Traveling salesman problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_M._Flood">TSP</a> back in the 1940s.  </p>
<p>He says that he found the problem while: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\dots}"/> I was struggling with the problem in connecting with a school-bus routing study in New Jersey. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Today I thought we might look at the TSP from a viewpoint of complexity theory.</p>
<p>
First, we note that the origins of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">TSP</a> are unclear. In 1832 it was mentioned in a handbook for traveling salesmen in Germany and Switzerland. William Hamilton talked about the related problem later named for him: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> On finding a circuit through all points of graph. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Karl Menger, in the 1930s, defined the TSP, and considered the obvious brute-force algorithm, and observed the non-optimality of the nearest neighbor heuristic. We have annotated Wikipedia’s optimal-tour example to show (in blue) one case where a node is not connected to either of its two nearest neighbors in the tour and another where a mutual nearest-neighbor edge is not used in the optimal tour (the latter is a slight fib as-is but can be nudged, we believe): </p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/19/traveling-salesman-problem-meets-complexity-theory/tspwikimod/" rel="attachment wp-att-17815"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17815" height="287" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/tspwikimod-1.png?w=300&amp;h=287" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Modern Times–Practice </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The TSP is now well known to be NP-complete thanks to Dick Karp’s brilliant work in the 1970s. Flood would be happy to hear—we believe—that there is now a computer program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde_TSP_Solver">Concorde</a> that can solve TSP with many cites and get a nearly optimal solution. The authors of this program are: David Applegate, Robert Bixby, Vasek Chvatal, and William Cook. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Concorde has been applied to problems of gene mapping, protein function prediction, vehicle routing, conversion of bitmap images to continuous line drawings, scheduling ship movements for seismic surveys, and in studying the scaling properties of combinatorial optimization problems. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Modern Times–Theory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Concorde’s solutions are guaranteed to be within 2-3% of optimal and have worked for problems with tens of thousand cities or more. A lot more than Flood considered. </p>
<p>
So why are we interested in the TSP still? A good question. </p>
<p>
The answer is not simple. In spite of the problem’s NP-completeness and widespread belief that P<img alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{&lt;}"/>NP we still do not know for sure. Could there be an algorithm that always solves TSP in polynomial time? We do not know. </p>
<p>
We also as complexity theorists want provable algorithms, want exact algorithms, or at least approximate algorithms with provable bounds. These are lacking. This is why we were excited by the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/10/26/a-vast-and-tiny-breakthrough/">recent</a> result of a tiny improvement to the <img alt="{1.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1.5}"/> bound on TSP by Anna Karlin, Nathan Klein, and Shayan Oveis Gharan. </p>
<p>
Maybe we are crazy to be excited over a microscopic shaving off from <img alt="{1.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1.5}"/>.  But their result comes with new ideas, and since we don’t believe that <img alt="{1.5 - \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5+-+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1.5 - \epsilon}"/> is Nature’s final answer, those ideas should yield further advances.  What we are really crazy over is new ideas, and that prompts us to attempt to find another in the rest of this post.  What complexity theorists do have more of than when Ken and I started is receptacles for new ideas, and we try for one in resource-bounded communication complexity.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Alice and Bob </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In this spirit of craziness let’s take a complexity viewpoint of TSP. Let’s visit Alice and Bob. By the way I always have thought the invention of them by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in their 1978 RSA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob">paper</a> was important. This idea has probably helped improve exposition more than any other single idea. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> They Meet the TSP </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
So suppose that Alice and Bob are presented with a <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> city TSP. Further suppose that Alice can solve the TSP, but Bob like the rest of us cannot. An issue is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Can Alice send a succinct message to Bob that allows him to find an optimal tour in polynomial time? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Without the word “succinct” there would be the simple answer of sending Bob her optimal tour. We will discuss a modest improvement: she can send half as many bits to Bob as it takes to describe the optimal tour. We suspect the following is known, but it suggests a possible interesting direction.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1 (Main)</b> <em> Alice can send Bob a message of <img alt="{\frac{n}{2} \lceil \log_{2}n \rceil}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7B2%7D+%5Clceil+%5Clog_%7B2%7Dn+%5Crceil%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\frac{n}{2} \lceil \log_{2}n \rceil}"/> bits, so that he can get an optimal TSP tour in polynomial time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This theorem holds for general TSP: it can be asymmetric and need not satisfy the triangle inequality. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Proof </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
<em>Proof:</em>  Let’s assume that <img alt="{n=2m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D2m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n=2m}"/>; the argument is the essentially same if <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> is odd. </p>
<p>
Alice will first solve the TSP exactly. Assume she finds an optimal tour that visits the cities in order 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}, x_{1}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B1%7D%2C+x_%7B2%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_%7Bn%7D%2C+x_%7B1%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}, x_{1}. "/></p>
<p>To simply the notation let <img alt="{d(i,j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{d(i,j)}"/> be the distance from <img alt="{x_{i}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x_{i}}"/> to <img alt="{x_{j}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7Bj%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x_{j}}"/>. Then let Alice send Bob the odd cities in order 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{3}, \dots, x_{2m-1}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B1%7D%2C+x_%7B3%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_%7B2m-1%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{3}, \dots, x_{2m-1}. "/></p>
<p>This message has the right length in bits of <img alt="{\frac{n}{2} \lceil \log_{2}n \rceil}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7B2%7D+%5Clceil+%5Clog_%7B2%7Dn+%5Crceil%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\frac{n}{2} \lceil \log_{2}n \rceil}"/>.</p>
<p>
Bob receives this message and creates the following bipartite graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>: The left vertices are the cities 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{2}, x_{4}, \dots, x_{2m}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B2%7D%2C+x_%7B4%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_%7B2m%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{2}, x_{4}, \dots, x_{2m}. "/></p>
<p>The right vertices are 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{3}, \dots, x_{2m-1}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B1%7D%2C+x_%7B3%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_%7B2m-1%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{1}, x_{3}, \dots, x_{2m-1}. "/></p>
<p>
<img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> has edges connecting every left vertex to every right vertex; i.e., <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> is the complete bipartite graph.</p>
<p>
The first idea is that any perfect matching in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> extends uniquely to a tour, because Bob knows the order of the odd vertices in Alice’s tour.  That is, if <img alt="{(2k+1,2l)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282k%2B1%2C2l%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{(2k+1,2l)}"/> is an edge in the tour, then Bob knows that the next edge goes to node <img alt="{2k+3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2k%2B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2k+3}"/> (modulo <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/>).</p>
<p>
The second idea—which is a caveat—is that an optimal matching under the graph’s original distance function might not produce Alice’s tour.  For this to be true, it would need to be the case that for every optimal tour, either one of the two perfect matchings it induces would need to be an optimal matching for the tour’s odd and even vertices.  An example where this fails is shown at lower left in our diagram above: The green edge is part of the optimal odd-even matching but is not in Alice’s optimal tour.</p>
<p>
The trick is to change the distance function to include the edge that Bob must add to the tour.  That is, we give the edge <img alt="{(2k+1,2l)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282k%2B1%2C2l%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{(2k+1,2l)}"/> the cost 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  d(2k+1,2l) + d(2l,2k+3). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++d%282k%2B1%2C2l%29+%2B+d%282l%2C2k%2B3%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  d(2k+1,2l) + d(2l,2k+3). "/></p>
<p>Note<img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> has edges connecting every left vertex to every right vertex; i.e., <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> is the complete bipartite graph.</p>
<p>
Bob then finds a minimum cost matching for the graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/>. This can be done in polynomial time. We claim the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The matching 		<p/>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x_{2k+2} \rightarrow x_{2k+1}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x_%7B2k%2B2%7D+%5Crightarrow+x_%7B2k%2B1%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x_{2k+2} \rightarrow x_{2k+1}, "/></p>
<p>has the cost of the original TSP tour. </p>
</li><li>
Every minimum complete matching of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> yields a tour for the original TSP with the same cost as the matching.
</li></ol>
<p>These claims imply that Bob can solve the TSP in polynomial time.</p>
<p>
We note that (1) follows from the definition of the graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{G}"/> and its costs. In order to see (2) let <img alt="{2\pi(k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%28k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2\pi(k)}"/> match to <img alt="{2k+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2k%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2k+1}"/>. This means that there are edges 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  2k+1 \rightarrow 2\pi(k) \rightarrow 2k+3, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2k%2B1+%5Crightarrow+2%5Cpi%28k%29+%5Crightarrow+2k%2B3%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  2k+1 \rightarrow 2\pi(k) \rightarrow 2k+3, "/></p>
<p>for all <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/>. This is clearly a tour, since <img alt="{\pi(k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%28k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\pi(k)}"/> is a permutation by the definition of matching. 	 <img alt="\Box" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\Box"/></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The fact that Alice can send only half of the tour to Bob suggests: can we avoid having Alice solve the TSP in order to compute her message? This is the direction we are interested in. If she could do that it would improve some known complexity bounds on TSP. A possible idea is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Replace having Alice solve the <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n}"/> city TSP exactly. Instead have her solve some randomly selected subproblem exactly, and then use the above method to add in the remaining cities. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Can this work?</p>
<p>
We have not found something like this when searching on TSP and communication complexity, but would not be surprised if the matching idea, caveat, and trick have been noticed and remarked on before.</p></font></font></div>

    <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities for Real-Valued Functions with Applications to Monotonicity Testing</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1605744000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Black:Hadley.html">Hadley Black</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kalemaj:Iden.html">Iden Kalemaj</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Raskhodnikova:Sofya.html">Sofya Raskhodnikova</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09441">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We generalize the celebrated isoperimetric inequality of Khot, Minzer, and
Safra~(SICOMP 2018) for Boolean functions to the case of real-valued functions
$f \colon \{0,1\}^d\to\mathbb{R}$. Our main tool in the proof of the
generalized inequality is a new Boolean decomposition that represents every
real-valued function $f$ over an arbitrary partially ordered domain as a
collection of Boolean functions over the same domain, roughly capturing the
distance of $f$ to monotonicity and the structure of violations of $f$ to
monotonicity.
</p>
<p>We apply our generalized isoperimetric inequality to improve algorithms for
testing monotonicity and approximating the distance to monotonicity for
real-valued functions. Our tester for monotonicity has query complexity
$\widetilde{O}(\min(r \sqrt{d},d))$, where $r$ is the size of the image of the
input function. (The best previously known tester, by Chakrabarty and Seshadhri
(STOC 2013), makes $O(d)$ queries.) Our tester is nonadaptive and has 1-sided
error. We show a matching lower bound for nonadaptive, 1-sided error testers
for monotonicity. We also show that the distance to monotonicity of real-valued
functions that are $\alpha$-far from monotone can be approximated nonadaptively
within a factor of $O(\sqrt{d\log d})$ with query complexity polynomial in
$1/\alpha$ and the dimension $d$. This query complexity is known to be nearly
optimal for nonadaptive algorithms even for the special case of Boolean
functions. (The best previously known distance approximation algorithm for
real-valued functions, by Fattal and Ron (TALG 2010) achieves $O(d\log
r)$-approximation.)

algorithm has access to multiple predictors, each producing a sequence of
predictions for the page arrival times. The predictors may have occasional
prediction errors and it is assumed that at least one of them makes a sublinear
number of prediction errors in total. Our main result states that this
assumption suffices for the design of a randomized online algorithm whose
time-average regret with respect to the optimal offline algorithm tends to zero
as the time tends to infinity. This holds (with different regret bounds) for
both the full information access model, where in each round, the online
algorithm gets the predictions of all predictors, and the bandit access model,
where in each round, the online algorithm queries a single predictor.
</p>
<p>While online algorithms that exploit inaccurate predictions have been a topic
of growing interest in the last few years, to the best of our knowledge, this
is the first paper that studies this topic in the context of multiple
predictors. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is also the first
paper that aims for (and achieves) online algorithms with a vanishing regret
for a classic online problem under reasonable assumptions.

$4$ SOS can exactly solve the tensor nuclear norm, tensor decomposition, and
tensor completion problems on tensors with random asymmetric components. More
precisely, for tensor nuclear norm and tensor decomposition, we show that
w.h.p. these semidefinite programs can exactly find the nuclear norm and
components of an $(n\times n\times n)$-tensor $\mathcal{T}$ with $m\leq
n^{3/2}/polylog(n)$ random asymmetric components. For tensor completion, we
show that w.h.p. the semidefinite program introduced by Potechin \&amp; Steurer
(2017) can exactly recover an $(n\times n\times n)$-tensor $\mathcal{T}$ with
$m$ random asymmetric components from only $n^{3/2}m\, polylog(n)$ randomly
observed entries. This gives the first theoretical guarantees for exact tensor
completion in the overcomplete regime.

Matroid prophet inequalities have been considered resolved since 2012 when
[KW12] introduced thresholds that guarantee a tight 2-approximation to the
prophet; however, this algorithm is adaptive. Other approaches of [CHMS10] and
[FSZ16] have used non-adaptive thresholds with a feasibility restriction;
however, this translates to adaptively changing an item's threshold to infinity
when it cannot be taken with respect to the additional feasibility constraint,
hence the algorithm is not truly non-adaptive. A major application of prophet
inequalities is in auction design, where non-adaptive prices possess a
significant advantage: they convert to order-oblivious posted pricings, and are
essential for translating a prophet inequality into a truthful mechanism for
multi-dimensional buyers. The existing matroid prophet inequalities do not
suffice for this application. We present the first non-adaptive constant-factor
prophet inequality for graphic matroids.

testing. Most notably, as opposed to all other solvers, it implicitly exploits
the presence of symmetries without explicitly computing them.
</p>
<p>We provide extensive benchmarks, showing that the algorithm outperforms all

our data not only show improved running times by an order of magnitude, but

<p>Our results demonstrate that, with current algorithms, isomorphism testing is
in practice easier than the related problems of computing the automorphism

time-consuming and comes with a steep learning curve needed to master the
design process as well as tool complexities. In order to simplify the modeling
process, we designed and implemented a prototypical system that leverages the
strengths of Virtual Reality (VR) hand gesture recognition in combination with
the expressiveness of a voice-based interface for the task of 3D modeling.
Furthermore, we use the Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) tree representation
for 3D models within the VR environment to let the user manipulate objects from
the ground up, giving an intuitive understanding of how the underlying basic
shapes connect. The system uses standard mid-air 3D object manipulation
techniques and adds a set of voice commands to help mitigate the deficiencies
of current hand gesture recognition techniques. A user study was conducted to
evaluate the proposed prototype. The combination of our hybrid input paradigm
shows to be a promising step towards easier to use CAD modeling.

aspects: First, we propose a new barycode-based sub-distance algorithm that

simplex but also improve the efficiency in distant, touching, and overlap cases
in distance query. Second, we provide a highly efficient implementation
subroutine for collision detection by optimizing the exit conditions of our GJK
distance algorithm, which shows dramatic improvements in run-time for
applications that only need binary results. We benchmark our methods along with
that of the well-known open-source collision detection libraries, such as

    <title>Block Rigidity: Strong Multiplayer Parallel Repetition implies Super-Linear Lower Bounds for Turing Machines</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1605744000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Kunal Mittal, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Raz:Ran.html">Ran Raz</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09093">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We prove that a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for a special
case of multiplayer (multiprover) games implies super-linear lower bounds for
multi-tape Turing machines with advice. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first connection between parallel repetition and lower bounds for time
complexity and the first major potential implication of a parallel repetition
theorem with more than two players.
</p>
<p>Along the way to proving this result, we define and initiate a study of block
rigidity, extending Valiant's notion of rigidity. While rigidity was originally
defined for matrices, or, equivalently, for (multi-output) linear functions, we
extend and study both rigidity and block rigidity for general (multi-output)
functions. Using techniques of Paul, Pippenger, Szemer\'edi and Trotter, we
show that a block-rigid function cannot be computed by multi-tape Turing
machines that run in linear (or slightly super-linear) time, even in the
non-uniform setting, where the machine gets an arbitrary advice tape.
</p>
<p>We then describe a class of multiplayer games, such that, a sufficiently
strong parallel repetition theorem for that class of games implies an explicit
block-rigid function. The games in that class have the following property that
may be of independent interest: for every random string for the verifier
(which, in particular, determines the vector of queries to the players), there
is a unique correct answer for each of the players, and the verifier accepts if
and only if all answers are correct. We refer to such games as independent
games. The theorem that we need is that parallel repetition reduces the value
of games in this class from $v$ to $v^{\Omega(n)}$, where $n$ is the number of
repetitions.
</p>
<p>As another application of block rigidity, we show conditional size-depth
tradeoffs for boolean circuits, where the gates compute arbitrary functions
over large sets.

natural myopic model for weighted paging in which an algorithm has access to
the relative ordering of all pages with respect to the time of their next

\ell)$-competitive randomized algorithm, where $\ell$ is the number of distinct
weight classes. Both these bounds are tight and imply an $O(\log W)$ and
$O(\log \log W)$-competitive ratio respectively when the page weights lie
between $1$ and $W$. Our model and results also simultaneously generalize the
paging with predictions (Lykouris and Vassilvitskii, 2018) and the interleaved

interconnected geometric allocation problems. We show that the competitiveness
of myopic weighted paging lies in between that of two similar problems called
soft and strict allocation. While variants of the allocation problem have been
studied previously in the context of the $k$-server problem, our formulation
exhibits a certain scale-free property that poses significant technical
challenges. Consequently, simple multiplicative weight update algorithms do not
seem to work here; instead, we are forced to use a novel technique that
decouples the rate of change of the allocation variables from their value. For
offline unweighted paging, we also provide an alternate proof of the optimality
of Belady's classic Farthest in Future algorithm, which may be of independent
interest.

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Dror Dayan, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Solovey:Kiril.html">Kiril Solovey</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Pavone:Marco.html">Marco Pavone</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Halperin:Dan.html">Dan Halperin</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08944">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>An underlying structure in several sampling-based methods for continuous
multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) is the tensor roadmap (TR), which emerges
from combining multiple PRM graphs constructed for the individual robots via a
tensor product. We study the conditions under which the TR encodes a
near-optimal solution for MRMP---satisfying these conditions implies near
optimality for a variety of popular planners, including dRRT*, and the discrete
methods M* and CBS when applied to the continuous domain. We develop the first
finite-sample analysis of this kind, which specifies the number of samples,
their deterministic distribution, and magnitude of the connection radii that
should be used by each individual PRM graph, to guarantee near-optimality using
the TR. This significantly improves upon a previous asymptotic analysis,
wherein the number of samples tends to infinity, and supports guaranteed
high-quality solutions in practice, within bounded running time. To achieve our
new result, we first develop a sampling scheme, which we call the staggered
grid, for finite-sample motion planning for individual robots, which requires
significantly less samples than previous work. We then extend it to the much
more involved MRMP setting which requires to account for interactions among
multiple robots. Finally, we report on a few experiments that serve as a
verification of our theoretical findings and raise interesting questions for
further investigation.

    <title>TR20-174 |  Isoperimetric Inequalities for Real-Valued Functions with Applications to Monotonicity Testing | 

	Hadley Black, 

	Iden Kalemaj, 

	Sofya Raskhodnikova</title>
    <summary>We generalize the celebrated isoperimetric inequality of Khot, Minzer, and Safra (SICOMP 2018) for Boolean functions to the case of real-valued functions $f \colon \{0,1\}^d\to\mathbb{R}$. Our main tool in the proof of the generalized inequality is a new Boolean decomposition that represents every real-valued function $f$ over an arbitrary partially ordered domain as a collection of Boolean functions over the same domain, roughly capturing the distance of $f$ to monotonicity and the structure of violations of $f$ to monotonicity.

We apply our generalized isoperimetric inequality to improve algorithms for testing monotonicity and approximating the distance to monotonicity for real-valued functions. Our tester for monotonicity has query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\min(r \sqrt{d},d))$, where $r$ is the size of the image of the input function. (The best previously known tester, by Chakrabarty and Seshadhri (STOC 2013), makes $O(d)$ queries.) Our tester is nonadaptive and has 1-sided error. We show a matching lower bound for nonadaptive, 1-sided error testers for monotonicity. We also show that the distance to monotonicity of real-valued functions that are $\alpha$-far from monotone can be approximated nonadaptively within a factor of $O(\sqrt{d\log d})$ with query complexity polynomial in  $1/\alpha$ and the dimension $d$. This query complexity is known to be nearly optimal for nonadaptive algorithms even for the special case of Boolean functions. (The best previously known distance approximation algorithm for real-valued functions, by Fattal and Ron (TALG 2010) achieves $O(d\log r)$-approximation.)</summary>

    <title>TR20-173 |  Block Rigidity: Strong Multiplayer Parallel Repetition implies Super-Linear Lower Bounds for Turing Machines | 

	Kunal Mittal, 

	Ran Raz</title>
    <summary>We prove that a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for a special case of multiplayer (multiprover) games implies super-linear lower bounds for multi-tape Turing machines with advice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first connection between parallel repetition and lower bounds for time complexity and the first major potential implication of a parallel repetition theorem with more than two players.

Along the way to proving this result, we define and initiate a study of block rigidity, extending Valiant's notion of rigidity [Val77]. While rigidity was originally defined for matrices, or, equivalently, for (multi-output) linear functions, we extend and study both rigidity and block rigidity for general (multi-output) functions. Using techniques of Paul, Pippenger, Szemer{\'{e}}di and Trotter [PPST83], we show that a block-rigid function cannot be computed by multi-tape Turing machines that run in linear (or slightly super-linear) time, even in the non-uniform setting, where the machine gets an arbitrary advice tape.

We then describe a class of multiplayer games, such that, a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for that class of games implies an explicit block-rigid function. The games in that class have the following property that may be of independent interest: for every random string for the verifier (which, in particular, determines the vector of queries to the players), there is a unique correct answer for each of the players, and the verifier accepts if and only if all answers are correct. We refer to such games as independent games. The theorem that we need is that parallel repetition reduces the value of games in this class from $v$ to $v^{\Omega(n)}$, where $n$ is the number of repetitions.

As another application of block rigidity, we show conditional size-depth tradeoffs for boolean circuits, where the gates compute arbitrary functions over large sets.</summary>

I would never have expected to see my former Princeton colleague <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/">Andrew Appel</a> on a Sean Hannity segment tweeted by President Trump.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/image.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7899" src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/image.png?w=1024"/></a></figure>



<p/>



<p>It may seem that even if it has partisan motivations, the recent GOP interest in election security is overall a positive thing. Who wouldn’t want elections to be more secure? Who wouldn’t want less fraud? However, in a very precise sense, the definition of “election security” used by the GOP these days corresponds to <strong>election insecurity</strong>.</p>



<p>To understand this claim, consider what it means for an election to be secure. (Let’s focus just on the correctness aspect of the count, since it is at the heart of the current issues, and not on the very interesting privacy aspect.) Computer scientists use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08554">the technical terms</a> “<strong>cast as intended</strong>“, “<strong>recorded as cast</strong>“, and “<strong>tallied as recorded</strong>“. In other words: if a voter X intends to cast vote for candidate Y,  then this vote should be recorded and tallied, and only such votes should be tallied.</p>



<p>With mail-in voting, there are several potential points of failure on the path between voter intent and the final tally:</p>



<ol><li>Mail can be lost or delayed too much, leading to the vote not counting.</li><li>A third party could intercept the ballot and impersonate the voter.</li><li>A ballot may not be formatted properly in some way, leading to it being disqualified.</li><li>There can be errors or hacks in the tallying process.</li></ol>



<p>Election security is about combatting points 1-4 (of which the last 3 are also applicable to in-person voting) , ideally in a way that is <em>verifiable</em> to the individual voters. Achieving verifiability while maintaining secrecy and not requiring the voter to trust complex technology is a challenging task, but there have been some proposed solutions (see above links).<br/><br/>The Hannity segment and much of the “Dominion” non story focused on point 4. This is an important point, but as <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2020/11/13/did-sean-hannity-misquote-me/">Appel himself notes</a>, paper ballots, which are mostly used in the US, serve as a way to audit counting. Re-counting is important, and is commonly done, but such recounts often change the total counts by relatively little (and the changes mostly cancel out). For example, here is the list of ballots changed and reasons from the Wisconsin 2016 count (taken from <a href="https://t.co/AUagggIp6j?amp=1">this paper</a>)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Image" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Emk1EJaU4AAtAJm?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096"/></figure>



<p>In contrast, many of the legal cases by the Trump campaign focused on signature verification and other ballot irregularities. There are two main reasons why a signature would not match between a ballot and driver’s license or other records:</p>



<ol><li>The signature may have been forged by someone trying to impersonate the voter.<br/></li><li>The voter’s signature might not very consistent, or maybe they have more than one signature (for example, I sometimes sign in Hebrew and sometimes in English) .</li></ol>



<p>Empirically, reason 2 is much more common than reason 1. If a ballot is tossed out because of the second reason it corresponds to a <strong>break between the voter intent and the final tally</strong>, and hence it is a case of <em>election insecurity</em>. For this reason, making more stringent signature checks could make elections less secure!</p>



<p>While President Trump might claim on Twitter that the election was stolen by a massive conspiracy involving forging of tens of thousands of ballots, this is not the actual content of the court cases (especially after some <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/lawyers-pan-significant-shrinkage-of-trump-campaigns-pennsylvania-lawsuit-only-addresses-a-handful-of-ballots/">recent</a> <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/484456818/Redline-Trump-Complaint">amendments</a>). For example, at the heart of the PA case is the process of “<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/ballot-curing-in-pennsylvania/">curing a ballot</a>“. This is when a ballot is disqualified due to some technical issue, and a voter has a chance to fix it. Curing a ballot ensures that the voters intent is captured, and hence makes elections more secure. </p>



<p>In PA, the decision of whether to notify voters in such cases was left to the counties, and apparently Democrat-controlled counties were more likely to do so Republican-controlled counties. This is a shame, and had the Trump campaign asked to extend the deadline for curing  ballots, then I would think it makes perfect sense. However, this is not what their lawsuit is about. To quote their complaint: <em>“plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction requiring the County Election Boards to invalidate ballots cast by voters who were notified and given an opportunity to cure their invalidly cast mail-in ballot.”</em> This are ballots where there is no question of the eligibility of the voter, nor of the accuracy of their intent, yet the Trump campaign seeks to prevent them from counting. I call this election insecurity.</p>

<p>The news: In 1981, Paul Erdős and András Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Hong Liu and Richard Montgomery <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15802">have just proved</a> that the answer is positive!  They also proved a variety of other old standing conjectures. This is remarkable. Congratulations!</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Before going on let me pose an even stronger conjecture</span></p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> The sum of the reciprocals of the odd<strong> induced</strong> cycle lengths in a <em>triangle-free</em> graph with no triangles and infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite.</p>
<p>The same conclusion should apply to graphs with bounded clique numbers; it is related to the general area of <img alt="\chi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\chi"/>-boundedness, see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/when-a-few-colors-suffice/">this post</a> and this <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~pds/papers/chibounded/paper.pdf">recent survey</a> by Alex Scott and Paul Seymour.</p>

<p>I am thankful to Benny Sudakov for telling me about the new result.</p>
<p>A key ingredient of the proof is the study of expanders that you can always find in graphs. Komlós and Szemerédi showed in 1996 that every graph <em>G</em> contains an expander with comparable average degree to <em>G </em>and since their work, with greater and greater sophistication, finding expanders in general graphs has become an important tool for a large number of extremal problems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In 1981, Erdős and Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Let <img alt="\mathcal{C}(G)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathcal{C}(G)"/> be the set of cycle lengths in a graph <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/> and let <img alt="\mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_%5Ctext%7Bodd%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)"/> be the set of odd numbers in <img alt="\mathcal{C}(G)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathcal{C}(G)"/>. We prove that, if <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/> has chromatic number <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>, then <img alt="\sum_{\ell\in  \mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)}1/\ell\geq (1/2-o_k(1))\log k." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_%7B%5Cell%5Cin++%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_%5Ctext%7Bodd%7D%28G%29%7D1%2F%5Cell%5Cgeq+%281%2F2-o_k%281%29%29%5Clog+k.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\sum_{\ell\in  \mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)}1/\ell\geq (1/2-o_k(1))\log k."/> This solves Erdős and Hajnal’s odd cycle problem, and, furthermore, this bound is asymptotically optimal.<br/>
In 1984, Erdős asked whether there is some d such that each graph with chromatic number at least d (or perhaps even only average degree at least <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/>) has a cycle whose length is a power of 2. We show that an average degree condition is sufficient for this problem, solving it with methods that apply to a wide range of sequences in addition to the powers of 2.<br/>
Finally, we use our methods to show that, for every <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>, there is some <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/> so that every graph with average degree at least d has a subdivision of the complete graph <img alt="K_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="K_k"/> in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times. This confirms a conjecture of Thomassen from 1984.</p></div>

    <title>Hiring Postdocs</title>
    <summary>I am looking to hire postdocs in the coming years on topics of algorithmic fairness with relation to a Simons Collaboration and on the meaning of individual probabilities with relation to a Sloan Foundation project. Please contact me (reingold@stanford.edu) for details and please forward to any relevant individual. Some comments: The Simons Collaboration will offer additional postdoc opportunities across the participating institutions. To be advertised soon. The perspective taken in both these projects is of TOC but the research will gain from collaborations with other fields within and outside of CS (Statistics, Economics, Philosophy, Law, Social Sciences at large). I will therefore be open to postdocs with various backgrounds (and would consider co-hosting with colleagues in other fields). Candidates from under-represented populations are encouraged to apply and I promise to give those applications my close attention.</summary>

Both are on You tube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtIT-jr1hmQ">Trebek hosts wheel</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwVNmYjClXE">Pat hosts Jeopardy</a> Alex's hosting was more fun because- well, you can see for yourself. </p><p>2) Aside from that one day, Alex Trebek hosted <i>Jeopardy</i> every night since he began in 1984. </p><p>3) My favorite pangram (sentence that has all 26 letters) is</p><p>Watch <i>Jeopardy!</i>, Alex Trebek's fun TV quiz game show. </p><p>(See my post on natural pangrams <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/11/can-you-measure-which-panagrams-are.html">here</a> for... more natural pangrams and a discussion of what natural means.) </p><p>It's my favorite since I can really imagine someone saying it. The show should have used it for its tagline. And now they can't :-(</p><p>4) From Alex's comments he seems to like high scoring games that are not run-a-ways. He also likes when people bet big on the daily doubles and on<i> final Jeopardy</i>.  I think he liked having long win streaks like Ken Jenning's  and James Holzhauer, but see point 7 below.  I think he didn't like it when people go for the high scoring questions first (perhaps looking for the Daily Double) since sometimes the category name is not quite clear (e.g., <i>Country Groups</i> could be things like<i> NATO </i>or things like <i>The Charlie Daniels Band</i>) so you want to do a cheap question to get your feet wet, and also easier for the audience to see what the category means.  IMHO they should really make the Daily Double Uniformly distributed on all the squares instead of having it tend to be the bigger-money questions. </p><p>5) When the final <i>Jeopardy</i> category is  revealed he sometimes says <i>that's a  good category!</i> or <i>that sounds hard. </i> Makes me wonder that if he makes no comment he is thinking<i> that's a stupid categor</i>y  or <i>Gee that's easy.</i></p><p>6) Because of the pandemic they could not, for a while, make new shows. Hence  they aired old shows including the  first ever Alex-Trebek-<i>Jeopardy</i> (the show had been hosted by Art Fleming and the Trebek-version was really a reboot). From that show I found out WHY it's called<i> Jeopardy</i> (a question I had never thought about). It's because if you get an answer WRONG you can LOSE money- that's the Jeopardy. Not really a good name, but by now everyone knows the show by that name.</p><p>7) Art Fleming also died of pancreatic cancer, back in 1995 (he was 70). Coincidence? Well, yes, though two game show hosts of the same show dying of the same disease 25 years apart could be the premise of a really bad murder mystery. </p><p>8) Alex makes some small talk with the contestants  (though some is edited for time). Things like <i>I hear you have a book on muffins that is not a cookbook-- what's that all about?</i>' I wonder if during Ken Jenning's 74-long winning streak, towards the end,  Alex ran out of things to ask him. I can imagine <i>I hear you're pretty good at Jeopardy.</i></p><p>9) I wonder how good Alex would be playing <i>Jeopardy</i>. When he hosted <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> he said in passing that he would NEVER go on <i>Jeopardy</i> as a contestant, so he doesn't think he would do well. He could be wrong about that since over time they ask questions that are not quite repeats but draw on the same knowledge- and he's heard all of them. However, it could be that he is too busy concentrating on other things to really absorb all of this knowledge. </p><p>10) The <i>we give the answers you give the questions </i>is a bit odd. However, in my classes I  sometimes say  <i>We'll Trebek this - we know what the answer is, we have to find the question</i>.</p><p>11) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7UgxCayfV0">This</a> youtube video is of a contestant singing WORDS to the <i>Jeopardy</i> theme song that he wrote.The contestant  refers to Jon Stewart as having also written words to the <i>Jeopardy</i> theme, but I can't find that anywhere- if you can, let me know. </p><p>12) Weird Al did a novelty song about <i>Jeopardy</i> using Art Fleming in the video (see  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvUZijEuNDQ">here</a>)  I always hoped he would update it and use Alex Trebek. He never did and now he can't :-( OR-with todays technology maybe he can. Here's hoping!</p><p>13) Alex Trebek was in a category by himself!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>Pathbreaking for intervals</title>
    <summary>The use of Nash’s Hex lemma in my previous post, according to which any 2-coloring of a triangular grid has a long monochromatic path, naturally raises the question: for which graphs other than the triangular grid is this true? In that post I mentioned that it is also true for certain outerplanar graphs, but false for bipartite graphs and for subcubic graphs. Here’s another class of graphs for which it is false: the graphs of bounded pathwidth. These graphs can always be 2-colored in a way that breaks up all long paths, leaving the remaining monochromatic paths of bounded size.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The use of Nash’s Hex lemma in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/10/hex-books-queues.html">my previous post</a>, according to which any 2-coloring of a triangular grid has a long monochromatic path, naturally raises the question: for which graphs other than the triangular grid is this true? In that post I mentioned that it is also true for certain outerplanar graphs, but false for bipartite graphs and for subcubic graphs. Here’s another class of graphs for which it is false: the graphs of bounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathwidth">pathwidth</a>. These graphs can always be 2-colored in a way that breaks up all long paths, leaving the remaining monochromatic paths of bounded size.</p>

<p>Rather than dealing with pathwidth directly, I want to formulate it geometrically in terms of interval graphs. Every graph can be completed (by adding extra edges) to form an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_graph">interval graph</a> of the same pathwidth; an interval graph has one-dimensional closed intervals as its vertices, connected by an edge whenever they intersect. The pathwidth of an interval graph is always one less than the maximum number of intervals that overlap at the same point (their ply). So rather than looking at graphs of bounded pathwidth I’ll be considering sets of intervals of bounded ply. For example in the illustration below which I drew a few years ago for Wikipedia, the intervals shown have ply 3, and their interval graph has pathwidth 2.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A set of intervals and their associated interval graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/interval-graph.svg"/></p>

<p>Intervals with low ply that are all either nested or disjoint can have no long paths in their intersection graph regardless of coloring. In any set of intervals forming a path, the path can pass through the outermost level of nesting at most once, subdividing it into two smaller paths with lower ply. It follows by induction the number of intervals in the path can be at most \(2^{\operatorname{ply}}-1\). (This is the standard argument behind an equivalence in graphs between longest path length and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-depth">tree-depth</a>.) So if we could partition an arbitrary set of intervals into two subsets within which all intervals are nested or disjoint, we’d be done. For instance, in the example above, the partition into \(\{A,B,F\}\) and \(\{C,D,E,G\}\) works. Not every set of intervals can be partitioned in this way, but I’ll show below that it’s always possible to lengthen some intervals, keeping the ply small, so that the lengthened intervals can be partitioned (colored) into two nested subsets.</p>

<p>As a subroutine in the construction, let’s find a set of points with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each interval lies strictly between the leftmost and rightmost selected points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No interval covers more than one selected point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The union of the intervals that cover selected points equals the union of all the intervals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This can be done by a greedy algorithm that repeatedly selects an uncovered interval endpoint until the intervals that cover selected points also cover all other interval endpoints. Finish by selecting any two points to the left and right of all the intervals, and then number the selected points as \(x_0,x_1,\dots\) in left-to-right order. For example, one possible choice for our example would have \(x_0\) to the left of the intervals, \(x_1\) at the left endpoint of \(D\), \(x_2\) at the left endpoint of \(F\), and \(x_3\) to the right of the intervals. For this choice, \(B\) and \(E\) do not cover any selected points, but that’s not a problem. It’s not necessary to optimize how many points are selected.</p>

<p>Call an interval “odd” if it covers an odd-numbered point \(x_i\) and “even” if it covers an even-numbered point. In our example, \(A\), \(C\), and \(D\) are odd, and \(F\), and \(G\) are even, but \(B\) and \(E\) are neither odd nor even. We will color the odd intervals blue and the even intervals red. Because they are different colors, we don’t have to worry about nesting between odd and even intervals. However, the intervals that contain any single point \(x_i\) will have the same color and need to be lengthened to nesting intervals. To do so, we extend all these intervals to a single longer interval, from just after \(x_{i-1}\) to just before \(x_{i+1}\). Because of the way the points \(x_i\) were chosen, this does not create new intersections between intervals of the same color, and it makes all colored intervals nest with all uncolored ones (not just with each other). However, it can also increase the ply. If the ply was \(p\) previously, it can increase by as much as \(2p-1\), when a point that was previously covered by only one odd or even interval becomes covered by \(2p-1\) more of them.</p>

<p>Finally, we apply the same coloring and lengthening process recursively, to the remaining subsets of uncolored intervals between each pair of selected points.
To make sure the intervals stay nested after lengthening, we take care in each recursive subproblem to select its first and last points to be inside all intervals of the outer problem that contain the subproblem. Because every point in an interval of a recursive subproblem is also in at least one of the outer colored intervals, the recursive subproblem has smaller ply than the initial ply of the outer problem. The recursion stops at ply 2; for this ply the intersection graph is a tree (more precisely a caterpillar) and it is possible to 2-color the intervals without any lengthening so that no two intervals of the same color intersect, by 2-coloring the tree.</p>

<p>So if we start with intervals of ply 2, we produce a lengthened, 2-colored, and monochromatically nested set of intervals of ply 2 again (no change to the ply). If we start with intervals of ply 3, we produce a lengthened, 2-colored, and monochromatically nested set of intervals of ply at most 8, because the ply-3 interval-lengthening process added at most 5 to the existing ply. More generally for any starting ply \(p\) the new ply will be at most \(p^2+p-4\). And since the interval graph for the lengthened intervals has no monochromatic path with more than \(2^{p^2+p-4}-1\) intervals in it, neither does the interval graph for the original intervals, with the same 2-coloring.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wolfgang Kühnel</span></p>
<p>Today I want to talk about a new result in a newly arXived paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02703">A subexponential size <img alt="\mathbb RP^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb RP^n"/> by Karim Adiprasito, Sergey Avvakumov, and Roman Karasev</a>. Sergey Avvakumov gave about it a <strong>great</strong> zoom seminar talk about the result in our combinatorics seminar. <a href="https://huji.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=602454e6-d104-42fe-849c-ac6000b7517b">Here is the link</a>.</p>
<p>The question is very simple: <strong>W<span style="color: #0000ff;">hat is the smallest number of vertices required to triangulate the <em>n</em>-dimensional real projective space?</span></strong></p>
<p>The short paper exhibits a triangulation with <img alt="\exp (\frac {1}{2} \sqrt n \log n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp+%28%5Cfrac+%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%5Csqrt+n+%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\exp (\frac {1}{2} \sqrt n \log n)"/> vertices.  This is the first construction that requires subexponential number of vertices in the dimension. The best lower bound by Pierre Arnoux and Alexis Marin (from 1999) are quadratic, so there is quite a way to go with the problem. I am thankful to Ryan Alweiss who was the first to tell me about the new result.</p>
<h2>Reasons to care</h2>
<p>Representing a topological space using simplicial complexes arose in the early days of algebraic topology, but there are certainly more “efficient” representations. What is the reason to to care specifically about representations via simplicial complexes? Here are my answers</p>
<ol>
<li>Constructions of triangulated manifolds with few vertices are occasionally amazing mathematical objects.</li>
<li>Simplicial complexes arise in many combinatorial and algebraic contexts,</li>
<li>The study of face numbers of simplicial complexes with various topological properties is often related to deep questions in algebra, geometry, and topology,</li>
<li>We care also about other types of representation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Kühnel and Lassmann’s complex projective plane with nine vertices and other miracles</h2>
<p>You may all be familiar with the 6-vertex triangulation of the projective space. It is obtained by identifying opposite faces of the icosahedron. It is 2-neighborly, namely every pair of vertices span an edge of the triangulation. (It also played a role in my high dimensional extension of Cayley’s counting trees formula.) The existence of 2-neighborly triangulations of other closed surfaces is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heawood_conjecture">Heawood 1890 conjecture</a> solved by Ringel and Young in the 1960s.</p>
<p>In 1980 Wolfgang Kühnel set out to construct a 3-neighborly triangulation of the complex projective plane with 9 vertices. The construction, achieved in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316583900055?via%3Dihub">a paper by Kühnel and Lassmann</a> (who also proved uniqueness), and discussed in <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~banchoff/howison/newbanchoff/publications/pdfs/9Vertex.pdf">a paper of the same year by Kühnel and Banchof</a>, is, in my view, among the most beautiful constructions in mathematics with additional hidden structures and many connections. Some motivation to the work came from the study of tight embeddings of smooth manifolds and Morse theory.</p>
<p>Ulrich Brehm and Kühnel <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040938387900425?via%3Dihub">proved</a> that if a <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-3">d</span></span></span></span>-manifold has fewer than <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-4"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-5"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-6">3</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-7">⌈</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8">d</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-9"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-10"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-11">/</span></span></span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-12">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-13">⌉</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-14">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-15">3</span></span></span></span> vertices then it is homeomorphic to a sphere, and if it has exactly <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-3-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-16"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-17"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-18">3</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-19">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-20">d</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-21"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-22"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-23">/</span></span></span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-24">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-25">)</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-26">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-27">3</span></span></span></span> vertices and is not a sphere, then <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-4-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-28"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-29"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-30">d</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-31">=</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-32">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-33">,</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-34">4</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-35">,</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-36">8</span></span></span></span> or <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-5-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-37"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-38"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-39">16</span></span></span></span> and the manifold has a nondegenerate height function with exactly three critical points. The 6-vertex <img alt="\mathbb RP^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb RP^2"/> and the 9-vertex $\mathbbCP^2$ are examples for dimensions 2 and 4. We can expect further such examples for projective planes over the quaternions and octonions. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01934320">Brehm and Kühnel</a> constructed three 8-dimensional 5-neighborly “manifolds” which are not combinatorially isomorphic. It is conjectured but not known that they all triangulate the quaternionic projective plane.</p>

<p>Here is a brief description of Sergey Avvakumov’s lecture. (As far as I could see the proof of their result is fully presented along with  3 other proofs for basic related results.)</p>

A simple inductive constructions of  a triangulation of <img alt="\mathbb R P^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R+P%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\mathbb R P^n"/>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">11:00</span></strong> The construction: triangulate the positive facets of the cross polytope and symmetrically the negative facet.

<h2>Open problems and Low dimensions</h2>
<p>Of course a main question is what is the minimum number of vertices required for a triangulation of n dimensional real projective space. What about the n-dimensional complex projective space?
