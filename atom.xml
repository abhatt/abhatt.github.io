    <title>TR21-004 |  Junta Distance Approximation with Sub-Exponential Queries | 

	Vishnu Iyer, 

	Avishay Tal, 

	Michael Whitmeyer</title>
    <summary>Leveraging tools of De, Mossel, and Neeman [FOCS, 2019], we show two different results pertaining to the tolerant testing of juntas. Given black-box access to a Boolean function $f:\{\pm1\}^{n} \to \{\pm1\}$ we give a poly$(k, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query algorithm that distinguishes between functions that are $\gamma$-close to $k$-juntas and $(\gamma+\varepsilon)$-far from $k'$-juntas, where $k' = O(\frac{k}{\varepsilon^2})$. In the non-relaxed setting, we extend our ideas to give a  $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k}/\varepsilon)}$ (adaptive) query algorithm that distinguishes between functions that are $\gamma$-close to $k$-juntas and $(\gamma+\varepsilon)$-far from $k$-juntas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first subexponential-in-$k$ query algorithm for approximating the distance of $f$ to being a $k$-junta (previous results of Blais, Canonne, Eden,  Levi,  and  Ron [SODA, 2018] and De, Mossel, and Neeman [FOCS, 2019] required exponentially many queries in $k$). Our techniques are Fourier analytical and introduce the new notion of "normalized influences'' that might be of independent interest.</summary>

<h3><strong>Conjecture:</strong> Let P be a centrally symmetric d-polytope. Then P has at least 3ᵈ non-empty faces.</h3>
<p>Here we count P itself as a face.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Before we continue</strong> let me mention</span> <a href="https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/programs/current-trimester-program/interplay-high-dimensional-geometry-probability/interplay-high-dimensional-geometry-probability-winterschool/">a winter school on “The Interplay between High-Dimensional Geometry and Probability”,</a> <span style="color: #008000;">January 11-15. Among other exciting lectures Bo’az Klartag will give 3 lectures on Yuansi Chen’s work on the KLS conjecture, that we discussed in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/21/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-15-yuansi-chen-achieved-a-major-breakthrough-on-bourgains-slicing-problem-and-the-kannan-lovasz-and-simonovits-conjecture/">this post</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Now back to the 3ᵈ conjecture. </strong>A case of equality is the <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/>-dimensional cube <img alt="C_d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="C_d"/>.

<h3>Some comments</h3>
<p>Here are some points raised in the discussion and further comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are many cases of equality – all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanner_polytope"><em>Hanner polytopes</em></a>. Those are obtained from intervals by taking the two operations, a) Cartesian product, b) moving from a polytope P to its polar-dual P*, and apply them in all possible ways.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Nati asked if a <img alt="(2+\epsilon)^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282%2B%5Cepsilon%29%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(2+\epsilon)^d"/> lower bound is known. To the best of my knowledge even this is not known.</span></li>
<li>Gideon asked about the connections with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahler_volume">Mahler’s conjecture</a> that for every d-dimentional centrally symmetric body K, <img alt="vol(K)vol(K*) \ge 4^n/n!" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=vol%28K%29vol%28K%2A%29+%5Cge+4%5En%2Fn%21&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="vol(K)vol(K*) \ge 4^n/n!"/>  . Indeed the cases of equality are conjectured to be the same – the class of Hanner polytopes. (Mahler’s conjecture and its relations to combinatorics would deserve a separate post.) The recent paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870818303372?casa_token=YEJdSwTFFaIAAAAA:k-e1q7dtnSZslAg5ZZYtJJQrgLiCbDE7_uNBITsrrUxOkCc5A8ThPF5CPTIcD4HUhTcVlUqeaAM" id="1oYidvdGYaQJ"><span dir="ltr">Flag numbers and floating bodies</span>‏</a> by <span dir="ltr"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MqLwWBgAAAAJ&amp;hl=iw&amp;oi=sra">F Besau</a>, C Schütt, EM Werner looks very relevant.</span></li>
<li>For simplicial polytopes the conjecture follows from results of Stanley (1986) and is related t0 a result by Barany and Lovasz (1982).</li>
<li>The conjecture is related to a 1979 theorem of Figiel, Lindenstrauss, and Milman that asserts that for every centrally symmetric <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d"/> polytope <img alt="\log f_0(P) \log f_{d-1}(P) \ge \gamma d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+f_0%28P%29+%5Clog+f_%7Bd-1%7D%28P%29+%5Cge+%5Cgamma+d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\log f_0(P) \log f_{d-1}(P) \ge \gamma d"/>, for some universal constant <img alt="\gamma" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\gamma"/>.</li>
<li>A somewhat more general conjecture would be that the number of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-faces of the barycentric subdivision of <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="K"/> is always as large as the number of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/>-faces of the barycentric subdivision of <img alt="C_d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="C_d"/>. The case <img alt="k=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k=0"/> is the original conjecture and I regard the case <img alt="k=d-1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3Dd-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k=d-1"/> (sometimes referred to as the “flag-number conjecture”) as even closer to Mahler’s conjecture. See the paper by Schmidt and Ziegler, <a href="https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/groups/discgeom/ziegler/Preprintfiles/127PREPRINT.pdf">Ten Problems in Geometry.</a></li>
<li>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3661">this paper</a> by Raman Sanyal, Axel Werner, and Günter M. Ziegler, the conjecture is proved for <img alt="d \le 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%5Cle+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="d \le 4"/>. The proof is rather involved and rely on an extension of the lower bound theorem. (It does not extend to polyhedral spheres.)  The paper also gives counterexamples for two much stronger conjectures that I made in my 1989 paper.</li>

<h3>Some further comments</h3>
<p><span id="more-20474"/></p>
<ol>
<li>Hanner polytopes form an exciting family of polytopes. They have the maximum Banach-Mazur distance from the Euclidean ball, and it is conjectured that only these polytopes attain this maximum. They also have the 2-3 Helly-property (namely every three pairwise intersecting translates have a point in common. It was proved by Lima and Jensen that this property holds only by Hanner polytopes!</li>
<li>The proof for the conjecture for d=4 involves the “extended lower bound inequality”.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Another conjecture of mine of a similar spirit is: a polyhedral d-manifold (more generally, a regular CW manifold) in dimension <em>d</em> which is not a sphere has at least <img alt="2^{(3d+4)/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%283d%2B4%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="2^{(3d+4)/2}"/> faces. (Including the empty face.)</span></li>
<li>Flag <img alt="(d-1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28d-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(d-1)"/>-dimensional spheres also have at least <img alt="3^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="3^d"/> faces. This follows from a theorem by Roy Meshulam.</li>
<li>Completely balanced <img alt="(d-1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28d-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="(d-1)"/>-dimensional spheres also have at least <img alt="3^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="3^d"/> faces. (I think.) (What about zonotopes, you may ask.)</li>
<li>The class of spheres in items 4 and 5 are simplicial. So an extensions of these classes to classes of polyhedral spheres (and regular CW spheres) would be interesting.</li>
<li>d-Polytopes with no triangular 2-faces also have at least <img alt="3^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="3^d"/> non-empty faces this follows from a theorem of Blind and Blind.</li>
<li>Looking around in papers that referred to my old paper I discovered the following appealing class of polytopes and interesting conjecture about them. A polytope P is 2-level if for every facet F of P there is a hyperplane parallel to the hyperplane through F that contains all vertices not in F. The conjecture is that for such a d-polytope P, <img alt="f_0(P)f_{d-1}(P)\le d2^{d+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_0%28P%29f_%7Bd-1%7D%28P%29%5Cle+d2%5E%7Bd%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f_0(P)f_{d-1}(P)\le d2^{d+1}"/>. This conjecture was made in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01943">Enumeration of 2-level polytopes by</a>  Bohn,  Faenza,  Fiorini,  Fisikopoulos, Macchia, and Pashkovich.</li>
<li>Interesting classes of polytopes arising from graphs that are very near the conjecture can be found in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5790" id="KdEkliExsEIJ"><span dir="ltr">Face numbers of centrally symmetric polytopes from split graphs</span>‏</a> by <span dir="ltr">Freij, Henze, Schmitt, and Ziegler.

    <title>Planar Reachability Under Single Vertex or Edge Failures</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/i/Italiano:Giuseppe_F=.html">Giuseppe F. Italiano</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Karczmarz:Adam.html">Adam Karczmarz</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Parotsidis:Nikos.html">Nikos Parotsidis</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02574">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we present an efficient reachability oracle under single-edge
or single-vertex failures for planar directed graphs. Specifically, we show
that a planar digraph $G$ can be preprocessed in $O(n\log^2{n}/\log\log{n})$
time, producing an $O(n\log{n})$-space data structure that can answer in
$O(\log{n})$ time whether $u$ can reach $v$ in $G$ if the vertex $x$ (the
edge~$f$) is removed from $G$, for any query vertices $u,v$ and failed vertex
$x$ (failed edge $f$). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data
structure for planar directed graphs with nearly optimal preprocessing time
that answers all-pairs queries under any kind of failures in polylogarithmic
time.
</p>
<p>We also consider 2-reachability problems, where we are given a planar digraph
$G$ and we wish to determine if there are two vertex-disjoint (edge-disjoint)
paths from $u$ to $v$, for query vertices $u,v$. In this setting we provide a
nearly optimal 2-reachability oracle, which is the existential variant of the
reachability oracle under single failures, with the following bounds. We can
construct in $O(n\log^{O(1)}{n})$ time an $O(n\log^{3+o(1)}{n})$-space data
structure that can check in $O(\log^{2+o(1)}{n})$ time for any query vertices
$u,v$ whether $v$ is 2-reachable from $u$, or otherwise find some separating
vertex (edge) $x$ lying on all paths from $u$ to $v$ in $G$.
</p>
<p>To obtain our results, we follow the general recursive approach of Thorup for
reachability in planar graphs [J.~ACM~'04] and we present new data structures
which generalize dominator trees and previous data structures for
strong-connectivity under failures [Georgiadis et al., SODA~'17]. Our new data
structures work also for general digraphs and may be of independent interest.

vertex attributes for instanced 3D meshes. In this paper, we implement and

    <title>Snappability and singularity-distance of pin-jointed body-bar frameworks</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1610236800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nawratil:Georg.html">Georg Nawratil</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02490">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>It is well-known that there exist rigid frameworks whose physical models can
snap between different realizations due to non-destructive elastic deformations
of material. We present a method to measure these snapping capability based on
the total elastic strain energy density of the framework by using the physical
concept of Green-Lagrange strain. As this so-called snappability only depends
on the intrinsic framework geometry, it enables a fair comparison of
pin-jointed body-bar frameworks, thus it can serve engineers as a criterion
within the design process either to avoid snapping phenomena (e.g. truss
structures) or to utilize them (e.g. multistable materials). Moreover, it turns
out that the value obtained from this intrinsic pseudometric also gives the
distance to the closest shaky configuration in the case of isostatic
frameworks. Therefore it is also of use for the kinematics community, which is
highly interested in the computation of these singularity-distances for diverse
mechanical devices. In more detail we study this problem for parallel
manipulators of Stewart-Gough type.

successful in image processing for preserving sharp features as well as smooth
transition variations. However, none of the existing works aims at numerically
calculating TGV over triangular meshes. In this paper, we develop a novel
numerical framework to discretize the second-order TGV over triangular meshes.
Further, we propose a TGV-based variational model to restore the face normal
field for mesh denoising. The TGV regularization in the proposed model is
represented by a combination of a first- and second-order term, which can be
automatically balanced. This TGV regularization is able to locate sharp
features and preserve them via the first-order term, while recognize smoothly
curved regions and recover them via the second-order term. To solve the
optimization problem, we introduce an efficient iterative algorithm based on
variable-splitting and augmented Lagrangian method. Extensive results and
comparisons on synthetic and real scanning data validate that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods visually and numerically.

algorithm for real-weighted directed graphs. The algorithm has
$\tilde{O}(nm+(n/d)^3)$ work and $\tilde{O}(d)$ depth for any depth parameter
$d\in [1,n]$. To the best of our knowledge, such a trade-off has only been
previously described for the real-weighted single-source shortest paths problem
using randomization [Bringmann et al., ICALP'17]. Moreover, our result improves
upon the parallelism of the state-of-the-art randomized parallel algorithm for
computing transitive closure, which has $\tilde{O}(nm+n^3/d^2)$ work and
$\tilde{O}(d)$ depth [Ullman and Yannakakis, SIAM J. Comput. '91]. Our APSP
algorithm turns out to be a powerful tool for designing efficient planar graph
algorithms in both parallel and sequential regimes.
</p>
<p>One notable ingredient of our parallel APSP algorithm is a simple
deterministic $\tilde{O}(nm)$-work $\tilde{O}(d)$-depth procedure for computing
$\tilde{O}(n/d)$-size hitting sets of shortest $d$-hop paths between all pairs
of vertices of a real-weighted digraph. Such hitting sets have also been called
$d$-hub sets. Hub sets have previously proved especially useful in designing
parallel or dynamic shortest paths algorithms and are typically obtained via
random sampling. Our procedure implies, for example, an $\tilde{O}(nm)$-time
deterministic algorithm for finding a shortest negative cycle of a
real-weighted digraph. Such a near-optimal bound for this problem has been so
far only achieved using a randomized algorithm [Orlin et al., Discret. Appl.
Math. '18].

complexity of time evolution, formulated as the shortest geodesic length on the
unitary group manifold between the identity and the time evolution operator, in

the time evolution trajectory, and hence complexity grows linearly in time. We
study how this linear growth is eventually truncated by the appearance and
accumulation of conjugate points, which signal the presence of shorter
geodesics intersecting the time evolution trajectory. By explicitly locating
such "shortcuts" through analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate that:
(a) in the free theory, time evolution encounters conjugate points at a
polynomial time; consequently complexity growth truncates at $O(\sqrt{N})$, and
we find an explicit operator which "fast-forwards" the free $N$-fermion time
evolution with this complexity, (b) in a class of interacting integrable
theories, the complexity is upper bounded by $O({\rm poly}(N))$, and (c) in
chaotic theories, we argue that conjugate points do not occur until exponential
times $O(e^N)$, after which it becomes possible to find infinitesimally nearby
geodesics which approximate the time evolution operator. Finally, we explore
the notion of eigenstate complexity in free, integrable, and chaotic models.

    <title>TR21-003 |  Inverse-Exponential Correlation Bounds and Extremely Rigid Matrices from a New Derandomized XOR Lemma | 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Xin Lyu</title>
    <summary>In this work we prove that there is a function $f \in \textrm{E}^\textrm{NP}$ such that, for every sufficiently large $n$ and $d = \sqrt{n}/\log n$, $f_n$ ($f$ restricted to $n$-bit inputs) cannot be $(1/2 + 2^{-d})$-approximated by $\textrm{F}_2$-polynomials of degree $d$. We also observe that a minor improvement (e.g., improving $d$ to $n^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$) over our result will imply $\textrm{E}^\textrm{NP}$ cannot be computed by depth-$3$ $\textrm{AC}^0$-circuits of $2^{n^{1/2 + \varepsilon}}$ size, which is a notoriously hard open question in complexity theory. 
	
	Using the same proof techniques, we are also able to construct extremely rigid matrices over $\textrm{F}_2$ in $\textrm{P}^\textrm{NP}$. More specifically, we show that for every constant $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, there is a $\textrm{P}^\textrm{NP}$ algorithm which on input $1^n$ outputs an $n\times n$ $\textrm{F}_2$-matrix $H_n$ satisfying $\mathcal{R}_{H_n}(2^{\log^{1 - \varepsilon} n}) \ge (1/2 - \exp(-\log^{2/3 \cdot \varepsilon} n) ) \cdot n^2$, for every sufficiently large $n$. This improves the recent $\textrm{P}^\textrm{NP}$ constructions of rigid matrices in [Alman and Chen, FOCS 2019] and [Bhangale et al., FOCS 2020], which only gives  $\Omega(n^2)$ rigidity.
	
	The key ingredient in the proof of our new results is a new derandomized XOR lemma based on approximate linear sums, which roughly says that given an $n$-input function $f$ which cannot be $0.99$-approximated by certain linear sum of $s$ many functions in $\mathcal{F}$ within $\ell_1$-distance, one can construct a new function $\textrm{Amp}^f$ with $\widetilde{O}(n)$ input bits, which cannot be $(1/2+s^{\Omega(1)})$-approximated by $\mathcal{F}$-functions. Taking $\mathcal{F}$ to be a function collection containing low-degree $\textrm{F}_2$-polynomials or low-rank $\textrm{F}_2$-matrices, our results are then obtained by first using the algorithmic method to construct a function which is weakly hard against linear sums of $\mathcal{F}$ in the above sense, and then apply the derandomized XOR lemma to $f$.
	
	We obtain our new derandomized XOR lemma by giving a generalization of the famous hardcore lemma by Impagliazzo. Our generalization in some sense constructs a non-Boolean hardcore of a weakly hard function $f$ with respect to $\mathcal{F}$-functions, from the weak inapproximability of $f$ by any linear sum of $\mathcal{F}$ with bounded $\ell_p$-norm. This generalization recovers the original hardcore lemma by considering the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm. Surprisingly, when we switch to the $\ell_1$-norm, we immediately rediscover Levin's proof of Yao's XOR Lemma. That is, these first two proofs of Yao's XOR Lemma can be unified with our new perspective. For proving the correlation bounds, our new derandomized XOR lemma indeed works with the $\ell_{4/3}$-norm.</summary>

    <title>TR21-002 |  Fooling Constant-Depth Threshold Circuits | 

	Pooya Hatami, 

	William Hoza, 

	Avishay Tal, 

	Roei Tell</title>
    <summary>We present new constructions of pseudorandom generators (PRGs) for two of the most widely-studied non-uniform circuit classes in complexity theory. Our main result is a construction of the first non-trivial PRG for linear threshold (LTF) circuits of arbitrary constant depth and super-linear size. This PRG fools circuits with depth $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and $n^{1+\delta}$ wires, where $\delta = 2^{-O(d)}$, using seed length $O(n^{1-\delta})$ and with error $2^{-n^{\delta}}$. This tightly matches the best known lower bounds for this circuit class. As a consequence of our result, all the known hardness for LTF circuits has now effectively been translated into pseudorandomness. This brings the extensive effort in the last decade to construct PRGs and deterministic circuit-analysis algorithms for this class to the point where any subsequent improvement would yield breakthrough lower bounds.
    
Our second contribution is a PRG for De Morgan formulas of size $s$ whose seed length is $s^{1/3+o(1)} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon)$ for error $\epsilon$. In particular, our PRG can fool formulas of sub-cubic size $s=n^{3-\Omega(1)}$ with an exponentially small error $\epsilon=\exp({-n^{\Omega(1)}})$. This significantly improves the inverse-polynomial error of the previous state-of-the-art for such formulas by Impagliazzo, Meka, and Zuckerman (FOCS 2012), and again tightly matches the best currently-known lower bounds for this class.
    
In both settings, a key ingredient in our constructions is a pseudorandom restriction procedure that has tiny failure probability, but simplifies the function to a non-natural "hybrid computational model" that combines several computational models. As part of our proofs we also construct "extremely low-error" PRGs for related circuit classes; for example, we construct a PRG for the class of functions computable by an arbitrary function of $s$ linear threshold functions that can handle even the extreme setting of parameters $s=n/\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and $\epsilon=2^{-n/\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$.</summary>

<p>
Allan Lichtman correctly predicted the 2020 presidential election, based on a 7-6 edge in “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_the_White_House">keys</a>” to Joe Biden. His model, which he <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/78/11/7230">developed</a> in 1981 with the late Vladimir Keilis-Borok, simply says that the incumbent party will lose the presidential election if 6 or more keys go against them. It has been right in every election since 1984.</p>
<p>
Today we make some predictions for the new year, 2021.</p>
<p>
Lichtman has not ventured a prediction for today’s Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Last November 19, he penned an <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/526780-time-to-jettison-horse-race-polls">article</a> eviscerating the performance of poll aggregation in the November 3 election. We have considered writing a post about that and about statistical predictions during the pandemic, in the direction of taking more moderate assessments of how various polls, predictions, and policies have fared.</p>
<p>
Polls of today’s races currently show a 1–2 percentage point edge for the Democratic candidates, but there are multiple caveats: The difference is just about one standard deviation, well within the margin of error even after aggregation. The polls have gyrated with multiple lead flips this past month; two polls from the past few days collected <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/georgia-senate-polls/?cid=rrpromo">here</a> show both Republican candidates tied or ahead. Many pollsters have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-many-pollsters-are-sitting-out-the-georgia-runoffs/">avoided</a> these races, and the five most recent polls all have sample sizes well under 1,000. The count beginning tonight may show a zigzag blue-to-red-to-“blur” shift for reasons of which votes are tallied when that we discussed generally <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/03/the-election-night-time-warp/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
With that said, let us address non-election predictions.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Previous Predictions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Back in <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/06/predictions-for-2019/">2019</a> we made some predictions that were easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>No circuit lower bound <img alt="{1000n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1000n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1000n}"/> or better will be proved for SAT.</em> Well that’s a freebie. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A computer scientist will win a Nobel Prize.</em> No—indeed, less close than other years. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>At least five claims that <img alt="{{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%3D%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}}"/> and five that <img alt="{{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}}"/> will be made.</em> Gerhard Woeginger’s claims <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm">page</a> is still paused at 2016, so we can only judge from our own window of communications made to us or commented in the blog. All we can say is that the number in each case is “order-of” <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{5}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A “provably” secure crypto-system will be broken.</em> For this one we don’t have to check any claims. We just pocket the “yes” answer.
</li></ul>
<p>
We skipped 2020—maybe that was smart of us? Our point about predictions in 2019 was the importance of “<em>when</em>” as opposed to “<em>what</em>.” With regard to some predictions, we can take the pandemic is as a global postponement of “when.”</p>
<p>
We claim complete and ongoing timeliness with another 2019 prediction, however. In full, we wrote:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Quantum supremacy will be proved—finally.</em> But be careful: there is a problem with this whole direction. See the next section.
</li></ul>
<p>
The section two years ago talked about the difficulties of proving such a claim. A claim was duly made in October 2019, which we evaluated <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">here</a>, but arguments over “proof” have not abated. They have just recently been summarized by Gil Kalai <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/29/the-argument-against-quantum-computers-a-very-short-introduction/">here</a>, and also <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5159">here</a> by Scott Aaronson in regard to an independent <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6523/1460">claim</a> by researchers from USTC in China.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Predictions for 2021 </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are some new predictions for 2021. We will try and skip easy ones like the above. We will try to make some that are surprising. We’ve made predictions about evidence for life on exoplanets before; we do something different there too. We do not venture any about the course of the pandemic.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>Quantum algorithms: <img alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{BQP}}"/> will be proved to be in sub-exponential time.</em> <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Further work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold">AlphaFold</a> will lead to a proof of a sub-exponential time algorithm for protein folding.</em> <p/>
</li><li>
<em>In consequence or independently, a SAT algorithm will be discovered that runs in sub-exponential time, thereby refuting various forms of the Exponential Time Hypothesis.</em> What do we mean by “sub-exponential” time here? Dick says the time for the SAT algorithm will be <img alt="{2^{\sqrt{n}\log n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%5Clog+n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2^{\sqrt{n}\log n}}"/>. Ken more modestly says time <img alt="{2^{O(n/\log n)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7BO%28n%2F%5Clog+n%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2^{O(n/\log n)}}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Another Clay prize problem (besides <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> versus <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>) will be claimed as solved, and then retracted.</em> <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A new kind of sorting network of size <img alt="{O(n \log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n+%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{O(n \log n)}"/> will be discovered, inspired by a connection to <img alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{O(n\log n)}"/> integer <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/integer-multiplication-in-nlogn-time/">multiplication</a><a>.</a></em><a> <p/>
</a></li><li><a>
<em>A new factoring algorithm will be discovered that beats the number field sieve.</em> <p/>
</a></li><li><a>
<em>A lower bound argument will show that clique requires formula size <img alt="{n^{10}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B10%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{n^{10}}"/> over the <img alt="{\vee,\wedge,\neg}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvee%2C%5Cwedge%2C%5Cneg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\vee,\wedge,\neg}"/> basis.</em> <p/>
</a></li><li><a>

</li><li>
<em>Dogs will reach 25% of the proficiency of cats at <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/cat-and-dog-challenge/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic">navigating</a> home obstacle courses, but not before the third quarter of 2021.</em> <p/>

<p>ORIGINAL MESSAGE: Please see below for a message from Shang-Hua Teng, regarding the possibility of waivers for SODA 2021 registration for students.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Dear TCS students:<br/><br/>By now, it is hard to overestimate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic to society. However, like every challenge, it has created some opportunities. For example, essentially all major conferences in TCS this year have been transformed into virtual ones, making them more accessible to scholars/students across the world (of course at the expense of traditional interactions). <br/><br/>ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA21) will be held virtually this year, on Jan. 10 – 13, 2021. As you may know, this is the premier conference on algorithms .<br/><br/>See <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda21" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda21</a><br/><br/>Thanks to our industry partners and ACM SIGACT group, SODA has some funds for covering student registrations. I am writing to informing you this opportunity and encourage you to apply:<br/> See: <br/>1. <a href="https://awards.siam.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://awards.siam.org/</a> <br/>2. <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/lodging-and-support/travel-support/soda21-travel-support" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/lodging-and-support/travel-support/soda21-travel-support</a><br/>That deadline is Dec. 27, 2020. Like before, having papers in SODA is not prerequisite.<br/><br/>Shang-Hua Teng<br/>On Behalf of SODA Steering Committee<br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text"><a href="https://francisbach.com/optimization-is-as-hard-as-approximation/">Last month</a>, I showed how global optimization based only on accessing function values can be hard with no convexity assumption. In a nutshell, with limited smoothness, the number of function evaluations has to grow exponentially fast in dimension, which is a rather negative statement. On the positive side, this number does not grow as fast for highly smooth functions. However, optimal algorithms end up approximating the whole function to minimize, and <em>then</em> minimizing the approximation, which takes exponential time in general. In this post, I will describe very recent work with Alessandro Rudi and Ulysse Marteau-Ferey [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] that essentially <em>jointly</em> approximates the function and minimizes the approximation.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Our task for this post will be to minimize a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), for which we know the global minimizer is already located in a certain bounded set \(\Omega\) (typically a large ball). We can query values of \(f\) at any point in \(\Omega\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out it can be formulated as a convex optimization problem (there has to be a catch in this statement, stay tuned).</p>



<h2>All optimization problems are convex!</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the following minimization problem: $$\tag{1} \sup_{c \in \mathbb{R}} \ c \ \ \mbox{ such that } \ \ \forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) \geqslant c.$$ As illustrated below, this corresponds to finding the largest lower bound \(c\) on the function.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5352" height="203" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/f_above_c-1-1024x670.png" width="310"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Assuming \(f\) attains its global minimizer \(f_\ast\) in \(\Omega\), then the optimal value of the problem above is attained and is clearly \(f_\ast\), that is, the problem in Eq. (1) leads to the minimal value of \(f\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, each constraint in Eq. (1) is a linear constraint in \(c\), and the objective is linear. Hence we obtain a linear programming problem which is a particularly simple instance of a convex optimization problem. Thus, all optimization problems are convex!</p>



<p class="justify-text">The catch here is that the set of inequalities is dense, that is, in general, \(\Omega\) contains infinitely many elements, and thus the number of constraints is infinite.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Duality.</strong> It is worth deriving the convex optimization dual (being loose here in terms of regularity and integrability conditions). We add a Lagrange multiplier \(\mu(x) \geqslant 0\) for each of the constraints \(f(x) \, – c \geqslant 0\), and consider the Lagrangian<br/>$$ \mathcal{L}(c,\mu) = c + \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) \big( f(x) \, – c\big) dx.$$ Maximizing it with respect to \(c\) leads to the constraint \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) dx = 1\), that is, \(\mu\) represents a probability distribution, and the dual problem is $$ \inf_{\mu \in \mathbb{R}^\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) f(x) dx \ \ \mbox{ such that } \int_\Omega\! \mu(x) dx = 1 \mbox{ and } \forall x \in \Omega, \ \mu(x) \geqslant 0.$$ In words, we minimize the expectation of \(f\) with respect to all probability distributions on \(\Omega\) with densities. Here, the infimum is obtained from any probability measure that puts mass only on the minimizer of \(f\) on \(\Omega\). This measure is typically not absolutely continuous, and thus the infimum is not attained (no big deal).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5350" height="202" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/f_and_mu-1024x699.png" width="295"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This is also a convex optimization problem, with a linear objective function on the infinite-dimensional set of probability measures.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Overall, we get convex but (apparently) useless problems. We will first need an efficient way to represent non-negativity of functions (this will be applied to \(f(x) \, – c\)).</p>



<h2>Positivity with “sums of squares”</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now start to make some assumptions on the function \(f\) to be minimized. We will assume that it can be written as $$\forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) = \langle \phi(x), F \phi(x) \rangle,$$ for some feature vector \(\phi(x)\) in some Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\), and \(F\) a symmetric linear operator on \(\mathcal{H}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">We will need infinite dimensions later, but you can safely assume that \(\mathcal{H}\) is a classical Euclidean space (e.g., \(\mathbb{R}^{{\rm dim}(\mathcal{H})}\)), and that we have $$\forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) = \phi(x)^\top F \phi(x) = \sum_{i,j=1}^{{\rm dim}(\mathcal{H})} F_{ij} \phi(x)_i \phi(x)_j.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We will also assume that the constant function on \(\Omega\) can be represented as well, that is, there exists \(u \in \mathcal{H}\) such that \(\forall x \in \Omega, \ \langle u, \phi(x) \rangle = 1.\) This is to ensure that we can represent within the optimization problem above the function \(f(x) \, – c = \langle \phi(x), (F – c \, u \otimes u) \phi(x) \rangle\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical example is the set of polynomials of degree \(2r\) for which we can choose \(\phi(x)\) to be of dimension \(d+r \choose r\) and contain all monomials are degree less than \(r\). We will go infinite-dimensional and link this to kernels later in this post.</p>



<p class="justify-text">You may wonder why we are not simply modeling the function \(f\) with a classical formulation \(f(x) = \langle w, \phi(x) \rangle\). This is precisely to be able to enforce positivity.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Positivity through “sum-of-squares”.</strong> We can assume that the operator \(F\) is positive-semidefinite (which we will denote \(F \succcurlyeq 0\)), that is, all of its eigenvalues are non-negative, or, for all \(h \in \mathcal{H}\), \(\langle h, F h \rangle \geqslant 0\). Then this implies that the function \(f\) is pointwise positive. Thus:  $$ \tag{2} F \succcurlyeq 0 \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ \forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x)  = \langle \phi(x), F \phi(x) \rangle \geqslant 0. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We refer to such functions as “sum-of-squares”. Indeed, given the spectral decomposition of \(F\) as $$ F = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i h_i \otimes h_i, $$ with \(I\) a countable set, and \((h_i)_{i \in I}\) an orthonormal family in \(\mathcal{H}\), we have \(\lambda_i \geqslant 0\) for all \(i \in I\), and thus we can write $$ f(x) = \langle \phi(x), F \phi(x) \rangle = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i \langle \phi(x) , (h_i \otimes h_i) \phi(x) \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n \big( \sqrt{\lambda_i} \langle h_i , \phi(x) \rangle \big)^2.$$ That is, the function \(f\) is a sum of squares of functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A key question is whether the implication in Eq. \((2)\) can be reversed. In other words, <em>can we write all non-negative functions as sum-of-squares?</em> The answer will depend on the chosen feature map \(\phi: \Omega \to \mathcal{H}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Polynomials.</strong> For polynomials, the answer is known to be positive in dimension 1, but negative in higher dimensions (see the nice review in [<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2695736">2</a>]): that is, unless \(d=1\), or \(d=2\) and \(r=2\), there are polynomials of degree \(2r\) in dimension \(d\) that are non-negative but are not the sum of squares of polynomials. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Keeping in mind the difference being non-negative and being a sum of squares, let’s look how this can be used for global optimization of polynomials.</p>



<h2>Polynomial optimization with sums-of-squares</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider that \(f\) is a polynomial of degree \(2r\), and that \(\phi(x)\) is of dimension \(d+r \choose r\) and contain all monomials of degree less than \(r\). We consider representing the constraint \(f(x)\geqslant c\) in Eq. (1), as \(f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle\) for some positive-definite operator (here a matrix) \(A\). With the notations above, this is equivalent to \(F = c u \otimes u + A\) and \(A \succcurlyeq 0\). This leads to the following optimization problem (no localization set \(\Omega\) is used): $$ \tag{3} \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A \succcurlyeq 0} c \ \mbox{ such that } \ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle .$$ This in now a problem in finite dimension, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming">semidefinite programming</a> problem, and can thus a priori be solved in polynomial time in \(d+r \choose r\). See [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1052623400366802">3</a>, 4] for more details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, beyond the potentially large dimension of the convex problem when \(r\) and \(d\) grow, there is a major concern: is the problem in Eq. (3) equivalent to the one in Eq. (1)? This is true if and only if the polynomial \(f(x) \, – f_\ast\) is a a sum-of-squares, which given the discussion above may not happen as soon as \(d \geqslant 2\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to apply to all polynomials, the problem has to be changed. A simple reformulation is possible [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1052623400366802">3</a>] by assuming that the global minimum of \(f\) is attained within the set \(\Omega = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ x^\top x \leqslant R^2\}\) for some \(R &gt; 0\). It turns out (and this is a highly non-trivial fact) that all polynomials \(f(x) \) which are positive on \(\Omega\) can be written as \(f(x) = q(x) + ( R^2 – x^\top x ) p(x)\), where \(q(x)\) and \(p(x) \) are sum-of-squares polynomials. The only issue is that the degrees of \(p\) and \(q\) are not known in advance so a sequence (a so-called “hierarchy”) of problems have to be solved with increasing degrees, each providing a lower bound on \(f_\ast\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">When the degree is large enough so that the sum-of-squares representation exists for \(f – f_\ast\), then the following problem  $$ \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A, B \succcurlyeq 0} c \mbox{ such that } \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle + ( R^2 – x^\top x ) \langle \phi(x), B \phi(x) \rangle$$ is a semi-definite program, whose solution leads to \(c = f_\ast\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This remains a large semi-definite program whose order is not known in advance and for which complicated solvers are needed. I will now present our recent work where we go infinite-dimensional, and some of these issues are alleviated (but some others are created).</p>



<h2>Going infinite-dimensional</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider \(\phi(x)\) to be infinite-dimensional. In order to allow finite-dimensional manipulations of various objects, we consider feature maps which are obtained from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_kernel">positive-definite kernels</a>. More precisely, we consider the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev space</a> \(\mathcal{H}\) of functions on \(\Omega\) with all partial derivatives up to order \(s\) which are square-integrable. When \(s &gt; d/2\), then this is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, that is, there exists a positive-definite kernel \(k: \Omega \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) such that the feature map \(\phi(x) = k(\cdot,x)\) allows to access function values as \(h(x) = \langle h, \phi(x) \rangle\) for all \(h \in \mathcal{H}\). For the algorithm, we will only need access to the kernel; for example, for \(s = d/2+1/2\), we can choose the usual exponential \(k(x,y) = \exp( – \alpha \| x – y \|_2)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider the same problem as for polynomials, but with this new feature map: $$\tag{4} \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A \succcurlyeq 0} c \ \mbox{ such that } \ \forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle .$$ In order to have an exact reformulation, we need that there exists some \(A_\ast\) such that \(\forall x \in \Omega, \ f(x)  \, – f_\ast = \langle \phi(x), A_\ast \phi(x) \rangle\). It turns out to be true [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] with appropriate geometric conditions on \(x\) (such as isolated second-order strict global minimizers within \(\Omega\)) and regularity (at least \(s+3\) derivatives); see [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This is all very nice, but the problem in Eq. (4) is still an infinite-dimensional problem (note that we have gone from a continuum of inequalities to elements of a Hilbert space, but that’s not much of a gain). </p>



<h2>Controlled approximation through sampling</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now leverage classical and more recent techniques from kernel methods. The main idea is to subsample the set of equalities in Eq. (4), that is consider \(n\) points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \Omega\), and solve instead the regularized sampled problem $$\tag{5} \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}, A \succcurlyeq 0} c \ – \, \lambda \, {\rm tr}(A) \ \mbox{ such that }\  \forall i \in \{1,\dots,n\}, \ f(x_i) = c + \langle \phi(x_i), A \phi(x_i) \rangle , $$ where \(\lambda &gt; 0\) is a regularization parameter.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Approximation guarantees.</strong> Beyond computational considerations, how big does \(n\) need to be to obtain a value of \(c\) which is at most \(\varepsilon\) away from \(f_\ast\)? From <a href="https://francisbach.com/optimization-is-as-hard-as-approximation/">last post</a>, if \(f\) is \(m\)-times differentiable, we cannot have \(n\) smaller than \(\varepsilon^{-d/m}\). As shown in [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>], for points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \Omega\) selected uniformly at random, then \(n\) can be taken to of the order \(\varepsilon^{-d/(m – d/2 – 3)}\) for a well-chosen Sobolev space \(s\) and regularization parameter \(\lambda\). This is not the optimal rate \(\varepsilon^{-d/(m – d/2)}\) , but close when \(m\) and \(d\) are large.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Finite-dimensional algorithm.</strong> The problem in Eq. (5) is still infinite-dimensional. We can leverage a recent work, again with Ulysse Marteau-Ferey and Alessandro Rudi [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03926(opens in a new tab)">5</a>], that shows that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a> exists for this type of problems: the optimization for the operator \(A\) may be restricted to \(A\) of the form $$A = \sum_{i,j} C_{ij} \phi(x_i) \otimes \phi(x_j)$$ for a positive definite <em>matrix</em> \(C \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\). This leads to a semi-definite programming problem of size \(n\), whose running-time complexity is polynomial in \(n\) (e.g, \(O(n^{3.5})\)), with standard general-purpose toolboxes (such as <a href="http://cvxr.com/cvx/">CVX</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to tackle large values \(n\) which are larger than \(1000\), simple iterative algorithms can be designed (see [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>] for a damped Newton algorithm which does not require any singular value decompositions, with complexity \(O(n^3)\) per iteration). Classical tools for efficient kernel methods, such as column sampling / Nyström method (see [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Bach13.pdf">6</a>, <a href="http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/5936-less-is-more-nystrom-computational-regularization.pdf">7</a>] and references therein) or random features (see [<a href="http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/6914-generalization-properties-of-learning-with-random-features.pdf">8</a>, <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-178/15-178.pdf">9</a>] and references therein), could also be used to avoid a cubic or quadratic complexity in \(n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Comparison with random search.</strong> Instead of solving the problem in Eq. (5), we could output the minimal value of \(f(x_i)\) for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\), which is exactly random search if the points \(x_i\) are random (this also happens to correspond to using \(\lambda=0\) in Eq. (5)). This can only achieve an error \(\varepsilon\) for \(n\) of order \(\varepsilon^{-d}\); in other words, it cannot leverage smoothness, while our algorithm can. The main technical reason is that subsampling inequalities provide weaker guarantees than subsampling equalities, and thus representing the non-negativity of a function through an equality (which our method essentially does) provides significant benefits.</p>



<h2>Duality</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As always in convex optimization, it is beneficial to look at dual problems. It turns out that iterative algorithms are easier to build for the finite-dimensional dual problem to Eq. (5). We rather look now at the dual of Eq. (4) and make the parallel with the primal original problem in Eq. (1) and its dual.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Introducing a Lagrange multiplier \(\mu(x)\) for the constraint \(f(x) = c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle\) (this time not constrained to be non-negative because we have an equality constraint), we can form the Lagrangian $$\mathcal{L}(c,A,\mu) = c + \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) \big( f(x) \, – c \, – \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle \big) dx.$$ Maximizing with respect to \(c\) again leads to the constraint \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) dx = 1\), while minimizing with respect to \(A \succcurlyeq 0\) leads to the constraint \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) \phi(x) \otimes \phi(x) dx \succcurlyeq 0 .\) The dual problem thus becomes $$ \inf_{\mu \in \mathbb{R}^\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \! \mu(x) f(x) dx \ \ \mbox{ such that } \int_\Omega\! \mu(x) dx = 1 \mbox{ and } \ \int_\Omega \mu(x) \phi(x) \otimes \phi(x)dx \succcurlyeq 0.$$ The impact of the representation of non-negative functions by quadratic forms in \(\phi(x)\) is to replace the non-negativity contraint on all \(\mu(x)\) by the positivity of the matrix \(\int_\Omega \mu(x) \phi(x) \otimes \phi(x)dx\), which is weaker in general, but equivalent if \(\phi(x)\) is “large” enough.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that the dual problem through a signed measure that should concentrate around the minimizers of \(f\) leads to a natural candidate \(\int_\Omega x \mu(x) dx\) for the optimizer (see more details in [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">1</a>], and a similar dual formulation for polynomials in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08566.pdf">10</a>]).</p>



<h2>Simulations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to highlight how the optimization method works, I will first present how it minimizes the multi-modal function in dimension \(d=2\) pictured below on \([-1,1]^2\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5384" height="367" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f3d_blog-1024x768.png" width="500"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We consider sampling a sequence of points \(x_1, x_2,\dots \in \mathbb{R}^2\) from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence">quasi-random sequence </a>(so that it fills the space more evenly that purely random). The random points are displayed in purple while the solution of our algorithm is displayed in red, with increasing numbers \(n\) of sampled points. On the right plot, the model \(c + \langle \phi(x), A \phi(x) \rangle\) is displayed, showing that the model becomes more accurate as \(n\) grows.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5385" height="434" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gloptikernel_blog.gif" width="1196"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We also consider a problem in dimension \(d=8\), where we compare random sampling and our algorithm (“gloptikernel”), as \(n\) grows (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11978">1</a>] for the experimental set-up).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5383" height="302" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/plot_blog_perf.png" width="362"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Clearly, the chosen baseline (random sampling) is rudimentary, though optimal up to logarithmic terms for non-smooth problems where only Lipschitz-continuity is assumed. We can also compare to gradient descent with random restarts (“random+GD” below, with the same overall number of function evaluations). As shown below, when the gradient information is robust, this baseline performs similarly (left plot), while when a high frequency component is added to the function (which makes the gradient information non reliable, right plot), the local descent algorithm needs more function evaluations.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5410" height="262" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/randomGD-1-1024x442.png" width="607"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">It would be interesting to compare this new algorithms to other global optimization algorithms based on function evaluations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES">CMA-ES</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization">Bayesian optimization</a>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I presented an algorithm for global optimization that can provably leverage smoothness with an algorithm which has a running time which is polynomial in the dimension and the number of function evaluations. For large smoothness factors, the number of such evaluations has a dependence on the precision \(\varepsilon\) which has no exponential dependence in dimension in the exponent (but still in the constants: we cannot optimize multivariate polynomials in polynomial time…).</p>



<p class="justify-text">These ideas can be extended in a number of ways.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>General relaxation tool for dense inequalities. </strong>We can generalize the previous developments to all problems with a continuum of constraints on a variable \(\theta\), such as, $$ \forall x \in \Omega, \ H(\theta,x) \geqslant 0.$$ The corresponding Lagrange multipliers also satisfy $$ \forall x \in \Omega, \ \mu(x) \geqslant 0$$ (there may be other ones like in the problem above). Now the question is: should we use the non-negative modelisation with quadratic forms in the primal or in the dual? Or equivalently, replace the non-negativity constraint by the positivity of the integral of \(\phi(x) \otimes \phi(x)\) in the dual or in the primal?</p>



<p class="justify-text">The answer depends on the expected smoothness of the function which is non-negative. In the optimization problem, we expect \(f(x) \, – c\) to be smooth at the optimum, while \(\mu(x)\) which is approximating a Dirac clearly isn’t; therefore, the choice is clear (at least in retrospect since we originally tried to model \(\mu(x)\) as a quadratic form…).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Constrained optimization.</strong> Following [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S1052623400366802">3</a>], we can apply the same algorithmic technique to constrained optimization, by formulating the problem of minimizing \(f(x)\) such that \(g(x) &gt; 0\) as maximizing \(c\) such that \(f(x) = c + p(x) + g(x)q(x)\), and \(p, q\) non-negative functions. We can (at least in principle) then replace the non-negative constraints by \(p(x) = \langle \phi(x),A\phi(x)\rangle\) and \(q(x) =\langle \phi(x),B\phi(x)\rangle\) for positive operators \(A\) and \(B\). All this remains to be explored in more details.</p>

<p><strong>Almost Optimal Bounds for Sublinear-Time Sampling of k-Cliques: Sampling Cliques is Harder Than Counting</strong> by Talya Eden, Dana Ron, and Will Rosenbaum (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04090">arXiv</a>). In many settings, sampling and counting are tightly coupled; the classic example being permanent estimation and sampling random bipartite matchings.This paper investigates the problem of sampling uniform random cliques, and unearths an interesting separation of approximately uniform sampling from approximate counting. Let’s consider the fundamental problem of edge and triangle counting, in graphs of constant arboricity. This class, which contains all minor-closed families, has deep connections to clique counting; clique counting can be done in linear time for bounded arboricity graphs.) The input connected graph \(G\) has \(n\) vertices, \(m\) edges, and \(t\) triangles. We assume the standard query model, with uniform random vertices, neighbor, and degree queries. Our aim is to get \((1+\varepsilon)\)-approximations for \(m\) and \(t\) (in general, any \(k\)-clique count). It is known from previous work that edge estimation can be done in \(O(1)\) time and triangle estimation can be done in \(O(n/t)\) time (ignoring log and \(\varepsilon\) dependencies). Moreover, these bounds is optimal. Can one get similar bounds for approximately sampling a uniform random edge/triangle? Previous work of <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/8300/">Eden-Rosenbaum</a> achieve such a bound for sampling edges. Surprisingly, this paper shows that triangle sampling is fundamentally harder, and requires \(\Omega(n^{3/4}/\sqrt{t})\) queries. The main result gives a precise and optimal bound for uniform sampling \(k\)-cliques in graphs of arboricity \(\alpha\).  </p>



<p><strong>Testing and reconstruction via decision trees </strong>by Guy Blanc, Jane Lange, and Li-Yang Tan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08735">arXiv</a>). A property tester is an (sublinear) algorithm that distinguishes an object with a property from those that are far. Reconstruction is a much stronger sublinear algorithm, which actually provides query access to the closest object. Suppose we have query access to an \(n\)-variate Boolean function \(f\), and the property \(\mathcal{P}\) of interest is size-\(s\) decision trees. A reconstructor would give query access to a function \(g \in \mathcal{P}\), such that \(dist(f,g) = O(OPT_f)\), where \(OPT_f\) is the distance of \(f\) to \(\mathcal{P}\). Observe that a reconstructor automatically gives a distance estimator (just estimate \(dist(f,g)\) by random sampling). One of the main results of this paper is a (weaker, bicriteria) reconstructor, where \(g\) is guaranteed to have decision-tree complexity \(s^{O(\log^2s)}\). Each query to \(g\) is computed in \(poly(\log s, 1/\varepsilon)\cdot n\) time. This reconstructor leads to a number of testing results, and reconstructors for other properties like low Fourier degree. Another interesting result proven: if there exists an efficient reconstructor that gets \(g\) of size \(s\), then there exists an efficient proper learner for decision trees (a big open problem).</p>



<p><strong>Testing Product Distributions: A Closer Look </strong>by Arnab Bhattacharyya, Sutanu Gayen, Saravanan Kandasamy, and N. V. Vinodchandran (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14632">arXiv</a>). This paper is on distribution testing, where all distributions involved are promised to be <em>product distributions</em>. Let \(P, Q\) be distributions over \(\Sigma^n\), where \(Sigma\) is some (small) finite set. The problems studied are identity testing (\(Q\) is known/fixed, and one gets samples from unknown \(P\)) and closeness testing (both unknown). It is known from previous work that these problems can basically be solved with \(O(n|\Sigma|\varepsilon^{-2})\) samples. Note that the domain size is exponential in \(n\); thus, these bounds give an exponential improvement over identity/closeness testing in the vanilla (non-product) setting. Tolerant testing is of special significance here. Because the domain is so large, it makes sense to allow for some distance even in the “yes” case. The main result of this paper is to completely map out the complexities for identity/closeness testing where we wish to distinguish \(d_1(P,Q) &lt; \varepsilon_1\) from \(d_2(P,Q) &gt; \varepsilon_2\), where \(d_1, d_2\) are potentially different distance measures. For example, the paper considers total variation (TV), KL, Hellinger, and \(\chi^2\) distances. An important improvement achieved is for identity testing where \(d_1\) is Hellinger and \(d_2\) is TV distance: for certain values of \(\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2\), one can get a tester of optimal sample complexity \(O(\sqrt{n|\Sigma|})\). Previous bounds only gave a \(O(n|\Sigma|)\) sample complexity. There are a number of new lower bounds for different combinations of \(d_1, d_2\) distance pairs.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-001 |  Computation Over the Noisy Broadcast Channel with Malicious Parties | 

	Raghuvansh Saxena, 

	Gillat Kol, 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Dmitry Paramonov</title>
    <summary>We study the $n$-party noisy broadcast channel with a constant fraction of malicious parties. Specifically, we assume that each non-malicious party holds an input bit, and communicates with the others in order to learn the input bits of all non-malicious parties. In each communication round, one of the parties broadcasts a bit to all other parties, and the bit received by each party is flipped with a fixed constant probability (independently for each recipient). How many rounds are needed?

Assuming there are no malicious parties, Gallager gave an $\mathcal{O}(n \log \log n)$-round protocol for the above problem, which was later shown to be optimal. This protocol, however, inherently breaks down in the presence of malicious parties.

We present a novel $n \cdot \tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\sqrt{\log n}\right)$-round protocol, that solves this problem even when almost half of the parties are malicious. Our protocol uses a new type of error correcting code, which we call a locality sensitive code and which may be of independent interest. Roughly speaking, these codes map "close" messages to "close" codewords, while messages that are not close are mapped to codewords that are very far apart.

We view our result as a first step towards a theory of property preserving interactive coding, i.e., interactive codes that preserve useful properties of the protocol being encoded. In our case, the naive protocol  over the noiseless broadcast channel, where all the parties broadcast their input bit and output all the bits received, works even in the presence of malicious parties. Our simulation of this protocol, unlike Gallager's, preserves this property of the original protocol.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5224">last post</a> about covid vaccines felt like shouting uselessly into the void … at least until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Collison">Patrick Collison</a>, the cofounder of Stripe and a wonderful friend, massively signal-boosted the post by <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/patrickc/status/1345139269904474113">tweeting</a> it.  This business is of such life-and-death urgency right now, and a <em>shift in attitude</em> or a <em>hardening of resolve</em> by just a few people reading could have such an outsized effect, that with apologies to anyone wanting me to return to my math/CS/physics lane, I feel like a second post on the same topic is called for.</p>



<p>Here’s my main point for today (as you might have noticed, I’ve changed the tagline of this entire blog accordingly):</p>



<p><strong>Reasonable people can disagree about whether vaccination could have, or should have, started much earlier.  But now that we in the US <em>have</em> painstakingly approved two vaccines, we should all agree about the <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">urgent need to get millions of doses into people’s arms before they spoil!</span>  Sure, better the elderly than the young, better essential than inessential workers—but much more importantly, better today than tomorrow, and better anyone than no one!</strong></p>



<p>Israel, which <em>didn’t</em> do especially well in earlier stages of the pandemic, is now putting the rest of the planet to shame with vaccinations.  What Dana and I hear from our friends and relatives there confirms what you can read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/30/how-has-israel-launched-the-worlds-fastest-covid-vaccination-drive">here</a>, <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F01%2F01%2Fworld%2Fmiddleeast%2Fisrael-coronavirus-vaccines.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1mmRY74TuILhmj08gqlTM3bUlHjIgcl4bYpl788Z8Y8gPnVV9O3c9NdX8&amp;h=AT3_NCHDgesUdnhZASL2Q4v840iZjNdwl9PF_by1ekphfj74Aj558AJRN4jE_vLygxmdETWAzHpJjBv_WaTYvfOtdjuloJsQwU6HpitdfO4Mng8og-m9Y7PyXsvb2rWs3Q&amp;__tn__=%2CmH-R&amp;c[0]=AT2H2XioKIFzYeGiu0qeLpT21jx4aDKGvcu4ymay0B8b1AVIW0fPfMQW-jBEjojJvf8Q0p_387lyA7EGqh29PllsKvZUKAbVuBXyxet7VrpMc4bMIzHkSm2B35yFxWJ1zsyxtQesY6-dcQmt6s2PvpWSMIo">here</a>, and elsewhere.  Rabin Square in Tel Aviv is now a huge <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/01/world/01virus-israel-vaccine02/merlin_181829658_7892b3dd-561f-4678-8a02-29b507628ab6-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp">vaccination field site</a>.  Vaccinations are now proceeding 24/7, even on Shabbat—something the ultra-Orthodox rabbis are <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/293713">grudgingly tolerating</a> under the doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh#:~:text=Pikuach%20nefesh%20is%20the%20principle,of%20the%20Torah%20becomes%20inapplicable.">“pikuach nefesh”</a> (i.e., saving a life overrides almost every other religious obligation).  Israelis are receiving texts at all hours telling them when it’s their turn and where to go.  Apparently, after the nurses are finished with everyone who had appointments, rather than waste whatever already-thawed supply is left, they simply go into the street and <a href="https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1344735831655936001">offer the extra doses</a> to anyone passing by.</p>



<p>Contrast that with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/31/opinion/coronavirus-vaccines-expiring.html">historic fiasco</a>—yes, <em>another</em> historic fiasco—<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/americas-vaccine-rollout-disaster.html">now unfolding in the US</a>.  The Trump administration had pledged to administer 20 million vaccines (well, Trump originally said <em>100</em> million) by the end of 2020.  Instead, fewer than three million were administered, with the already-glacial pace slowing even further over the holidays.  Unbelievably, <em>millions of doses are on track to spoil this month, before they can be administered</em>.  The bottleneck is now not manufacturing, it’s not supply, it’s just pure bureaucratic dysfunction and chaos, lack of funding and staff, and a stone-faced unwillingness by governors to deviate from harebrained “plans” and “guidelines” even with their populations’ survival at stake.</p>



<p>Famously, the CDC urged that essential workers get vaccinated before the elderly, since even though their own modeling predicted that many more people from all ethnic groups would die that way, at least the deaths would be more equitably distributed.  While there <em>are</em> some good arguments to prioritize essential workers, an outcry then led to the CDC partially backtracking, and to many states just making up their own guidelines.  But we’re now, for real, headed for a scenario where none of these moral-philosophy debates turn out to matter, since the vaccines will simply spoil in freezers (!!!) while the medical system struggles to comply with the Byzantine rules about who gets them first.</p>



<p>While I’d <em>obviously</em> never advocate such a thing, one wonders whether there’s an idealistic medical worker, somewhere in the US, who’s willing to risk jail for vaccinating people without approval, using supply that would otherwise be wasted.  If <em>anything</em> could galvanize this sad and declining nation to move faster, maybe it’s that.</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>In my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5224">last post</a>, I invited people to explain to me where I went wrong in my naïve, simplistic, doofus belief that, were our civilization still capable of “WWII” levels of competence, flexibility, and calculated risk-tolerance, most of the world could have already been vaccinated by now.  In the rest of this post, I’d like to list the eight most important counterarguments to that position that commenters offered (at least, those that I hadn’t already anticipated in the post itself), together with my brief responses to them.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Faster approval wouldn’t have helped, since the limiting factor was just the time needed to ramp up the supply.</strong>  As the first part of this post discussed, ironically supply is <em>not</em> now the limiting factor, and approval even a month or two earlier could’ve provided precious time to iron out the massive problems in distribution.  More broadly, though, what’s becoming obvious is that we needed faster <em>everything</em>: testing, approval, manufacturing, and distribution.</li><li><strong>The real risk, with vaccines, is long-term side effects, ones that might manifest only after years.</strong>  What I don’t get is, if people genuinely believe this, then why are they OK with having approved the vaccines <em>last month</em>?  Why shouldn’t we have waited until 2024, or maybe 2040?  By that point, those of us who were still alive could take the covid vaccine with <em>real</em> confidence, at least that the dreaded side effects would be unlikely to manifest before 2060.</li><li><strong>Much like with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a>, there are limits to how much more money could’ve sped up vaccine manufacturing.</strong>   My problem is that, while this is undoubtedly true, I see no indication that we were anywhere close to those limits—or indeed, that the paltry ~$9 billion the US spent on covid vaccines was the output of <em>any</em> rational cost/benefit calculation.  It’s like: suppose an enemy army had invaded the US mainland, slaughtered 330,000 people, and shut down much of the economy.  Can you imagine Congress responding by giving the Pentagon a <em>1.3%</em> budget increase to fight back, reasoning that any more would run up against Amdahl’s Law?  That’s how much $9 billion is.</li><li><strong>The old, inactivated-virus vaccines often took years to develop, so spending years to test them as well made a lot more sense.</strong>  This is undoubtedly true, but is not a counterargument.  It’s time to rethink the whole vaccine approval process for the era of programmable mRNA, which is <em>also</em> the era of pandemics that can spread around the world in months.</li><li><strong>Human challenge trials wouldn’t have provided much information, because you can’t do challenge trials with old or sick people, and because covid spread so widely that normal Phase III trials were perfectly informative.</strong>  Actually, <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/">1DaySooner</a> had plenty of elderly volunteers and volunteers with preexisting conditions.  It bothers me how the impossibility of using those volunteers is treated like a law of physics, rather than what it is: another non-obvious moral tradeoff.  Also, compared to Phase III trials, it looks like challenge trials would’ve bought us at least a couple months and maybe a half-million lives.</li><li><strong>Doctors can’t think like utilitarians—e.g., risking hundreds of lives in challenge trials in order to save millions of lives with a vaccine—because it’s a slippery slope from there to cutting up one person in order to save ten with their organs.</strong>  Well, I think the <em>informed consent</em> of the challenge trial participants is a pretty important factor here!  As is their &gt;99% chance of survival.  Look, <em>anyone</em> who works in public health makes utilitarian tradeoffs; the question is whether they’re good or bad ones.  As someone who lost most of his extended family in the Holocaust, my rule of thumb is that, if you’re worrying every second about whether you might become Dr. Mengele, that’s a pretty good sign that you <em>won’t</em> become Dr. Mengele.</li><li><strong>If a hastily-approved vaccine turned out to be ineffective or dangerous, it could diminish the public’s trust in all future vaccines.</strong>  Yes, of course there’s such a tradeoff, but I want you to notice the immense irony: this argument effectively says we can condemn millions to die right now, out of concern for hypothetical <em>other</em> millions in the future.  And yet some of the people making this argument will then turn around and call <em>me</em> a callous utilitarian!</li><li><strong>I’m suffering from hindsight bias: it might be clear <em>now</em> that vaccine approval and distribution should’ve happened a lot faster, but experts had no way of knowing that in the spring.</strong>  <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4780">Here’s</a> my post from May 1, entitled “Vaccine challenge trials NOW!”  I was encouraged by the many others who said similar things still earlier.  Was it just a lucky gamble?  Had we been allowed to get vaccinated then, at least we could’ve put our bloodstreams where our mouths were, and profited from the gamble!  More seriously, I sympathize with the decision-makers who’d be on the hook had an early vaccine rollout proved disastrous.  But if we don’t learn a lesson from this, and ready ourselves for the <em>next</em> pandemic with an mRNA platform that can be customized, tested, and injected into people’s arms within at most 2-3 months, we’ll <em>really</em> have no excuse.</li></ol>

Peter Neumann, Professor of Mathematics at Queen’s College, Oxford University, passed away two weeks ago. Last Monday would have been his 80th birthday. </p>
<p>
Today we join others mourning in private and remembering in public, including the authors of these <a href="https://luit-pariya.blogspot.com/2020/12/eter-neumann-is-no-more.html">stories</a> and <a href="https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2020/12/24/memories-of-peter-neumann/">memories</a>, who are among Peter’s <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=28732">39</a> graduated doctoral students.<br/>
<span id="more-17937"/></p>
<p>
Peter died from Covid-19 while in a care home for long treatment of a stroke that had paralyzed his left side two years ago—something he <a href="https://www.queens.ox.ac.uk/academics/neumann">wrote</a> he could recover from “no earlier than late 2020.” From the number of people we know who have been touched closely by this kind of happening, my family included, we have a small statistical window on a great tragedy. The one resolution we can most make for the New Year is that it bring a resolution, so that the progression Covid 19-20-21 stops there.</p>
<p>
The two words that most define Peter for me are <em>genial</em> and <em>acute</em>. I knew him from the beginning of my time as a graduate student at Oxford under a Marshall Scholarship in 1981. Every “don” at Oxford is associated to one of the thirty-nine residential colleges or six private halls. I joined Merton College to associate with my advisor, Dominic Welsh, but also there was Peter Cameron, whose memories are linked above and who joined Merton’s faculty after earning his doctorate under Peter in 1971. Perhaps that contributed to why Peter—that is, Neumann—kept up spelling his name Πeter. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Kinderseminar </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Early in my first term, Peter invited me to join a special weekly seminar hosted by Πeter in his expansive room in Queen’s College. It was already called the <em>Kinderseminar</em>, for it was directed to the graduate students for experience reading current research papers and, importantly, presenting them. It always began at 11am and had flexible time after noon because college lunches at Oxford typically began at 12:20 or 12:30 for students and 1pm for fellows.</p>
<p>
It is hard to replicate the atmosphere anywhere I have seen in the US. There was at least one big comfy chair, in which I remember Peter’s student Sarah Rees almost disappearing, and other chairs brought in around a coffee table for tea and—much more often—coffee. And a roll of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McVitie's">McVitie’s</a> that was passed around. High windows let in enough light to work lamps-off except on the darkest days. Lugged to the head of the table when the time for chitchat was over was a portable chalkboard. Then began a masterclass in how to give a masterclass.</p>

We have already mentioned the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/09/27/a-dictionary-for-reading-proofs/">seminar</a> a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/">number</a> of <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/16/summer-reading-in-theory/">times</a> on this blog. Two of those mentions recall a lecture by Πeter himself on Évariste Galois, whose ulterior point was to warn the dangers of carelessly using phrases like “it is easy to see that…” in proofs. Well Galois, explained Πeter, was writing in haste the night before the duel that killed him, but most of us don’t have that excuse. Here is a preserved later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=xfJ4vwQ3vpo">lecture</a> by Πeter on Galois.</p>
<p>
The most recent of those posts featured Norman Biggs, who visited Oxford and took part in the seminar for some of my first year. My own first presentation in the seminar was on alternate proofs I’d found in my Princeton undergraduate thesis of theorems covered in a textbook by Biggs. He gave me the nice compliment of saying that if his text went to a second edition he could use my proofs. But Πeter—ah, Πeter took me aside afterward and pointed out my kinks in delivering them, including body positioning and organizing diagrams and algebra on the board. Encouragingly, of course.</p>
<p>
Also a regular was my fellow Mertonian and chess master Dugald Macpherson. Neither of us was the most illustrious chess player to enter that room, for grandmaster Colin McNab obtained his doctorate under Πeter shortly after I finished. I was more impressed by stories of playing first-class cricket in Jamaica by the visiting Ken Johnson. Thirty years later, when I emerged from my car in Princeton’s south campus parking lot and boarded a jitney going to the 2012 Alan Turing Centennial event covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/turings-tiger-birthday-party/">here</a>, there was Johnson—who is now a professor at Penn State. Other students I have particular memories of there are Muhammad Audu, Jacinta Covington, and Tim Penttila.</p>
<p>
One quirky memory was coming in on Tuesday, Oct. 25, 1983, to find everyone around a radio bringing bulletins of the US invasion of Grenada which had begun at local dawn. After some pointed anti-imperialist disapproval they did get into math, but my mind stayed on Grenada as I composed in my head a steel-drum melody and the first verse of a still-unfinished <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/Writing/GrenadaAfter.txt">song</a> about the event. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Another Memory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Because his OBE from Queen Elizabeth in 2008 says Peter not Πeter, I will revert to the former. This was cited for services to mathematics education. He not only won other prizes, he has a prize named after him: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Society_for_the_History_of_Mathematics#Neumann_Prize">Neumann Prize</a> by the British Society for the History of Mathematics. Peter served once as its president and also led the British Mathematical Association—whose logo spells its name with a lowercase <img alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\alpha}"/>.</p>

<p>
From various experiences I can aver that Peter took a <em>whole-person</em> approach to education. He followed the lives of his former students and I heard stories of social occasions in both Britain and France. He also wrote the Oxford Mathematical Institute’s <a href="https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/view_material/1160">guide</a> to TeX and LaTeX for students. </p>
<p>
In May, 1984, the Institute organized an outing to a Mathematics Day at the University of Warwick near Coventry, about 55 miles north of Oxford. Peter organized about a dozen for the trip—whether this was everyone coming from Oxford, and whether we had one shuttle or separate cars, I do not recall. </p>

What I do recall is that he did not simply take us to and from the workshop. He planned a picnic en-route at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollright_Stones">Rollright Stones</a>, which are along a road at the Oxon-Warks border. I had not previously seen a Celtic stone circle. He told stories of its history. I also believe that after the meeting we took a drive into Coventry with a brief stop to walk around the cathedral to see the damage from World War II, but it is possible I am conflating that with a time the Oxford chess team played a match in Coventry.</p>

<p/><p>
Peter carried the Neumann pedigree in group theory, for it was the specialty of both his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Neumann">mother</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Neumann">father</a>. He supervised another friend from Merton, Julia Tompson, in a thesis on the history of the Jordan-Hölder theorem. But I will discuss a contribution in which group theory is in the background—where I can put ideas from computational complexity in the foreground.</p>
<p>
Our May 2014 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/stoc-1500/">post</a> “STOC 1500” had a semi-serious intent of aligning famous classical problems of geometric (non-)constructibility with modern complexity theory. It has a fantasized keynote by the chess master and mathematician Luca Pacioli introducing the “<img alt="{\mathcal{NC=C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC%3DC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC=C}}"/>?” problem: using Euclid’s ruler and compass alone, can one trisect an angle, double a cube, or (going beyond <img alt="{\mathcal{NC}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC}}"/>) square a circle? Much as we’re at pains to say that “<img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>” does <em>not</em> stand for “non-polynomial,” the name “<img alt="{\mathcal{NC}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC}}"/>” does not stand for “non-constructible” but rather constructible by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neusis_construction">neusis</a>, meaning using fixed marks on a rotatable ruler. Of course, now we know that <img alt="{\mathcal{NC \neq C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC+%5Cneq+C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC \neq C}}"/>, a fact often attributed to Galois theory but, as Peter noted in his <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/~pleite/pub/artigos/neumann/reflections_on_reflection_on_spherical_mirror.pdf">paper</a>, provable from simpler considerations about field extensions.</p>
<p>
Both “Ancient Complexity” and computational complexity have a key distinction between <em>instances</em> and <em>problems</em>. Trisecting a <img alt="{90^\circ}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B90%5E%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{90^\circ}"/> angle is an easy instance. If <img alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\alpha}"/> is a <em>constructible angle</em>, then the angle <img alt="{\beta = 3\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta+%3D+3%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\beta = 3\alpha}"/> can be trisected—but the method is <em>ad hoc</em> to that instance, not a single algorithm that given only <img alt="{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\beta}"/> would efficiently discover how to trisect it. There are algorithms that work correctly on multiple angles but not on all of them.</p>
<p>
What is most different from computational complexity is that there are single instances that cannot be solved, such as <img alt="{\alpha = 60^\circ}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+60%5E%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\alpha = 60^\circ}"/>. It is not a case of a Euclid-based algorithm taking too long: no <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> algorithm can construct a <img alt="{20^\circ}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20%5E%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{20^\circ}"/> angle, period. This is akin to how a single string can be <em>incompressible</em> in Kolmogorov complexity, but without the latter’s dependence on a reference universal compression scheme.</p>
<p>
Another difference is problems, such as doubling the cube and squaring the circle, that essentially have only one instance. One can impose algebraic coordinates to represent different instances of them, but that is different from defining the coordinates from features of a given instance, as allowed when marking a ruler for <em>neusis</em>.  Peter’s paper speaks these problem/instance distinctions well.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Reflection Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen's_problem">problem</a> addressed in Peter’s paper was formulated by Ptolemy in the year 150. Given a circle <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/> and points <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a}"/> and <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b}"/>, both inside <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/> or both outside <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/>, construct a point <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{p}"/> on <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/> so that light starting from <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a}"/> will reflect at <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{p}"/> and go to <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b}"/>. When the points are inside, this is imagined as shooting a perfect billiard ball from <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a}"/> off a circular rim to hit <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b}"/>.</p>

<p/><p><br/>
There are two algorithms in <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> that correctly solve an infinite set of instances, namely points <img alt="{a',b'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%2Cb%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a',b'}"/> equidistant from the center <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{0}"/> of the circle. One constructs the midpoint <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{m}"/> of the line segment between <img alt="{a'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a'}"/> and <img alt="{b'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b'}"/>, projects the ray <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{R}"/> from <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{0}"/> to <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{m}"/>, and finds <img alt="{p'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{p'}"/> where the ray intersects <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/>. The other (shown in the above figure) first finds the intersections of the rays from <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{0}"/> to <img alt="{a',b'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%2Cb%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a',b'}"/> with <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C}"/>, bisects the line segment connecting them, and uses that to project outward to <img alt="{p'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{p'}"/>. The latter algorithm also works on points <img alt="{a'',b''}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%27%2Cb%27%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a'',b''}"/> that are collinear with the rays to <img alt="{a'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a'}"/> and <img alt="{b'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b'}"/>, respectively, while the former is correct for pairs taken from the lines through <img alt="{a'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{a'}"/> and <img alt="{b'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{b'}"/> that are parallel to <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{R}"/>.

<p>
Around the year 1020, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham presented a geometric algorithm that works in all cases, <a href="https://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Math/Aydin/Teach/128/AlHazenProblem.pdf">using</a> conic sections in ways equivalent to <em>neusis</em> and further <a href="http://nyjm.albany.edu/j/2000/6-8.pdf">characterized</a> this millennium by Roger Alperin of San José State. The problem was apparently not shown to be outside <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> until a 1965 <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27968003?refreqid=excelsior_b4edd5f21fda45f74dd56724556a7a87&amp;seq=1">paper</a> by Jack Elkin. </p>
<p>
After considering solvable cases like the above in his paper, Elkin ended by giving a single non-<img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/> case, analogous to <img alt="{60^\circ}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B60%5E%5Ccirc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{60^\circ}"/> for the trisection problem. His example did show the general algebraic ingredients. What Peter did in his 1998 <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/~pleite/pub/artigos/neumann/reflections_on_reflection_on_spherical_mirror.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Obituaries/Al-Haytham_Telegraph/">evidently</a> <a href="https://www-jstor-org.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/stable/3620392">unaware</a> of Elkin’s, was to characterize all the <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/>-solvable cases and show that they form a set of measure zero. Thus, he gave a rigorous sense in which <em>almost all</em> instances of the reflection problem are not <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/>-solvable. The algebra and lemmas about field extensions and irreducibility are especially pretty in Peter’s paper.</p>

Discovering Alperin’s equivalences while writing this post leads me to re-pose this question from the “STOC 1500” <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/stoc-1500/">post</a>: is there a single problem that is <img alt="{\mathcal{NC}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BNC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{NC}}"/>-complete under <img alt="{\mathcal{C}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathcal{C}}"/>-reductions?</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I hope everyone is enjoying a New Years’ as festive as the circumstances allow!</p>



<p>I’ve heard from a bunch of you awaiting my next post on the continuum hypothesis, and it’s a-comin’, but I confess the new, faster-spreading covid variant is giving me the same sinking feeling that Covid 1.0 gave me in late February, making it <em>really</em> hard to think about the eternal.  (For perspectives on Covid 2.0 from individuals who acquitted themselves well with their early warnings about Covid 1.0, see for example <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/12/26/seeing-the-new-covid-variant-smoke/">this by Jacob Falkovich</a>, or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CHtwDXy63BsLkQx4n/covid-12-24-we-re-f-ed-it-s-over">this by Zvi Mowshowitz</a>.)</p>



<p>So on that note: do you hold any opinions, on factual matters of practical importance, that most everyone around you sharply disagrees with?  Opinions that those who you respect consider ignorant, naïve, imprudent, and well outside your sphere of expertise?  Opinions that, nevertheless, you simply continue to hold, because you’ve learned that, <em>unless and until</em> someone shows you the light, you can no more will yourself to change what you think about the matter than change your blood type?</p>



<p>I try to have as few such opinions as possible.  Having run <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> for fifteen years, I’m acutely aware of the success rate of those autodidacts who think they’ve solved P versus NP or quantum gravity or whatever.  It’s basically zero out of hundreds—and why wouldn’t it be?</p>



<p>And yet there’s one issue where I feel myself in the unhappy epistemic situation of those amateurs, spamming the professors in all-caps.  So, OK, here it is:</p>



<p><strong>I think that, in a well-run civilization, the first covid vaccines would’ve been tested and approved by around March or April 2020, while mass-manufacturing simultaneously ramped up with <em>trillions</em> of dollars’ investment.  I think almost everyone on earth could have, and should have, already been vaccinated by now.  I think a faster, “WWII-style” approach would’ve saved millions of lives, prevented economic destruction, and carried negligible risks compared to its benefits.  I think this will be clear to future generations, who’ll write PhD theses exploring how it was possible that we invented multiple effective covid vaccines in mere days or weeks, but then simply <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">sat on those vaccines for a year</a>, ticking off boxes called “Phase I,” “Phase II,” etc. while civilization hung in the balance.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve said similar things, on this blog and elsewhere, since the beginning of the pandemic, but part of me kept expecting events to teach me why I was wrong.  Instead events—including the staggering cost of delay, the spectacular failures of institutional authorities to adapt to the scientific realities of covid, and the long-awaited finding that <em>all</em> the major vaccines safely work (some better than others), just like the experts predicted back in February—all this only made me more confident of my original, stupid and naïve position.</p>



<p>I’m saying all this—clearly enough that no one will misunderstand—but I’m also scared to say it.  I’m scared because it sounds too much like colossal <em>ingratitude</em>, like Monday-morning quarterbacking of one of the great heroic achievements of our era by someone who played no part in it.</p>



<p>Let’s be clear: the ~11 months that it took to get from sequencing the novel coronavirus, to approving and mass-manufacturing vaccines, is a world record, soundly beating the previous record of 4 years.  Nobel Prizes and billions of dollars are the <em>least</em> that those who made it happen deserve.  Eternal praise is especially due to those like <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mrna-coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-biontech?fbclid=IwAR0uTyPvEyhlia7tvlH3XFx8kVrCyx0A8IIy8ALVSrUJ8m7jV4b8E7mf-Ec">Katalin Karikó</a>, who risked their careers in the decades before covid to do the basic research on mRNA delivery that made the development of <em>these</em> mRNA vaccines so blindingly fast.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I could easily believe that there’s no one agent—neither Pfizer nor BioNTech nor Moderna, neither the CDC nor FDA nor other health or regulatory agencies, neither Bill Gates nor Moncef Slaoui—who could’ve unilaterally sped things up very much.  If one of them tried, they would’ve simply been ostracized by the other parts of the system, and they probably all understood that.  It might have taken a whole different civilization, with different attitudes about utility and risk.</p>



<p>And yet the fact remains that, historic though it was, a one-to-two-year turnaround time <em>wasn’t nearly good enough</em>.  Especially once we factor in the faster-spreading variant, by the time we’ve vaccinated everyone, we’ll already be a large fraction of the way to herd immunity and to the vaccine losing its purpose.  For all the advances in civilization, from believing in demonic spirits all the way to <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">understanding mRNA at a machine-code level of detail</a>, covid is running wild much like it would have back in the Middle Ages—partly, yes, because modern transportation helps it spread, but partly also because our political and regulatory and public-health tools have lagged so breathtakingly behind our knowledge of molecular biology.</p>



<p>What could’ve been done faster?  For starters, as I said back in March, we could’ve had <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/">human challenge trials</a> with willing volunteers, of whom there were tens of thousands.  We could’ve started mass-manufacturing months earlier, with funding commensurate with the problem’s scale (think trillions, not billions).  Today, we could give as many people as possible the first doses (which apparently already provide something like ~80% protection) before circling back to give the second doses (which boost the protection as high as ~95%).  We could <em>distribute the vaccines that are now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/30/covid-vaccine-delay/">sitting in warehouses, spoiling</a>, while people in the distribution chain take off for the holidays</em>—but that’s such low-hanging fruit that it feels unsporting even to mention it.</p>



<p>Let me now respond to three counterarguments that would surely come up in the comments if I didn’t address them.</p>



<ol><li><strong>The Argument from Actual Risk.</strong>  Every time this subject arises, someone patiently explains to me that, since a vaccine gets administered to billions of <em>healthy</em> people, the standards for its safety and efficacy need to be even higher than they are for ordinary medicines.  Of course that’s true, and it strikes me as an excellent reason not to inject people with a <em>completely</em> untested vaccine!  All I ask is that the people who are, or could be, harmed by a faulty vaccine, be weighed on the same moral scale as the people harmed by covid itself.  As an example, we know that the Phase III clinical trials were repeatedly halted for days or weeks because of a single participant developing strange symptoms—often a participant who’d received the placebo rather than the actual vaccine!  That person matters.  Any future vaccine recipient who might develop similar symptoms matters.  But <em>the 10,000 people who die of covid every single day we delay</em>, along with the hundreds of millions more impoverished, kept out of school, etc., matter equally.  If we threw them all onto the same utilitarian scale, would we be making the same tradeoffs that we are now?  I feel like the question answers itself.<br/></li><li><strong>The Argument from Perceived Risk.</strong>  Even <em>with</em> all the testing that’s been done, somewhere between 16% and 40% of Americans (depending on which poll you believe) say that they’ll refuse to get a covid vaccine, often because of anti-vaxx conspiracy theories.  How much higher would the percentage be had the vaccines been rushed out in a month or two?  And of course, if not enough people get vaccinated, then R<sub>0</sub> remains above 1 and the public-health campaign is a failure.  In this way of thinking, we need three phases of clinical trials the same way we need everyone to take off their shoes at airport security: it might not prevent a single terrorist, but the masses will be too scared to get on the planes if we don’t.  To me, this (if true) only underscores my broader point, that the year-long delay in getting vaccines out represents a failure of <em>our entire civilization</em>, rather than a failure of any one agent.  But also: people’s membership in the pro- or anti-vaxx camps is not static.  The percentage saying they’ll get a covid vaccine seems to have <em>already</em> gone up, as a formerly abstract question becomes a stark choice between wallowing in delusions and getting a deadly disease, or accepting reality and not getting it.  So while the Phase III trials were still underway—when the vaccines were already known to be safe, and experts thought it much more likely than not that they’d work—would it have been such a disaster to let Pfizer and Moderna sell the vaccines, for a hefty profit, <em>to those who wanted them</em>?  With the hope that, just like with the iPhone or any other successful consumer product, satisfied early adopters would inspire the more reticent to get in line too?<br/></li><li><strong>The Argument from Trump.</strong>  Now for the most awkward counterargument, which I’d like to address head-on rather than dodge.  If the vaccines had been approved faster in the US, it would’ve <em>looked</em> to many like Trump deserved credit for it, and he might well have been reelected.  And devastating though covid has been, Trump is plausibly worse!  Here’s my response: Trump has the mentality of a toddler, albeit with curiosity swapped out for cruelty and vindictiveness.  His and his cronies’ impulsivity, self-centeredness, and incompetence are likely responsible for at least ~200,000 of the 330,000 Americans now dead from covid.  But, yes, reversing his previous anti-vaxx stance, Trump <em>did</em> say that he wanted to see a covid vaccine in months, just like I’ve said.  Does it make me uncomfortable to have America’s worst president in my “camp”?  Only a little, because I have no problem admitting that sometimes toddlers are right and experts are wrong.  The solution, I’d say, is <em>not</em> to put toddlers in charge of the government!  As should be obvious by now—indeed, as should’ve been obvious back in 2016—that solution has some exceedingly severe downsides.  The solution, rather, is to work for a world where experts are unafraid to speak bluntly, so that it never <em>falls</em> to a mental toddler to say what the experts can’t say without jeopardizing their careers.</li></ol>



<p>Anyway, despite everything I’ve written, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410">considerations of Aumann’s Agreement Theorem</a> still lead me to believe there’s an excellent chance that I’m wrong, and the vaccines couldn’t realistically have been rolled out any faster.  The trouble is, I don’t understand <em>why</em>.  And I don’t understand why compressing this process, from a year or two to at most a month or two, shouldn’t be civilization’s most urgent priority ahead of the <em>next</em> pandemic.  So go ahead, explain it to me!  I’ll be eternally grateful to whoever makes me retract this post in shame.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Jan. 1, 2021):</span></strong> If you want a sense of the on-the-ground realities of administering the vaccine in the US, check out <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/12/31/covid-12-31-meet-the-new-year/">this long post by Zvi Mowshowitz</a>.  Briefly, it looks like in my post, I gave those in charge <em>way too much benefit of the doubt</em> <em>(!!)</em>.  The Trump administration pledged to administer 20 million vaccines by the end of 2020; instead it administered fewer than 3 million.  Crucially, this is not because of any problem with manufacturing or supply, but just because of pure bureaucratic blank-facedness.  Incredibly, even as the pandemic rages, most of the vaccines are sitting in storage, at severe risk of spoiling … and officials’ primary concern is not to administer the precious doses, but just to make sure no one gets a dose “out of turn.”  In contrast to Israel, where they’re now administering vaccines 24/7, including on Shabbat, with the goal being to get through the entire population as quickly as possible, in the US they’re moving at a snail’s pace and took off for the holidays.  In Wisconsin, a pharmacist intentionally spoiled hundreds of doses; in West Virginia, they mistakenly gave antibody treatments instead of vaccines.  There are no longer any terms to understand what’s happening other than those of black comedy.</p></div>

    <title>19th Century Precursors of Polynomial Methods</title>
    <summary>These days, I’m spending a lot of time revising my book about polynomial methods and incidences (an older draft is available here). This led me to the following conclusion: I am not sure what classifies a proof as a polynomial method. A Wikipedia page states “… the polynomial method is an algebraic approach to combinatorics problems that involves […]</summary>

    <title>TR20-193 |  Average-case rigidity lower bounds | 

	Xuangui Huang, 

	Emanuele Viola</title>
    <summary>It is shown that there exists $f : \{0,1\}^{n/2} \times \{0,1\}^{n/2} \to \{0,1\}$ in E$^\mathbf{NP}$ such that for every $2^{n/2} \times 2^{n/2}$ matrix $M$ of rank $\le \rho$ we have $\P_{x,y}[f(x,y)\ne M_{x,y}] \ge 1/2-2^{-\Omega(k)}$, where $k \leq \Theta(\sqrt{n})$ and $\log \rho \leq \delta n/k(\log n + k)$ for a sufficiently small $\delta &gt; 0$.  
This generalizes recent results which bound below the probability by $1/2-\Omega(1)$ or apply to constant-depth circuits.
The result is a step towards obtaining data-structure lower bounds for E$^\mathbf{NP}$: they would follow from a better trade-off between the probability bound and $\rho$.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Some memories from 2020.</p>



<p>When the year began I was in Hong Kong.</p>



<p>I got to see the tail end of the latest round of pro-democracy and pro-freedom protests, which had started several months earlier in response to a proposed new extradition law. The proposal ignited protests because many people saw the point of the law as allowing the PRC to bring trumped-up charges against pro-democracy Hong Kongers, and then request their extradition, thus avoiding the extrajudicial kidnappings that had been the primary way of bringing dissidents to the mainland. (In June 2020, the PRC sidestepped the issue by throwing away whatever was left of the handover agreements, and passing its own anti-sedition law and imposing it on Hong Kong, making it possible to jail dissenters directly in Hong Kong.)</p>



<p>On January 1, I went to one of the big demonstrations, in Victoria Park, and saw Joshua Wong, the pro-democracy leader who is currently serving a jail term on the basis of the June 2020 laws.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In the video below. the audio is not clear, but people are chanting “five demands, not one less” and “fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong”. The five demands were to drop the extradition law, institute universal suffrage in elections, and the other three demands related to investigating and punishing police abuses against protesters.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In those days, I was reading English-language Hong-Kong press to keep up to date on protests that could cause the subway to shut down, and I noticed some reporting on a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. Since the time of SARS, Hong Kongers have been quite paranoid about new respiratory diseases coming from the mainland, but the reports were that no human-to-human transmission had been confirmed. (Speaking of Hong Kong press, the publisher of the Apple Daily newspaper is now in jail on the basis of the June 2020 legislation, because of his pro-democracy position.)</p>



<p>The reason I remember this is that on January 2 I came down with a fever and a cough. On my flight back, several days later, I coughed for the whole flight, without a face mask. Those being more innocent times, nobody seemed to mind.</p>



<p>Between January 31 and February 3 I was in London for an event organized by Bocconi. The evening of January 31 happened to be the moment Brexit went into effect, after the negotiations had blown past several deadlines, and after being pushed back several times. As it happened, negotiations continued for the rest of the year, and were not resolved until a few days ago. Although Brexit was on everyone’s mind, there was concern about the novel Coronavirus that had been isolated in Wuhan, which had proved to transmit person-to-person, and that had led to a health emergency and a severe lockdown of the city of Wuhan.</p>

<p>(Photo taken in London, Feb 2, 2020)</p>



<p>Back in Milan, I was looking forward to a Spring semester in which I was not teaching, and to the plans to take several trips and to host a number of academic guests.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Italian government had established a protocol according to which Covid19 testing was restricted to people who had had contact with a person known to suffer from Covid19 or who had recently traveled to China. Since nobody in Italy was known to suffer from Covid19, there was a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem going on, even as the virus (as became clear in retrospect) was spreading widely in Northern Italy. </p>



<p>Eventually, a person with Covid19 symptoms reported to have had dinner with a friend who had been to China. That person was tested, and, while he was already in intensive care, he became the first confirmed case of local transmission, on February 21. It then became clear that the friend who had been to China had never been infected, and that there must have already been a number of local infections. This was in the middle of Milan Fashion Week, which had already been scaled down due to concern about international travel. It was going to be the last major public event to take place in Milan for a while.</p>



<p>The following week, the Italian government settled on its response strategy: take some measures, back down after concern for the economic consequences, then double down when the situation gets worse. On March 1 I traveled to Rome in a mostly empty train. While a measure of panic was starting to gather in Milan (where it had become impossible to buy face masks and there were some shortages of other supplies in supermarkets), Romans were still mostly in denial. Tourism, however, had died down completely, and the city center was empty as I had never seen it.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4466 size-full" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/img_9367-1.png?w=1024"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p class="has-large-font-size"/>
</div></div>



<p>(Piazza di Spagna and Via dei Condotti seen from Trinità dei Monti on March 1, 2020. I had never seen Piazza di Spagna empty of people ever before).</p>



<p>The following week (see above on government strategy), the initial measures that had closed bars and restaurants in Milan were relaxed, and bars could open but could only do table service. </p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4468 size-full" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/img_9383.png?w=768"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p class="has-large-font-size"/>
</div></div>



<p>(A bar in the Navigli district of Milan on March 7, 2020. The counter area was roped-off, and they only provided table service.)</p>



<p>On the night of March 7, as I was having my sit-down drink with a friend, I started receiving text messages saying that the prime minister was about to speak on TV and that there were rumors that the government would lock down Northern Italy. As people literally ran to the train station to catch the last train out of Milan, the press conference was delayed until late at night, and he did announce a lockdown of Northern Italy, which would be extended to the whole country a few days later.</p>



<p>After that, time is a blur. I read a very interesting article on this topic (but I cannot find it again now), whose point was that when nothing interesting happens, time seems to stretch, and the days feel long and empty. But because nothing interesting happens, we do not form new long-term memory, so later it feels like that time went by very quickly. This warped perception is part of the sense of dislocation that some of us felt during the lockdown. </p>



<p>I looked at my pictures from those months for a clue as to what happened, and it’s basically pictures of things that I cooked and of the unfortunate results of cutting my hair with a beard trimmer. The lockdown was extremely strict until May, banning even taking a walk outside alone. In May we could again walk outside, but the city felt eery and empty.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4471 size-full" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/img_9581.png?w=1024"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">

<p>(The Italian stock exchange in Piazza Affari, Milan, on May 10, 2020. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Cattelan">Maurizio Cattelan</a>‘s iconic sculpture is visible in the foreground.)</p>



<p>During the summer, Covid19 cases, and especially Covid19 deaths, dropped considerably, and most business were allowed to reopen. Movie theaters, concert halls, stadiums, conference centers, and other venues where large numbers of people congregate remained closed. Dance clubs, however, reopened, and schools reopened in September.</p>



<p>By mid-October, numbers were about half the thresholds that were considered alarming. There were more than a thousand Covid19 patients in intensive care, for example, and two thousand was considered the threshold at which there would be a shortage of ICU beds for other patients. Furthermore, the numbers were doubling roughly every ten days, and any new measures would take about two weeks to have any effect. I wasn’t teaching until the second week of November. I did the math and I moved to Rome. </p>



<p>By the end of October, Bocconi had moved almost all teaching online, and the government had instituted new measures, this time on a regional basis. Milan was in a “red” region, and got a lockdown almost as bad as the one in the Spring. Rome was in a “yellow” region and there was a bit more freedom: retail was open, and indoor dining was possible for lunch. </p>



<p>I went back to Milan just before Christmas, when there have been further restrictions to avoid the large gatherings that are common during the Christmas holidays. They might have actually overshot a bit with the restrictions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>(This is Piazza Duomo in Milan, in the early evening of December 26, 2020. The emptiness and the tinny Christmas music made it feel like the setting of a horror movie.)</p>



<p>The day after I shot the above video, the European vaccine campaign got started. In July 2020, I was supposed to travel to Taipei. While all the other international events I had planned to attend in 2020 were canceled, the even in Taipei was moved to July 2021. I am looking ahead at what surely be another difficult Winter and Spring, but I am holding out hope to be in Taiwan in July and in <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/si2021-3">Berkeley in November</a>.</p>



<p>Best wishes to all readers, and may 2021 be a much less interesting year than the current one.</p></div>

Registration is open and free. <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/singapore.pptx">Here are the slides</a>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Happy new year to all my readers.</span></h3>
<p>Today, I will briefly explain the main argument in my theory regarding quantum computers. In this post I will use the term HQCA (“Huge Quantum Computational Advantage”) instead of “quantum supremacy” that Google uses and “quantum advantage” that IBM and  Jiuzhang Boson Sampling group use. Before we move to the main topic of the post, here are two related updates.</p>
<h3>Boson Sampling update</h3>
<p>A group of researchers mainly from USTC in Hefei, China, claimed to achieve a fantastic quantum computational advantage using <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jiuzhang,</span></strong> a photonic device for “Boson Sampling”.  It seems plausible now that level-<em>k</em> approximation from my paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3093" rel="nofollow ugc">Gaussian Noise Sensitivity and BosonSampling</a> with Guy Kindler will “spoof” the claims, namely, will show an efficient way to give samples of similar fidelity on a digital computer. (There are other related approaches for spoofing the claim, mainly one by Jelmer Renema, and there are interesting connections between Jelmer’s approximations and ours. Sergio Boixo, John Martinis, and other researchers also raised concerns regarding the new HQCA claims.) While it will probably take several weeks or months to clarify it further, <strong>it is already clear, that in view of Kindler and mine 2014 results, the claims of achieving in 200 seconds samples that require millions of computing years on current supercomputers are unfounded.</strong></p>
<p>For more details  see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/06/photonic-huge-quantum-advantage/">my post</a> about the recent HQCA Boson Sampling experiment, and also Scott Aaronson’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5159">recent post</a>.</p>
<h3>Scott Aaronson’s apology</h3>
<p>Let me mention that Scott Aaronson’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5159">recent post</a> issued the following apology addressed to me, which I gladly welcome:</p>
<h3><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/scott-aaronson.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20715" height="360" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/scott-aaronson.jpg" width="640"/></a></h3>
<h2>The argument against quantum computers: a very short introduction</h2>
<p>Our starting point is the following <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5122">recent assertion</a> by Scott Aaronson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Many colleagues told me they thought experimental BosonSampling was a dead end, because of photon losses and the staggering difficulty of synchronizing 50-100 single-photon sources. They said that a convincing demonstration of quantum supremacy would have to await the arrival of quantum fault-tolerance—or at any rate, some hardware platform more robust than photonics. I always agreed that they might be right. — </em></span></p>

<p>My argument for why all attempts to reach HQCA as well as quantum error-correction via NISQ systems will fail  is based on two claims.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>A) “A convincing demonstration of HQCA would have to await the arrival of quantum fault-tolerance”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>

</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>B) The error rate required for quantum error correcting codes needed for quantum fault tolerance is even lower than that required for HQCA.</strong></span></p>
<p>If claims A) and B) are <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>both</strong></span> correct, then it is not possible to reach HQCA as well as good quality quantum error-correction via NISQ systems. In this case, all attempts to reach HQCA as well as quantum error-correction via NISQ systems will fail.</p>
<p>As Scott Aaronson himself asserted, many people in the quantum computing community agree (or used to agree) with claim A). And there is also wide agreement and experimental evidence for claim B). But fewer people see the logical consequence of claims A) and B) put together. </p>
<h2>A little more</h2>
<h3>The basis for Claim A</h3>
<p>We need to put claim A on theoretical grounds. And indeed it is based on a computational complexity assertion for the computational power of NISQ systems, PLUS a heuristic principle (“naturalness”)  on the relation between asymptotic statements and the behaviour of intermediate scale systems.   </p>
<p>My work with Guy Kindler shows that for constant level of noise, NISQ systems represent very low-level computational power that we call LDP. (We studied specifically BosonSampling but the argument extends.)</p>
<p>The naturalness principle is quite common when you relate theory to practice: E.g., when Scott Aaronson and  Sam Gunn <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12085">argue</a>  that “spoofing” the Google statistical test for 53 qubits is probably very hard for digital computers, they make a similar leap from asymptotic insights to hardness insights for intermediate-scale systems.</p>
<h3>

</h3>
<h3>Non-stationary and chaotic behaviour</h3>
<p>There are several facts that strengthen the argument for claim A. Let me mention one: We already mentioned that for constant level of noise, NISQ systems represent very low-level computational power. Our work also asserts that for a wide range of <strong><em>lower</em></strong> levels of noise the empirical distribution from sampling based on NISQ systems will be very noise-sensitive: we can expect non-stationary and even chaotic empirical outcomes. <span style="color: #0000ff;">This is a great thing to test empirically!</span></p>
<h3>But how is it that classical computation is possible?</h3>
<p>This is a beautiful piece of the puzzle. The very low computational complexity class describing the power of NISQ systems <em>does</em> support a very rudimentary form of classical error-correction. This is the reason that robust classical information is possible so I can write  this post for you to read. (See also this <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/10/16/if-quantum-computers-are-not-possible-why-are-classical-computers-possible/">cartoon post</a> from 2017.)</p>
<h3>Topological quantum computing (4 Nick)</h3>
<p>Topological quantum computing is a proposed alternative path to very stable quantum qubits and quantum computing. Accepting claims A) and B) does not directly imply that topological quantum computing will fail, but there are good reasons that the argument does extend.</p>
<h3>Was HQCA achieved already?</h3>
<p>There are two papers claiming it was! One describing the Sycamore Random Circuit Sampling experiment was published in <em>Nature</em> in 2019, and one describing the Jiuzhang Boson Sampling experiment was published in <em>Science</em> in 2020.  I  find both these claims unconvincing.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br/>An Open Problem</span></h2>
<p>One question that certainly comes to mind is whether the technological advances represented by <strong>Jiuzhang</strong> and earlier on by <strong>Sycamore</strong> and by other superconducting and ion trapped  NISQ systems, could have technological and scientific fruits even <em>without</em> achieving a computational advantage.</p>
<p>This  is especially interesting if my theory is correct, but it is also interesting if it is not.</p>

<h3>Boson Sampling as the<em> C. Elegans</em> of quantum computing</h3>
<p>Caenorhabditis elegans, or<em> C. elegans</em> for short, is a species of a free-living roundworm whose biological study shed much light on more complicated organisms. In my paper in Itamar Pitowsky’s memorial volume I regard BosonSampling as the <em>C. elegans</em> of quantum computing. Several technical and conceptual aspects of quantum computation are becoming much clearer for this model.</p>
<h2>A remark about the terminology</h2>
<p><span style="color: #008080;">John Preskill’s term “quantum supremacy” is problematic because the word “supremacy” (e.g. “the supremacy of the king”) often refers to superiority or dominance across the board, which is not the case for quantum computation. It is also unfortunate in terms of its connotations. I agree with Preskill that “advantage” is too weak e.g. when it is claimed that the new Boson Sampling experiment can achieve in 200 seconds what would take an ordinary supercomputer millions of years, this is not merely an “advantage.”  This is why I propose “huge quantum computational advantage” (HQCA). </span></p>

    <title>TR20-192 |  Constructing Large Families of Pairwise Far Permutations: Good Permutation Codes Based on the Shuffle-Exchange Network | 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Avi Wigderson</title>
    <summary>We consider the problem of efficiently constructing an as large as possible family of permutations such that each pair of permutations are far part (i.e., disagree on a constant fraction of their inputs).
Specifically, for every $n\in\N$, we present a collection of $N=N(n)=(n!)^{\Omega(1)}$ pairwise far apart permutations $\{\pi_i:[n]\to[n]\}_{i\in[N]}$ and a polynomial-time algorithm that on input $i\in[N]$ outputs an explicit description of $\pi_i$. 

From a coding theoretic perspective, we construct permutation codes of constant relative distance and constant rate along with efficient encoding (and decoding) algorithms. 
This construction is easily extended to produce codes on smaller alphabets in which every codeword is balanced; namely, each symbol appears the same number of times. 

Our construction combines routing on the Shuffle-Exchange network with any good binary error correcting code. 
Specifically, we uses codewords of a good binary code in order to determine the switching instructions in the Shuffle-Exchange network.</summary>

    <title>TR20-191 |  Negations Provide Strongly Exponential Savings | 

	Arkadev Chattopadhyay, 

	Rajit Datta, 

	Partha Mukhopadhyay</title>
    <summary>We show that there is a family of monotone multilinear polynomials over $n$ variables in VP, such that any monotone arithmetic circuit for it would be of size $2^{\Omega(n)}$. Before our result, strongly exponential lower bounds on the size of monotone circuits were known only for computing explicit polynomials in VNP. The family of polynomials we prescribe are the spanning tree polynomials, also considered by Jerrum and Snir (JACM,1982), but this time defined over constant-degree expander graphs.</summary>

    <title>TR20-190 |  Erasure-Resilient Sublinear-Time Graph Algorithms | 

	Ramesh Krishnan S. Pallavoor, 

	Amit Levi, 

	Sofya Raskhodnikova, 

	Nithin Varma</title>
    <summary>We investigate sublinear-time algorithms that take partially erased graphs represented by adjacency lists as input. Our algorithms make degree and neighbor queries to the input graph and work with a specified fraction of adversarial erasures in adjacency entries. We focus on two computational tasks: testing if a graph is connected or $\varepsilon$-far from connected and estimating the average degree. For testing connectedness, we discover a threshold phenomenon: when the fraction of erasures is less than $\varepsilon$, this property can be tested efficiently (in time independent of the size of the graph); when the fraction of erasures is at least $\varepsilon,$ then a number of queries linear in the size of the graph representation is required. Our erasure-resilient algorithm (for the special case with no erasures) is an improvement over the previously known algorithm for connectedness in the standard property testing model and has optimal dependence on the proximity parameter $\varepsilon$. For estimating the average degree, our results provide an "interpolation" between the query complexity for this computational task in the model with no erasures in two different settings: with only degree queries, investigated by Feige (SIAM J. Comput. `06), and with degree queries and neighbor queries, investigated by Goldreich and Ron (Random Struct. Algorithms `08) and Eden et al. (ICALP `17). We conclude with a discussion of our model and open questions raised by our work.</summary>

<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">My summary: understanding of the distribution of largest increasing subsequences for random permutations, and the combinatorics of largest increasing subsequences of general permutations is among the most fascinating stories in modern mathematics.

<h2>Heaviest increasing subsequences</h2>
<p>Setup: Let X be a bounded distribution with support on an interval [1,T]. Given a permutation <img alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\sigma}"/> of size N, an increasing subsequence is a set of indices <img alt="{i_1&lt;i_2&lt;\cdots&lt;i_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi_1%3Ci_2%3C%5Ccdots%3Ci_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{i_1&lt;i_2&lt;\cdots&lt;i_k}"/> such that <img alt="{\sigma (i_1)&lt;\sigma (i_2)&lt;\cdots&lt;\sigma (i_k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma+%28i_1%29%3C%5Csigma+%28i_2%29%3C%5Ccdots%3C%5Csigma+%28i_k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\sigma (i_1)&lt;\sigma (i_2)&lt;\cdots&lt;\sigma (i_k)}"/>. If in addition, we attach to each index <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{i}"/> a weight <img alt="{w(i)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%28i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{w(i)}"/>, the weight of the subsequence is the sum <img alt="{w(i_1)+w(i_2)+\cdots+w(i_k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%28i_1%29%2Bw%28i_2%29%2B%5Ccdots%2Bw%28i_k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{w(i_1)+w(i_2)+\cdots+w(i_k)}"/>.

The theorem of Vershik and Kerov on the longest increasing subsequence in a random permutation states that if X is the Dirac distribution which always takes the value <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1}"/>, then <img alt="{\tau (X)=2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau+%28X%29%3D2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau (X)=2}"/>.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The problems above are motivated by the study of the asymptotic behavior of certain finite particle (interval) systems which we call “`airplane boarding”‘. The system has a parameter <img alt="{k\geq 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5Cgeq+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k\geq 0}"/>. At any given moment, the system consists of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{N}"/> closed moving intervals <img alt="{I_1,\dots,I_N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_1%2C%5Cdots%2CI_N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{I_1,\dots,I_N}"/> all of length <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/> which we call “passengers” and which can only overlap at endpoints. The index of an interval/passenger is called its “queue location”. The ordering of the intervals according to “queue locations” never changes, i.e., passengers cannot pass each other while “boarding”. The interval <img alt="{[0,N]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B0%2CN%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{[0,N]}"/> is called the “airplane aisle”. Each interval <img alt="{I_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{I_j}"/> has a target “row” (in the airplane aisle) <img alt="{\sigma (j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma+%28j%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\sigma (j)}"/> where <img alt="{\sigma }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\sigma }"/> is a permutation on <img alt="{1,...,N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C...%2CN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{1,...,N}"/> (the system can be generalized to handle more than one “passenger” per “row”). To each “passenger” we also attach an “aisle clearing time” <img alt="{w_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{w_i}"/>. Initially, at time <img alt="{t=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{t=0}"/>, all the intervals are left of <img alt="{-k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{-k}"/> and in descending order of their index, for example, if <img alt="{ k=1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B+k%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{ k=1}"/>, we might have <img alt="{I_1=[-3,-2]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_1%3D%5B-3%2C-2%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{I_1=[-3,-2]}"/>, <img alt="{I_2=[-5.5,-4.5]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_2%3D%5B-5.5%2C-4.5%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{I_2=[-5.5,-4.5]}"/> etc., at any given time point, each interval/passenger, <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{i}"/>,moves at infinite speed towards its destination “row” and if it is not blocked by other intervals to its right it positions itself with the left endpoint at <img alt="{\sigma (i)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma+%28i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\sigma (i)}"/>, i.e., occupies <img alt="{[\sigma_i-k,\sigma_i]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B%5Csigma_i-k%2C%5Csigma_i%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{[\sigma_i-k,\sigma_i]}"/>. When a passenger does reach its target “row”, then it waits its aisle clearing time <img alt="{w_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{w_i}"/> before leaving the system and allowing the passengers behind to advance further towards their row. The “boarding time” is the time when all intervals have left the system and the process terminates. From the description, one can check that the boarding time when <img alt="{k=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k=0}"/> is simply the heaviest increasing subsequence for <img alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\sigma}"/> and weights <img alt="{ w_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B+w_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{ w_i}"/>, so its clear that the problems above are relevant to the analysis of “airplane boarding”. To motivate them more specifically, lets introduce one more element, a “boarding policy” which makes the boarding time into a random variable. The simplest policy, which we have already encountered, is Random boarding. In Random boarding we assume that the queue position, the row and the weights are all independent random variables. The first two are chosen uniformly, generating a uniformly random permutation and we think of the <img alt="{w_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{w_i}"/> as drawn i.i.d. from a distribution <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{X}"/>, which is the aisle clearing time distribution of all passengers as a single group. We observe that <img alt="{\tau (X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau+%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau (X)}"/> is a normalized asymptotic indicator of the boarding time of the Random policy. Suppose now that we have two (or more in general) subpopulations with different aisle clearing times, say, passengers with no hand luggage and the other passengers, or passengers who need assistant or are travelling with children and the other passengers as a second group. If we denote by Y and Z the aisle clearing time of the first and second subpopulations and by p, the portion of passengers from the first subpopulation, then the aisle clearing time of the whole population <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{X}"/> will be the mixture <img alt="{pY+(1-p)Z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BpY%2B%281-p%29Z%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{pY+(1-p)Z}"/>. We use <img alt="{\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau}"/> as a measure of the slowness or quickness of a group and will assume that the first group with aisle clearing time distribution <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Y}"/> is the group of ‘slow passengers”, i.e., <img alt="{\tau (Y)\geq \tau(Z)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau+%28Y%29%5Cgeq+%5Ctau%28Z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau (Y)\geq \tau(Z)}"/>. Given this scenario, we can naturally define two policies which are practiced by airlines. The first policy is the “Slow First” (SF) policy, where we use a uniformly random permutation <img alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\sigma}"/>, but for the weights, those of the first <img alt="{[pN]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5BpN%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{[pN]}"/> passengers are drawn i.i.d. from Y and the others are drawn i.i.d. from Z. The other policy is “Fast First” (FF) which as the name suggests, draws the weights of the first <img alt="{[(1-p)N]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B%281-p%29N%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{[(1-p)N]}"/> passengers i.i.d. from Z and the others from Y.</p>
<p>Now we come to the test your intuition portion of the post. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Spoiler alert, please test your intuition before continuing to read below the fold.</span></strong> Assuming “normal” coach class conditions in a full occupancy airplane, <img alt="{k=4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k=4}"/>, with a realistic portion of slow passengers, say p=0.2, and a realistic effective aisle clearing time ratio <img alt="{\tau (Y)/\tau (Z)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau+%28Y%29%2F%5Ctau+%28Z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau (Y)/\tau (Z)}"/> of <img alt="{C=3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%3D3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{C=3}"/>, rank the 3 policies, Random, Slow First and Fast First, from fastest to slowest in terms of average asymptotic boarding time (ascending boarding time order).</p>

<p>The ordering is: Slow First, then Fast First, then Random.

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> (SF is better than FF universally) For any parameters <img alt="{k,p,c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%2Cp%2Cc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k,p,c}"/>, SF has lower or equal average asymptotic boarding time compared to FF.</p>
<p>It turns out that we donít have a universal comparison between Random and FF. On realistic parameters, FF is faster, but for some small region of parameter space Random is actually faster than FF. We are left with the comparison of SF and Random and here comes problem 2 into play.

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Slow first is universally (for all mixtures and k) faster than Random if and only if <img alt="{\tau^2 (X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%5E2+%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau^2 (X)}"/> is concave on the space of bounded distributions.</p>
<p>The concavity of <img alt="{\tau^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau^2}"/> has been verified on all mixtures coming from empirical observations of aisle clearing times (say, first group is passengers with 0,2,3 luggage items and the other those with 1 or 4).</p>
<p>The third problem and to some extent, the first, have a somewhat different motivation. There is a very different situation where we break a distribution as a mixture and that is express line queues, where the population of customers is broken into fast customers that go to the express line and the others which go to a regular line (assume there is one). We can consider the average waiting time in queue as a function of the mixture. Such systems have a parameter that does not exist in airplane boarding, the utilization <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\rho}"/>. On the other hand, airplane boarding has <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k}"/> which does not have an express line counterpart. In addition, in airplane boarding there may be better policies for handling the slow and fast groups (say, slow passengers in back rows at the front of the queue and slow passengers from the front rows at the back of the queue, and more complicated ones).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It has been shown, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221718310695" rel="nofollow">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221718310695</a> , that after proper normalizations to offset these non-mutual parameters, for any mixture, the average response time of the express line queue is approximately the square of the boarding time of the optimal policy for handling the slow and fast groups of the mixture (a complicated policy, the result does not hold for slow first nor fast first). The quality of the approximation essentially depends on the ratio <img alt="{\tau^2 (X)/E(X^2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%5E2+%28X%29%2FE%28X%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\tau^2 (X)/E(X^2)}"/>. If it is universally bounded then so is the approximation ratio.</p>
<p>Having such a tight relation between express line queues and airplane boarding is useful, since we can use it to analyze airplane boarding via the simpler and better studied express line queues. In addition, express line queues have an exact and non trivial duality on mixtures which preserves average waiting time via a formula of Riemann which was used in his proof of the functional equation of the zeta function. The duality simplifies the analysis of express line queues on self-dual distributions, these include log-normal distributions, Bounded Pareto distributions (as a family) and distributions whose densities are given by squaring a weight 2 Hecke cusp form (as in the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture) restricted to the positive imaginary axis. The approximate relation allows us to get a non-trivial approximate duality in airplane boarding.</p>
<p>The post is becoming long, so I will leave you with one final insight which is at the heart of the analysis of airplane boarding. Airplane boarding is asymptotically, most naturally understood in terms of evolution in (proper) time of particle clouds in space-time. As a process (consider the passengers which sit down at approximately the same time) it is essentially a discrete version of what is known as a Congruence with respect to proper time of particles, starting with a Cauchy hypersurface. That’s the kind of stuff that Penrose studied (much more deeply) when he proved the singularity theorems that won him a share of the 2020 Noble prize in physics. Maximal length or heaviest increasing subsequences in uniformly random permutations correspond to the simplest case of geodesics in special relativity (straight lines). I will explain some other time, what all this has to do with college admissions.</p>

    <title>Lars Arge.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><i> Not a post I'd have wanted to make on Christmas day, but that's how it goes sometimes. </i></p><p>Lars Arge just passed away, on Dec 23. For those of us who've been following his battles with cancer, this might not come as a total shock, but there was always hope, and that's no longer an option. </p><p>It's hard to imagine this in 2020, but there was a time not that long ago (at least in my mind) when "big data" wasn't really a thing. Companies were acquiring lots of data, and "GIGA byte" was a thing, but there was no real appreciation of the computational challenge associated with big data. </p><p><a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00075827">A paper by Aggarwal and Vitter</a> in 1998 made the first step towards changing that, introducing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_memory_algorithm#:~:text=The%20model%20was%20introduced%20by,size%20and%20the%20cache%20size.&amp;text=Both%20the%20internal%20and%20external,into%20blocks%20of%20size%20B.">external memory model</a> as a way to think about computations when you have memory access that are cheap (in RAM) and expensive (on disk). </p><p>It's a diabolically simple model: all main memory access is free, and any disk access costs 1 unit (but you can get a block of data of size B for that one unit of access). It's not meant to be realistic, but like the best computational models, it's meant to isolate the key operations that are expensive so that we can study how algorithm design needs to change. </p><p>Lars was one of the foremost algorithm designers for this new world of external memory. His Ph.D thesis laid out ideas for how to build data structures that are external memory efficient, and his research over the next many decades, in true Tarjan/Hopcroft form, built the fundamental structures and concepts one would need to even think about efficient algorithm design, with many clever ideas around batching queries, processing data in main memory to prepare for queries, and streaming access to disk when appropriate. </p><p>Formal algorithmic models are often misunderstood. They look simplistic, miss many of the details that seem relevant in practice, and appear to encourage theoretical game playing divorced from reality. But a formal model at its best does its work invisibly. It shifts the way we think about a framework. It fosters the design of new paradigms for efficient algorithms, and it allows us to layer optimizations on that move a system from theory to practice without ever having to compromise the underlying design principles.</p><p>Lars was a force of nature in this area. I first remember meeting him in 1998 at AT&amp;T Labs when I was interning and he was visiting there. He had boundless energy for this space, and seemingly wanted to turn everything into an external memory algorithm, whether it was geometry, data structures, or even the most basic algorithms like sorting. His intuition was the best kind of algorithmic intuition: build up the core primitives, and the rest would follow. </p><p>And this is exactly what happened. The field exploded. For a while, "big data algorithms" WERE external memory algorithms. There was no other way to even talk about big data. And that spawned even more models. Streaming algorithms were inspired by external memory and the realization that a one pass stream was an effective way to work with large data. Cache-oblivious algorithms asked about what would happen if we took the same two-part hierarchy with main memory and disk and extended it to the cache. Semi-external memory models asked how we might modify the base model for graph computations. The MapReduce framework from the early 2000s generalized the external memory model to handle newer kinds of streaming/memory-limited architectures, in turn to be followed by Spark and so many other models. </p><p>I'd go as far as to say this: all of the conceptual developments we see today in big data computations at some level can be traced back to work on external memory algorithms, and that was driven by Lars (and his collaborators). </p><p>It wasn't just the papers he wrote. Lars was a leader in shaping the field. Early in the 2000s he moved back from Duke University to Aarhus University, and from there started to build what would become one of the foremost institutes for thinking about big data, first as a BRICS center and then as the appropriately named <a href="https://cs.au.dk/research/centers/madalgo/">MADALGO</a> Institute. </p><p>Many of us who had anything to do with big data visited MADALGO at some point in our careers. I spent one of the best summers of my life being hosted by him during my sabbatical - my children still remember that summer we spent in Aarhus and wish we could go back each year. He instinctively knew that the best way to foster the area was to facilitate a generation of researchers who would bring their own ideas to Aarhus, mix and exchange them,  and then go away and share them with the world. </p><p>And he wasn't merely content with that. He wanted to demonstrate the power of his perspective beyond just the realm of academia. He started a company <a href="https://scalgo.com/">SCALGO</a> that applied the principles of external memory algorithms (and so much more) to help with modeling geospatial data. I remember distinctly him telling me the first time he demonstrated SCALGO products in a forum with other companies doing GIS work and how the performance of their system blew the other products out of the water. For someone (at the time) deeply embedded in the theory of computer science, I was astounded and encouraged by this validation of formal thinking. </p><p>Lars was a giant in our field (his email address was always large@..., and this worked more appropriately than one would ever dream of). But he was also a giant both in real life and in his personality. He was the warmest, most fun person to be around. He seemed almost ego-free, and often downplayed his own accomplishments, claiming that his main talent was hanging around with smarter people. He was extremely generous with his time and resources (which is why so many of us were able to visit Aarhus and benefit from being at MADALGO)</p><p>He was the life of any party -- I still remember when he hosted the Symposium on Computational Geometry in Denmark. It felt like we were at a post-battle Viking celebration (and yes he got up on a table and shouted "SKÅL" over and over again while an actual pig was roasting on a spit nearby). I remember him taking me to a Denmark-Sweden soccer game and warning me not to wear anything with blue on it. I remember us going for go-kart racing and his stream of trash talking. </p><p>Lars was the entire package: a great person, a great researcher, a visionary leader, and a canny entrepreneur. I will miss him greatly. </p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheGeomblog/~4/ok1NCQJBVpM" width="1"/></div>
