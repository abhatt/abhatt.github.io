    <summary>Assuming that the Permanent polynomial requires algebraic circuits of exponential size, we show that the class VNP *does not* have efficiently computable equations. In other words, any nonzero polynomial that vanishes on the coefficient vectors of all polynomials in the class VNP requires algebraic circuits of super-polynomial size.

In a recent work of Chatterjee and the authors (FOCS 2020), it was shown that the subclasses of VP and VNP consisting of polynomials with bounded integer coefficients *do*  have equations with small algebraic circuits. Their work left open the possibility that these results could perhaps be extended to all of VP or VNP. The results in this paper show that assuming the hardness of Permanent, at least for VNP, allowing polynomials with large coefficients does indeed incur a significant blow up in the circuit complexity of equations.</summary>

    <title>TR20-186 |  Shrinkage of Decision Lists and DNF Formulas | 

	Benjamin Rossman</title>
    <summary>We establish nearly tight bounds on the expected shrinkage of decision lists and DNF formulas under the $p$-random restriction $\mathbf R_p$ for all values of $p \in [0,1]$. For a function $f$ with domain $\{0,1\}^n$, let $\mathrm{DL}(f)$ denote the minimum size of a decision list that computes $f$. We show that
\[
  \mathbb E[\ \mathrm{DL}(f|\mathbf R_p)\ ] \le 
  \mathrm{DL}(f)^{\log_{2/(1-p)}(\frac{1+p}{1-p})}.
\]
For example, this bound is $\sqrt{\mathrm{DL}(f)}$ when $p = \sqrt{5}-2 \approx 0.24$. For Boolean functions $f$, we obtain the same shrinkage bound with respect to DNF formula size plus $1$ (i.e.,\ replacing $\mathrm{DL}(\cdot)$ with $\mathrm{DNF}(\cdot)+1$ on both sides of the inequality).</summary>

    <title>TR20-185 |  Quantum learning algorithms imply circuit lower bounds | 

	Tom Gur, 

	Alex Grilo, 

	Igor Oliveira, 

	Srinivasan Arunachalam, 

	Aarthi Sundaram</title>
    <summary>We establish the first general connection between the design of quantum algorithms and  circuit lower bounds. Specifically, let $\mathrm{C}$ be a class of polynomial-size concepts, and suppose that $\mathrm{C}$ can be PAC-learned with membership queries under the uniform distribution with error $1/2 - \gamma$ by a time $T$ quantum algorithm. We prove that if $\gamma^2 \cdot T \ll 2^n/n$, then $\mathrm{BQE} \not\subseteq \mathrm{C}$, where $\mathrm{BQE} = \mathrm{BQTIME}[2^{O(n)}]$ is an exponential-time analogue of $\mathrm{BQP}$. This result is optimal in both $\gamma$ and $T$, since it is not hard to learn any class $\mathcal{C}$ of functions in (classical) time $T = 2^n$  (with no error), or in quantum time $T = \mathrm{poly}(n)$ with error at most $1/2 - \Omega(2^{-n/2})$ via Fourier sampling. In other words, even a marginal improvement on these generic learning algorithms would lead to major consequences in complexity theory. 

Our proof builds on several works in learning theory, pseudorandomness, and computational complexity, and crucially, on a connection between non-trivial classical learning algorithms and circuit lower bounds established by Oliveira and Santhanam (CCC 2017). Extending their approach to quantum learning algorithms turns out to create significant challenges. To achieve that, we show among other results how pseudorandom generators imply learning-to-lower-bound connections in a generic fashion, construct the first conditional pseudorandom generator secure against uniform quantum computations, and extend the local list-decoding algorithm of Impagliazzo, Jaiswal, Kabanets and Wigderson (SICOMP 2010) to quantum circuits via a delicate analysis. We believe that these contributions are of independent interest and might find other applications.</summary>

$D$ of $G$ is a subset of $V$, such that, for every vertex $v \in V$, there
exists a node $u \in D$ whose hop-distance from $v$ is at most $k$. A $k$-hop
dominating set of minimum cardinality is called a minimum $k$-hop dominating
set. In this paper, we present linear-time algorithms that find a minimum
$k$-hop dominating set in unicyclic and cactus graphs. To achieve this, we show
that the $k$-dominating set problem on unicycle graph reduces to the piercing
circular arcs problem, and show a linear-time algorithm for piercing sorted
circular arcs, which improves the best known $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm.

    <title>A novel algorithm for clearing financial obligations between companies -- an application within the Romanian Ministry of Economy</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1607817600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Lucian-Ionut Gavrila, Alexandru Popa <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05564">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The concept of clearing or netting, as defined in the glossaries of European
Central Bank, has a great impact on the economy of a country influencing the
exchanges and the interactions between companies. On short, netting refers to
an alternative to the usual way in which the companies make the payments to
each other: it is an agreement in which each party sets off amounts it owes
against amounts owed to it. Based on the amounts two or more parties owe
between them, the payment is substituted by a direct settlement. In this paper
we introduce a set of graph algorithms which provide optimal netting solutions
for the scale of a country economy. The set of algorithms computes results in
an efficient time and is tested on invoice data provided by the Romanian
Ministry of Economy. Our results show that classical graph algorithms are still
capable of solving very important modern problems.

    <title>Quasi-polynomial Time Approximation of Output Probabilities of Constant-depth, Geometrically-local Quantum Circuits</title>

constant-depth quantum circuit $C$, and any bit string $x \in \{0,1\}^n$, can
compute the quantity $|&lt;x|C |0^{\otimes n}&gt;|^2$ to within any
inverse-polynomial additive error in quasi-polynomial time. It is known that it
is $\#P$-hard to compute this same quantity to within $2^{-n^2}$ additive error
[Mov20]. The previous best known algorithm for this problem used
$O(2^{n^{1/3}}\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ time to compute probabilities to within
additive error $\epsilon$ [BGM20]. Notably, the [BGM20] paper included an
elegant polynomial time algorithm for the same estimation task with 2D
circuits, which makes a novel use of 1D Matrix Product States carefully
tailored to the 2D geometry of the circuit in question. Surprisingly, it is not
clear that it is possible to extend this use of MPS to address the case of 3D
circuits in polynomial time. This raises a natural question as to whether the
computational complexity of the 3D problem might be drastically higher than
that of the 2D problem. In this work we address this question by exhibiting a
quasi-polynomial time algorithm for the 3D case. In order to surpass the
technical barriers encountered by previously known techniques we are forced to
pursue a novel approach:
</p>
<p>Our algorithm has a Divide-and-Conquer structure, constructing a recursive
sub-division of the given 3D circuit using carefully designed block-encodings,
each creating a 3D-local circuit on at most half the number of qubits as the
original. This division step is then applied recursively, expressing the
original quantity as a weighted sum of smaller and smaller 3D-local quantum
circuits. A central technical challenge is to control correlations arising from
the entanglement that may exist between the different circuit "pieces" produced
this way.

becoming pervasive and efficient in the industry. In this work, we present a
highly scalable and configurable distributed algorithm for building connected

over joint probability distributions with fixed marginals. A key issue in many
applications is the complexity of solving MOT: the linear program has
exponential size in the number of marginals k and their support sizes n. A
recent line of work has shown that MOT is poly(n,k)-time solvable for certain
families of costs that have poly(n,k)-size implicit representations. However,
it is unclear what further families of costs this line of algorithmic research
can encompass. In order to understand these fundamental limitations, this paper
initiates the study of intractability results for MOT.
</p>
<p>Our main technical contribution is developing a toolkit for proving
NP-hardness and inapproximability results for MOT problems. We demonstrate this
toolkit by using it to establish the intractability of a number of MOT problems
studied in the literature that have resisted previous algorithmic efforts. For
instance, we provide evidence that repulsive costs make MOT intractable by
showing that several such problems of interest are NP-hard to solve--even
approximately.

    <title>Data-driven Competitive Algorithms for Online Knapsack and Set Cover</title>

worst-case guarantees, e.g., bounds on the competitive ratio. However, it is
well-known that such algorithms are often overly pessimistic, performing
sub-optimally on non-worst-case inputs. In this paper, we develop an approach
for data-driven design of online algorithms that maintain near-optimal
worst-case guarantees while also performing learning in order to perform well
for typical inputs. Our approach is to identify policy classes that admit
global worst-case guarantees, and then perform learning using historical data
within the policy classes. We demonstrate the approach in the context of two
classical problems, online knapsack and online set cover, proving competitive
bounds for rich policy classes in each case. Additionally, we illustrate the
practical implications via a case study on electric vehicle charging.

    <title>Quarterly Th. Wksp `at' Northwestern, and thoughts inspired by it</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> On the <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/events/">Northwestern CS Theory Group</a> there is a set of Quarterly Theory Workshops. There is one coming up on Dec 17-18, 2020, called the <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/events/2020-junior-theorists-workshop/">Junior Theorists Workshop</a>. Take a look and possibly go to it! Because it is virtual you do not need to plan that much ahead- though they do want you to register. </p><p>1) I notice broadly two kinds of meetings:</p><p><br/>Based on WHO will be there, e.g., JUNIOR theorists</p><p><br/>Based on TOPIC: e.g., there was a meeting on ALGORITHMIC FAIRNESS.</p><p><br/></p><p>2) These types of meetings (NY Theory day is another) are, I believe, intended to be for people that are local (more on that later). But because the meeting will be on zoom, geography is no longer an impediment for either the attendees or the speakers. </p><p><br/></p><p>3) Before covid there was some talk of  `Gee, flying off to STOC, FOCS, other conferences is bad for the environment, what to do about that?'. With that in mind, here is a history which might not be true but makes a point:</p><p><i>In an earlier era FOCS/STOC were attended by mostly Americans and ICALP was attended by mostly Europeans.  I do not think there was any policy of discrimination on admissions, but it was more like Americans just did not submit to ICALP as much, nor Europeans  to FOCS/STOC. But over time when these conferences got to be considered prestigious people would routinely submit to either one depending on timing. If your paper was done in time for Conf X deadline, that's where you submit. If it does not get in then  you edit it some, perhaps add some new results, and submit to Conf Y. </i></p><p>So one solution to the air-travel-global-Warming   problem of conferences is go back to a time (which may not have ever existed) where it was just understood that you go to LOCAL conferences. Math does this, but it helps that their regional conferences are not  prestigious. But even they don't quite get it right: the joint AMS-MAA meeting alternates coasts. One year when it was in California they invited me to be a guest speaker (on the Muffin Problem). The following year it was in Baltimore. Note that I live in Maryland, so perhaps they should have waited a year. </p><p>How to encourage people to submit locally. I DO NOT want to have a rule or a diff standard for those who don't. As such... I have no idea. </p><p><br/></p><p>4)  Are virtual conferences a good idea? This is a hot topic now so I won't dwell on it, just to say that there is still something about being there IN PERSON, meeting people, serendipity that makes live confs better.</p><p>However, to have it at the same time be virtual and recorded will be VERY HELPFL to those who can't afford to go for whatever reason. </p><p>And of course there is the whole issue of if we should have prestigious conferences, which I won't get into now. Or later. That's more Lance's issue (he thinks no). </p><p><br/></p></div>

<p>He is a longtime faculty member in computer science at the University of Buffalo, a longtime fan of the Buffalo NFL football team, and a longtime international master of chess. He is also one of the world experts on detecting cheating at chess. Players cheat by making their moves based on computer programs instead of relying on their brains. The key issue is: computer programs play chess better than any human. </p>
<p>
Today I thought we might send Ken a tip-of-the-hat for being in the Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>
That is he is featured in a WSJ article called <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-real-queens-gambit-catching-chess-cheaters-11607439491">Queen’s Gambit</a> about chess cheating. </p>

<p>
This is not his first mention in the WSJ—see <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-tech-chess-cheaters-charge-ahead-1444404660">here</a>. See <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2020/12/010.html">this</a> for additional comments by Cory Nealon, who says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The game of chess is no stranger to cheating. But since the pandemic hit and tournaments have moved online, the services of chess detectives have never been more in demand. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ken is perhaps the world’s most feared chess detective. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Beyond Chess </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Chess is important, but it is a game. Yet chess cheating may be an early warning of things to come. Might robotic methods in other areas soon start to dominate humans? Might chess be one of first areas to be lost to robots?</p>
<p>
A 1970 movie that comes to mind is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus:_The_Forbin_Project">The Forbin Project</a>. The plot is what happens when a computer system, Colossus, takes over the world. Its creator is Dr. Forbin, has the following exchange with it at the end of the movie: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Colossus later tells Forbin that the world, now freed from war, will create a new human millennium that will raise mankind to new heights, but only under its absolute rule. Colossus informs Forbin that “freedom is an illusion” and that “in time you will come to regard me not only with respect and awe, but with love”. Forbin responds, “Never!” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I think there is a reason to worry about computers like Colossus wiping us out. Perhaps not taking absolute control, but nevertheless making us second class citizens. I wonder if the following areas could be potential ones where we lose out to computers:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Protein folding?</i> They already are doing quite <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/12/02/too-long-didnt-read/">well</a>.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Play calling in the NFL?</i> I made this one up, but I do wonder if using all the statistics available programs could do a better job than players and coaches. They probably could already do better than the Jets defensive coach, who was recently <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/report-jets-fire-defensive-coordinator-gregg-williams-after-legendarily-awful-loss-to-raiders-161424493.html">fired</a>. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Solving Open Math Problems?</i> We recently talked about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/surely-you-are-joking/#comment-114892">Lean</a> the proof checking system. But what if Lean could start to conjecture, to suggest directions, and give a proof outline? This would be, I believe, much more disruptive than the ability to check proofs.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are some areas that you think could be next? That could be taken over by robots?<br/>
Moreover, as more areas are dominated by robots, we will need more Ken’s to stop cheaters. </p>
<p>
Thanks again Ken. </p>

The reason is that the independence number of <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/> is always 1 except in one case occurring with probability <img alt="2^{-1/\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B-1%2F%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="2^{-1/\tau}"/> where <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="W"/> is empty.</p>

<h2>Problem 2: Lionel Levine’s infamous hat problem.</h2>
<h3>Warm up problem:</h3>
<p><img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> people are assigned at random white/black hats, Each person sees the hats of the other and need to guess the color of her own hat. They can decide in advance on the guessing strategy and their aim is maximize the probability that they all guessed correctly. How well they can do?</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a strategy with 50% chance of winning. They all need to assume that there are overall an even number of black hats.</p>
<h3>The real infamous hat problem by Lionel Levine</h3>
<p>Now every player has an infinite tower of hats on her head and, again, the hats are taken to be white or black at random. Again each players see all the hats of other players and again the players can plan in advance a strategy for success, This time each player has to point to one of the hats on her head and  the players WIN if all these hats are black.</p>
<p>Again, based on the hats of all others the k-th player says something like “I think the 7th hat on my head is black” or “I think the 3rd hat on my head is black” and the players win if all these statement are correct.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> As the number of players grows the probability for success tends to zero.</p>
<p>Let <img alt="p_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="p_k"/> be the success probability for <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/> players. (Remark: instead of having infinite number of hats we can assume that <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/> is fixed, each player has <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> hats, and then let <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> goes to infinity.</p>
<p>Ehud explained why <img alt="1/3 \le p_2 \le 3/8" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F3+%5Cle+p_2+%5Cle+3%2F8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="1/3 \le p_2 \le 3/8"/>. He challenged the audience to prove that <img alt="p_3 &lt; p_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_3+%3C+p_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="p_3 &lt; p_2"/> which is unknown.</p>
<p>The problem was presented in <a href="https://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/2011/04/how-many-hats-can-fit-on-your-head/">this 2011 post</a>  on <a href="https://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/" title="Tanya Khovanova's Math Blog: Mathematics, applications of mathematics to life in general, and my life as a mathematician.">Tanya Khovanova’s Math Blog.</a> Tanya also offered a new variant of her own.  It was also <a href="https://www.brand.site.co.il/riddles/201607q.html">July 2016 riddle</a> further discussed <a href="https://www.brand.site.co.il/riddles/201607a.html">here</a> on the math riddles site “<a href="https://www.brand.site.co.il/riddles/">Using your head is permitted</a>”</p>

<p>Bocconi University is looking for two Tenure-Track Assistant Professors in Computer Science, for positions starting in Fall 2021. This is in the context of a build-up toward a new department focused on Computer Science, which is part of the University’s strategic plan, and which is expected to be launched by Fall 2022.</p>



<p>Bocconi is Italy’s premiere private University, located in Milan. It is well known for its excellence in Economics and Management, and a few years ago it has begun a push into the hard sciences and engineering. Currently it offers a <em>Bachelor on Economics, Management and Computer Science</em>, a <em>Bachelor on Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence</em>, and a <em>Master’s in Data Science and Analytics</em>. There is a PhD program in Statistics and Computer Science. Additional programs related to computing are being planned.</p>



<p>The University negotiates salaries on an individual basis, and is able to put together very competitive offer packages. Scholars moving to Milan from outside Italy gain, in addition, a 6+ year tax break (90% of the salary is exempt from income tax). The University provides relocation benefits and employs full time staff to assist non-Italian-speaking faculty. Students are admitted on the basis of a competitive admission exam. A large fraction of them are foreigners, and the general academic level is fairly high.</p>



<p>A special note for Italians on how the position relates to positions in public Universities (in Italian because this is only a local concern): la posizione di “assistant professor” è simile a quella di RTDA, ma è un contratto di diritto privato. Dopo una valutazione intermedia, si passa ad una posizione simile a RTDB, ma sempre con un contratto distinto di diritto privato, e dopo una tenure review si viene promossi ad associati. I ruoli di associati ed ordinari sono inquadrati nel sistema nazionale e parificati (a parte la possibilità di una integrazione salariale) ai corrispettivi ruoli nell’università pubblica. Anche se non sono io la persona più qualificata per discutere questi aspetti, rispondo volentieri a qualunque domanda.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-184 |  Proof complexity of natural formulas via communication arguments | 

	Dmitry Itsykson, 

	Artur Riazanov</title>
    <summary>A canonical communication problem ${\rm Search}(\phi)$ is defined for every unsatisfiable CNF $\phi$: an assignment to the variables of $\phi$ is distributed among the communicating parties, they are to find a clause of $\phi$ falsified by this assignment. Lower bounds on the randomized $k$-party communication complexity of ${\rm Search}(\phi)$ in the number-on-forehead (NOF) model imply tree-size lower bounds, rank lower bounds, and size-space tradeoffs for the formula $\phi$ in the semantic proof system ${\rm T}^{cc}(k,c)$ that operates with proof lines that can be computed by $k$-party randomized communication protocol using at most $c$ bits of communication [Göös, Pitassi, 2014]. All known lower bounds on ${\rm Search}(\phi)$ (e.g. [Beame, Pitassi, Segerlind, 2007; Göös, Pitassi, 2014; Impagliazzo, Pitassi, Urquhart, 1994]) are realized on ad-hoc formulas $\phi$ (i.e. they were introduced specifically for these lower bounds). We introduce a new communication complexity approach that allows establishing proof complexity lower bounds for natural formulas.
  
  First, we demonstrate our approach for two-party communication and apply it to the proof system ${\rm Res}(\oplus)$ that operates with disjunctions of linear equalities over $\mathbb{F}_2$ [Itsykson, Sokolov, 2014]. Let a formula ${\rm PMP}_G$ encode that a graph $G$ has a perfect matching. 
    If $G$ has an odd number of vertices, then ${\rm PMP}_{G}$ has a tree-like ${\rm Res}(\oplus)$-refutation of a polynomial-size [Itsykson, Sokolov, 2014]. It was unknown whether this is the case for graphs with an even number of vertices. Using our approach we resolve this question and show a lower bound $2^{\Omega(n)}$ on size of tree-like ${\rm Res}(\oplus)$-refutations of ${\rm PMP}_{K_{n+2,n}}$.
  
  Then we apply our approach for $k$-party communication complexity in the NOF model and obtain a $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{k} 2^{n/2k - 3k/2}\right)$ lower bound on the randomized $k$-party communication complexity of ${\rm Search}({\rm BPHP}^{M}_{2^n})$ w.r.t. to some natural partition of the variables, where ${\rm BPHP}^{M}_{2^n}$ is the bit pigeonhole principle and $M=2^n+2^{n(1-1/k)}$. 
  In particular, our result implies that the bit pigeonhole requires exponential tree-like ${\rm Th}(k)$ proofs, where ${\rm Th}(k)$ is the semantic proof system operating with polynomial inequalities of degree at most $k$ and $k= O(\log^{1-\epsilon} n)$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$.
 We also show that ${\rm BPHP}^{2^n+1}_{2^n}$ superpolynomially separates tree-like ${\rm Th}(\log^{1-\epsilon} m)$ from tree-like ${\rm Th}(\log m)$, where $m$ is the number of variables in the refuted formula.</summary>

Kevin Buzzard is Professor of Pure Mathematics at Imperial College London. Wikipedia says that he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Buzzard">specialises</a> in algebraic number theory, rather than “specializes.” Is this because he was born in Britain, works in Britain, both, or could it be neither?</p>
<p>
This month, he has an <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202011/rnoti-p1791.pdf">article</a> in the <em>AMS Notices</em> that highlights the system <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/about/"><img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/></a>. We thought we’d discuss <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> and its potential to change math—or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbZCECvoaTA">maths</a>—as we know it.</p>
<p>
For starters we should say that <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Lean is an open source theorem prover and programming language being developed at Microsoft Research. Lean aims to bridge the gap between interactive and automated theorem proving, by situating automated tools and methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This wording should perk up the ear of us complexity theorists. We know that polynomial-size interactive proofs have the power of <img alt="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPSPACE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}"/> for one prover, <img alt="{\mathsf{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NEXP}}"/> for two, and the Halting Problem for two quantum provers, all of which are believed bigger than <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> as for non-interactive proofs. We believe that our concrete capabilities are shaped by this abstract lay-of-the-land, though this is a meta-scientific assertion that we could never try to prove. What Buzzard’s article and <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> are on about is the scientific state of what we do try to prove, or think we have proved.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Aftermath as We Know It </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Buzzard spoke early this year at the second annual “Lean Together” segment of the Formal Methods in Mathematics <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/index.html">conference</a> at CMU. </p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/slides/fomm_buzzard.pdf">talk</a> was not so much about details of  <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> but about the fact of errors and specter of gaps in published mathematics. While a student of Richard Taylor, he had a front-row seat to a major instance. As he relates on a slide marked <b>Gaps</b> in big letters: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> </em></p><em>
<ul>
<li>
In 1993, Andrew Wiles announced a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. There was a gap in the proof. <p/>
</li><li>
In 1994, Wiles and Taylor fixed the gap, the papers were published, and our community accepted the proof. <p/>
</li><li>
In 1995, I pointed out to Taylor that the proof used work of Gross which was known to be incomplete.<br/>
<img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\dots}"/><br/>
Taylor told me it was OK, because he knew another argument which avoided Gross’s work completely.
</li></ul>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
He also highlights the current unfinished state of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups">classification</a> theorem. The process of writing its proof may outlive all of the first generation of provers. We at GLL have accepted it almost all of our working lives. The “after math” can be harder than the initial publication even in the traditional process, let alone the totally free dissemination we have today.</p>
<p>
Buzzard points out that some long proofs have now been written in <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> or related systems. These include the famous Feit-Thompson odd order theorem in <a href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a>, and the 2017 Ellenberg-Gijswijt proof of the cap set conjecture. This shows that complex arguments can be written in systems like <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> and others. He maintains his own <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/what-is-the-xena-project/">blog</a>, “The Xena Project,” on practical and educational uses of <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> and similar software.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Really Proved? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
But there is a problem with <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> and all the other similar systems. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Their correct proofs may be incorrect. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> is a large software system and may have bugs. This is of course a major concern, but perhaps one that can be handled. Perhaps not.</p>
<p>
I thought about this issue years ago when people argued for verification of operating systems to prove that they had no errors. They wanted to argue that software systems could be error-free only by making a formal proof that they were correct. Over forty years ago, Rich DeMillo and Alan Perlis and I wrote a <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">paper</a> on this issue. Our paper starts with </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Many people have argued that computer programming should strive to become more like mathematics. Maybe so, but not in the way they seem to think. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We go on to argue against formal verification as the answer to correctness. It is interesting to see that now the argument is flipped: Should mathematics become more like programming?</p>
<p>
Ken opines out that a bug in <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> would probably be more catchable because it would likely replicate. Mistakes in proofs ought by nature to be more recognizable than telling whether a <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/tactics.html">tactic</a> to try to build a proof is likely to succeed.</p>

<p/><p>
The fundamental idea of <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> is to create a language that does make proofs more like programming. The key is that a proof written in <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> can be checked automatically. This is like saying that a program in Python can be executed. </p>
<p>
The project that Buzzard and others are interested in is several-fold. One is that <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> can be a teaching tool. Another is it can help us ensure that the proofs we write down are correct. </p>
<p>
The use of <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> is akin to LaTeX. Most of us now write our proofs in LaTeX or some similar typesetting language. We love and hate the issues involved in getting the LaTeX to compile and to look good. Buzzard argues that adding the new ability to be sure that one’s proof is solid is a great leap. LaTeX lets us be sure the proof looks good, while <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> allows us to be sure it is correct. </p>
<p>We have generally taken a reserved attitude toward formal methods on this blog—or maybe <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/surely-you-are-joking/">not</a> so reserved. We keep our reservations expressed above. But what may help <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> overcome them is its emphasis on interaction—on being an assistant. Maybe writing a proof in <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> won’t be like taking castor oil proverbially used to be—it might be more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite">Marmite</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Two final thoughts. For the main one: Proofs are not as important as discoveries. Can we use <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> to suggest ideas, open problems, approaches, and more? The gene folding program we discussed recently does not claim to prove its fold is correct. But it seems useful. If <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> could help make guesses or provided intuition that would be valuable. Perhaps more valuable than assuring that a long proof is correct. </p>
<p>
Another possible idea: How about we insist that claimed proofs of P<img alt="{=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{=}"/>NP or other famous conjectures must be presented using <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/>. The “claimed” proofs are all relatively short, so it would not be too hard for the authors of these results to write them out in the <img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> system. They already LaTeX them, so why not? This would have a double benefit: The false claims that are made about famous problems might decrease; and the chance that a correct proof would not be overlooked might increase. The cost would be the time to write up the<img alt="L\exists \forall N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5Cexists+%5Cforall+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="L\exists \forall N"/> proof.</p>
<p>
Buzzard is a colorful (or colourful?) character, and may also be gaining a reputation for being well ahead of the times. In 2017 he gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQPb7DRMoZY&amp;list=LLuXRsVD2rJdPs_rstTQZeow&amp;index=9">talk</a> on P<img alt="{=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{=}"/>NP for the Royal Institution, but what we note in the cideo is how he was presciently dressed for Zoom.</p>

<p>This is our second post on the open problem session of the HUJI combinatorics seminar. <a href="https://huji.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1ac330a2-d6b7-4b86-9bac-ac7500d14205">The video of the session is here</a>. Today’s problem was presented by <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ckeller/">Chaya Keller</a>.</p>
<h2>The Krasnoselskii number</h2>
<p>One of the best-known applications of Helly’s theorem (that is, actually, equivalent to Helly’s theorem, see [Bo]) is the following theorem, due to Krasnoselskii [K]:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1 (Krasnoselskii):</strong> Let <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> be an infinite compact set in <img alt="{\mathbb{R}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathbb{R}^d}"/>. If every <img alt="{d+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%2B1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{d+1}"/> points of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> are visible from a common point, then <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> is starshaped, that is there exists some <img alt="{x_0 \in S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0+%5Cin+S%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x_0 \in S}"/> that sees all points in <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/>.</p>
<p>Krasnoselskii’s theorem does not hold for non-compact sets. However, all known counter-examples satisfy the weaker requirement of being finitely starlike, namely that any finite subset of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> is visible from a common point. This led Peterson [P] to ask the following:</p>
<p>Does there exist a Krasnoselskii number <img alt="{K(d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%28d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K(d)}"/> such that for any infinite set <img alt="{S \subset \mathbb{R}^d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS+%5Csubset+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S \subset \mathbb{R}^d}"/>, if every <img alt="{K(d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%28d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K(d)}"/> points of <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> are visible from a single point, then <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> is finitely starlike?</p>
<p>Marilyn Breen obtained positive results for special cases of sets that satisfy additional topological conditions [Br1,Br2,Br3], e.g., Krasnoselskii number 3 for closed sets in the plane. On the other hand, she proved that if <img alt="{K(2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{K(2)}"/> exists, then it must be larger than <img alt="{8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{8}"/>.</p>
<p>Recently, Micha Perles and me (Chaya Keller) proved that under no restriction on the set, the Krasnoselskii number does not exist. More precisely, we proved that for any <img alt="{k \geq 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%5Cgeq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{k \geq 2}"/>, there exists a set <img alt="{S \subset \mathbb{R}^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS+%5Csubset+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S \subset \mathbb{R}^2}"/> such that any <img alt="{2k+3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2k%2B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2k+3}"/> points in <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> are visible from a common point, but there exist <img alt="{2k+4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2k%2B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{2k+4}"/> points in <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> that are not visible from a common point. But this counter example is absolutely not constructive (since it is based on a transfinite induction), and the resulting set <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> admits no resonable topological structure.</p>
<p>This leads to the following two problems:</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Problem 1: Can you show constructively that the Krasnoselskii number does not exist?</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Problem 2: Can you find more natural topological conditions under which the Krasnoselskii number exists?</span></h3>

Needless to say this was the course that changed my life and led me down a path that would have me teach a variation of this course myself more than twenty times.</p><p>For some reason one of the final exam questions is still stuck in my head.</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><p>Let the permutation of a language L be the set of strings x such that there is a string y in L which is a permutation of the letters in x. For example perm({01},{001})={01,10,001,010,100}. </p><p>Are regular languages closed under permutations?</p></blockquote><p>There's a short and easy answer that's not so easy to find. Just in that P v NP spirit a Hartmanis test question should have. Give it a try before you read more.</p><p>If you <a href="https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/ll-shuffle-language-l-let-shuffle-l-following-language-w-x-elementof-l-w-x-w-permutation-l-q23260847">ask Chegg</a> you end up with </p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F357%2F35711f1a-f8bc-490e-893d-cb13349ebfa3%2FphpMmxXRb.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="70" src="https://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F357%2F35711f1a-f8bc-490e-893d-cb13349ebfa3%2FphpMmxXRb.png" width="400"/></a></div><p>And for $15 you can get the answer.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Highlights in property testing this month, include developments across the board. We have a nice potpourri of results which will catch your fancy. From a result which shows the tightness of quadratic gap between query complexities of adaptive vs non-adaptive testers for dense graph properties, to isoperimetric Talagrand-like inequalities for real valued functions over the hypercube, to results which consider face off between quantum computing and distribution testing and more. Looks like the festive season came early for the PTReview readers.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Non-adaptive vs Adaptive Queries in the Dense Graph Testing Model</strong> (by Oded Goldreich and Avi Wigderson) (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/160/">ECCC</a>) It has been long established in the dense graph property testing literature that the query complexity of adaptive testers and non-adaptive testers are only a quadratic factor apart. This work asks: is this gap necessarily tight and answers in the affirmative. The main conceptual tool used in the paper is the notion of <em>robustly self-ordered graphs</em> and <em>local self-ordering procedures</em> for these graphs (which was developed by the same authors and was covered in our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1420">September Post</a>). These results use these tools to port lower bounds on property testing problems for bit strings to graph properties.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Sum and Partitionability Testing over General Groups </strong>(by Andrej Bogdanov and Gautam Prakriya) (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/164/">ECCC</a>)  In their celebrated work, Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld gave a four query test to determine whether a function \(f \colon \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{F}_2\) is affine. This paper considers a generalization of the notion of affinity to functions \(f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to G\) where \(G\) is an Abelian group. The generalization sough asks: does \(f\) have the form \(f = \sum x_ig_i + g_0\) for group elements \(g_0, g_1, \cdots, g_n \in G\). In this setting, the BLR analysis does not apply as the domain and range are note equipped with the same group structure. This work presents a four query test for the above problem. In fact, the test is more general and can be used to decide whether a function \(f \colon D_1 \times D_2 \ldots \times D_n \to G\) from a product domain \(D_1 \times D_2 \ldots \times D_n\) to an Abelian group $G$ is a direct sum if it has the form \(f(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) = \sum f_i(x_i)\) which resolves a conjecture of Dinur and Golubev. The work also presents results for testing whether a function \(f\) defined from a product domain to an Abelian group \(G\) is a direct product.</p>

<p><strong>Isoperimetric Inequalities for Real-Valued Functions with Applications to Monotonicity Testing</strong> (by Hadley Black, Iden Kalemaj and Sofya Raskhodnikova) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09441.pdf">ArXiv</a>) This paper generalizes the celebrated isoperimetric inequalities of boolean functions over the hypercube to the setting of real valued functions. This generalized isoperimetry is then put to work to obtain a monotonicity tester for \(f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}\). The tester makes \(\min(\tilde{O}(r \sqrt n), O(n))\) non-adaptive queries (where \(r\) is the size of image of \(f\)) and has one-sided error. The authors generalize the KMS inequality by a Boolean decomposition theorem which allows them to represent any real valued function over the cube as a collection of Boolean functions over the cube which capture \(f\)’s distance to montonicity as well the structure of violations to monotonicity in \(f\). </p>

<p><strong>Erasure-Resilient Sublinear-Time Graph Algorithms</strong> (by Amit Levi, Ramesh Krishnan S. Pallavoor, Sofya Raskhodnikova and Nithin Varma) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14291.pdf">ArXiv</a>) In a previous work, a subset of the authors explored how to equip property testers with the erasure-resilience for function properties. With graph properties, a different picture emerges. In the dense graph model, where you have query access to the adjacency matrix, the situation is <em>still</em> fine: adjacency matrices are functional representations of graphs: therefore, if you have a <em>black belt</em> in making property testers erasure resilient for function properties, you would be able to test properties of dense graphs too. However, if I give you query access to the graph through an adjacency list, the picture changes. These are non-functional representations of graphs and therefore need new conceptual tools. This paper begins the study of erasure resilience in the adjacency list model. It focuses on two computational tasks: testing connectivity and estimating average degree.  Let me showcase the results in the paper on testing connectivity. It is shown that you encounter a threshold phenomena in testing connectivity. As long as the fraction of erasures is small, you get testers which run in time independent of the size of the graph. But when the fraction of erasures exceeds a certain cutoff, it is shown that the tester needs a number of queries linear in the size of the adjacency list. </p>



<p><strong>Expander Random Walks: A Fourier Analytic Approach</strong> (by Gil Cohen, Noam Peri and Amnon Ta-Shma) (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/163/">ECCC</a>) While this is a not exactly a property testing paper, how can you not report a paper which proves a significant strengthening of the classic CLT for Markov Chains (alright, for random walks on expanders) with respect to the TV distance? Let us now unpack the above a little. So, consider the following setup: Suppose you have a \(d\)-regular expander \(G\). Now, imagine running the following process \(\textsf{(P)}\):</p>



<p>1) Label half the vertices in \(G\) as \(+1\) and the other half as \(-1\) arbitrarily.<br/>2) Take a \(t-1\) step random walk which involves \(t\) vertices: say \(v_1, v_2, \ldots v_t\).<br/>3) Finally, return the boolean label of all of the visited vertices. This gives a bit-vector \(x \in \{-1,1\}^t\).</p>



<p>Now, let us ask: Which class of functions get fooled by this process?</p>



<p>The main result of the paper shows that this process fools</p>



<p>1) Symmetric functions<br/>2) The class \(AC^0\)<br/>3) Functions \(f\) which are computable by low width read once branching programs.</p>



<p>In more detail, let \(f\) be a symmetric function and let \(G\) be a \(\lambda\)-spectral expander. For the process \(\textsf{(P)}\) defined above, it follows by the spectral expansion of \(G\), that \(discrepancy(f) = |E_{x \sim \textsf{(P)}} [f(x)] – E_{x \sim U_t} [f(x)]|\) is small.</p>



<p>Now note that the total variation distance is precisely equal to the maximum discrepancy you get over all symmetric functions \(f\). This leads to the connection that allows the authors to upgrade CLT for expander random walks as they are able to show a CLT for Markov Chains with respect to the TV distance (as opposed to the CLT with respect to the Kolmogorov Distance which is what was known from the work of Kipnis and Vadhan since 1986).</p>

<p><strong>New Sublinear Algorithms and Lower Bounds for LIS Estimation</strong> (by Ilan Newman and Nithin Varma) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05805.pdf">ArXiv</a>) As the title suggests, this paper considers the task of estimating the length of the longest increasing sequence in an array. In particular, it gives a non-adaptive algorithm which estimates the LIS length within an additive error of \(\pm \varepsilon n\) in \(\tilde{O}\left(\frac{r}{\varepsilon^3}\right)\) queries (where \(r\) is the number of distinct elements in \(A\)). On the lower bound side, the paper presents a lower bound of \((\log n)^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}\) non-adaptive queries. The lower bound construction uses ideas from lower bound of Ben-Eliezer, Canonne, Letzter and Waingarten on testing monotone pattern freeness.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Stability and testability: equations in permutations</strong> (by Oren Becker, Alexander Lubotzky, AND Jonathan Mosheiff) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05234.pdf">ArXiv</a>) Consider the following question: Suppose I ask if two permuations \(A,B \in Sym(n)\). Suppose I want to decide whether these permutations commute or whether they are far from permutations which commute. Can this question be answered in time independent of \(n\)? The authors answer this question in the affirmative. They show a simple <em>Sample and Substitute</em> procedure which essentially does the following: take samples \(x_1, x_2, cdots x_k \sim [n]\). And accept <em>iff</em> \(ABx_i = BAx_i\) for each \(i\). The authors call this particular set of equations/constraints (checking whether \(AB = BA\)) stable: as it admits a Sample and Substitute style tester with query complexity independent of \([n]\).  This allows the authors to consider the group theoretic notion of stability as a property testing concept and allows them to examine the notion of stability from a computational standpoint.   </p>



<p/>



<p><strong>StoqMA meets distribution testing</strong> (by Yupan Liu) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05733.pdf">ArXiv</a>) This paper shows a containment result. A certain complexity class \(\textsf{eStoqMA}\) is shown to be a subset of \(\textsf{StoqMA}\). Let us informally define what these classes are. A language \(L \in \textsf{StoqMA}\) if there exists a verifier (which is a reversible quantum circuit) such that on input a string \(x\) such that for every \(x \in L\) there exists a witness quantum state which makes the verifier accept with probability at least \(2/3\). And in case \(x \not\in L\), for every quantum state the verifier rejects \(x\) with probability at least \(2/3\). The paper characterizes this class from a distribution testing point of view. And this connection allows the author to conclude that \(\textsf{eStoqMA} = \textsf{MA}\). Here, \(\textsf{eStoqMA}\) is a sub-class of \(\textsf{StoqMA}\) where all YES instances have an easy <em>witness</em>.</p>

<p><strong>(Edit: <em>Added later</em>)</strong> We missed the following two papers. Thanks to our readers for pointing it out.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Near-Optimal Learning of Tree-Structured Distributions by Chow-Liu</strong> (by Arnab Bhattacharya, Sutanu Gayen, Eric Price and N.V. Vinodchandran) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04144.pdf">ArXiv</a>) Graphical models are a convenient way to describe high dimensional data in terms of its dependence structure. An important question in this area concerns learning/inferring the underlying graphical model from <em>iid</em> samples. This paper considers the problem when the underlying graph is in fact a tree. Thus, the challenge is to learn a tree structured distribution. The main result is that given sample access to a tree structured distribution, you can recover an \(\varepsilon\) <em>approximate</em> tree with good probability in \(O(n/\varepsilon)\).</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Relaxed Locally Correctable Codes with Improved Parameters</strong> (by Vahid R. Asadi and Igor Shinkar) (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/142/">ECCC</a>) In their work on Robust PCPs of Proximity, Ben-Sasson et al. asked whether it is possible to obtain a \(q\)-query <em>(Relaxed)</em> Locally Decodable Code whose block length is strictly smaller than the best known bounds on block lengths for Locally Decodable Codes. Recall with relaxed LDCs you are allowed to abort outputting the \(i^{th}\) bit of the message should you detect that the received word is not a valid codeword. This paper makes progress on this problem and shows that you can actually construct an \(O(q)\)-query relaxed LDCs which encode a message of length \(k\) using \(O(k^{1 + 1/q})\) queries. This matches some of the known lower bounds for constant query LDCs which thus makes progress towards understanding the gap between LDCs and relaxed LDCs in the regime \(q = O(1)\).</p></div>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>In this guest post, I will toot my own horn about a paper in progress (hopefully nearly finished) that goes back to the revolutionary early days of quantum computing, namely Shor’s algorithm. <strong>The takeway: I think that the strongest multidimensional generalization of Shor’s algorithm has been missed for decades. It appears to be a new algorithm that does more than the standard generalization described by Kitaev.</strong> (Scott wanted me to channel Captain Kirk and boldly go with a takeaway, so I did.)</p>



<p>Unlike Shor’s algorithm proper, I don’t know of any dramatic applications of this new algorithm. However, more than one quantum algorithm was discovered just because it looked interesting, and then found applications later. The input to Shor’s algorithm is a function \(f:\mathbb{Z} \to S\), in other words a symbol-valued function \(f\) on the integers, which is periodic with an unknown period \(p\) and otherwise injective. In equations, \(f(x) = f(y)\) if only if \(p\) divides \(x-y\). In saying that the input is a function \(f\), I mean that Shor’s algorithm is provided with an algorithm to compute \(f\) efficiently. Shor’s algorithm itself can then find the period \(p\) in (quantum) polynomial time in the number of digits of \(p\). (Not polynomial time in \(p\), polynomial time in its logarithm.) If you’ve heard that Shor’s algorithm can factor integers, that is just one special case where \(f(x) = a^x\) mod \(N\), the integer to factor. In its generalized form, Shor’s algorithm is miraculous. In particular, if \(f\) is a black-box function, then it is routine to prove that any classical algorithm to do the same thing needs exponentially many values of \(f\), or values \(f(x)\) where \(x\) has exponentially many digits.</p>



<p>Shor’s algorithm begat the Shor-Kitaev algorithm, which does the same thing for a higher dimensional periodic function \(f:\mathbb{Z}^d \to S\), where \(f\) is now periodic with respect to a lattice \(L\). The Shor-Kitaev algorithm in turn begat the hidden subgroup problem (called HSP among friends), where \(\mathbb{Z}\) or \(\mathbb{Z}^d\) is replaced by a group \(G\), and now \(f\) is \(L\)-periodic for some subgroup \(L\). HSP varies substantially in both its computationally difficulty and its complexity status, depending on the structure of \(G\) as well as optional restrictions on \(L\).</p>



<p>A funny thing happened <s>on the way to the forum</s> in later work on HSP. Most of the later work has been in the special case that the ambient group \(G\) is finite, even though \(G\) is infinite in the famous case of Shor’s algorithm. My paper-to-be explores the hidden subgroup problem in various cases when \(G\) is infinite. In particular, I noticed that even the case \(G = \mathbb{Z}^d\) isn’t fully solved, because the Shor-Kitaev algorithm makes the extra assumption that \(L\) is a maximum-rank lattice, or equivalently that \(L\) a finite-index subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}^d\). As far as I know, the more general case where \(L\) might have lower rank wasn’t treated previously. I found an extension of Shor-Kitaev to handle this case, which is I will sketch after discussing some points about HSP in general.</p>



<h2>Quantum algorithms for HSP</h2>



<p>Every known quantum algorithm for HSP has the same two opening steps. First prepare an equal superposition \(|\psi_G\rangle\) of “all” elements of the ambient group \(G\), then apply a unitary form of the hiding function \(f\) to get the following: \[ U_f|\psi_G\rangle \propto \sum_{x \in G} |x,f(x)\rangle. \] Actually, you can only do exactly this when \(G\) is a finite group. You cannot make an equal quantum superposition on an infinite set, for the same reason that you cannot choose an integer uniformly at random from among all of the integers: It would defy the laws of probability. Since computers are finite, a realistic quantum algorithm cannot make an unequal quantum superposition on an infinite set either. However, if \(G\) is a well-behaved infinite group, then you can approximate the same idea by making an equal superposition on a large but finite box \(B \subseteq G\) instead: \[ U_f|\psi_G\rangle \propto \sum_{x \in B \subseteq G} |x,f(x)\rangle. \] Quantum algorithms for HSP now follow a third counterintuitive “step”, namely, that you should discard the output qubits that contain the value \(f(x)\). You should take the values of \(f\) to be incomprehensible data, encrypted for all you know. A good quantum algorithm evaluates \(f\) too few times to interpret its output, so you might as well let it go. (By contrast, a classical algorithm is forced to dig for the only meaningful information that the output of \(f\) to have. Namely, it has to keep searching until it finds equal values.) What remains, want what turns out to be highly valuable, is the input state in a partially measured form. I remember joking with <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~moore/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cris Moore</a> about the different ways of looking at this step:</p>



<ol><li>You can measure the output qubits.</li><li>The janitor can fish the output qubits out of the trash and measure them for you.</li><li>You can secretly not measure the output qubits and say you did.</li><li>You can keep the output qubits and say you threw them away.</li></ol>



<p>Measuring the output qubits wins you the purely mathematical convenience that the posterior state on the input qubits is pure (a vector state) rather than mixed (a density matrix). However, since no use is made of the measured value, it truly makes no difference for the algorithm.</p>



<p>The final universal step for all HSP quantum algorithms is to apply a quantum Fourier transform (or QFT) to the input register and measure the resulting Fourier mode. This might seem like a creative step that may or may not be a good idea. However, if you have an efficient algorithm for the QFT for your particular group \(G\), then you might as well do this, because (taking the interpretation that you threw away the output register) the environment already knows the Fourier mode. You can assume that this Fourier mode has been published in the New York Times, and you won’t lose anything by reading the papers.</p>



<h2>Fourier modes and Fourier stripes</h2>



<p>I’ll now let \(G = \mathbb{Z}^d\) and make things more explicit, for starters by putting arrows on elements \(\vec{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^d\) to indicate that they are lattice vectors. The standard begining produces a superposition \(|\psi_{L+\vec{v}}\rangle\) on a translate \(L+\vec{v}\) of the hidden lattice \(L\). (Again, \(L\) is the periodicity of \(f\).) If this state could be an equal superposition on the infinite set \(L+\vec{v}\), and if you could do a perfect QFT on the infinite group \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), then the resulting Fourier mode would be a randomly chosen element of a certain dual group \(L^\# \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^d\) inside the torus of Fourier modes of \(\mathbb{Z}^d\). Namely, \(L^\#\) consists of those vectors \(\vec{y} \in (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^d\) whose such that the dot product \(\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}\) is an integer for every \(\vec{x} \in L\). (If you expected the Fourier dual of the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) to be a circle \(\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}\) of length \(2\pi\), I found it convenient here to rescale it to a circle \(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\) of length 1. This is often considered gauche these days, like using \(h\) instead of \(\hbar\) in quantum mechanics, but in context it’s okay.) In principle, you can learn \(L^\#\) from sampling it, and then learn \(L\) from \(L^\#\). Happily, the unknown and irrelevant translation vector \(\vec{v}\) is erased in this method.</p>



<p>In practice, it’s not so simple. As before, you cannot actually make an equal superposition on all of \(L+\vec{v}\), but only trimmed to a box \(B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d\). If you have \(q\) qubits available for each coordinate of \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), then \(B\) might be a \(d\)-dimensional cube with \(Q = 2^q\) lattice points in each direction. Following Peter Shor’s famous paper, the standard thing to do here is to identify \(B\) with the finite group \((\mathbb{Z}/Q)^d\) and do the QFT there instead. This is gauche as pure mathematics, but it’s reasonable as computer science. In any case, it works, but it comes at a price. You should rescale the resulting Fourier mode \(\vec{y} \in (\mathbb{Z}/Q)^d\) as \(\vec{y}_1 = \vec{y}/Q\) to match it to the torus \((\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^d\). Even if you do that, \(\vec{y}_1\) is not actually a uniformly random element of \(L^\#\), but rather a noisy, discretized approximation of one.</p>



<p>In Shor’s algorithm, the remaining work is often interpreted as the post-climax. In this case \(L = p\mathbb{Z}\), where \(p\) is the hidden period of \(f\), and \(L^\#\) consists of the multiples of \(1/p\) in \(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\). The Fourier mode \(y_1\) (skipping the arrow since we are in one dimension) is an approximation to some fraction \(r/p\) with roughly \(q\) binary digits of precision. (\(y_1\) is often but not always the very best binary approximation to \(r/p\) with the available precision.) If you have enough precision, you can learn a fraction from its digits, either in base 2 or in any base. For instance, if I’m thinking of a fraction that is approximately 0.2857, then 2/7 is much closer than any other fraction with a one-digit denominator. As many people know, and as Shor explained in his paper, continued fractions are an efficient and optimal algorithm for this in larger cases.</p>



<p>The Shor-Kitaev algorithm works the same way. You can denoise each coordinate of each Fourier example \(\vec{y}_1\) with the continued fraction algorithm to obtain an exact element \(\vec{y}_0 \in L^\#\). You can learn \(L^\#\) with a polynomial number of samples, and then learn \(L\) from that with integer linear algebra. However, this approach can only work if \(L^\#\) is a finite group, or equivalently when \(L\) has maximum rank \(d\). This condition is explicitly stated in Kitaev’s paper, and in most but not all of the papers and books that cite this algorithm. if \(L\) has maximum rank, then the picture in Fourier space looks like this: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/f1-torus.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/f1-torus.png"/></a></figure>



<p>However, if \(L\) has rank \(\ell &lt; d\), then \(L^\#\) is a pattern of \((k-\ell)\)-dimensional stripes, like this instead: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/f2-torus.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/f2-torus.png"/></a></figure>



<p>In this case, as the picture indicates, each coordinate of \(\vec{y}_1\) is flat random and individually irreparable. If you knew the direction of the stripes, then you use could define a slanted coordinate system where some of the coordinates of \(\vec{y}_1\) could be repaired. But the tangent directions of \(L^\#\) essentially beg the question. They are the orthogonal space of \(L_\mathbb{R}\), the vector space subtended by the hidden subgroup \(L\). If you know \(L_\mathbb{R}\), then you can find \(L\) by running Shor-Kitaev in the lattice \(L_\mathbb{R} \cap \mathbb{Z}^d\).</p>



<p>My solution to this conundrum is to observe that the multiples of a randomly chosen point \(\vec{y}_0\) in \(L^\#\) have a good chance of filling out \(L^\#\) adequately well, in particular to land near \(\vec{0}\) often enough to reveal the tangent directions of \(L^\#\). You have to make do with a noisy sample \(\vec{y}_1\) instead, but by making the QFT radix \(Q\) large enough, you can reduce the noise well enough for this to work. Still, even if you know that these small, high-quality multiples of \(\vec{y}_1\) exist, they are needles in an exponential haystack of bad multiples, so how do you find them? It turns out that the versatile LLL algorithm, which finds a basis of short vectors in a lattice, can be used here. The multiples of \(\vec{y}_0\) (say, for simplicity) aren’t a lattice, they are a dense orbit in \(L^\#\) or part of it. However, they are a shadow of a lattice one dimension higher, that you can supply to the LLL algorithm. This step produces lets you compute the linear span \(L_\mathbb{R}\) of \(L\) from its perpendicular space, and then as mentioned you can use Shor-Kitaev to learn the exact geometry of \(L\).</p></div>

    <title>In 1974 Planarity was O(V) time and could do 900 node graphs in 12 seconds! Fast then...</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In 1974  Hopcroft and Tarjan showed that Planarity is in polynomial time. That is an understatement- they actually have an O(V) algorithm which one can actually code up.

How does that compare to what Moore's law (for time) would have predicted? Can this help us determine an x such that Moore's law stopped working at year x. I've  heard various candidates for x including the notion that the death of Moore's law has been greatly exaggerated. Moore himself is still alive, at the age of 91. </p><p>2) Are there better algorithms now?

    <title>Long contours and chessboard coloring</title>
    <summary>The image below is a topographic map of some parkland a couple miles from my house, clipped from opentopomap.org.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The image below is a topographic map of some parkland a couple miles from my house, clipped from <a href="https://opentopomap.org/#map=15/33.61985/-117.77702">opentopomap.org</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Topographic map of Bommer Canyon, Irvine, from opentopomap.org" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/BommerCanyon.jpg"/></p>

<p>Here’s another picture of the same place that I took <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/vvbc/">a few years ago</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Bommer Canyon, Irvine" src="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/vvbc/MustardMeadow-m.jpg"/></p>

<p>It’s pretty hilly there, as you can tell from the brown <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/12/06/Contour line">contour lines</a> on the map, sets of points that are all at the same height as each other. Some contours are short closed curves. Typically these surround hilltops, although they could also mark basins in the landscape; it’s dry enough here that a basin wouldn’t necessarily stay filled with rainwater. Others wiggle around for quite a long distance before escaping the map and connecting to its surrounding regions. Some of them (including the darker brown curve surrounding a pair of hilltops in the upper left of the map) look like they cross or touch themselves at a saddle point of the landscape. This kind of point, where four or more branches of a contour meet, can indeed happen for a contour at the exact height of a saddle point, but a closeup inspection of the upper left one reveals that it has slightly lower height and is actually a single simple closed curve around both hills. It is also possible for contours to reach a dead end (for instance when they follow the top of a level ridgeline) or for an odd number of branches to meet at a junction.</p>

<p>It turns out that every possible landscape has a contour that stretches from one edge of the map to the opposite edge. To state this more precisely and avoid fractal difficulties, let’s model the landscape as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_terrain">polyhedral terrain</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulated_irregular_network">triangulated irregular network</a>, the graph of a piecewise-linear continuous function from a planar polygon \(p\) to the height at each point. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set">level sets</a> are inverse images of heights, and its contours are connected components of level sets. They might not actually be curves or lines; for instance a level plain in the landscape would belong to a single contour. Every contour touches the boundary of \(P\) in a (possibly empty) set of points, dividing the boundary into arcs. Then the existence of a long contour can be stated more explicitly: there is a contour such that all of these arcs have length at most half the perimeter of \(P\). If \(P\) is a rectangle or square, this long contour touches two opposite sides, possibly at their endpoints, because avoiding both a horizontal side and a vertical side would cause the arc containing those sides to be too long.</p>

<p>The proof sketch is not particularly difficult but I’ve indented it below so you can skip over it anyway:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Start with the contour containing an arbitrary boundary point, and suppose that it doesn’t immediately solve the problem. This means that there is an arc (and there can be only one) between two of its boundary points (say clockwise from \(x\) to \(y\)) that covers more than half of the perimeter of \(P\). Now consider what happens if you move clockwise continuously from \(x\) to some point \(x'\), and then walk along a contour from \(x'\) (staying to the left whenever you have a choice) to reach another boundary point \(y'\). Then \(y'\), wherever it is, must be within the arc from \(x\) to \(y\), because the two contours cannot cross, so the arc from \(x'\) to \(y'\) is shorter than the arc from \(x\) to \(y\). As we move \(x'\) continuously away from \(x\), the position of \(y'\) moves continuously in the other direction away from \(y\), except at points when the contour passes through a vertex of the landscape; at those points the contour can change its shape discontinuously and \(y'\) can jump discontinuously. But regardless of whether \(y'\) changes continuously or jumps, the length of the arc from \(x'\) to \(y'\) decreases as \(x'\) and \(y'\) move towards each other until eventually they cross.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">At some point before they do cross, one of two other things must happen. Either the length of arc \(x'y'\) decreases continuously through half the perimeter, or it jumps from being larger than half the perimeter to being smaller than half the perimeter. If it decreases continuously through half the perimeter, the contour containing the points \(x'\) and \(y'\) at the time that it reaches exactly half the perimeter has the desired property. If it jumps, consider the contour \(C\) exactly at the point when it jumps. If \(C\) has the desired property, we are done. Alternatively, there might still be a long boundary arc \(uv\) for \(C\), nested within the pre-jump arc \(x'y'\), and we can continue the same process from there until eventually terminating in one of the other cases.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(Exercise: Use this method to find a long contour in the topographic map.)</p>

<p>That was all very continuous and topological but I actually came to this problem from something much more discrete: If you color the squares of a chessboard with three colors, must there be some two of the three colors whose squares stretch all the way across the board, touching edge to edge? In contrast, with four colors you can make colorings where all two-color regions are small:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="4-coloring of grid squares so that 2-colored regions are all small" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/plaid.svg"/></p>

<p>The four-coloring above is <em>proper</em> (no two adjacent squares have the same color) and I can use contours prove that every proper three-coloring has a two-colored region that stretches across the board.</p>

<p>The idea is, first, to turn any three-coloring of the chessboard squares into a discrete height function, one that takes integer values on each square and where these values differ by \(\pm 1\) on adjacent squares, so that the coloring can be recovered by taking the heights modulo three. I discussed this briefly in an <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/16/from-one-fold.html">earlier post about reconfiguring Miura-folded origami</a>, with the following example:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Height function of a proper 3-coloring of a square grid" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/heightfn.svg"/></p>

<p>It doesn’t look very continuous, but we can make it continuous by using these height values only for the middle points of the squares. At each corner point where two or four squares come together, set the height value to be the average of the heights of the squares that meet there. Divide each square into four isosceles right triangles, meeting at the center of the square, and interpolate these height values linearly within each triangle. Then, find a long contour for the resulting polyhedral terrain. If the long contour is at an integer height, it can be turned into an edge-to-edge sequence of squares using that height and either one of the two neighboring integer heights. If the long contour is at a non-integer height, it can be turned into an edge-to-edge sequence of squares using the integer heights closest to it above and below that height. The image below shows the integer and half-integer contours of the same grid 3-coloring, with the long contour through the large red-yellow region shown in bold. The crosshatched regions are level shelves in the surface, and the black dots are peaks and basins.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Topographic map of height function derived from proper 3-coloring of a square grid" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/checkerboard-topo.svg"/></p>

<p>Sadly, the same argument doesn’t work for improper three-colorings, because they don’t usually have height functions. More strongly, the property that we want to prove, the existence of large two-colored regions, is just not true of improper colorings. The improper coloring below can be extended to arbitrarily large chessboards, with all two-colored regions having at most 13 squares:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Improper 3-coloring of grid squares so that 2-colored regions are all small" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/plaid2.svg"/></p>

    <title>TR20-183 |  Constant Depth Formula and Partial Function Versions of MCSP are Hard | 

	Rahul Ilango</title>
    <summary>Attempts to prove the intractability of the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) date as far back as the 1950s and are well-motivated by connections to cryptography, learning theory, and average-case complexity. In this work, we make progress, on two fronts, towards showing MCSP is intractable under worst-case assumptions. 


While Masek showed in the late 1970s that the version of MCSP for DNF formulas is NP-hard, extending this result to the case of depth-$3$ AND/OR formulas was open.  We show that determining the minimum size of a depth-$d$ formula computing a given Boolean function is NP-hard under quasipolynomial-time randomized reductions for all constant $d \geq 2$. Our approach is based on a method to "lift" depth-$d$ formula lower bounds to depth-$(d+1)$. This method also implies the existence of a function with a $2^{\Omega_d(n)}$ additive gap between its depth-$d$ and depth-$(d+1)$ formula complexity.


We also make progress in the case of general, unrestricted circuits. We show that the version of MCSP where the input is a partial function (represented by a string in $\{0,1,\star\}^*$) is not in P under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).


Intriguingly, we formulate a notion of lower bound statements being $(P/poly)$-recognizable that is closely related to Razborov and Rudich's definition of being $(P/poly)$-constructive. We show that unless there are subexponential-sized circuits computing SAT, the collection of lower bound statements used to prove the correctness of our reductions cannot be $(P/poly)$-recognizable.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This is a quick and preliminary post about a very recent announcement in a Science Magazine paper: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/12/02/science.abe8770">Quantum computational advantage using photons</a> by a group of researchers leaded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Jianwei">Jianwei Pan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chaoyanglu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Chao-Yang Lu.</a> (Most of the researchers are from USTC in Hefei, China.)</p>
<p>The paper announces achieving  quantum advantage (aka “quantum supremacy”) using photonic implementation of BosonSampling.  (I heard about it from a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5122">SO post</a> that contains further links.) The claimed advantage is huge and clearly I will have to look carefully at the results, the data, and the interpretation. The idea that this could be done was raised ten years ago by Aaronson and Arkhipov and we discussed it in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2010/11/17/aaronson-and-arkhipovs-result-on-hierarchy-collapse/">here</a> and in several other posts along with the idea that it<em> cannot</em> be done.</p>
<p>Boson Sampling was studied in a 2014 paper by Guy Kindler and me <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3093" rel="nofollow ugc">Gaussian Noise Sensitivity and BosonSampling</a>. Our paper and the connection with noise sensitivity and the Fourier description is the basis for <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwii7ure67ftAhVDhqQKHRMsCyoQFjACegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ams.org%2Fnotices%2F201605%2Frnoti-p508.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw3S3tSldRaLR6RwskAYwLUo">my argument</a> against quantum computers.  Of course, a demonstration of a huge quantum advantage, as claimed in the new paper, if valid, would refute my theory.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter is if the statistical performance of the photonic samples produced in the experiment could be achieved by classical sampling. (This is referred to as “spoofing.”) My paper with Guy proposes a very simple way to try to do it based  on the low degree Hermite-Fourier truncation of the Boson Sampling distribution.</p>
<p>The easiest way to implement it is as follows: Given an n by m matrix you draw (with the appropriate weights based on repeated columns) at random n by n minor M (with repeated columns), then compute the degree k approximation X to the |permanent(M)|^2, (based on formula (8) from our paper) and then take the sample with probability according to the value of X and toss it away otherwise. This may work even for degree-2 truncation. (Rather than the straight truncation we can also try the “Beckner-noise” version but I don’t think this will make much difference.)</p>
<p>Since my paper with Guy Kindler offers “off the shelf” classic algorithm that may “spoof” the claims I propose to test it. (And I am a little surprised that this was not tried already.)</p>

    <title>TR20-182 |  An Improved Derandomization of the Switching Lemma | 

	Zander Kelley</title>
    <summary>We prove a new derandomization of Håstad's switching lemma, showing how to efficiently generate restrictions satisfying the switching lemma for DNF or CNF formulas of size $m$ using only $\widetilde{O}(\log m)$ random bits. Derandomizations of the switching lemma have been useful in many works as a key building-block for constructing objects which are in some way provably-pseudorandom with respect to AC$^0$-circuits.

Here, we use our new derandomization to give an improved analysis of the pseudorandom generator of Trevisan and Xue for AC$^0$-circuits (CCC'13): we show that  the generator $\varepsilon$-fools size-$m$, depth-$D$ circuits with $n$-bit inputs using only $\widetilde{O}(\log(m/\varepsilon)^{D} \cdot \log n)$ random bits. In particular, we obtain (modulo the $\log \log$-factors hidden in the $\widetilde{O}$-notation) a dependence on $m/\varepsilon$ which is best-possible with respect to currently-known AC$^0$-circuit lower bounds.</summary>

    <title>TR20-181 |  Monotone Circuit Lower Bounds from Robust Sunflowers | 

	Bruno Pasqualotto Cavalar, 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	Benjamin Rossman</title>
    <summary>Robust sunflowers are a generalization of combinatorial sunflowers that have applications in monotone circuit complexity, DNF sparsification, randomness extractors, and recent advances on the Erd\H{o}s-Rado sunflower conjecture.  The recent breakthrough of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang gives an improved bound on the maximum size of a $w$-set system that excludes a robust sunflower.  In this paper, we use this result to obtain an $\exp(n^{1/2-o(1)})$ lower bound on the monotone circuit size of an explicit $n$-variate monotone function, improving the previous best known $\exp(n^{1/3-o(1)})$ due to Andreev and Harnik and Raz. We also show an $\exp(\Omega(n))$ lower bound on the monotone arithmetic circuit size of a related polynomial.  Finally, we introduce a notion of robust clique-sunflowers and use this to prove an $n^{\Omega(k)}$ lower bound on the monotone circuit size of the CLIQUE function for all $k \le n^{1/3-o(1)}$, strengthening the bound of Alon and Boppana.</summary>

<p>For many of the famous open problems of theoretical computer science, most researchers agree on what the answer is, but the challenge is to <em>prove </em>it. Most complexity theorists (with few notable exceptions) believe that P≠NP, but we don’t know how to prove it. Similarly, most people working on matrix multiplication believe that there is an Õ(n²) algorithm for this problem, but we’re still stuck at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05846">2.3728596</a>.   We believed that primality checking has a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm long before it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">proven </a>and we still believe the same holds for polynomial identity testing.</p>



<p>The story of <em>cryptographic obfuscation</em> is different. This story deserves a full length blog post (though see my now outdated <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/3/198855-hopes-fears-and-software-obfuscation/fulltext">survey</a>), but the short version is as follows. In 2001 we (in a <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/p_obfuscate.html">paper </a>with Goldreich, Impagliazzo, Rudich, Sahai, Vadhan, and Yang) showed that what is arguably the most natural definition of obfuscation is impossible to achieve. That paper explored a number of obfuscation-related questions, and in particular left as an open question the existence of so-called <em>indistinguishable obfuscators</em> or <em>IO</em>. Since then there were arguably more negative than positive results in obfuscation research until in 2012, extending some of the ideas behind fully-homomorphic encryption, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/610">Garg Gentry and Halevi</a> gave a heuristic construction of multilinear map, which one can think of as “Diffie Hellman on steroids” (or maybe LSD..). Then in 2013 <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/451">Garg, Gentry, Halevi., Raykova, Sahai and Waters (GGHRSW)</a> built on top of these maps to give a heuristic construction of IO. </p>



<p>The GGHRSW paper opened the floodgates to many papers using IO to achieve many longstanding cryptographic goals as well as show that IO provides a unified approach to solve many classic cryptographic problems. The fact that so many goals were achieved through heuristic constructions was not very comforting to cryptographers. Even less comforting was the fact that several cryptographic attacks were discovered on these heuristic constructions. The years that followed saw a sequence of constructions and breaks,  giving cryptographers an “emotional whiplash”.  Everyone agreed that IO would be amazing if it exists, but whether or not it actually exists depended on who you asked, and what paper in the eprint archive they read that morning…</p>



<p>The “holy grail” in this line of work is to base obfuscation on a standard assumption, and ideally Regev’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_with_errors">Learning With Errors (LWE)</a> assumption. Of course, we don’t know that LWE is true (in particular LWE implies P≠NP) but if it’s false it would bring down so much of the field that cryptographers might as well pack their bags and do machine learning (or try to sabotage progress in quantum computing, since the only other standard <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/365">assumptions for public-key crypto</a> are broken by fully scalable quantum computing).</p>



<p>We have not yet achieved this holy grail (this is only the 4th season) but as described in <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-achieve-crown-jewel-of-cryptography-20201110/">this quanta article</a>, there has been a remarkable progress in the last few months. In particular, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1003">Jain, Lin and Sahai (JLS)</a>  (building on a long sequence of works by  many people including Ananth, Matt, Tessaro and Vaikuntanathan) obtained IO based on LWE and several standard assumptions in cryptography. This is arguably the first “heuristic free” construction, and is a fantastic breakthrough. However, there is still work to do – the JLS construction uses not just LWE but also a variant of it that is not as well studied. It is also based on pairing-based cryptography. This is an area that has thousands of papers, but for which known instantiations can be broken by quantum computers.  However, there is yet more hope – in another  sequence of works by <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/633">Agrawal</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1024">Brakerski, Döttling, Garg, and Malavolta</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1042">Wee and Wichs</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1010">Gay and Pass</a> a construction of IO was achieved that is “almost” heuristic free. It still uses one heuristic assumption (circular security) but has the advantage that apart from this assumption it only relies on LWE. </p>



<p>One can hope that in the next season, these two lines of work will converge to give a construction of IO based on LWE, achieving a “meta theorem” deriving from LWE a huge array of cryptographic primitives.</p>



<p>Want to learn more about these amazing advances? Want to know what’s next in store for IO? <br/><br/>Fortunately there is a virtual <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/obfuscation-symposium">Simons symposium on indistinguishability obfuscation</a> <strong>coming to your computer screen on December 10-11</strong>. Authors of all the papers mentioned will join together in coordinated presentations to give a unified view of the field and the challenges ahead. We will also have a historical opening talk by Yael Kalai, as well as a talk by Benny Applebaum on the computational assumptions used, followed by a panel discussion with Yael, Benny and Chris Peikert. Finally, like every proper crypto event, there will be a rump session, though you will have to supply your own beer.</p>



<p>See the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/obfuscation-symposium">schedule of the workshop</a> and you can register on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/obfuscation-symposium">this page</a>.</p>



<p>Hope you to see you there! Bring your favorite programs to obfuscate with you*<br/><br/>*<sub>Disclaimer/fine print: Due to large constants and exponents, we do not recommend the compiler be used on programs that are more than one nanobit long.</sub></p>
