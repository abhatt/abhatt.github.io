    <title>TR21-078 |  A direct product theorem for quantum communication complexity with applications to device-independent QKD | 

	Rahul  Jain, 

	Srijita Kundu</title>
    <summary>We give a direct product theorem for the entanglement-assisted interactive quantum communication complexity of an $l$-player predicate $V$. In particular we show that for a distribution $p$ that is product across the input sets of the $l$ players, the success probability of any entanglement-assisted quantum communication protocol for computing $n$ copies of $V$, whose communication is $o(\log(\mathrm{eff}^*(V,p))\cdot n)$, goes down exponentially in $n$. Here $\mathrm{eff}^*(V, p)$ is a distributional version of the quantum efficiency or partition bound introduced by Laplante, Lerays and Roland (2014), which is a lower bound on the distributional quantum communication complexity of computing a single copy of $V$ with respect to $p$.
  As an application of our result, we show that it is possible to do device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) without the assumption that devices do not leak any information after inputs are provided to them. We analyze the DIQKD protocol given by Jain, Miller and Shi (2017), and show that when the protocol is carried out with devices that are compatible with $n$ copies of the Magic Square game, it is possible to extract $\Omega(n)$ bits of key from it, even in the presence of $O(n)$ bits of leakage. Our security proof is parallel, i.e., the honest parties can enter all their inputs into their devices at once, and works for a leakage model that is arbitrarily interactive, i.e., the devices of the honest parties Alice and Bob can exchange information with each other and with the eavesdropper Eve in any number of rounds, as long as the total number of bits or qubits communicated is bounded.</summary>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I have recently posted the paper <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#Xviola-rank-samp">Vio21</a>]</span> (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/073/">download</a>) which does something that I have been trying to do for a long time, more than ten years, on and off. Consider the basic data-structure problem of storing <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> bits of data <img alt="x\in \{0,1\}^{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> into <img alt="m+r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%2Br&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> bits so that the <em>prefix-sum queries</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="\begin{aligned} \mathbb {\text {\textsc {Rank}}}(i):=\sum _{j\le i}x_{j} \end{aligned}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D+%5Cmathbb+%7B%5Ctext+%7B%5Ctextsc+%7BRank%7D%7D%7D%28i%29%3A%3D%5Csum+_%7Bj%5Cle+i%7Dx_%7Bj%7D+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   can be computed by probing <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> <em>cells</em> (or <em>words</em>) of <img alt="w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> bits each. (You can think <img alt="w=\log m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3D%5Clog+m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> throughout this post.) The paper <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascuV10">PV10</a>]</span> with Pǎtraşcu shows that <img alt="r\ge m/w^{O(q)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5Cge+m%2Fw%5E%7BO%28q%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and this was recently shown to be tight by Yu <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/conf/stoc/Yu19">Yu19</a>]</span> (building on the breakthrough data structure <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascu08Succincter">Pǎt08</a>]</span> which motivated the lower bound and is not far from it).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   As is common in data-structure lower bounds, the proof in <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascuV10">PV10</a>]</span> is an <em>encoding argument</em>. In the recently posted paper, an alternative proof is presented which avoids the encoding argument and is perhaps more in line with other proofs in complexity lower bounds. Of course, <em>everything</em> is an encoding argument, and <em>nothing </em>is an encoding argument, and this post won’t draw a line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The new proof establishes an <em>intrinsic property</em> of efficient data structures, whereas typical proofs including <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascuV10">PV10</a>]</span> are somewhat tailored to the problem at hand. The property is called the <em>separator</em> and is a main technical contribution of the work. At the high level the separator shows that in any efficient data structure you can restrict the input space a little so that many queries are nearly <em>pairwise independent</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Also, the new proof rules out a stronger object: a <em>sampler</em> (<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/is-nature-a-low-complexity-sampler/">see previous post here</a> on sampling lower bounds). Specifically, the distribution Rank<img alt="(U)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28U%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="U" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the uniform distribution cannot be sampled, not even slightly close, by an efficient cell-probe algorithm. This implies the data-structure result, and it can be informally interpreted as saying that the “reason” why the lower bound holds is not that the data is compressed, but rather that one can’t generate the type of dependencies occurring in Rank via an efficient cell-probe algorithm, regardless of what the input is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Building on this machinery, one can prove several results about sampling, like showing that cell-probe samplers are strictly weaker than AC0 samplers. While doing this, it occurred to me that one gets a corollary for data structures which I had not seen in the literature. The corollary is a <em>probe hierarchy</em>, showing that some problem can be solved with zero redundancy (<img alt="r=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) with <img alt="O(q)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28q%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> probes, while it requires almost linear <img alt="r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> probes. For example I don’t know of a result yielding this for small <img alt="q" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such as <img alt="q=O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%3DO%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; I would appreciate a reference. (As mentioned in the                                                                                                                                                        paper, the sampling viewpoint is not essential and just like for Rank one can prove the data-structure corollaries directly. Personally, and obviously, I find the sampling viewpoint useful.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   One of my favorite open problems in the area still is: can a uniform distribution over <img alt="[m]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bm%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be approximately sampled by an efficient cell-probe algorithm? I can’t even rule out samplers making <em>two </em>probes!</p>

Mary Kay Farley, my dear wife’s mom, and Dorothy Lipton, my mom, have unfortunately both passed away. Kathryn and I miss them greatly. Both women shared keen mathematical skills, a fascination with the game of baseball and a commitment to living a well-ordered life.  </p>
<p>
Today is <b>not</b> Mother’s Day. We still hope all mothers everywhere are enjoying their day.</p>
<p>
We will take this time to thank all of you out there. We missed doing so last month, but the pandemic has distended time anyway. What we are hearing now are stories of mothers and children and grandchildren finally being able to think of seeing each other in person rather than via video.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Another Kind of Parentage </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This has blended with musings on our recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/26/congrats-avi-and-laci-on-the-abel-prize/">post</a> in which I (Dick) noted that Dorit Aharonov is an academic grandchild of mine, in that Avi Wigderson co-supervised her doctoral thesis and I supervised Avi’s. </p>
<p>
Years ago we featured on Father’s Day a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/06/19/who's-your-doktorvater/">post</a> with the title “Who’s Your <em>Doktorvater</em>?”—which was a play on the <a href="https://bosoxinjection.com/2014/09/24/ten-years-gone-pedro-martinez-calls-yankees-daddy/">expression</a> “who’s your daddy?” Now it is high time to note that there are many “doctor mothers”—as Dorit has herself <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=102209">become</a>. </p>
<p>
One difference from human genealogy is that most often there is only one “doctor parent.” My <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=86340&amp;fChrono=1">advisor</a>, David Parnas, has two: Alan Perlis and Everard Williams. From Perlis it is a straight shot back to Siméon Poisson, whose 1800 dissertation was co-advised by Joseph Lagrange and Pierre Laplace. For Lagrange there is a strange <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=17864">note</a> of Leonhard Euler as a virtual advisor, but the real one is Giovanni Beccaria—who has no listed parent. Going through Laplace also dead-ends. But selecting Euler includes a chain that ends in the 1100s with Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharaf_al-Din_al-Tusi#Mathematics">improved</a> the complexity of approximately solving cubic equations.</p>
<p>
I appear not to have any female ancestors in my doctoral genealogy. I have two female PhD graduates, one of whom is a <em>Doktormutter</em>. Ken’s first female doctoral student, co-advised, had a successful thesis defense last week; he has another nearing the ABD stage. But I have known quite a few other “doctor mothers” personally. Today, Ken and I thought to recognize them.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Doctor Moms I Know </h2><p/>

Here are some that I have had the honor to know. They are in a certain order—do you see what it is? I give only the surname on purpose—click the second name and note its URL for a singular reflection of this.</p>

The last gives us an all-female tree, not just one branch, of people we know. Besides Anna Gilbert, another of Ingrid Daubechies’s students, who herself has <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=92059">advisees</a>, is Cynthia Rudin of Duke, whom Ken knew and taught while she was an undergraduate at Buffalo.</p>
<p>
There are others I could mention who went into research labs where there are different relationships besides PhD advising. They include Irene Greif, Tal Rabin, Lynn Conway, and Jean Sammet. I could include Jamie Morgenstern, whom we recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/10/making-algorithms-fair/">featured</a> and who his <a href="https://jamiemorgenstern.com/">advising</a> her first students at the University of Washington—do they have to be “born” yet to count you as a <em>Doktormutter</em>? I’ve left others out—apologies for that—but the ones I’ve listed make a nice <img alt="{4 \times 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> collage:</p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> My Upbringing </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Of these, the one with the most formative impact on me was Helena Rasiowa. I learned advanced logic from her when I was an undergraduate. </p>
<p>
Here is a tribute to <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/fitting/bookspapers/pdf/papers/Rasiowa.pdf">her</a> by Melvin Fitting: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I once heard Dana Scott criticize her <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Metamathematics-Helena-SIKORSKI-RASIOWA/dp/B005JGKZXW">book</a>, <em>The Mathematics of Metamathematics</em> with Roman Sikorski, because, while it took an algebraic approach to logic, it did not carry the work further and consider set theory. If it had, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)">forcing</a> would have been discovered years earlier than it was. This is not, at heart, a criticism, but a tribute. The building of mathematics always goes on. Foundations, firmly laid, enable later construction, and the foundations laid by that book were powerfully firm. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken also points to logic as a formative influence—though from men at Oxford.  Both of us were attracted to Gödel-type undecidability issues in complexity theory in the early 1980s.  The nexus of logic and algebra has been important to us in different ways, Ken more with finite automata and descriptive complexity.  Courses in logic gave both of us a habit of framing problems along formal lines.</p>

Are there exceptions? </p><p>I have not seen any discussion of this point on the web. So here are my rules of thumb and some questions.(CORRECTION- a commenter points out that this IS discussed on the web. Even so, you can comment on my thoughts or give your thoughts or whatever you like.) </p><p>1) If  there are 3 or more people than use et al. Exception: If the three are VERY WELL KNOWN as a triple. E.g., <i>the double play was Tinkers to Evers to Chance. </i>Well, that would not really come up since in baseball nobody ever says <i>the double play was Tinkers et al.</i>  More relevant examples:</p><p>Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman</p><p>Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, also known as CLR</p><p>The more recent edition is</p><p>Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. I have heard CLRS but I don't know if people WRITE all four names. </p><p>Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz also usually mentions all three. </p><p>2) If there is one name do not use <i>et al</i>.  unless that one person has a multiple personality disorder.</p><p>3) If there are 2 people it can be tricky and perhaps unfair.

Robinson since there is another mathematician with last name Robinson: Rafael Robinson who was Julia's Robinson's husband (to my younger readers--- there was a time when a women who got married took her husband's last name). There is at least one other Math-Robinson: Robert W Robinson. I do not think he is closely related. </p><p>Baker: I do not know of another mathematician named Baker. I tried Google, but the Bakers  I found were   not in the right time frame. I also kept finding hits to an anecdote about Poincare and a man whose profession was a baker (see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/the-story-of-poincare-and-his-friend-the-baker/">here</a> though its later in that blog post). However, I suspect there was another mathematician named Baker which is why the author uses the first initial.  Its possible the author did not want to confuse Alan  Baker with Theodore Baker, one of the authors of Baker-Gill-Solovay that showed there were oracles that made P = NP and others that made P NE NP.  But somehow, that just doesn't seem right to me. I suspect there is only one mathematician with last name Matijsavic. </p><p>Thomas Alva Edison named his son Thomas Alva Edison Jr.  This was a bad idea but not for reasons of authorship, see <a href="http://edisontinfoil.com/taejr/edisonjr.htm">here</a>.</p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>Forward Super-Resolution: How Can GANs Learn Hierarchical Generative Models for Real-World Distributions</title>

for learning high-complexity, real-world distributions. However, in theory, due
to the highly non-convex, non-concave landscape of the minmax training
objective, GAN remains one of the least understood deep learning models. In
this work, we formally study how GANs can efficiently learn certain
hierarchically generated distributions that are close to the distribution of
images in practice. We prove that when a distribution has a structure that we
refer to as Forward Super-Resolution, then simply training generative
adversarial networks using gradient descent ascent (GDA) can indeed learn this
distribution efficiently, both in terms of sample and time complexities. We
also provide concrete empirical evidence that not only our assumption "forward
super-resolution" is very natural in practice, but also the underlying learning
mechanisms that we study in this paper (to allow us efficiently train GAN via
GDA in theory) simulates the actual learning process of GANs in practice on
real-world problems.

    <title>On Classifying Continuous Constraint Satisfaction problems</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1623024000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Miltzow:Tillmann.html">Tillmann Miltzow</a>, Reinier F. Schmiermann <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02397">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A continuous constraint satisfaction problem (CCSP) is a constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP) with a domain $U \subset \mathbb{R}$. We engage in a
systematic study to classify CCSPs that are complete of the Existential Theory
of the Reals, i.e., ER-complete. To define this class, we first consider the
problem ETR, which also stands for Existential Theory of the Reals. In an
instance of this problem we are given some sentence of the form $\exists x_1,
\ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R} : \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, where $\Phi$ is a
well-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols $\{0, 1, +,
\cdot, \geq, &gt;, \wedge, \vee, \neg\}$, the goal is to check whether this
sentence is true. Now the class ER is the family of all problems that admit a
polynomial-time reduction to ETR. It is known that NP $\subseteq$ ER
$\subseteq$ PSPACE.
</p>
<p>We restrict our attention on CCSPs with addition constraints ($x + y = z$)
and some other mild technical condition. Previously, it was shown that
multiplication constraints ($x \cdot y = z$), squaring constraints ($x^2 = y$),
or inversion constraints ($x\cdot y = 1$) are sufficient to establish
ER-completeness. We extend this in the strongest possible sense for equality
constraints as follows. We show that CCSPs (with addition constraints and some
other mild technical condition) that have any one well-behaved curved equality
constraint ($f(x,y) = 0$) are ER-complete. We further extend our results to
inequality constraints. We show that any well-behaved convexly curved and any
well-behaved concavely curved inequality constraint ($f(x,y) \geq 0$ and
$g(x,y) \geq 0$) imply ER-completeness on the class of such CCSPs.
</p>
<p>We apply our findings to geometric packing and answer an open question by
Abrahamsen et al. [FOCS 2020]. Namely, we establish ER-completeness of packing
convex pieces into a square container under rotations and translations.

    <title>Spectral Hypergraph Sparsifiers of Nearly Linear Size</title>

culminating in spectral sparsifiers of optimal size (up to constant factors).
Spectral hypergraph sparsification is a natural analogue of this problem, for
which optimal bounds on the sparsifier size are not known, mainly because the
hypergraph Laplacian is non-linear, and thus lacks the linear-algebraic
structure and tools that have been so effective for graphs.
</p>
<p>Our main contribution is the first algorithm for constructing
$\epsilon$-spectral sparsifiers for hypergraphs with $O^*(n)$ hyperedges, where
$O^*$ suppresses $(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)^{O(1)}$ factors. This bound is
independent of the rank $r$ (maximum cardinality of a hyperedge), and is
essentially best possible due to a recent bit complexity lower bound of
$\Omega(nr)$ for hypergraph sparsification.
</p>
<p>This result is obtained by introducing two new tools. First, we give a new
proof of spectral concentration bounds for sparsifiers of graphs; it avoids
linear-algebraic methods, replacing e.g.~the usual application of the matrix
Bernstein inequality and therefore applies to the (non-linear) hypergraph
setting. To achieve the result, we design a new sequence of
hypergraph-dependent $\epsilon$-nets on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Second, we extend the weight assignment technique of Chen, Khanna and Nagda
[FOCS'20] to the spectral sparsification setting. Surprisingly, the number of
spanning trees after the weight assignment can serve as a potential function
guiding the reweighting process in the spectral setting.

    <title>Parallel and External-Memory Construction of Minimal Perfect Hash Functions with PTHash</title>

function of the form $f : S \rightarrow \{0,\ldots,n-1\}$. These functions are
important for many practical applications in computing, such as search engines,
computer networks, and databases. Several algorithms have been proposed to
build minimal perfect hash functions that: scale well to large sets, retain
fast evaluation time, and take very little space, e.g., 2 - 3 bits/key. PTHash
is one such algorithm, achieving very fast evaluation in compressed space,
typically several times faster than other techniques. In this work, we propose
a new construction algorithm for PTHash enabling: (1) multi-threading, to
either build functions more quickly or more space-efficiently, and (2)
external-memory processing to scale to inputs much larger than the available
internal memory. Only few other algorithms in the literature share these
features, despite of their big practical impact. We conduct an extensive
experimental assessment on large real-world string collections and show that,
with respect to other techniques, PTHash is competitive in construction time
and space consumption, but retains 2 - 6$\times$ better lookup time.

    <title>Covering Polygons is Even Harder</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1623024000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Abrahamsen:Mikkel.html">Mikkel Abrahamsen</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02335">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the MINIMUM CONVEX COVER (MCC) problem, we are given a simple polygon
$\mathcal P$ and an integer $k$, and the question is if there exist $k$ convex
polygons whose union is $\mathcal P$. It is known that MCC is
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard [Culberson &amp; Reckhow: Covering polygons is hard, FOCS
1988/Journal of Algorithms 1994] and in $\exists\mathbb{R}$ [O'Rourke: The
complexity of computing minimum convex covers for polygons, Allerton 1982]. We
prove that MCC is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-hard, and the problem is thus
$\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete. In other words, the problem is equivalent to
deciding whether a system of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer
coefficients has a real solution.
</p>
<p>If a cover for our constructed polygon exists, then so does a cover
consisting entirely of triangles. As a byproduct, we therefore also establish
that it is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete to decide whether $k$ triangles cover a
given polygon.
</p>
<p>The issue that it was not known if finding a minimum cover is in
$\mathsf{NP}$ has repeatedly been raised in the literature, and it was
mentioned as a "long-standing open question" already in 2001 [Eidenbenz &amp;
Widmayer: An approximation algorithm for minimum convex cover with logarithmic
performance guarantee, ESA 2001/SIAM Journal on Computing 2003]. We prove that
assuming the widespread belief that $\mathsf{NP}\neq\exists\mathbb{R}$, the
problem is not in $\mathsf{NP}$.
</p>
<p>An implication of the result is that many natural approaches to finding small
covers are bound to give suboptimal solutions in some cases, since irrational
coordinates of arbitrarily high algebraic degree can be needed for the corners
of the pieces in an optimal solution.

$k$-means to datasets that are uncertain, vague, and otherwise hard to cluster.
In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised active clustering framework, where
the learner is allowed to interact with an oracle (domain expert), asking for
the similarity between a certain set of chosen items. We study the query and
computational complexities of clustering in this framework. We prove that
having a few of such similarity queries enables one to get a polynomial-time
approximation algorithm to an otherwise conjecturally NP-hard problem. In
particular, we provide probabilistic algorithms for fuzzy clustering in this
setting that asks $O(\mathsf{poly}(k)\log n)$ similarity queries and run with
polynomial-time-complexity, where $n$ is the number of items. The fuzzy
$k$-means objective is nonconvex, with $k$-means as a special case, and is
equivalent to some other generic nonconvex problem such as non-negative matrix
factorization. The ubiquitous Lloyd-type algorithms (or,
expectation-maximization algorithm) can get stuck at a local minima. Our
results show that by making few similarity queries, the problem becomes easier
to solve. Finally, we test our algorithms over real-world datasets, showing
their effectiveness in real-world applications.

discounts utility over time). The buyer will remain in the market for a period
of time $T$, and her private value is drawn from a publicly known distribution.
What is the revenue-optimal pricing-curve (sequence of (price, time) pairs) for
the seller? Is randomization of help here? Is the revenue-optimal pricing-curve
computable in polynomial time? We answer these questions in this paper. We give
an efficient algorithm for computing the revenue-optimal pricing curve. We show
that pricing curves, that post a price at each point of time and let the buyer
pick her utility maximizing time to buy, are revenue-optimal among a much
broader class of sequential lottery mechanisms: namely, mechanisms that allow
the seller to post a menu of lotteries at each point of time cannot get any
higher revenue than pricing curves. We also show that the even broader class of
mechanisms that allow the menu of lotteries to be adaptively set, can earn
strictly higher revenue than that of pricing curves, and the revenue gap can be
as big as the support size of the buyer's value distribution.

    <title>The Algorithmic Phase Transition of Random $k$-SAT for Low Degree Polynomials</title>

clauses. We study the algorithmic task of finding a satisfying assignment of
$\Phi$. It is known that a satisfying assignment exists with high probability
at clause density $m/n &lt; 2^k \log 2 - \frac12 (\log 2 + 1) + o_k(1)$, while the
best polynomial-time algorithm known, the Fix algorithm of Coja-Oghlan, finds a
satisfying assignment at the much lower clause density $(1 - o_k(1)) 2^k \log k
/ k$. This prompts the question: is it possible to efficiently find a
satisfying assignment at higher clause densities?
</p>
<p>To understand the algorithmic threshold of random $k$-SAT, we study low
degree polynomial algorithms, which are a powerful class of algorithms
including Fix, Survey Propagation guided decimation, and paradigms such as
message passing and local graph algorithms. We show that low degree polynomial
algorithms can find a satisfying assignment at clause density $(1 - o_k(1)) 2^k
\log k / k$, matching Fix, and not at clause density $(1 + o_k(1)) \kappa^* 2^k
\log k / k$, where $\kappa^* \approx 4.911$. This shows the first sharp (up to
constant factor) computational phase transition of random $k$-SAT for a class
of algorithms. Our proof establishes and leverages a new many-way overlap gap
property tailored to random $k$-SAT.

    <title>Approximation Algorithms for Min-Distance Problems in DAGs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1623024000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Dalirrooyfard:Mina.html">Mina Dalirrooyfard</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kaufmann:Jenny.html">Jenny Kaufmann</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02120">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The min-distance between two nodes $u, v$ is defined as the minimum of the
distance from $v$ to $u$ or from $u$ to $v$, and is a natural distance metric
in DAGs. As with the standard distance problems, the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis [Impagliazzo-Paturi-Zane 2001, Calabro-Impagliazzo-Paturi 2009]
leaves little hope for computing min-distance problems faster than computing
All Pairs Shortest Paths, which can be solved in $\tilde{O}(mn)$ time. So it is
natural to resort to approximation algorithms in $\tilde{O}(mn^{1-\epsilon})$
time for some positive $\epsilon$.
</p>
<p>Abboud, Vassilevska W., and Wang [SODA 2016] first studied min-distance
problems achieving constant factor approximation algorithms on DAGs, obtaining
a $3$-approximation algorithm for min-radius on DAGs which works in
$\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ time, and showing that any $(2-\delta)$-approximation
requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time for any $\delta&gt;0$, under the Hitting Set
Conjecture. We close the gap, obtaining a $2$-approximation algorithm which
runs in $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ time. As the lower bound of Abboud et al only
works for sparse DAGs, we further show that our algorithm is conditionally
tight for dense DAGs using a reduction from Boolean matrix multiplication.
Moreover, Abboud et al obtained a linear time $2$-approximation algorithm for
min-diameter along with a lower bound stating that any
$(3/2-\delta)$-approximation algorithm for sparse DAGs requires $n^{2-o(1)}$
time under SETH. We close this gap for dense DAGs by obtaining a
$3/2$-approximation algorithm which works in $O(n^{2.350})$ time and showing
that the approximation factor is unlikely to be improved within $O(n^{\omega -
o(1)})$ time under the high dimensional Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture, where
$\omega$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.

    <title>Winning the War by (Strategically) Losing Battles: Settling the Complexity of Grundy-Values in Undirected Geography</title>

and 1993-in combinatorial game theory (CGT).
</p>
<p>We prove that the Grundy value (a.k.a. nim-value, or nimber) of Undirected
Geography is PSPACE-complete to compute. This exhibits a stark contrast with a
result from 1993 that Undirected Geography is polynomial-time solvable. By
distilling to a simple reduction, our proof further establishes a dichotomy
theorem, providing a "phase transition to intractability" in Grundy-value
computation, sharply characterized by a maximum degree of four: The Grundy
value of Undirected Geography over any degree-three graph is polynomial-time
computable, but over degree-four graphs-even when planar and bipartite-is
PSPACE-hard. Additionally, we show, for the first time, how to construct
Undirected Geography instances with Grundy value $\ast n$ and size polynomial
in n.
</p>
<p>We strengthen a result from 1981 showing that sums of tractable partisan
games are PSPACE-complete in two fundamental ways. First, since Undirected
Geography is an impartial ruleset, we extend the hardness of sums to impartial
games, a strict subset of partisan. Second, the 1981 construction is not built
from a natural ruleset, instead using a long sum of tailored short-depth game
positions. We use the sum of two Undirected Geography positions to create our
hard instances. Our result also has computational implications to
Sprague-Grundy Theory (1930s) which shows that the Grundy value of the
disjunctive sum of any two impartial games can be computed-in polynomial
time-from their Grundy values. In contrast, we prove that assuming PSPACE
$\neq$ P, there is no general polynomial-time method to summarize two
polynomial-time solvable impartial games to efficiently solve their disjunctive
sum.

Some notable examples of
items to be stacked are steel bars or steel plates in a steel yard or
containers in a container terminal or on a ship. We say that two items are
conflicting if their storage time intervals overlap in which case one of the
items needs to be rehandled if the items are stored at the same LIFO storage
location. We consider the problem of stacking items using $k$ LIFO locations
with a minimum number of conflicts between items sharing a location. We present
an extremely simple online stacking algorithm that is oblivious to the storage
time intervals and storage locations of all other items when it picks a storage
location for an item. The risk of assigning the same storage location to two
conflicting items is proved to be of the order $1/k^2$ under mild assumptions
on the distribution of the storage time intervals for the items. Intuitively,
it seems natural to pick a storage location uniformly at random in the
oblivious setting implying a risk of $1/k$ so the risk for our algorithm is
surprisingly low. Our results can also be expressed within the context of the
MAX $k$-CUT problem for circle graphs. The results indicate that circle graphs
on average have relatively big $k$-cuts compared to the total number of edges.

of iid processes, and descriptive combinatorics in the context of regular
trees.
</p>
<p>We extend the Borel determinacy technique of Marks coming from descriptive
combinatorics and adapt it to the area of distributed computing. Using this
technique, we prove deterministic distributed $\Omega(\log n)$-round lower
bounds for problems from a natural class of homomorphism problems.
Interestingly, these lower bounds seem beyond the current reach of the powerful
round elimination technique responsible for all substantial locality lower
bounds of the last years. Our key technical ingredient is a novel ID graph
technique that we expect to be of independent interest.
</p>
<p>We prove that a local problem admits a Baire measurable coloring if and only
if it admits a local algorithm with local complexity $O(\log n)$, extending the
classification of Baire measurable colorings of Bernshteyn. A key ingredient of
the proof is a new and simple characterization of local problems that can be
solved in $O(\log n)$ rounds. We complement this result by showing separations
between complexity classes from distributed computing, finitary factors, and
descriptive combinatorics. Most notably, the class of problems that allow a
distributed algorithm with sublogarithmic randomized local complexity is
incomparable with the class of problems with a Borel solution.
</p>
<p>We hope that our treatment will help to view all three perspectives as part
of a common theory of locality, in which we follow the insightful paper of
[Bernshteyn -- arXiv <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2004.04905">2004.04905</a>].

    <title>TR21-077 |  Lower Bounds on Stabilizer Rank | 

	Shir Peleg, 

	Amir Shpilka, 

	Ben Lee Volk</title>
    <summary>The stabilizer rank of a quantum state $\psi$ is the minimal $r$ such that $\left| \psi \right \rangle = \sum_{j=1}^r c_j \left|\varphi_j \right\rangle$ for $c_j \in \mathbb{C}$ and stabilizer states $\varphi_j$. The running time of several classical simulation methods for quantum circuits is determined by the stabilizer rank of the $n$-th tensor power of single-qubit magic states.

We prove a lower bound of $\Omega(n)$ on the stabilizer rank of such states, improving a previous lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ of Bravyi, Smith and Smolin [BSS16]. Further, we prove that for a sufficiently small constant $\delta$, the stabilizer rank of any state which is $\delta$-close to those states is $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound for approximate stabilizer rank.

Our techniques rely on the representation of stabilizer states as quadratic functions over affine subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$, and we use tools from analysis of boolean functions and complexity theory. The proof of the first result involves a careful analysis of directional derivatives of quadratic polynomials, whereas the proof of the second result uses Razborov-Smolensky low degree polynomial approximations and correlation bounds against the majority function.</summary>

    <title>TR21-076 |  Pseudorandom Generators, Resolution and Heavy Width | 

	Dmitry Sokolov</title>
    <summary>Following the paper of Alekhnovich, Ben-Sasson, Razborov, Wigderson \cite{ABRW04} we call a pseudorandom generator $\mathrm{PRG}\colon \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ hard for for a propositional proof system $\mathrm{P}$ if $\mathrm{P}$ cannot efficiently prove the (properly encoded) statement $b \notin \mathrm{Im}(\mathrm{PRG})$ for any string $b \in \{0, 1\}^m$.

In \cite{ABRW04} authors suggested the ``functional encoding'' of considered statement for Nisan--Wigderson generator that allows the introduction of ``local'' extension variables. These extension variables may potentially significantly increase the power of the proof system. In \cite{ABRW04} authors gave a lower bound $\exp\left[\frac{n^2}{m \Omega\left(2^{2^{\Delta}}\right)}\right]$ on the length of Resolution proofs where $\Delta$ is the degree of the dependency graph of the generator. This lower bound meets the barrier for the restriction technique.

In this paper, we introduce a ``heavy width'' measure for Resolution that allows showing a lower bound $\exp\left[\frac{n^2}{m 2^{O(\varepsilon \Delta)}}\right]$ on the length of Resolution proofs of the considered statement for the Nisan--Wigderson generator. This gives an exponential lower bound up to $\Delta := \log^{2 - \delta} n$ (the bigger degree the more extension variables we can use). It is a solution to an open problem from \cite{ABRW04}.</summary>

    <title>Statistical Inference is Not a Privacy Violation</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>On April 28, 2021, the US Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/process/disclosure-avoidance/2020-das-updates.html">released</a> a new demonstration of its differentially private Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) for the 2020 US Census. The public were given a month to submit feedback before the system is finalized.
This demonstration data and the feedback has generated a lot of discussion, including media coverage on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/993247101/for-the-u-s-census-keeping-your-data-anonymous-and-useful-is-a-tricky-balance">National Public Radio</a>, in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/2020-census-differential-privacy-ipums/2021/06/01/6c94b46e-c30d-11eb-93f5-ee9558eecf4b_story.html">the Washington Post</a>, and via <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-census-2020-technology-e701e313e841674be6396321343b7e49">the Associated Press</a>. The DAS is also the subject of an <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59728874/state-v-united-states-department-of-commerce/">ongoing lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p>The following is a response from experts on differential privacy and cryptography to the <a href="https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-05-28-census-das/Harvard-DAS-Evaluation.pdf">working paper of Kenny et al.</a> on the impact of the 2020 U.S. Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) on redistricting.</p>

<p>This paper makes a <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2016-06-14.md">common but serious mistake</a>, from which the authors wrongfully conclude the Census Bureau should not modernize its privacy-protection technology.  Not only do the results not support this conclusion, but they instead show the power of the methodology, known as differential privacy, adopted by the Bureau, precisely the opposite of the authors’ erroneous conclusions.</p>

<p>Trust is essential; once destroyed it can be nearly impossible to rebuild, and getting privacy wrong in this Census will have an impact on all future government surveys.  The Census Bureau has shown that their <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/index.html">2010 (DAS) does not survive modern privacy threats</a>, and in fact was roughly equivalent to publishing nearly three quarters of the responses.  The Census Bureau’s decision to modernize its Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) for the 2020 Decennial Census to be differentially private is the correct response to decades of theoretical and empirical work on the privacy risks inherent in releasing large numbers of statistics derived from a dataset.</p>

<p>The importance of the Census, and the reality that no technology competing with differential privacy exists for meeting their confidentiality obligations, makes it very important that the public and policy makers have accurate information. We imagine you will be reporting on this topic in the future.  Others have <a href="https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/DAS-evaluation-Kenny-response">addressed flaws</a> in the paper regarding implications for redistricting; we want to provide you with an understanding of the privacy mistake in the study.</p>

<p>To understand the flaw in the paper’s argument, consider the role of smoking in determining cancer risk.  Statistical study of medical data has taught us that smoking causes cancer.   Armed with this knowledge, if we are told that 40 year old Mr. S is a smoker, we can conclude that he has an elevated cancer risk.  The statistical inference of elevated cancer risk—made before Mr. S was born—did not violate Mr. S’s privacy. To conclude otherwise is to define science to be a privacy attack.  This is the mistake made in the paper.</p>

<p>This is basically what Kenny et al. found.</p>

<p>The authors looked at three different predictors: one built directly from (swapped) 2010 Census data and the other two built using differential privacy applied to (swapped) 2010 Census data, and evaluated all three “on approximately 5.8 million registered voters included in the North Carolina February 2021 voter file.”  What did they find?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Our analysis shows that across three main racial and ethnic groups, the predictions based on the [differential privacy based] DAS data appear to be as accurate as those based on the 2010 Census data.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes perfect sense. Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, or BISG, is a statistical method of building a predictor inferring ethnicity (or race) from name and geography.  Here, name and geography play the role of the information as to whether or not one smokes, and the prediction of ethnicity corresponds to the cancer risk prediction.  The predictor is constructed from census data on the ethnic makeup of individual census blocks and statistical information about the popularity of individual surnames within different ethnic groups.  With such a predictor, moving across the country can change the outcome, as can changing one’s name.  But a BISG prediction is not about the individual, it is about the statistical—population-level—relationship between name, geography, and ethnicity.</p>

<p>The differentially private DAS enabled learning to make statistical inferences about ethnicity from name and geography, without compromising the privacy of any Census respondent, exactly as it was intended to do.  In other words, the paper establishes fitness-for-use of the DAS data for the BISG statistical method!  Because differential privacy permits learning statistical patterns without compromising the privacy of individual members of the dataset, it should not interfere with learning the predictor, which is exactly what the authors found. Returning to our “smoking causes cancer” example, the researchers found that it was just as easy to detect this statistical pattern with a modern disclosure avoidance system in place as it was with the older, less protective system.</p>

<p>The authors’ conclusions –“ the DAS data may not provide universal privacy protection” – are simply not supported by their findings.</p>

<p>They have confused learning that smoking causes cancer—and applying this predictor to an individual smoker—with learning medical details of individual patients in the dataset. Change the input to the predictor—replace “smoker” with “non-smoker” or move across the country, for example—and the prediction changes.</p>

<p>The BISG prediction is not about the individual, it does not accompany her as she relocates from one neighborhood to another, it is a statistical relationship between name, geography, and ethnicity.  It is not a privacy compromise, it is science.</p>

    <title>TR21-075 |  Affine Extractors for Almost Logarithmic Entropy | 

	Eshan Chattopadhyay, 

	Jesse Goodman, 

	Jyun-Jie Liao</title>
    <summary>We give an explicit construction of an affine extractor (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) that works for affine sources on $n$ bits with min-entropy $k \ge~  \log n \cdot (\log \log n)^{1 + o(1)}$. This improves prior work of Li (FOCS'16) that requires  min-entropy at least $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$.
    
Our construction is based on the framework of using correlation breakers and resilient functions, a paradigm that was also used by Li. On a high level, the key sources of our improvement are based on the following new ingredients: (i) A new construction of  an affine somewhere random extractor, that we use in a crucial step instead of a linear seeded extractor (for which optimal constructions are not known) that was used by Li. (ii) A near optimal construction of a correlation breaker for linearly correlated sources. The construction of our correlation breaker takes inspiration from an exciting line of recent work that constructs two-source extractors for near logarithmic min-entropy.</summary>

    <title>What happened to self-driving cars?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In 2014, I wrote a blog post about a fake company <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/07/elfdrive.html">Elfdrive</a>.</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><p>With a near record-setting investment announced last week, the self-driving car service Elfdrive is the hottest, most valuable technology start-up on the planet. It is also one of the most controversial.</p><p>The company, which has been the target of protests across Europe this week, has been accused of a reckless attitude toward safety, of price-gouging its customers, of putting existing cabbies out of work and of evading regulation. And it has been called trivial. In The New Yorker last year, George Packer huffed that Elfdrive typified Silicon Valley’s newfound focus on “solving all the problems of being 20 years old, with cash on hand.”</p><p>It is impossible to say whether Elfdrive is worth the $117 billion its investors believe it to be; like any start-up, it could fail. But for all its flaws, Elfdrive is anything but trivial. It could well transform transportation the way Amazon has altered shopping — by using slick, user-friendly software and mountains of data to completely reshape an existing market, ultimately making many modes of urban transportation cheaper, more flexible and more widely accessible to people across the income spectrum.</p></blockquote><p>It was a spoof on Uber but now it looks more like Tesla, expect that Tesla's market value is over half a trillion, about six times larger than General Motors.</p><p>The post was really about self-driving cars which I thought at the time would be commonplace by 2020. We are mostly there but there are issues of silent communication between drivers or between a driver and a pedestrian on who goes first that's hard to duplicate for a self-driving car. There is the paradox that if we make a car that will always stop if someone runs in front of it, then some people will run in front of it.</p><p>There is also the man-bites-dog problem. Any person killed by a self-driving car will be a major news item while the person killed by a human-driven car while you've been reading this post will never be reported.</p><p>We'll get to self-driving cars eventually, it just won't be all at once. We're already have basically self-driving cars on highways and in many other roads as well. As the technology improves and people see that it's safe at some point people will say, "So why do we even need the steering wheel anymore?"</p></div>

    <title>TR21-074 |  Space characterizations of complexity measures and size-space trade-offs in propositional proof systems | 

	Theodoros Papamakarios, 

	Alexander Razborov</title>
    <summary>We identify two new big clusters of proof complexity measures equivalent up to
polynomial and $\log n$ factors. The first cluster contains, among others,
the logarithm of tree-like resolution size, regularized (that is, multiplied
by the logarithm of proof length) clause and monomial space, and clause
space, both ordinary and regularized, in regular and tree-like resolution. As
a consequence, separating clause or monomial space from the (logarithm of)
tree-like resolution size is the same as showing a strong trade-off between
clause or monomial space and proof length, and is the same as showing a
super-critical trade-off between clause space and depth. The second cluster
contains width, $\Sigma_2$ space (a generalization of clause
space to depth 2 Frege systems), both ordinary and regularized, as well as
the logarithm of tree-like size in the system $R(\log)$. As an application of some of
these simulations, we improve a known size-space trade-off for polynomial calculus with resolution. In
terms of lower bounds, we show a quadratic lower bound on tree-like
resolution size for formulas refutable in clause space $4$. We introduce on
our way yet another proof complexity measure intermediate between depth and
the logarithm of tree-like size that might be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>TR21-073 |  Lower bounds for samplers and data structures via the cell-probe separator | 

	Emanuele Viola</title>
    <summary>Suppose that a distribution $S$ can be approximately sampled by an
efficient cell-probe algorithm. It is shown to be possible to restrict
the input to the algorithm so that its output distribution is still
not too far from $S$, and at the same time many output coordinates
are almost pairwise independent.

Building on this several results are obtained, including:

- A lower bound for sampling prefix sums.

- A lower bound for sampling a variant of the predecessor problem.

- A separation between AC0 and cell-probe sampling.

- A separation between sampling with $O(q)$ and $q$ probes.

- A new proof of the Patrascu-Viola data-structure lower bound for
prefix sums, demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining data-structure
lower bounds via sampling.

- A separation between data structures making $O(q)$ and $q$ probes.

The only previous cell-probe lower bounds for sampling followed from
the AC0 lower bounds and applied to pseudorandom objects like error-correcting
and extractors, making them inadequate for the above applications.</summary>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: For a while now the problem of robustly learning a high-dimensional mixture of Gaussians has had a target on its back. The first works in algorithmic robust statistics gave provably robust algorithms for learning a single Gaussian. Since then there has been steady progress, including algorithms for robustly learning mixtures of spherical Gaussians, mixtures of Gaussians under separation conditions, and arbitrary mixtures of two Gaussians. In this talk we will discuss two recent works that essentially resolve the general problem. There are important differences in their techniques, setup, and overall quantitative guarantees, which we will discuss.</p>
<p>The talk will cover the following independent works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liu, Moitra, “Settling the Robust Learnability of Mixtures of Gaussians”</li>
<li>Bakshi, Diakonikolas, Jia, Kane, Kothari, Vempala, “Robustly Learning Mixtures of <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> Arbitrary Gaussians”</li>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Spurred by the excellent 1978 radio programme <a href="https://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/20145" target="_blank">'Better than the Stars'</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Mellor" target="_blank">D. H. Mellor</a> about <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey/" target="_blank">Frank Ramsey</a> and by the <a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/philosophybites/Cheryl_Misak_on_Frank_Ramsey_and_Ludwig_Wittgenstein.mp3" target="_blank">Philosophy Bites interview with Cheryl Misak on Frank Ramsey and Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, I started reading <a href="https://www.cherylmisak.com/" target="_blank">Cheryl Misak</a>'s <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/frank-ramsey-9780198755357?cc=is&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank">biography of Frank Ramsey</a>. (FWIW, I strongly recommend the radio programme, the podcast and the book.)<br/></p><p>The following quote from pages 169-170 of Cheryl Misak's book describes Ramsey's views on publications and research, as stated in a letter to his father Arthur:<br/></p><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">Arthur tried a different tack, suggesting that Frank was going to be in trouble for wasting all this time on analysis, rather than on his career. On 24 September, in what seems to be his last letter home before he left Vienna, Frank wrote: </div><blockquote style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">I don’t see how there can be any such inquisition into my conduct in Vienna as you suppose seem to want to guard against.... No one can suppose that you can’t research for six months without having a paper ready by the end. If everyone wrote a paper every six months the amount of trivial literature would swell beyond all bounds. Given time I shall produce a good paper. But if I hurry it will be ill written and unintelligible and unconvincing. <br/></blockquote><blockquote style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">It seems to me perfectly proper to spend a scholarship being analysed, as it is likely to make me cleverer in the future, and discoveries of importance are made by remarkable people not by remarkable diligence. </blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"> While it may not be persuasive that psychoanalysis makes one cleverer, Frank was prescient that the numbers of journal articles would eventually swell and he was right that diligence isn't enough to produce discoveries of importance.</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"> </div><div style="text-align: left;">Of course, academia has changed since those times and I do value "remarkable diligence". However, I will try to remember Ramsey's words next time someone proposes to make academic hirings and promotions conditional to having a certain number of papers or citations or whatever per year on average. <br/></div></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>WINE 2021: The 17th Conference on Web and Internet Economics </strong></p>



<p><strong>December 14-17, 2021</strong><br/><strong>Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany</strong></p>



<p/><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content"><a href="https://hpi.de/wine2021/">Overview</a></blockquote><p/>



<p>Over the past two decades, researchers in theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, operations research, and economics have joined forces to understand the interplay of incentives and computation. These issues are of particular importance in the Web and the Internet that enable the interaction of large and diverse populations. The Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE) is an interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas and results on incentives and computation arising from these various fields. WINE 2021 continues the successful tradition of the Conference on Web and Internet Economics (named Workshop on Internet &amp; Network Economics until 2013), which was held annually from 2005 to present.</p>



<p>The program will feature invited talks, tutorials, paper presentations, and a poster session. All paper submissions will be peer-reviewed and evaluated on the basis of the quality of their contribution, originality, soundness, and significance. Submissions are invited in, but not limited to, the following topics:</p>



<ul><li>Algorithmic Game Theory</li><li>Algorithmic Mechanism Design</li><li>Auction Algorithms and Analysis</li><li>Computational Advertising</li><li>Computational Aspects of Equilibria</li><li>Computational Social Choice</li><li>Learning in Markets and Mechanism Design</li><li>Learning under Strategic Behavior</li><li>Coalitions, Coordination, and Collective Action</li><li>Economic Aspects of Security and Privacy</li><li>Economic Aspects of Distributed Computing and Cryptocurrencies</li><li>Econometrics, ML, and Data Science</li><li>Behavioral Economics and Behavioral Modeling</li><li>Fairness and Trust in Games and Markets</li><li>Price Differentiation and Price Dynamics</li><li>Revenue Management</li><li>Social Networks and Network Games</li></ul>



<p><strong>Authors of the accepted papers will have a choice to attend the conference virtually.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Important Dates</strong></p>



<p>Paper submission deadline: July 12, 2021, 11:59pm Pacific Time</p>



<p>Author notification: September (exact date TBA)</p>



<p><strong>Submission Format</strong></p>



<p>Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts presenting original research on any of the research fields related to WINE 2021.</p>



<p>An extended abstract submitted to WINE 2021 should start with the title of the paper, each author’s name, affiliation and e-mail address, followed by a one-paragraph summary of the results to be presented. This should then be followed by a technical exposition of the main ideas and techniques used to achieve these results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work.</p>



<p>The extended abstract should not exceed 18 single-spaced pages (excluding references) using reasonable margins (at least one-inch margins all around) and at least 11-point font. If the authors believe that more details are essential to substantiate the claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix (with no space limit) that will be read at the discretion of the Program Committee. It is strongly recommended that submissions adhere to the specified format and length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. The above specifications are meant to provide more freedom to the authors at the time of submission. Note that accepted papers will be allocated 14 pages (including references) in the LNCS format in the proceedings (see below).</p>



<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the ARCoSS/LNCS series, and will be available for distribution at the conference. Accepted papers will be allocated 14 pages total in the LNCS format in the proceedings. Submissions are encouraged, though not required, to follow the LNCS format (Latex, Word). More information about the LNCS format can be found on the <a href="https://www.springer.com/cn/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">author instructions page of Springer-Verlag</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Best Paper Award</strong></p>



<p>The program committee will decide upon a best paper award and a best student paper award.</p>



<p><strong>Important Notice</strong></p>



<p>To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. The authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.</p>



<p>Simultaneous submission of results to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed. Results previously published or presented at another archival conference prior to WINE 2021, or published (or accepted for publication) at a journal prior to the submission deadline of WINE 2021, will not be considered. Simultaneous submission of results to a journal is allowed only if the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in WINE 2021. Papers that are accepted and appear as a one-page abstract can be subsequently submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other conference that has a published proceeding.</p>

    <title>What is a natural question? Who should decide?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><br/></p><p>(Thanks to Timothy Chow for inspiring this post.)</p><p>My survey on Hilbert's Tenth Problem(see  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07220">here</a>) is about variants of the problem. One of them is as follows: </p><p>For which degrees d and number-of-vars n, is Hilbert's tenth problem decidable? undecidable? unknown? </p><p> I wondered why there was not a website with this information. More generally, the problem didn't seem to be getting much attention. (My survey does report on the attention it has gotten.) </p><p>I got several emails telling me it was the wrong question. I didn't quite know what they meant until Timothy Chow emailed me the following eloquent explanation:</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p><i>One reason there isn't already a website of the type you envision is that from a number-theoretic (or decidability) point of view, parameterization by  degree and number of variables is not as natural as it might seem at first glance. The most fruitful lines of research have been geometric, and so geometric concepts such as smoothness, dimension, and genus are more natural than, say, degree. A nice survey by a number theorist is the book Rational Points on Varieties by Bjorn Poonen. Much of it is highly technical; however, reading the preface is very enlightening. Roughly speaking, the current state of the art is that there is really only one known way to prove that a system of Diophantine equations has no rational solution.</i></p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>AGAINST THE NUMBER THEORISTS VIEWPOINT:</p><p>1) ALICE: Why are you looking for your keys under the lamppost instead of where you dropped them?</p><p>   BOB: The light is better here.</p><p>2) I can imagine the following conversation:</p><p>BILL: I want to know about what happens with degree 3, and number of variables 3.</p><p>MATHPERSON: That's the wrong question you moron. The real question is what happens for fixed length of cohomology subchains.</p><p>BILL: Why is that more natural?</p><p>MATHPERSON: Because that is what we can solve. And besides, I've had 10 papers on it.</p><p><br/></p><p>FOR THE NUMBER THEORISTS VIEWPOINT</p><p>1) They are working on really hard problems so it is natural to gravitate towards those that can be solved.</p><p>2) I suspect that the math that comes out of studying classes of equations based on smoothness, dimension, genus is more interesting than what comes out of degree and number of vars. Or at least it has been so far. </p><p>META QUESTION</p><p>Who gets to decide what problems are natural?</p><p>People outside the field (me in this case) are asking the kind of questions that a layperson would ask and there is some merit to that.</p><p>People inside the field KNOW STUFF and hence their opinion of what's interesting to study has some merit. But they can also mistake `I cannot solve X' for `X is not interesting'</p><div><br/></div></div>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><span class="has-inline-color" style="color: #a30042;">Every planar graph has acyclic colouring with five colours.</span> </strong></p>



<p>This was proved by Borodin in 1976.</p>



<p>Borodin made the following stronger conjecture. Recall that a graph is <img alt="r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-degenerate if every  subgraph has a vertex of degree at most <img alt="r" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </p>

<p>Let me mention an intermediate conjecture in-between Grunbaum’s conjecture and Borodin’s </p>

<p>Grunbaum’s 1973 paper <a href="https://idp.springer.com/authorize/casa?redirect_uri=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02764716&amp;casa_token=vnWD-T_S73sAAAAA:mUenckyg9cyx5mrJI0hGdRqZ5WznXX-keyu4jYW61z-CkI1pslMA4w7SheVILEa1g1yHmjmFrP63EoqPODY">Acyclic<strong> </strong>colorings of planar graphs‏</a> is a very imaginative and highly cited paper.

    <title>A few lessons from the history of multiparty computation</title>
    <summary>As part of my Ph.D. qualifying exam, I gave a survey talk on some of the recent progress in practical multi-party computation (MPC). After the talk, Omer Reingold asked me why so much progress on MPC happened in the last decade or so, given that the main theoretical groundwork for multiparty computation was laid out in the 1980s.  Omer’s question got me interested, so I looked at some MPC papers from over the years and talked to a few people who have been working on MPC for some time now. In this post, I want to share some of what I’ve learned about the history of the progress of MPC, a few answers to Omer’s question, and potentially a few takeaways on progress in science more broadly.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As part of my Ph.D. qualifying exam, I gave a survey talk on some of the recent progress in practical multi-party computation (MPC).

In this post, I want to share some of what I’ve learned about the history of the progress of MPC, a few answers to Omer’s question, and potentially a few takeaways on progress in science more broadly.</p>



<p>To give a bit of background, MPC is one of the most fundamental problems in cryptography. In particular, MPC protocols allow a set of parties, each of which holds its private input, to compute a joint function over their inputs, in a way that protects the confidentiality and integrity of the computation from an adversary that controls a subset of the parties and the communication channels. Defining this precisely requires a lot of care, yet for now, you can think of an MPC protocol as being secure, if the adversary can only cause as much damage as it can in an “ideal world” in which the computation is performed with the aid of a trusted incorruptible party. Intuitively, in such an ideal world, the adversary cannot do much more than choose its inputs, modify its output, or choose not to participate in the computation at all. </p>



<p>In the 1980s, a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4568207">sequence</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/28395.28420">of</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62213">works</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62214">initiated</a> the study of multiparty computation and established very powerful and general results, showing the feasibility of constructing protocols for securely computing any multi-party functionality in a variety of settings. Those results were mostly theoretical. In contrast, the last 15 years saw a growing interest in MPC from a more practical perspective. To put this rising interest in context, consider the following two graphs (data for the graphs is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IzfKDRqv6C9hSeD9TyosvCl9fknN2V3Ja4tQjy54y0A/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2245" height="372" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/comptime.png?w=620" width="620"/></figure></div>



<p>This graph shows the time of a two-party secure computation of the AES block cipher over the years. That is the time it takes to evaluate AES(k,x), where one party holds a 128-bit key k to the block cipher, the other party holds a 256-bit data block x, and the output is 256-bit long. The measurements are from the original papers. There are different variants of this “benchmark”, in terms of the number of parties (2PC/MPC), the number of corrupted parties (honest/dishonest majority), precise security model (semi-honest/fully malicious), hardware, network (LAN/WAN), and cost model (single/batch execution), but, for concreteness, the graph only includes results in the batch-evaluation setting in the fully malicious two-party setting. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img height="375" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lfa7-L5D3d5U8ZCHbAmUoqRH-RVaUmpFfSiFhBl7yF38ieoUmdo-LL0xH-gzXEaPauRXkCUmOYWDovfJvE792a0ikVxojM6g4P7EFD-mg4A2XbvzJWAslBug8UE6W4CnRhtIt4el" width="624"/></p>



<p>The second graph shows the number of papers on two-party computation, over the years. This is not a very well-defined characterization, but for simplicity, I looked at all the papers referenced from the relevant chapters in the <a href="https://securecomputation.org/">book on MPC</a> by Evans, Kolesnikov, and Rosulek. Admittedly, these are not all the papers in the area, there might be valuable indirect contributions that are missing, and, more importantly, the number of papers is a bit of a superficial metric. Yet, even with these caveats, I think this is helpful to get a general picture. On top of the flurry of academic research, MPC has also been thriving in the industry, with companies like <a href="https://www.curv.co/">Curv</a>, <a href="https://partisia.com/">Partisia</a>, <a href="https://sharemind.cyber.ee/">Sharemind</a>, <a href="https://www.unboundsecurity.com/">Unbound</a>, and others building MPC-based products and services.</p>



<p>The first graph shows quite impressive progress. In less than a decade, the time to securely compute AES in the two-party setting decreased by more than 60,000x, from more than 10 minutes to less than 10 milliseconds. (For reference, in the same period, CPU speeds increased <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-975+%40+3.33GHz&amp;id=841">roughly</a> <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-7740X+%40+4.30GHz&amp;id=3041">twofold</a>, and typical local-area network speeds increased from 1GB/S to 10GB/S.) The second graph illustrates the increase in the volume of research, which has enabled this progress. This includes advances such as <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/100216.100287">various</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/336992.337028">increasingly</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-70583-3_40">efficient</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-46803-6_8">garbling</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3133956.3134053">techniques</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11745853_30">more</a> <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.140.2627&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">efficient</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72540-4_4">cut</a>–<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20465-4_22">and</a>–<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19571-6_20">choose</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40084-1_3">techniques</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-00457-5_22">for</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2508859.2516698">malicious security</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20465-4_11">protocols</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32009-5_38">based on</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32009-5_40">information-theoretic</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978357">message-authentication</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78372-7_6">codes</a>, <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf">homomorphic</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2090236.2090262">encryption</a>, and many others. (See the EKR book for an overview of these techniques and more references.) The second graph also clearly shows the inflection point that happened about 15 years ago. This inflection point illustrates the premise of the question that has triggered this blog post.</p>



<p>I use the term inflection point, since progress in MPC never really stopped between the late 80s and the mid-2000s, and there was a lot of research in the interim period. For example, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/187.pdf">oblivious</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1008908.1008920">transfer</a>–one of the fundamental primitives used <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3812.3818">to</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-47721-7_17.pdf">build</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62215">MPC</a>–<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44750-4_9">received</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/237814.237996">a</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00208002">lot</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0054139">of</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/301250.301312">attention</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44987-6_8">and</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/365411.365502">saw</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45146-4_9">significant</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-40061-5_27">progress</a>.

Other works developed special-purpose secure computation protocols for concrete applications such as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/502223">secure auctions</a> and  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/293347.293350">private information retrieval</a>. Many of the techniques and ideas in these works were instrumental for the more recent progress.</p>



<p>Having said that, there still seems to have been a dip in the attention devoted to MPC for a certain period. One explanation that I’ve found interesting is that the powerful feasibility results from the early days made the problem seem “solved” from a theoretical point of view. As a result, interest in MPC within the theory community decreased. It took time before the interest ramped up again, this time more within the more-practically oriented crypto community. (Interestingly, since then, MPC found renewed interest in the theoretical cryptography community as well.)</p>



<p>One work that, to me, is a key point in the transition of MPC from theory to practice is the 2004 <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/13th-usenix-security-symposium/fairplay%E2%80%94-secure-two-party-computation-system">Fairplay paper</a>. This was the first full-fledged system that implemented generic secure function evaluation. I believe that, together with other early implementations of MPC-based systems (such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03549-4_20">the system</a> developed for the Danish sugar-beet auction and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-88313-5_13">Sharemind system</a>), it played a pivotal role in accelerating practical research. I view it as a lesson on the value of “first systems”: they help to identify bottlenecks and discover new concerns, which are hard to predict without building an actual system. Moreover, such systems put “theory problems” on the radar of practitioners and demonstrate which ideas are closer to being practical.  In some sense, a system is an evidence that “the constants in the big-O have been worked out…and they are not astronomical.” Furthermore, when code is made public, follow-up works can build upon an initial system and improve on it more rapidly. A first system can mark the transition of an idea from pure theory to practice. It’s still fair to ask what determines the timing of the appearance of such a first system. One answer is that it often takes the right type of collaboration of researchers from different research communities, as seems to have been the case with “Fairplay”. </p>



<p>I think that external factors also played a role in the timing of events. Specifically, the growth of the Internet and the demand for security on the Internet stimulated a lot of interest and progress in applied cryptography. The late 1990s saw large-scale adoption of public-key cryptography with the successful development and deployment of SSL. More complex Internet applications began to appear later, including those that are inherently security-sensitive, like e-commerce. These applications stimulated interest in more advanced cryptographic tools, MPC being one of them. Indeed, MPC papers from that period discuss new Internet-driven applications as part of their motivation. </p>



<p>A final factor that I want to mention ties back to the first graph above. The fact that many works demonstrate their performance by measuring AES evaluation is, to me, an example of the value of standardized benchmarks. Such benchmarks help to evaluate new techniques and ideas within a certain area and can help progress on a particular dimension, partly because of the competitive element they add. As with any measurement, there is a risk of overfitting to the benchmark, rather than focusing on the true goal, but I think they are very helpful overall.</p>



<p>I am sure there are other valuable lessons to be learned from this case study. Moreover, I am quite certain that folks with more experience in the area have a much better perspective on the history of these developments than I do. I will be very happy to hear other perspectives!</p>

are researchers in the area of voting security. Some have worked in this area for decades, others for years, and some are new to the area. But they all signed a letter about election security—right after the last presidential election. The body of <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=118718">the letter</a> is also below.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we might look into the main paradox surrounding voting security.<br/>
<span id="more-18791"/></p>
<p>
Peter G. Neumann and Rebecca Mercuri just published a <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/6/252836-the-risks-of-election-believability-or-lack-thereof/fulltext">paper</a> in the CACM on voting security. It is titled <i>The Risks of Election Believability (or Lack Thereof)</i>. </p>
<p>They say: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Trustworthiness in elections is inherently a total-system problem <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
So let’s look at election security.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Paradox </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
<i>The people who cast the votes don’t decide an election, the people who count the votes do—Joseph Stalin</i></p>
<p>
I am reluctant in citing Stalin. But I believe that he hit the mark. The key in any election, in the US or elsewhere, is how and by whom the votes are counted.  </p>
<p>
The issue with the letter, with the recent paper, and more is that the researchers seem to be caught in the middle between two points of view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
There is no evidence of voter fraud in the last presidential election. None. Zero. <p/>
</li><li>
There is no proof of voting security in the last presidential election. None. Zero.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is the problem. We would like to believe that voting is fair and secure. We would like to believe that our election—especially for president—is fair and correct. But we really have no proof that this is true. We are left with desire to make elections safer, but take the position that there is no issue with them. </p>
<p>
Good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Letter </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is the letter. I think they miss saying things as bluntly as Stalin does. But they do say essentially the same.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We are specialists in election security, having studied the security of voting machines, voting systems, and technology used for government elections for decades.</em></p><em>
<p>
We and other scientists have warned for many years that there are security weaknesses in voting systems and have advocated that election systems be better secured against malicious attack. As the National Academies recently concluded, “There is no realistic mechanism to fully secure vote casting and tabulation computer systems from cyber threats.” However, notwithstanding these serious concerns, we have never claimed that technical vulnerabilities have actually been exploited to alter the outcome of any US election.</p>
<p>
Anyone asserting that a US election was “rigged” is making an extraordinary claim, one that must be supported by persuasive and verifiable evidence. Merely citing the existence of technical flaws does not establish that an attack occurred, much less that it altered an election outcome. It is simply speculation.</p>
<p>
The presence of security weaknesses in election infrastructure does not by itself tell us that any election has actually been compromised. Technical, physical, and procedural safeguards complicate the task of maliciously exploiting election systems, as does monitoring of likely adversaries by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Altering an election outcome involves more than simply the existence of a technical vulnerability.</p>
<p>
We are aware of alarming assertions being made that the 2020 election was “rigged” by exploiting technical vulnerabilities. However, in every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent. To our collective knowledge, no credible evidence has been put forth that supports a conclusion that the 2020 election outcome in any state has been altered through technical compromise.</p>
</em><p><em>
That said, it is imperative that the US continue working to bolster the security of elections against sophisticated adversaries. At a minimum, all states should employ election security practices and mechanisms recommended by experts to increase assurance in election outcomes, such as post-election risk-limiting audits. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The letter is well written, but <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> They say in the letter: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> However, notwithstanding these serious concerns, we have never claimed that technical vulnerabilities have actually been exploited to alter the outcome of any US election. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems to be a problem. How do you get people to <i>look both ways when crossing the street</i>, when you have also basically asserted: “No one has ever been hit by a car when crossing the street.”</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/05/26/the-voting-paradox/cs/" rel="attachment wp-att-18795"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18795" height="183" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cs.png?resize=276%2C183&amp;ssl=1" width="276"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We believe that election security is a real issue. Perhaps our single point is: Even if we do not believe that any fraud happen in the past, we must agree to make the voting process secure. We must use all our insights to make elections not only fair, but believed to be fair.</p>
<p>
Look both ways. </p>
<p>
Ken notes that “Trust but verify” was first the Russian proverb <i>Doveryay no proveryay</i>, but that its origins are <a href="https://www.rbth.com/lifestyle/330521-reagan-trust-but-verify-chernobyl">unclear</a> even to Russians.  He adds that besides <i>how</i> and <i>by whom</i> there is also the issue of <i>when</i> votes are counted.  The warnings he gave in our election-eve <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/11/03/the-election-night-time-warp/">post</a> were reflected in <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/false-claim-about-bidens-win-probability/">claims</a> made in the early December Texas attorney general filing.</p></font></font></div>

    <title>Course on Ethics and Accountability in Computer Science</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>About one year ago, I became aware of the course "Ethics and Accountability in Computer Science" designed and taught by <a href="https://riceacademy.rice.edu/junior-fellows/dr-rodrigo-ferreira" target="_blank">Rodrigo Ferreira</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/" target="_blank">Moshe Y. Vardi</a> at Rice University. The goals and high-level structure of the course, as well as its context, are described in an informative and thoughtful <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/papers/sigcse21.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> by Moshe and Rodrigo that appears in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3408877" target="_blank">Proceedings of the  52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE ’21)</a>, which I strongly recommend. You can also read a <a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/tej/content/tej_2021_0999_3_31_87" target="_blank">journal paper</a> reporting on one of their course assignments, which was designed to make students focus on practising <a href="https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb" target="_blank">"deep attention"</a> in the sense of artist and academic <a href="https://www.jennyodell.com/" target="_blank">Jenny Odell</a>.</p><p>I was smitten by the underlying tenet for their course, namely that "social justice is  the single  most important issue  confronting computer science  students today." That tenet is also very much in line with a reflection on the impact that digital technology has on social justice that the <a href="https://www.gssi.it/institute/organization" target="_blank">Scientific Advisory Board of the Gran Sasso Science Institute</a> asked the Computer Science group at that institute to undertake. Therefore, after having invited Rodrigo to deliver a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ficetcs.ru.is%2Fwebinars%2Fdeep_ethics.mp4&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9ux4zX7PThxWzwoNa_yyZNa-ILA" target="_blank">webinar on the course</a> at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/gssi.it/csgssi/seminars-and-events/joint-ice-tcs-csgssi-virtual-seminar" target="_blank">ICE-TCS+GSSI webinar series</a>, I decided that, as an experiment, I would offer a version of the Rice University course to master students in computer science, language technology and software engineering at Reykjavik University during our spring semester 2021. </p><p>Mine was a foolhardy decision for a variety of reasons. However, I have always believed that computer scientists should strive to be the 21st century Renaissance men and women, and bridge the gap between C. P. Snow's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures" target="_blank">"two cultures"</a>. Indeed, to quote <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/~eal/" target="_blank">Edward A. Lee</a> freely, to my mind technologists ought to be amongst the greatest humanists of our age. Despite my other commitments, offering a version of the Ferreira-Vardi course at Reykjavik University felt like the right thing to do at this time. </p><p>I taught the course over twelve weeks to a varied group of eight students, in cooperation with <a href="http://claudiopedica.com/" target="_blank">Claudio Pedica</a>. Thanks to the constant support I received from Rodrigo Ferreira, I lived to tell the tale and I hope that I managed to do some justice to the truly excellent course that Moshe and Rodrigo put together. Having a dream team of students with a variety of cultural backgrounds made the course extremely interesting and a learning experience for me. I had to refresh my memory of the philosophy I studied at high school in Italy in a previous life, learn some modern moral philosophy I had not met at school (such as the work by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anscombe/" target="_blank">Elisabeth Anscombe</a> and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philippa-foot/" target="_blank">Philippa Foot</a>, amongst others), read a substantial amount of new material (some of it fresh off the press as the course was unfolding) and broaden my horizons. I could not have asked for a better intellectual experience and the students in the course, from Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland and the Netherlands taught me well, kept me on my toes and stimulated me to keep reading material related to ethics even now that the course is over. <br/></p><p>Teaching the course reinforced my belief that a course on ethics and on the impact that our field has on social justice should be required for all students in computer science. If you plan to run such a course, I strongly recommend that you consider the Ferreira-Vardi course as a blueprint. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

      <subtitle>Papers I find interesting---mostly, but not solely, in Process Algebra---, and some fun stuff in Mathematics and Computer Science at large and on general issues related to research, teaching and academic life.</subtitle>
