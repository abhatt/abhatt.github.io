    <title>TR22-053 |  On the Complexity of Algebraic Numbers, and the Bit-Complexity of Straight-Line Programs | 

	Eric Allender, 

	Nikhil Balaji,

	Rameshwar Pratap</title>
    <summary>We investigate the complexity of languages that correspond to algebraic real numbers, and we present improved upper bounds on the complexity of these languages.  Our key technical contribution is the presentation of improved uniform TC^0 circuits
for division, matrix powering, and related problems, where the improvement is in terms of "majority depth" (initially studied by Maciel and Therien). As a corollary, we obtain improved bounds on the complexity of certain problems involving arithmetic circuits, which are known to lie in the counting hierarchy, and we answer a question posed by Yap.</summary>

<p>Last week, Takashi Yamakawa and Mark Zhandry posted a preprint to the arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">“Verifiable Quantum Advantage without Structure,”</a> that represents some of the most exciting progress in quantum complexity theory in years.  I wish I’d thought of it.  tl;dr they show that relative to a random oracle (!), there’s an NP search problem that quantum computers can solve exponentially faster than classical ones.  And yet this is 100% consistent with the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture!</p>

<p>A student brought my attention to <a href="https://deduckproject.github.io/quantle/">Quantle</a>, a variant of Wordle where you need to guess a true equation involving 1-qubit quantum states and unitary transformations.  It’s really well-done!  Possibly the best quantum game I’ve seen.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-has-demonstrated-the-underlying-physics-required-to-create-a-new-kind-of-qubit/">announced on the web</a> that it had achieved an experimental breakthrough in topological quantum computing: not <em>quite</em> the creation of a topological qubit, but some of the underlying physics required for that.  This followed their needing to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00612-z">retract</a> their previous claim of such a breakthrough, due to the criticisms of Sergey Frolov and others.  One imagines that they would’ve taken far greater care this time around.  Unfortunately, a research paper doesn’t seem to be available yet.  Anyone with further details is welcome to chime in.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Woohoo!  Maximum flow, maximum bipartite matching, matrix scaling, and isotonic regression on posets (among many others)—all algorithmic problems that I was familiar with way back in the 1990s—are now solvable in nearly-linear time, thanks to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00671">breakthrough by Chen et al.</a>!  Many undergraduate algorithms courses will need to be updated.</p>

quantum algorithm designed for combinatorial optimization. We analyze its
expected performance and prove concentration properties at any constant level
(number of layers) on ensembles of random combinatorial optimization problems
in the infinite size limit. These ensembles include mixed spin models and
Max-$q$-XORSAT on sparse random hypergraphs. To enable our analysis, we prove a
generalization of the multinomial theorem which is a technical result of
independent interest. We then show that the performance of the QAOA at constant
levels for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically the ones for
Max-$q$-XORSAT on random sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi hypergraphs and every
large-girth regular hypergraph. Through this correspondence, we establish that
the average-case value produced by the QAOA at constant levels is bounded away
from optimality for pure $q$-spin models when $q\ge 4$ is even. This limitation
gives a hardness of approximation result for quantum algorithms in a new regime
where the whole graph is seen.

Vixie</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10250">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The Gromov$\unicode{x2013}$Hausdorff distance measures the difference in
shape between compact metric spaces. While even approximating the distance up
to any practical factor poses an NP-hard problem, its relaxations have proven
useful for the problems in geometric data analysis, including on point clouds,
manifolds, and graphs. We investigate the modified
Gromov$\unicode{x2013}$Hausdorff distance, a relaxation of the standard
distance that retains many of its theoretical properties, which includes their
topological equivalence on a rich set of families of metric spaces. We show
that the two distances are Lipschitz-equivalent on any family of metric spaces
of uniformly bounded size, but that the equivalence does not hold in general,
not even when the distances are restricted to ultrametric spaces. We
additionally prove that the standard and the modified
Gromov$\unicode{x2013}$Hausdorff distances are either equal or within a factor
of 2 from each other when taken to a regular simplex, which connects the
relaxation to some well-known problems in discrete geometry.

devices have provided us great opportunities to collect and mine human mobility
trajectories. In this work, we focus on passively collected trajectories, which
are sequences of time-stamped locations that mobile entities visit. To analyse
such trajectories, a crucial part is a measure of similarity between two
trajectories. We propose the time-window Frechet distance, which enforces the
maximum temporal separation between points of two trajectories that can be
paired in the calculation of the Frechet distance, and the metric-based edit
distance which incorporates the underlying metric in the computation of the
insertion and deletion costs. Using these measures, we can cluster trajectories
to infer group motion patterns. We look at the $k$-gather problem which
requires each cluster to have at least $k$ trajectories. We prove that k-gather
remains NP-hard under edit distance, metric-based edit distance and Jaccard
distance. Finally, we improve over previous results on discrete Frechet
distance and show that there is no strongly sub-quadratic time with
approximation factor less than $1.61$ in two dimensional setting unless SETH
fails.

forbidden pairs. Specifically, given a stable matching $M_1$, a set $Q$ of
forced pairs, and a set $P$ of forbidden pairs, we want to find a stable
matching that includes all pairs from $Q$, no pair from $P$, and that is as
close as possible to $M_1$. We study this problem in four classical stable
matching settings: Stable Roommates (with Ties) and Stable Marriage (with
Ties). As our main contribution, we develop an algorithmic technique to
"propagate" changes through a stable matching. This technique is at the core of
our polynomial-time algorithm for adapting Stable Roommates matchings to forced
pairs. In contrast to this, we show that the same problem for forbidden pairs
is NP-hard. However, our propagation technique allows for a fixed-parameter
tractable algorithm with respect to the number of forbidden pairs when both
forced and forbidden pairs are present. Moreover, we establish strong
intractability results when preferences contain ties.

graph $G$. Motifs capture higher order organizational structure of $G$ beyond
edge relationships, and, therefore, have found wide applications such as in
graph clustering, community detection, and analysis of biological and physical
networks to name a few. In these applications, the cut structure of motifs
plays a crucial role as vertices are partitioned into clusters by cuts whose
conductance is based on the number of instances of a particular motif, as
opposed to just the number of edges, crossing the cuts.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce the concept of a motif cut sparsifier. We show
that one can compute in polynomial time a sparse weighted subgraph $G'$ with
only $\widetilde{O}(n/\epsilon^2)$ edges such that for every cut, the weighted
number of copies of $M$ crossing the cut in $G'$ is within a $1+\epsilon$
factor of the number of copies of $M$ crossing the cut in $G$, for every
constant size motif $M$.
</p>
<p>Our work carefully combines the viewpoints of both graph sparsification and
hypergraph sparsification. We sample edges which requires us to extend and
strengthen the concept of cut sparsifiers introduced in the seminal work of to
the motif setting. We adapt the importance sampling framework through the
viewpoint of hypergraph sparsification by deriving the edge sampling
probabilities from the strong connectivity values of a hypergraph whose
hyperedges represent motif instances. Finally, an iterative sparsification
primitive inspired by both viewpoints is used to reduce the number of edges in
$G$ to nearly linear.

<p>In addition, we present a strong lower bound ruling out a similar result for
sparsification with respect to induced occurrences of motifs.

    <title>Faster Approximate Covering of Subcurves under the Fr\'echet Distance</title>

problem, where the start and endpoints of trajectory patterns within the
collected trajectory data are not known in advance. We study this problem in
the form of a set cover problem for a given polygonal curve: find the smallest
number $k$ of representative curves such that any point on the input curve is
contained in a subcurve that has Fr\'echet distance at most a given $\Delta$ to
a representative curve. We focus on the case where the representative curves
are line segments and approach this NP-hard problem with classical techniques
from the area of geometric set cover: we use a variant of the multiplicative
weights update method which was first suggested by Br\"onniman and Goodrich for
set cover instances with small VC-dimension. We obtain a
bicriteria-approximation algorithm that computes a set of $O(k\log(k))$ line
segments that cover a given polygonal curve of $n$ vertices under Fr\'echet
distance at most $O(\Delta)$. We show that the algorithm runs in
$\widetilde{O}(k^2 n + k n^3)$ time in expectation and uses $ \widetilde{O}(k n
+ n^3)$ space. For two dimensional input curves that are $c$-packed, we bound
the expected running time by $\widetilde{O}(k^2 c^2 n)$ and the space by $
\widetilde{O}(kn + c^2 n)$. In $\mathbb{R}^d$ the dependency on $n$ instead is
quadratic. In addition, we present a variant of the algorithm that uses
implicit weight updates on the candidate set and thereby achieves near-linear
running time in $n$ without any assumptions on the input curve, while keeping
the same approximation bounds. This comes at the expense of a small
(polylogarithmic) dependency on the relative arclength.

    <title>Memory Bounds for the Experts Problem</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1650672000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Vaidehi Srinivas, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Woodruff:David_P=.html">David P. Woodruff</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/x/Xu:Ziyu.html">Ziyu Xu</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/z/Zhou:Samson.html">Samson Zhou</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.09837">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Online learning with expert advice is a fundamental problem of sequential
prediction. In this problem, the algorithm has access to a set of $n$ "experts"
who make predictions on each day. The goal on each day is to process these
predictions, and make a prediction with the minimum cost. After making a
prediction, the algorithm sees the actual outcome on that day, updates its
state, and then moves on to the next day. An algorithm is judged by how well it
does compared to the best expert in the set.
</p>
<p>The classical algorithm for this problem is the multiplicative weights
algorithm. However, every application, to our knowledge, relies on storing
weights for every expert, and uses $\Omega(n)$ memory. There is little work on
understanding the memory required to solve the online learning with expert
advice problem, or run standard sequential prediction algorithms, in natural
streaming models, which is especially important when the number of experts, as
well as the number of days on which the experts make predictions, is large.
</p>
<p>We initiate the study of the learning with expert advice problem in the
streaming setting, and show lower and upper bounds. Our lower bound for i.i.d.,
random order, and adversarial order streams uses a reduction to a custom-built
problem using a novel masking technique, to show a smooth trade-off for regret
versus memory. Our upper bounds show novel ways to run standard sequential
prediction algorithms in rounds on small "pools" of experts, thus reducing the
necessary memory. For random-order streams, we show that our upper bound is
tight up to low order terms. We hope that these results and techniques will
have broad applications in online learning, and can inspire algorithms based on
standard sequential prediction techniques, like multiplicative weights, for a
wide range of other problems in the memory-constrained setting.

<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/db/" rel="attachment wp-att-19928"><img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-19928" height="165" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/db.jpg?resize=220%2C165&amp;ssl=1" width="220"/></a></p>
<p>
Dietrich Braess is a professor of mathematics at Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany.  He is famous for the discovery of a paradox. When he was doing research on traffic modeling in 1968, he discovered that the flow in a road network could be <i>hindered</i> by <i>adding</i> a new road.</p>
<p>
Today we note a connection between him and the new ACM Athena Award winner, Éva Tardos, whom we congratulate.</p>
<p>
The paradox has a paradox riding on it.  The original is about the game theory of elective actions by drivers individually trying to optimize their routes. Yet it shows up in purely physical dynamics.  Consider the following <a href="http://www.davros.org/science/roadparadox.html">network</a> of springs and strings:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/par/" rel="attachment wp-att-19929"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19929" height="192" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/par.png?resize=100%2C192&amp;ssl=1" width="100"/></a></p>
<p>
Quoting Clive Feathers, who <a href="http://www.davros.org/">studies</a> Britain’s railways and the London Underground:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If all the strings are taut, then each of them will be carrying one-third of the weight of the block. So if the purple string is cut, the remaining strings will carry more of the weight and the block will drop down a bit as the springs take up the load, right?</em></p><em>
<p>
Wrong!</p>
</em><p><em>
As shown, each string has a tension of 4N, so the springs will each be under a tension of 8N and will stretch accordingly. Now, when the purple string is cut the remaining strings have a tension of 6N, and so does each spring. So there is less tension in the springs, and they will contract accordingly, making the block rise. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Braess Paradox </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Who cares about springs and strings? Indeed. </p>
<p>
The point is that this paradox arises in problems we study in CS. It is named now as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess's_paradox">Braess’s Paradox</a>. Springs and strings can be changed to edges. Edges in turn relate to networks of many kinds; the following figure comes from a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aad490">paper</a> on power grids:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/smile/" rel="attachment wp-att-19931"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19931" height="282" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/smile.jpg?resize=500%2C282&amp;ssl=1" width="500"/></a></p>
<p>
The original paradox is that adding one or more roads to a road network can slow down overall traffic flow through it. The new road initially makes its use locally optimal for everyone until a saturation point <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is reached. The limit on choices before and after using the new road, however, also makes the <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> usage increase the cost of the previously optimal strategies. This evolves a worse configuration for everyone that is not locally improvable. </p>
<p>
The flip side is that a clog-prone network can sometimes be improved by removing certain parts of it. This paradox has been used to explain instances of improved traffic flow when existing major roads are closed. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws12/ct/Braess-paradox.pdf">In Stuttgart, Germany</a> after investments into the road network in 1969, the traffic situation did not improve until a section of newly-built road was closed for traffic again.<p/>
<p/></li><li>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/25/health/what-if-they-closed-42d-street-and-nobody-noticed.html">ON Earth Day</a> this year (1990), New York City’s Transportation Commissioner decided to close 42d Street, which as every New Yorker knows is always congested. “Many predicted it would be doomsday,” said the Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio. “You didn’t need to be a rocket scientist or have a sophisticated computer queuing model to see that this could have been a major problem.”<p/>
<p>
But to everyone’s surprise, Earth Day generated no historic traffic jam. Traffic flow actually improved when 42d Street was closed.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Today’s News and the Paradox </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This started as a post on Éva Tardos, who is a professor at Cornell University. She just was named the 2022-2023 ACM <a href="https://awards.acm.org/athena">Athena Lecturer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This award celebrates women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to Computer Science. Each year ACM honors a preeminent woman computer scientist as the Athena Lecturer. The recipient gives an invited talk at a major ACM conference of her choice. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
What is the connection between Tardos as Athena Lecturer and the Braess Paradox? Indeed, the citation notes her contributions to algorithmic game theory. These are game-theory situations in her purview.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/et-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-19933"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19933" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/et.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
She has many papers that bound approximations to optimal solutions. Often the answers are likely to be hard to solve exactly—they are NP-complete for example. But she has some wonderful papers that study questions where paradoxes apply regardless of whether <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is true.</p>
<p>
One is the <a href="http://www.timroughgarden.org/papers/mcbp.pdf">paper</a> by Henry Lin, Tim Roughgarden, Eva Tardos, and Asher Walkover, and is titled, “Stronger Bounds On Braess’s Paradox And The Maximum Latency Of Selfish Routing.” It addresses the flip-side paradox: how much can the performance of a network be improved by removing one edge? One might expect that removing an edge might be less likely to improve the smallest networks, as well as less impactful on larger networks, so that the highest improvement would come in some mid-size example. In fact, they show that Braess’s original example of four nodes and five edges has the highest improvement. </p>
<p>
They also show that the problem of finding the maximum improvement possible within a sub-network of a large network is <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-hard to approximate, even sub-exponentially. We wonder how this connects to an earlier <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~fan/wp/braess_rsa.pdf">paper</a> by Fan Chung, Stephen Young, and Wenbo Zhao showing that expander graphs tend to have many subgraphs exhibiting the Braess paradox. This is surprising because expanders by-and-large promote free network flows.</p>
<p/><p>
We add that Tardos is just the third Athena Lecturer from the theory area since the first award in 2006: Shafi Goldwasser in 2008 and Nancy Lynch in 2012. Congrats, Éva. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I did not know about the Braess Paradox before reading about her award; Ken thinks he saw it a decade or so ago. Previously my favorite result of Tardos was in the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eva/Gap.Between.Monotone.NonMonotone.Circuit.Complexity.is.Exponential.pdf">paper</a>, “The Gap Between Monotone And Non-Monotone Circuit Complexity Is Exponential.” Now not so clear.</p>
<p>
What is your favorite of her results?</p>

<p><i>
“Missingness”, or the absence of features from an input, is a concept that is fundamental to many model debugging tools. In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">latest paper</a>, we examine the challenges of implementing missingness in computer vision. In particular, we demonstrate how current approximations of missingness introduce biases into the debugging process of computer vision models. We then show how a natural implementation of missingness based on VITs can mitigate these biases and lead to more reliable model debugging.
</i></p>

<p>Deep learning models can learn powerful features. However, these learned features can be unintuitive or spurious. Indeed, recent studies have pointed out that ML models often leverage unexpected—and, in fact, undesirable—associations. These include image pathology detection models that rely on <a href="https://cerre.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai_explainability_whitepaper_google.pdf">pen marks made by radiologist</a> and image classifiers that focus too much on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">backgrounds</a> or on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231">texture</a>. Such prediction mechanisms can cause models to fail in downstream tasks or new environments.</p>

<p>How can we detect model failures caused by relying on such brittle or undesirable associations? Answering this question is a major goal of model debugging. Work in this context brought forth techniques that allow, for example, surfacing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05796">human aligned</a> <a href="https://gradientscience.org/glm_saga/">concepts</a>, <a href="https://gradientscience.org/3db/">probing specific types of bias a model uses</a>, or highlighting features that were <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07451">important for a</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">specific prediction</a>.</p>

<p>A common theme in many of these debugging methods is to study model behavior on so-called counterfactual inputs, i.e., inputs with and without specific features. For example, consider the image of a dog being held by its owner below. By removing the owner from the image, we can study how much our model’s prediction depends on the presence of a human. In a similar vein, we can remove parts of the dog (head, body, paws) to identify which ones among them are most critical for correctly classifying the image. This concept of “the absence of a feature” from the input is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/attribution-baselines/">missingness</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Woman-Dog Example" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/woman_dog_example.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
        By removing parts of the image, we can study how much our model depends on a given input feature (such as the human, or the dog's snout).  
</div>

<p>Indeed, this primitive of missingness is used quite a lot in model debugging techniques. For example, widely-used methods such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">integrated gradients</a> leverage it. It also has been applied to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07623">radiology images</a> to understand the regions of the scan that are important for diagnoses, or to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04301">flag spurious correlations</a>. Finally, in natural language processing, model designers often remove words <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12487">to understand their impact on the output</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Example of LIME" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/main_lime.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
LIME, a popular model debugging method, relies on the  missingness primitive to generate model explanations. The method first generates a set of ablations by randomly removing parts of the image. These ablations are then used to generate a model explanation, typically obtained by fitting a sparse linear model to them. 
</div>

<h2 id="challenges-of-implementing-missingness-in-computer-vision">Challenges of implementing missingness in computer vision</h2>

<p>Missingness is a rather intuitive notion: we simply would like the model to predict as if the corresponding part of the input didn’t exist. Also, in a domain such as NLP implementing this primitive is fairly straightforward: we simply drop the corresponding words from the sentence. However, in the context of computer vision, its proper implementation turns out to be much more challenging. This is because images are spatially contiguous objects: it is unclear how to leave a “hole” in the image.</p>

<p>Researchers thus have come up with all kinds of ways to “fill” such hole, i.e., approximating missingness by replacing the region with other pixels. This involves <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01365.pdf">blacking out the pixels</a>, replacing them with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf">random noise</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03296.pdf">blurring the corresponding image region</a>. However, these approaches, even though very natural, turn out to have unintended effects. For example, researchers found that <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/attribution-baselines/">saliency maps generated with integrated gradients are quite sensitive to the chosen baseline color of the filling</a>, and thus can change significantly based on the (arbitrary) choice of that missingness approximation.</p>

<p><img alt="Woman-Dog Example" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/various_approx_original.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
    Practitioners often approximate missingness in computer vision by replacing the removed region with other types of pixels. Examples include blacking out, using the mean pixel color, filling with random noise, or blurring the image.
</div>

<!-- What impact do missingness approximations have—especially with respect to model debugging? In our [recent work][arxiv], we systematically investigate how approximations like blacking out pixels can create bias, where the model uses masked out regions to make predictions rather than ignoring them. Moreover, we find that this _missingness bias_ can hinder our ability to debug models. We then show how transformer-based architectures can enable a more natural implementation of missingness, allowing us to mitigate this bias and thus improve model debugging.  -->

<h2 id="missingness-approximations-can-create-bias">Missingness approximations can create bias</h2>

<p>So, what impact do such missingness approximations actually have on the resulting model predictions? In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">recent work</a>, we systematically investigate the bias that these approximations can imbue. Specifically, <i>we find that models end up using masked out regions to make predictions rather than simply ignoring them.</i></p>

<p>For example, take a look below at the image of a spider from ImageNet, where we have removed various regions from the image by blacking out the corresponding pixels.</p>

<div id="bias_examples_widget" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
    Various regions of an image are removed by blacking out pixels. Regardless of what regions from the image are masked, a ResNet-50 outputs a wrong class. 
</div>

<p>It turns out that irrespective of what subregions of the image are removed, a standard CNN (e.g., ResNet-50) outputs incorrect classes, even when most of the foreground object is not obscured. In fact, taking a closer look at the randomly masked images, we find that the model seems to be relying on the masking pattern itself to make the prediction (e.g., predicting class “crossword”).</p>

<p>To analyze this bias more quantitatively, we measure how missingness approximations impact the output class distribution of a Resnet-50 classifier (over the whole dataset).  Specifically, we iteratively black out parts of ImageNet images, and keep track of how the probability of predicting any one class changes. Before blacking out any pixels, the model predicts a roughly equal number of each class on the ImageNet test set (which is what one would expect given that this test set is class balanced). However, when we apply missingness approximations, this distribution skews heavily toward classes such as maze, crossword puzzle, and carton.</p>

<div id="anno">

</div>
<div class="footnote">
    We measure the shift in output class distribution after applying a (blacking out) missingness approximations. As patches are increasingly blacked out, the ResNet-50 classifier's predictions skew from a uniform distribution toward a few specific classes such as maze, crossword puzzle, and carton.
</div>

<p>Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">paper</a> investigates this missingness bias in more depth by exploring different approximations, datasets, mask sizes, etc.</p>

<h2 id="missingness-bias-in-model-debugging-a-case-study-on-lime">Missingness bias in model debugging: A case study on LIME</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, missingness primitive is often used by model debugging techniques—how does the above-mentioned bias impact them? To answer this question, we focus on a popular feature attribution method: local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME</a>.</p>

<div id="lime_examples_widget" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
    Examples of generated LIME explanations represented as a heat map. High-intensity regions contribute more to the prediction of the model than low-intensity ones. On the right, the top 20 image regions identified by the LIME explanation are masked in black.
</div>

<p>The image above depicts an example LIME explanation generated for a ResNet-50 classifier. Specifically, for a given image, LIME generates a heatmap highlighting the regions of the image based on how much they impact prediction (according to LIME). While sometimes LIME highlights the foreground object (which is what one would expect), in most cases it also highlights rather irrelevant regions scattered all over the image. Why is this the case?</p>

<p>Although we can’t say for sure, we suspect that this behavior is caused in large part by the fact that the underlying ResNet-50 classifier relies on masked regions in the image to make predictions, and this tricks it into believing that these regions are important. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">our paper</a>, we perform a more detailed quantitative analysis of the missingness bias in LIME explanations, and find that it indeed makes them more inconsistent and, during evaluation, indistinguishable from random explanations.</p>

<h2 id="a-more-natural-implementation-of-missingness">A more natural implementation of missingness</h2>
<p>What is the right way to represent missing pixels then? Ideally, since replacing pixels with other pixels can lead to missingness bias, we would like to be able to remove these regions altogether. But what about the need of having the images be represented by contiguous inputs?</p>

<p>Certainly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require such spatial contiguity because convolutions slide filters across the image. But do we even need to use CNNs? Not really!</p>

<p>How about we turn to a different architecture:  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">vision transformers</a> (ViTs)? Unlike CNNs, ViTs do not use convolutions and operate instead on sets of patches that correspond to positionally encoded regions of the image. Specifically, a ViT has two stages when processing an input image:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tokenization</strong>: split the image into square patches, and positionally encode these patches into tokens.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-attention</strong>: pass the set of tokens through several self-attention layers.</li>
</ul>

<p>After tokenization, the self-attention layers operate on the set of tokens rather than the entire image. Thus, ViTs enables a far more natural implementation of missingness: <i>we can simply drop the tokens that encode the region we want to remove!</i></p>

<p><img alt="Woman-Dog Example" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/vit_dropping.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
    ViTs split the image into a set of tokens, where each token represents a patch in the image. In order to implement missingness, we can simply drop the tokens corresponding to the regions we would like to remove.
</div>

<h2 id="mitigating-missingness-bias-through-vits">Mitigating missingness bias through ViTs</h2>

<p>As we now demonstrate,  using this more natural implementation of missingness turns out to substantially mitigate the missingness bias that we saw earlier. Indeed, recall that, with a ResNet-50, blacking out pixels biased the model toward specific classes (such as crossword). But, a similarly sized ViT-small (ViT-S) architecture is able to side-step this bias (when we implement token dropping), maintaining a correct (or at least related) prediction.</p>

<div id="bias_examples_widget2" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
   When we remove image regions by dropping tokens with a ViT-S classifier, the model maintains its original prediction or, at least, predicts a related class.
</div>

<p>This difference is even more striking when we examine the output class distribution corresponding to removal of image regions: while for our ResNet-50 classifier we have seen this distribution being skewed toward certain classes, for the ViT classifier, this distribution remains close to uniform.</p>

<div id="anno"> 
    <canvas height="15%" id="vit_bar_chart" width="30%"/>
</div>
<div class="footnote">

</div>

<h2 id="improving-model-debugging-with-vits">Improving model debugging with ViTs</h2>

<p>So, we have seen that ViTs allow us to mitigate missingness bias. Can we thus use ViTs to improve model debugging too? We return to our case study of LIME. As we demonstrated earlier, LIME relies on a notion of missingness, and is thus vulnerable to missingness bias when using approximations like blacking out pixels. What happens when we use ViTs and token dropping instead?</p>

<div id="lime_examples_widget2" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
Examples of generated LIME explanations for a ResNet (blacking out pixels) and a ViT (dropping tokens). 
</div>

<p>The figure above displays examples of the LIME explanations generated for a ResNet classifier and for a ViT classifier (dropping tokens). Qualitatively, one can see that the explanations for the ViT seem more aligned with human intuition, highlighting the main object instead of regions in the background. We confirm these observations with a more quantitative analysis in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">our paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we studied how missingness approximations can lead to biases and, in turn, impact the model debugging techniques that leverage them. We also demonstrated how transformer-based architectures can enable a seamless implementation of missingness that allows us to side-step missingness bias and lead to more reliable model debugging.</p>

    <title>TR22-052 |  Verifying The Unseen: Interactive Proofs for Label-Invariant Distribution Properties | 

	Tal Herman, 

	Guy Rothblum</title>
    <summary>Given i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution over a large domain $[N]$, approximating several basic quantities, including the distribution's support size, its entropy, and its distance from the uniform distribution, requires $\Theta(N / \log N)$ samples [Valiant and Valiant, STOC 2011].

Suppose, however, that we can interact with a powerful but untrusted prover, who knows the entire distribution (or a good approximation of it). Can we use such a prover to approximate (or rather, to approximately {\em verify}) such statistical quantities more efficiently? We show that this is indeed the case: the support size, the entropy, and the distance from the uniform distribution, can all be approximately verified via a 2-message interactive proof, where the communication complexity, the verifier's running time, and the sample complexity are $\widetilde{O}({\sqrt{N}})$. For all these quantities, the sample complexity is tight up to $\polylog N$ factors (for any interactive proof, regardless of its communication complexity or verification time).

More generally, we give a tolerant interactive proof system with the above sample and communication complexities for verifying a distribution's proximity to any label-invariant property (any property that is invariant to re-labeling of the elements in the distribution's support). The verifier's running time in this more general protocol is also $\widetilde{O}({\sqrt{N}})$, under a mild assumption about the complexity of deciding, given a compact representation of a distribution, whether it is in the property or far from it.</summary>

    <title>TR22-051 |  Low Degree Testing over the Reals | 

	Noah Fleming, 

	Vipul Arora, 

	Arnab Bhattacharyya, 

	Esty Kelman, 

	Yuichi Yoshida</title>
    <summary>We study the problem of testing whether a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $d$ in the distribution-free testing model. Here, the distance between functions is measured with respect to an unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathbb{R}^n$ from which we can draw samples. In contrast to previous work, we do not assume that $\mathcal{D}$ has finite support. 
    
We design a tester that given query access to $f$, and sample access to $\mathcal{D}$, makes $(d/\varepsilon)^{O(1)}$ many queries to $f$, accepts with probability $1$ if $f$ is a polynomial of degree $d$, and rejects with probability at least $2/3$ if every degree-$d$ polynomial $P$ disagrees with $f$ on a set of mass at least $\varepsilon$ with respect to $\mathcal{D}$. Our result also holds under mild assumptions when we receive only a polynomial number of bits of precision for each query to $f$, or when $f$ can only be queried on rational points representable using a logarithmic number of bits. Along the way, we prove a new stability theorem for multivariate polynomials that may be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>1-week long Summer School for Ugrads Interested in Theory, and my comments on it</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Recently a grad student in CS at UMCP emailed me the following email he got,  thinking (correctly) that I should forward it to interested ugrads. </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Are you interested in theoretical computer science including topics like algorithms, cryptography, machine learning, and others? If so, please consider applying to the New Horizons in Theoretical Computer Science week-long online summer school! The school will contain several mini-courses from top researchers in the field. The course is free of charge,and we welcome applications from undergraduates majoring in computer science or related fields. We particularly encourage applications from students that are members of groups that are currently under-represented in theoretical computer science.</p><p>Students from previous years have shared with us that the mini-lectures, online group activities, and interactions with other students and the friendly TAs were extraordinarily engaging and fun.</p><p>For full consideration, please complete the application (it’s short and easy!) by April 25, 2022. The summer school will take place online from June 6 to June 10.</p><p>Please see our website for details: see <a href="https://tcs-summerschool.ttic.edu/">here</a> </p><p>Any questions can be directed to summer-school-admin-2022@ttic.edu.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A few points about this</p><p>1) I emailed them asking `why do people need to apply if its online and free?'</p><p>I had one answer in mind, but they gave me another one</p><p><i>Their Answer: </i>They want to have SMALL online activities in groups. If they had X students and want groups of size g then if X is large, X/g may be too large. </p><p><i>My Answer</i>: If people REGISTER for something they are more likely to actually show up. (I know of a conference that got MORE people going once they had registation, and even MORE when they began charging for it.) </p><p>2) I emailed them asking if the talks will, at some later point, be on line. They will be. I then realized that there are already LOTS of theory talks online that I have not gotten around to watching, and perhaps never will. Even so, the talks on line may well benefit people who goto the summer school if they want to look back and something. </p><p>3) Online conferences PROS and CONS:</p><p>PROS: Free (or very low cost), no hassle getting airfare and hotel, and if talks are recorded then you can see them later (that applies to in-person as well). </p><p>CONS: Less committed to going to it. Can go in a half-ass way. For example, you can go and then in the middle of a talk go do your laundry. Being FORCED to be in a ROOM with the SPEAKER may be good. Also, of course, no informal conversations in the hallways.  Also, less serendipity. </p><p>I want to say <i>It would to be good to see talks outside of my area </i>however, this may only be true for easy talks, perhaps talks in a new field, OR talks that are just barely outside my area so I have some context. </p><p>4) I was surprised I didn't get the email directly since I have more contact with ugrads (and I have this blog) then the grad student who alerted me to it. However, I have learned that information gets to people in random ways so perhaps not to surprising. </p></div>

    <summary>Given a Boolean circuit $C$, we wish to convert it to a circuit $C'$ that computes the same function as $C$ even if some of its gates suffer from adversarial short circuit errors, i.e., their output is replaced by the value of one of their inputs [KLM97]. Can we design such a resilient circuit $C'$ whose size is roughly comparable to that of $C$? Prior work [KLR12, BEGY19] gave a positive answer for the special case where $C$ is a formula.

We study the general case and show that any Boolean circuit $C$ of size $s$ can be converted to a new circuit $C'$ of quasi-polynomial size $s^{O(\log s)}$ that computes the same function as $C$ even if a $1/51$ fraction of the gates on any root-to-leaf path in $C'$ are short circuited. Moreover, if the original circuit $C$ is a formula, the resilient circuit $C'$ is of near-linear size $s^{1+\epsilon}$. The construction of our resilient circuits utilizes the connection between circuits and DAG-like communication protocols} [Raz95, Pud10, Sok17], originally introduced in the context of proof complexity.</summary>

    <summary>As Robert Fathauer points out (\(\mathbb{M}\)), the US “Star Ribbon” postage stamp depicts a star-shaped Möbius strip. If you slice the depicted ribbon lengthwise into two linked rings, its central white portion and outer red and blue portions, the inner part is again a Möbius strip while the outer part becomes doubly twisted and twice as long, with red on one side and blue on the other.</summary>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Optimal transport (OT) has recently gained lot of interest in machine learning. It is a natural tool to compare in a geometrically faithful way probability distributions. It finds applications in both supervised learning (using geometric loss functions) and unsupervised learning (to perform generative model fitting). OT is however plagued by the curse of dimensionality, since it might require a number of samples which grows exponentially with the dimension. In this talk, I will explain how to leverage entropic regularization methods to define computationally efficient loss functions, approximating OT with a better sample complexity. More information and references can be found on <a href="https://optimaltransport.github.io/">the website of our book</a> “Computational Optimal Transport.”</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We give the first almost-linear time algorithm for computing exact maximum flows and minimum-cost flows on directed graphs. By well-known reductions, this implies almost-linear time algorithms for several problems including bipartite matching, optimal transport, and undirected vertex connectivity.</p>
<p>Our algorithm uses a new Interior Point Method (IPM) that builds the optimal flow as a sequence of an almost-linear number of approximate undirected minimum-ratio cycles, each of which is computed and processed very efficiently using a new dynamic data structure.</p>
<p>Our framework extends to give an almost-linear time algorithm for computing flows that minimize general edge-separable convex functions to high accuracy. This gives the first almost-linear time algorithm for several problems including entropy-regularized optimal transport, matrix scaling, p-norm flows, and Isotonic regression.</p>

    <title>The Roeder Seq Problems was Solved Before I Posed it (Math)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>  (Joint Post by Bill Gasarch, David Harris, and Tomas
Harris) </p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The divisor graph D(n) is an undirected graph with</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">vertex set V={1,...,n}$ and</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">edge set E={(a,b) :  a  divides  b 
or  b  divides  a }</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We denote the length of the longest simple path in D(n) by
L(n).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">EXAMPLE: if n=10 then one long-ish sequence is</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1,8,4,2,6,3,9</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">so L(10) GE 7. I leave it to the reader to do better OR to
show its optimal. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 2017 Oliver Roeder asked for L(100) (see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pick-a-number-any-number/">here</a>)
In a later post Roeder reported that Anders Kaseorg claimed L(100)=77
(see  <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-this-bathroom-occupied/">here</a>).
Anders gave a sequence and claimed that, by a computer search, this was
optimal. The column also claims that other people also claimed 77 and nobody
got a sequence of length 78, so the answer probably is 77 (it is now known that
it IS 77).  Roeder also mentions the case of n=1000 for which Kaseorg
showed L(1000) GE 418. No nontrivial lower bounds are known. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 2019 I (Gasarch) asked about asymptotic results for
L(n)  (see my blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/09/a-problem-i-thought-was-interesting-now.html">here</a> and
my open problems column <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/open/nate.pdf">here</a>.)
I began working on it with David and Tomas Harris. David proved that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Omega( n/( (log n)^{1.68} )  LE  L(n) 
LE  O( n/( (log n)^{0.79} ).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We also studied human-readable proofs that L(100) LE X for
some reasonable X, though getting a human-readable proof for X=77 seemed
impossible. We did get L(100) LE 83, in a human-readable proof. (Some
commenters on my post to sketched a proof  that L(100) LE 83 and another
that L(100) LE 80 as well.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> But it turned out that this problem had already been
studied, predating Roeder's column. (This blog post is all about the math, bout
the math, no treble.  My next post will be about how we didn't know the
literature until our paper was close to being finished.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1982 Pomerance showed L(n)  LE o(n) (see <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/divisorgraph.pdf">here</a>).
Pollington had earlier shown </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
                     
    L(n) GE ne^{polylog(n)};</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">however, the paper is not online and hence is lost to
history forever. (If you can find an online copy please email me the pointer
and I will edit this post.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1995 Gerald Tenenbaum showed, in a paper written in
French,  that there exists a,b such that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
               n/(log n)^a LE L(n) LE
n/(log n)^b (see <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/ASENS_1995_4_28_2_115_0/">here</a>). </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">More recently, in 2021, Saias showed, in a paper written in
French, that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
                     
L(n) GE (0.3 - o(1)) n/log n (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03855">here</a>). </p><p class="MsoNormal">(ADDED LATER:  I got a very angry email telling me that the paper was in English and that I am a moron. It turns out that the abstract is in English but the paper is in French, hence the person who send the letter only read the abstract which explains their mistake.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He conjectures that L(n)  SIM cn/log n where c is
likely in the interval [3,7]. (Apparently, no other information is known about
the relevant constant factors in the estimates.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Interestingly, the work of Tenenbaum and Saias also
demonstrates why the study of L(n)  is not an idle problem in recreational
mathematics. The upper bounds come from results on certain density conditions
for prime factorization of random integers. That is, given an integer x chosen
uniformly at random from the range {1,..., n} with prime factorization p1 GE p2
GE ... one wants to show that, with high probability, the primes pi are close
to each other in a certain sense. Most recent results on L(n) have been tied
closely with improved asymptotic estimates for deep number theory problems.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Determining the value of L(100) (i.e., Roeder's problem) was
mentioned in Saias's paper. He claims that L(100) = 77 was discovered by Arnaud
Chadozeau, who himself has written a number of papers on other properties of
D(n). Since this paper was in 2021 it was after Roeder's column; however, we
believe that the different discoveries of L(100) are independent. The recent
work around Roeder's column appears to be done independently from the extensive
French-language literature on the topic.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The following problems are  likely still open:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">a) Find L(n) exactly for as many n as you can.  This
would clearly need a computer program.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A listing of L(n) for n = 1 ... 200, computed by Rob Pratt
and Nathan McNew,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">appears as OEIS #A337125. This also includes additional
references.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">b) Find human-readable proofs for upper bounds on L(n)
(likely not exact) for as many</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">n as you can.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">  </p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">ADDED LATER: Gaétan Berthe emailed me </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm the author of the last comment on your article about
Roeder Sequence , as your curious about the subject I can share what we've done
with my friend Paul Revenant those last few years for fun.</p><p class="MsoNormal">
<br/>
It all started with a competition between our classmates (see <a href="https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gaetan.berthe/challenge.php">here</a> though note that its in French) for the 100 and 1000 cases, after a few months Paul using a MIP solver gurobi
was able to found a solution of size 666, and last year by studying the
structure of the 666 solution we were able, with the help of gurobi again, to
prove that there was no 667 solution either.<br/>
<br/>
Paul then achieve to find very probable value of the sequence for 1 to 1000 (we
didn't automatize the proof of 666 but it should be doable). On my side I tried
to look for good solutions for the 10000 case, again using gurobi and the structure
that appeared in the solution of size 666. The structure enable to cut the
problem in two subpart, so the search goes faster I was able to find a solution
of size 5505.<br/>
<br/>
So I would say that the two mains reasons we're able to prove optimality for high
numbers as 1000 are:<br/>
<br/>
- MIP solver such as gurobi are very powerful tools.<br/>
<br/>
- The longest path in the divisor graph are highly structured.<br/>
<br/>
I joined our informal proof of the 666 case (the solution at the end), what is
interesting is to understand how the solution is composed of different blocks
depending of the prime decomposition of the elements. I joined lower bound from
1 to 1000 computed by Paul, that are very likely to be optimal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He also emailed me</p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">1)  a list of the numbers I call L(n) for n=1 to 1000.
These have not been refereed though I think they are correct. The list is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/1-1000.txt">here</a></p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">AND</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">2)  a PROOF that L(1000)\le 666 (and they HAVE a
sequence of length 666, so L(1000)=666).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Again, not refereed, but you can read the proof
yourself <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/proof1000.pdf">here</a> WARNING- the proof is in ENGLISH, so you cannot use it to improve your
mathematical French. </p></div>

Rich was the key guest for Harry Lewis’s class <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/richde/status/1398627350984728580">last June</a>. This time it is my turn to be part of the discussion of our paper <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">Social Process and Proofs of Theorems and Programs</a> that starts:  </p>
<p><em>Many people have argued that computer programming should strive to become more like mathematics. Maybe so, but not in the way they seem to think.</em></p>
<p>Sadly the paper’s third author, Alan Perlis, is unable to ever take part.</p>

</p><p><b> The Class </b></p>
<p/><p>
Lewis’s class is based on his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ideas-That-Created-Future-Computer/dp/0262045303/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=lewis+ideas+that+created+the+future&amp;qid=1595538528&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">book</a>.</p>

<p>
<em>The book highlights results that played a key part in the history of CS.  Ideas That Created the Future collects forty-six classic papers in computer science that map the evolution of the field. It covers all aspects of computer science: theory and practice, architectures and algorithms, and logic and software systems, with an emphasis on the period of 1936-1980 but also including important early work. Offering papers by thinkers ranging from Aristotle and Leibniz to Alan Turing and Nobert Wiener, the book documents the discoveries and inventions that created today’s digital world. Each paper is accompanied by a brief essay by Harry Lewis, the volume’s editor, offering historical and intellectual context. </em></p>
<p>
Some have asked: How could Rich and Alan and myself be included with such notables? Many hate our paper, but perhaps that is just life. This Tuesday it will be discussed again. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Our Paper </b></p>
<p/><p>
Rich and I were in the late 1970’s quite interested in program correctness. We had three approaches:</p>
<li>Random Testing: We were the first to show that certain programs could be mathematically tested via random tests. The insight was that if the correctness was based on a polynomial restriction, then randomness could be proved to work with very small probability of failure. This was <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220112604_A_Probabilistic_Remark_on_Algebraic_Program_Testing">A probabilistic remark on algebraic program testing.</a>
</li><li>Program Testing: The method here is based on what is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">mutation method</a>. It is powerful, but cannot be raised to mathematical certainty.
</li><li>Proving Programs is Hard: This was our negative result that is the key to the debate.
<p>
</p><p><b> The Debate—Starts </b></p>
<p/><p>
The key to the argument is two part: </p>
<ol>
<li> The correctness of real systems is not clean. It is very complex, very case based. Terribly complex.
</li><li> The proof method of math is not geared to huge complex statements of correctness.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><b> The Debate—Continues </b></p>
<p/><p>
Today papers on proof methods split into two classes: </p>
<ol>
<li> Those that refer to us. Usually negatively, but do at least they refer to us.
</li><li> Those that ignore us completely.
</li></ol>
<p>
Here are three examples from countless many papers: They should reference us but do not: </p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1999-00/automatic-theorem-proving/philosophy.htm">Philosophical Interests in Program Verification</a>
</li><li> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_18">Deductive Software Verification: From Pen-and-Paper Proofs to Industrial Tools</a>
</li><li> <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.3577&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Correctness: A Very Important Quality Factor In Programming</a>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Should there be some middle ground? Do we deserve to be in Harry’s book?</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Thirty years ago, I was in the middle of the second semester of my third year of undergrad, and one of the courses that I was enrolled in was on information theory. I was majoring in computer science, a major that had just been established at Sapienza University when I signed up for it in 1989, <s>organized by a computer science department that had also just been established in 1989</s>. A computer science department was established in 1991.</p>



<p>The new Sapienza computer science department was founded mostly by faculty from the Sapienza mathematics department, plus a number of people that came from other places to help start it. Among the latter, Renato Capocelli had moved to Rome from the University of Salerno, where he had been department chair of computer science.</p>



<p>Capocelli worked on combinatorics and information theory. In the early 90s, he had also become interested in the then-new area of zero-knowledge proofs.</p>



<p>Capocelli taught the information-theory course that I was attending, and it was a very different experience from the classes I had attended up to that point. To get the new major started, several professors were teaching classes outside their area, sticking close to their notes. Those teaching mathematical classes, were experts but were not deviating from the definition-theorem-proof script. Capocelli had an infectious passion for his subject, took his time to make us gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts of information theory, was full of examples and anecdotes, and  always emphasized the high-level idea of the proofs.</p>



<p>I subsequently met several other charismatic and inspiring computer scientists and mathematicians, though Capocelli had a very different personality from most of them. He was like an earlier generation of Southern Italian intellectuals, who could be passionate about their subject in a peculiarly non-nerdy way, loving it the way one may love food, people, nature, or a full life in general.</p>



<p>On April 8, 1992, Renato Capocelli <a href="https://www.di.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/dipartimento/capocelli.pdf">died suddenly and unexpectedly</a>, though his memory lives on in the many people he inspired. The Computer Science department of the University of Salerno was named after him for a period of time.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-049 |  Non-Adaptive Universal One-Way Hash Functions from Arbitrary One-Way Functions | 

	Noam Mazor, 

	Jiapeng Zhang, 

	Xinyu Mao</title>
    <summary>Two of the most useful cryptographic primitives that can be constructed from one-way functions are pseudorandom generators (PRGs) and universal one-way hash functions (UOWHFs). The three major efficiency measures of these primitives are: seed length, number of calls to the one-way function, and adaptivity of these calls. Although a long and successful line of research studied these primitives, their optimal efficiency is not yet fully understood: there are gaps between the known upper bound and the known lower bound for black-box constructions.

Interstingly, the first construction of PRGs by H ?astad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [SICOMP ’99], and the UOWHFs construction by Rompel [STOC ’90] shared a similar structure. Since then, there was an improvement in the efficiency of both constructions: The state of the art construction of PRGs by Haitner, Reingold, and Vadhan [STOC ’10] uses $O(n^4)$ bits of random seed and $O(n^3)$ non-adaptive calls to the one-way function, or alternatively, seed of size $O(n^3)$ with $O(n^3)$ adaptive calls (Vadhan and Zheng [STOC ’12]). Constructing a UOWHF with similar parameters is still an open question. Currently, the best UOWHF construction by Haitner, Holenstein, Reingold, Vadhan, and Wee [Eurocrypt ’10] uses $O(n^{13})$ adaptive calls with a key of size $O(n^5)$.

In this work we give the first non-adaptive construction of UOWHFs from arbitrary one-way functions. Our construction uses $O(n^9)$ calls to the one-way function, and key of length $O(n^{10})$. By the result of Applebaum, Ishai, and Kushilevitz [FOCS ’04], the above implies the existence of UOWHFs in NC0, given the existence of one-way functions in NC1. We also show that the PRG construction of Haitner et al., with small modifications, yields a relaxed notion of UOWHFs. In order to analyze this construction, we introduce the notion of next-bit unreachable entropy, which replaces the next-bit pseudoentropy notion, used in the PRG construction above.</summary>

<p><strong>Private High-Dimensional Hypothesis Testing</strong> by  Shyam Narayanan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01537">arXiv</a>) This paper continues the novel study of distribution testing under the constraints brought forth by differential privacy extending the work of Canonne-Kamath-McMillan-Ullman-Zakynthinou (henceforth CKMUZ, covered in our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2019/06/news-for-may-2019/">May 2019 post</a>). In particular, the paper presents algorithms with optimal sample complexity for private identity testing of \(d\)-dimensional Gaussians. In more detail, the paper shows that can be done with a mere \(\widetilde{O}\left(  \frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} + \frac{  d^{1/3} }{ \alpha^{4/3} \cdot \varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{1}{\alpha \cdot \varepsilon} \right)\). Here \(\alpha\) is the proximity parameter and \(\varepsilon\) is the privacy parameter. Combined with a previous result of Acharya-Sun-Zhang, the paper proves that private identity testing of \(d\)-dimensional Gaussians is doable with a sample complexity smaller than that of private identity testing of discrete distributions over a domain of size \(d\) thereby refuting a conjecture of CKMUZ.</p>

<p><strong>Differentially Private All-Pairs Shortest Path Distances: Improved Algorithms and Lower Bounds</strong> by Badih Ghazi, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi and Jelani Nelson (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16476">arXiv</a>) Adam Sealfon considered the classic All Pairs Shortest Path Problem (the APSP problem) with privacy considerations in 2016. In the \((\varepsilon, \delta)\)-DP framework, Sealfon presented an algorithm which on input an edge-weighted graph \(G=(V,E,w)\) adds Laplace noise to all edge weights and computes the shortest paths on this noisy graph. The output of the algorithm satisfies that the estimated distance between every pair is within an additive \(\pm O(n \log n/\varepsilon)\) of the actual distance (the absolute value of this parameter is called the <em>accuracy of the algorithm</em>). Moreover, this error is tight up to a logarithmic factor if the algorithm is required to <em>release</em> the shortest paths. The current paper shows you can privately release all the pairwise distances while suffering only a sublinear accuracy if you additionally release the edge weights (in place of releasing the shortest paths). In particular, this paper presents an \(\varepsilon\)-DP algorithm with sublinear \(\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})\) accuracy.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Quantum algorithms for estimating quantum entropies</strong> by Youle Wang, Benchi Zhao, Xin Wang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02386">arXiv</a>) So, remember <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/12/news-for-november-2021/">our post from December</a> on sublinear quantum algorithms for estimation of quantum (von Neumann) entropy?  The current paper begins by noting that the research so far (along the lines of the work above) assumes access to a quantum query model for the input state which we do not yet know how to construct efficiently. This paper addresses this issue and gives quantum algorithms to estimate the von Neumann entropy of a  \(n\)-qubit quantum state \(\rho\) by using independent copies of the input state.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Sublinear Algorithms and Lower Bounds for Estimating MST and TSP Cost in General Metrics</strong> by Yu Chen, Sanjeev Khanna, Zihan Tan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14798">arXiv</a>) As mentioned in the title, this paper studies sublinear algorithms for the metric MST and the metric TSP problem. The paper obtains a wide assortment of results and shows that both these problems admit an \(\alpha\)-approximation algorithm which uses \(O(n/\alpha)\) space. This algorithm assumes that the input is given as a stream of \(n \choose 2\) metric entries. Under this model, the paper also presents an \(\Omega(n/\alpha^2)\) space lower bound. Let me highlight one more result from the paper. In a <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2020/07/news-for-june-2020/">previous news</a> (from June 2020), we covered a result detailing a better than \(2\)-approximation for the <em>graphic</em> TSP and \((1,2)\) TSP which runs in sublinear time. This paper extends this result and obtains better than \(2\)-approximation for TSP on a relaively richer class of metrics.</p></div>

</p><p><b> A Current Blog </b></p>
<p/><p>
A blog is <b>current</b> provided its last post refers to stuff that happen in late 2021 or 2022. Lewis has a current blog and this one is also current. I like a current one—some blogs are very incurrent indeed. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> List of Current Blogs </b></p>
<p/><p>
The first group below are ones we have listed before and the second group are those that were found elsewhere. All below are current.

    <title>Masks</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Illinois Tech removed the last of their mandatory masking restrictions yesterday. Chicago had zero Covid deaths. Yet I still get messages like this in my twitter feed.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I don't care who you are. If I see you without a mask indoors when infections are rampant and there are many still at risk, I will see you as ignorant of science, narcissistic, and uncaring of the vulnerable around you. I will truly see you unmasked for what you are.</p>— Bill Comeau 🇨🇦🇺🇦 (@Billius27) <a href="https://twitter.com/Billius27/status/1510714029072912390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p/><p>The science is unequivocal for vaccines, which do a good job preventing infection and a strong job saving lives. I just got my second booster on Sunday.</p><p>Masks give you some protection but nothing like the vaccines. It's impossible to completely remove the risk of Covid so people need to make their own choices and tradeoffs. If you are vaccinated your chance of serious illness is tiny, whether or not your wear a mask. And mask wearing is not cost-free.</p><p>I just don't like wearing masks. Wearing a mask bends my ears and is mildly painful. People can't always understand me when I talk through a mask, and they can't read my facial expressions. People and computers don't recognize me in a mask. Masks fog up my glasses. I can't exercise with a mask, it gets wet with sweat and hard to breath. You can't eat or drink wearing a mask.</p><p>Now everyone has their own tolerance and I respect that. I'll wear a mask if someone asks nicely or if it is required, like on public transit and many theaters. If I have a meeting with someone wearing a mask, I'll ask if they would like me to put mine on. In most cases they remove theirs.</p><p>On the other hand, the Chicago Symphony concert I planned to attend tonight was cancelled because the conductor, Riccardo Muti, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/4/4/23010828/riccardo-muti-tests-positive-for-covid-chicago-symphony-orchestra-concert-canceled">tested positive for Covid</a> (with minor symptoms). For my own selfish reasons, I wish he had worn a mask.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d637be8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+1/resize/840x560!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fe9_J_DxUKtnWan4c8MigVZf8vBM%3D%2F0x0%3A4000x2668%2F4000x2668%2Ffilters%3Afocal%282000x1334%3A2001x1335%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F19129683%2FCSO190509_160f_Riccardo_Muti_and_Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra_May_2019.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d637be8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+1/resize/840x560!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fe9_J_DxUKtnWan4c8MigVZf8vBM%3D%2F0x0%3A4000x2668%2F4000x2668%2Ffilters%3Afocal%282000x1334%3A2001x1335%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F19129683%2FCSO190509_160f_Riccardo_Muti_and_Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra_May_2019.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><br/><p><br/></p></div>

<p>“<em>No ads, no subscriptions; but open-source and passion.</em>“</p>



<p>“<em>Are some features reserved to Patrons? No, because Lichess is entirely free, forever, and for everyone. That’s a promise.</em>“</p>



<p>It doesn’t get better than that, in this world; and that’s why I love computers and the community surrounding them.</p>



<p>Another good news is that I got tired of 5 | 5!  The games are just too slow, and my chess isn’t even worth this much of my time.  I am now playing 3 | 2.  It’s fun the adrenaline kick I get with every match.  Also I got much stricter with my routine, and I don’t lose more than once a day.</p>



<p>Here’s my <a href="https://lichess.org/@/EAmaiLeNuvole">profile</a>.  It’s an anagram of my unpronounceable name which can be loosely translated as <em>…and I loved the clouds.</em></p>



<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Excessive activity and blunders merely reflect my generous sharing of credentials.</p>



<p>And then I thought, why don’t we automatically analyze existing games to find interesting situations, and present them to the user as a puzzle?  Naturally, the beauty — and dismay — of living in the AI (after-internet) era is that… <a href="https://chesstempo.com/chess-tactics/">it’s already done</a>.</p>



<p>OK, time for my daily fix.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-048 |  On the Range Avoidance Problem for Circuits | 

	Hanlin Ren, 

	Rahul Santhanam, 

	Zhikun Wang</title>
    <summary>We consider the range avoidance problem (called Avoid): given the description of a circuit $C:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^\ell$ (where $\ell &gt; n$), find a string $y\in\{0, 1\}^\ell$ that is not in the range of $C$. This problem is complete for the class APEPP that corresponds to explicit constructions of objects whose existence follows from the probabilistic method (Korten, FOCS 2021). 
    
Motivated by applications in explicit constructions and complexity theory, we initiate the study of the range avoidance problem for weak circuit classes, and obtain the following results:
    
    
1. Generalising Williams's connections between circuit-analysis algorithms and circuit lower bounds (J. ACM 2014), we present a framework for solving C-Avoid in $FP^{NP}$ using circuit-analysis data structures for C, for "typical" multi-output circuit classes C. As an application, we present a non-trivial $FP^{NP}$ range avoidance algorithm for De Morgan formulas.
An important technical ingredient is a construction of rectangular PCPs of proximity, building on the rectangular PCPs by Bhangale, Harsha, Paradise, and Tal (FOCS 2020).
        
2. Using the above framework, we show that circuit lower bounds for $E^{NP}$ are equivalent to circuit-analysis algorithms with $E^{NP}$ preprocessing. This is the first equivalence result regarding circuit lower bounds for $E^{NP}$. Our equivalences have the additional advantages that they work in both infinitely-often and almost-everywhere settings, and that they also hold for larger (e.g., subexponential) size bounds.

3. Complementing the above results, we show that in some settings, solving C-Avoid would imply breakthrough lower bounds, even for very weak circuit classes C. In particular, an algorithm for $AC^0$-Avoid with polynomial stretch (i.e., $\ell = poly(n)$) implies lower bounds against $NC^1$, and an algorithm for $NC^0_4$-Avoid with very small stretch (i.e., $\ell = n + n^{o(1)}$) implies lower bounds against $NC^1$ and branching programs.

4. We show that Avoid is in FNP if and only if there is a propositional proof system that breaks every non-uniform proof complexity generator. This result connects the study of range avoidance with fundamental questions in proof complexity.</summary>

    <title>TR22-047 |  Linear Hashing with $\ell_\infty$ guarantees and two-sided Kakeya bounds | 

	Manik Dhar, 

	Zeev Dvir</title>
    <summary>We show that a randomly chosen linear map over a finite field gives a good hash function in the $\ell_\infty$ sense.  More concretely, consider a set $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^n$ and a randomly chosen linear map $L :  \mathbb{F}_q^n \to  \mathbb{F}_q^t$ with $q^t$ taken to be sufficiently smaller than $|S|$. Let $U_S$ denote a random variable distributed uniformly on $S$. Our main theorem shows that, with high probability over the choice of $L$, the random variable  $L(U_S)$ is close to uniform in the $\ell_\infty$ norm.  In other words, every element in the range $\mathbb{F}_q^t$ has about the same number of elements in $S$ mapped to it. This complements the widely-used Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) which proves the analog statement under the statistical, or $\ell_1$, distance  (for a richer class of functions) as well as prior work on the expected largest 'bucket size' in linear hash functions  [ADMPT99].  Our proof leverages a connection between linear hashing and the finite field Kakeya problem and extends some of the tools developed in this area, in particular the polynomial method.</summary>
